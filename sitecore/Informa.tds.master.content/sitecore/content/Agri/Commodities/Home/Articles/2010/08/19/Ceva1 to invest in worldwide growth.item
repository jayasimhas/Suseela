Last year the French animal health group 
Ceva Sante Animale told Animal Pharm how it was getting through the general economic downturn (Animal Pharm No 666, p10-11). This year, Animal Pharm’s France correspondent Nathalie Caplet interviewed Ceva’s president and CEO 
Marc Prikazsky to learn about the group’s post-crisis agenda

<p xmlns="">To get through the financial storm, the Ceva group rallied all staff around some key projects to streamline its expenditure in 2009.</p><p xmlns="">Freezing acquisitions and recruitment (except for a few key positions), while still investing strongly in its R&amp;D and production sites, was a strategy that paid off. The group has announced good sales results, inward investment from a new financial fund and a recent acquisition in Australia.</p><p xmlns="">Ceva’s 2009 growth remained positive: it reported €395m in sales, a 4.7% growth on 2008 revenues, and a 7.8% increase at constant perimeter and exchange rate. Growth really picked up in 2010 with first semester sales improving by 15% compared to 2009, due to good results in all areas of the business.</p><p xmlns="">In 2009 all efforts were devoted to tightening budgets without having to make too many sacrifices, says Mr Prikazsky. By 2010, Ceva was ready to put some energy back into its external operations. Bringing in more capital for future acquisitions was a first step. “Together with Virbac and Vétoquinol, we are one of the only independent animal health companies that is not linked with a human health company. I believe our type of company has to either concentrate even more on its product catalogue, or increase in size. As we are already working in many market segments, we have to increase in size,” Mr Prikazsky explains.</p><h3 xmlns="">More funds for acquisitions</h3><p xmlns="">Following a six-month discussion, the Sagard investment fund has just injected €100m into Ceva’s capital base. This fund brings together a small number of influential European and North American industrial families, including the Canadian Desmarais family, Bouygues and Peugeot, together with and renowned financial institutions.</p><p xmlns="">Sagard was interesting to Ceva not only because of the money it could bring in, but also because its decision centre is in Paris, and so is close geographically and culturally to Ceva. Sagard, through its specialized staff, can be an advisor as well as an investor.</p><p xmlns="">Ceva remains mainly owned by its staff and management team. It also has two investment fund shareholders, Natixis Private Equity (now in the AXA group) and the French Euromezzanine, alongside commercial banks including Natixis, Barclays and Crédit Agricole. When Sagard came in with €100m, the rest of the shareholders (including the management) added a further €75m. “With debt, we can go up to €300m of preauthorized money, but we can go much further if need be,” states Mr Prikazsky. We would need to ask our shareholders but it’s possible.”</p><h3 xmlns="">Stronger position in Australia</h3><p xmlns="">At the beginning of July, the French group announced the acquisition of Nature Vet, an Australian veterinary company specializing equine products (80% of its sales) together with other companion animal products. The company, based in Glenorie, a northwestern suburb of Sydney, employs 60 people.</p><p xmlns="">The driving force behind this acquisition is location. Ceva already had a small Australian presence through its 2008 purchase of Delvet, with some €4m of annual sales. With this new acquisition, Ceva has totals revenues of €17m in Australia.</p><p xmlns="">Nature Vet, which has an R&amp;D department and a GMP-certified production site, has a real know-how and portfolio in the equine sector, explains Mr Prikazsky. Ceva’s Tildren (tiludronic acid) treatment for lameness in horses is already registered in Australia. “We now have the structure to sell it on the Australian market,” he says, adding: “We also have products for production animals and some are already registered there, so we are ready to go! In addition we will be able to export our newly acquired equine expertise to the major equine markets worldwide.”</p><p xmlns="">Australia is the tenth largest worldwide market for animal health products. “We’ve been really under represented there. It is also the case in New Zealand, where we’ll keep working with a distributor for now,” he says. Ideally Ceva prefers to make acquisitions than work with distributors where one has very little control. Nature Vet is not complementary for its location and portfolio, but it also corresponds well to the type of company Ceva likes to acquire: family companies with entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p xmlns="">Ceva believes it can take advantage of the company’s location, expertise, products and market, while the company gets a chance to launch its products internationally thanks to Ceva’s worldwide presence. If possible, Ceva likes to retain the head of the acquired company as he will know the local specifications. This is the case for Nature Vet although a manager was sent to handle the integration of Delvet and Nature Vet.</p><p xmlns="">Nonetheless, Mr Prikazsky points out: “Being the head of a small company (with cash flow tension) is very different from being the head of a large group subsidiary. We want managers that are hands-on and know the fieldwork, since we must never forget the clients.”</p><p xmlns="">Reviewing Ceva’s worldwide presence, Mr Prikazsky notes: “We are under-represented in China and Japan, although we do have some products that are registered and distributed there.” A Chinese joint venture has been in the pipeline for 18 months. “We are not much in South Korea which is quite an important market. We are very strong in Africa and the Middle East and now well represented in Brazil (possibly the eighth biggest animal health company there), a country with an important farm animal market.</p><p xmlns="">"However, we are not in other South American countries such as Argentina, and insufficiently in Mexico and in the US. So there are still a lot of zones where we can make acquisitions: in the US of course, and even in Europe if there are interesting opportunities.”</p><p xmlns="">Geographical coverage is important to Ceva. New territories can be obtained through acquisitions, but it also important not to lose regions because of various difficulties. “At the end of 2008, we hesitated to stay in the Ukraine,” recalls Mr Prikazsky.</p><p xmlns="">"There were 40 people working for Ceva there, with a subsidiary’s budget that was just balanced, and a currency which lost 40% in a few weeks. But we asked ourselves in which country we should stay. Ukraine has the most fertile lands on Earth. We thought livestock will develop there. In the end, we recapitalized our subsidiary. We had to increase our prices and concentrate on strategic products, but we made the right choice. We broke even in 2009 and this year we should have a profitable and growing subsidiary.”</p><p xmlns="">“We are in countries where our competitors are not, countries where there are risks,” he continues. “At the height of the Algerian crisis, when people were being killed, we stayed, with some of our group staff going there regularly. We know how to do that and when times get brighter we are leaders on these markets. It’s the case in Algeria. There is a sort of recognition by people locally, in the subsidiary and the general public. So you take important market shares.”</p><h3 xmlns="">Innovation on all fronts</h3><p xmlns="">Building on its long-term plan, Ceva was forced by the recent crisis to concentrate even more on strategic products, to improve efficiency and to be even more innovative. Innovation does not only mean technology, insists Mr Prikazsky. “We innovate on a lot of aspects – in the way we manage people, in our financial model, in our ability to acquire companies and talk from entrepreneur to entrepreneur.</p><p xmlns="">“We innovate through our products, but we need to do more. We have the best offer in recombinant poultry vaccines, but I believe that we can go much further, much faster. The risk with some of the huge groups is for them not to be able to innovate internally anymore. We try and have short circuits between R&amp;D and commercialization. The risk is to forget some steps, like to file for a patent, which has to be done before any communication or publication is done on the technology.</p><p xmlns="">“A market authorization protects a new product for 10 years (after registration in the first country), while a patent protects it for 20 years. We became more conscious of this issue about 4 to 5 years ago.” Ceva presently holds 80 patents. “We apply for 4 to 5 a year, but I think that it is very insufficient. There are a lot of good ideas, in formulations, in processes, not just on molecules. We need to develop our patent culture.”</p><p xmlns="">Out of 2,300 members of staff worldwide, Ceva employs over 200 researchers, 80 of which are at its Libourne headquarters near Bordeaux in France. It also works with universities in France, the US and Hungary, as well as in Japan on recombinant vaccine projects.</p><h3 xmlns="">Investing in production</h3><p xmlns="">Like R&amp;D which will reach almost 9% of turnover this year, one area where the company has not cut budgets despite the economic downturn, is its production sites. The group has a total of 15 production units around the world. The five major facilities are in France (a tablet plant in Brittany and an injectables unit in Libourne), Hungary (Phylaxia), Brazil and in the Kansas Animal Health Corridor in the US.</p><p xmlns="">The latter is presently being rebuilt in order to increase output tenfold (Animal Pharm 678). Overall investment on industrial sites totaled €17m in 2009, and is expected to reach €25m this year and €35m in 2011. “When your sales increase by 15%, you have to make sure your production can produce accordingly,” comments Mr Prikazsky.</p><p xmlns="">Few companies have a defined business plan over even the next five years, he says, but in 2007, Ceva made a seven year plan (Animal Pharm No 622, p12), which was later extended to 2015 (not counting acquisitions). At the end of this period, Ceva plans to change its financial shareholders, with its management retaining the majority of the capital. This will allow the company’s 700 managers to have a direct stake in the business. “In modern capitalism, people should work to receive their salary, but also to get some of the company’s value. I find that normal,” the CEO states.</p><p xmlns="">Passionate about his company, Mr Prikazsky presents a picture of an active and atypical group: focused, yet open to both internal and external influences for new ideas. “More than the big groups, we are prepared to share the profit, because we need other partners,” he concludes.</p><p xmlns="">Others such as the family companies Ceva teams with, the funds that accompany the business and the research groups it works with, as well as the professionals attracted to the company. The charm of this medium-size group must be working, as managers from larger groups are keen to take part in its growth. This is an aspect that especially delights Mr Prikazsky, who is convinced that recruiting good managers is as important as acquiring good companies.</p><img src="https://www.agra-net.com/agra/incoming/article521245.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/cattle" in="" nz_105578093.jpg="" alt="width" =="" height="">https://www.agra-net.com/agra/incoming/article521245.ece/BINARY/DSC05204.JPG
