<p>Generic versions of Sanofi-Aventis's Plavix (clopidogrel) could soon be available in Germany after a court there yesterday maintained two marketing approvals for the drug held by Yes Pharmaceuticals and Ratiopharm.</p><p>"The administrative court in Cologne has ordered the immediate execution of the approval. Together with its marketing partners in Germany the launch of clopidogrel is being initiated without further delay," saidSchweizerhall, the Swiss generics company which produces the drug. BfArM, the German regulator, originally approved the authorisations in May but Sanofi-Aventis challenged the decision and the marketing authorisations were subsequently suspended.</p><p>Sanofi-Aventis says that it will appeal against these decisions alongside Bristol-Myers Squibb. "Sanofi-Aventis considers that these marketing authorisations, which Sanofi-Aventis is convinced rely on data originating from Sanofi-Aventis/Bristol-Myers Squibb &ndash; the originators of Plavix/Iscover &ndash; should never have been accepted for review by any EU regulatory agencies until after data protection expired on July 15<sup>th</sup>," the company said.</p><p>However, Luzi Andreas von Bidder, Schweizerhall Holding's chairman, told <i>Scrip</i> earlier this year that its clopidogrel did not violate the Plavix patent and that the company had not used "any data protected by Sanofi-Aventis's patent" (<i>Scrip</i> Online, May 9<sup>th</sup>, 2008).</p><p>The same court is expected to make a third ruling in the near future, this time concerning the marketing authorisation granted to Hexal(Sandoz).</p><p>Schweizerhall is looking to register clopidogrel in Luxembourg and other European countries. The group says it expects 2008 sales to increase by up to 30% and result in a significant increase in earning power.</p><p>The generic version of the drug was developed byCimex, a subsidiary of the Schweizerhall Group, which also includes Yes Pharmaceuticals. European sales for Plavix totalled &euro;440 million in the first quarter and &euro;1.8 billion last year, Sanofi-Aventis reports.</p>
