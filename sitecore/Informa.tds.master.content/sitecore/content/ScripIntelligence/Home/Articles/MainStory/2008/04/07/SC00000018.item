<p>A federal judge in New York will allow securities fraud claims to proceed against Pfizerin a suit by investors which accuses the company and some of its former executives of "misstatements and omissions in their public filings and statements" regarding the COX-2 inhibitors Celebrex (celecoxib) and Bextra (valdecoxib).</p><p>In a July 1st opinion, US District Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York refused to grant Pfizer&rsquo;s motion to have the entire suit dismissed. She did, however, dismiss a handful of claims outlined in the consolidated class action. The remaining claims are without merit, a Pfizer spokesperson stated.</p><p>The lead plaintiff, Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, brought the action on behalf of a putative class of investors who bought stock between October 31st, 2000 and October 19th, 2005.</p><p>The investors claim that the defendants violated federal and state laws by deliberately concealing the results of three medical studies concerning Celebrex and Bextra, and later made misrepresentations. The ruling states: "Plaintiffs allege that senior officials at Pfizer, including the individual defendants, knew from a very early date that Celebrex and Bextra had adverse cardiovascular effects. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that defendants were aware of three studies which revealed these adverse effects."</p><p>The judge found that the consolidated class-action complaint "sufficiently alleged that the defendants knew or had access to information showing that their public statements were inaccurate". Judge Swain did not rule on the merits of the claims, just that they had been sufficiently alleged to proceed toward trial.</p><p>There has been much debate concerning Celebrex and cardiovascular effects &ndash; indeed, last year a judge overseeing hundreds of product liability cases concerning the drug ruled that plaintiffs suing Pfizer had failed to provide reliable scientific evidence to prove that Celebrex could cause heart attacks and strokes when taken at a daily dose of 200mg, the most commonly used (<i>Scrip</i> No 3328, p 14).</p><p>Studies alleging a cardiovascular link have been questioned. In 2005, Dr Sidney Wolfe of the US consumer group Public Citizen accused Pfizer of failing to disseminate the results of a 1999 Phase II trial comparing Celebrex with placebo in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients, which allegedly showed a 3.6-fold risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events. Pfizer rebutted that the group had "cherry-picked" the data. A member of the independent safety board that monitored the study also said that he believed that the Public Citizen analysis was flawed (<i>Scrip</i> No 3028, p 15).</p><p>Pfizer withdrew Bextra from the US market in 2005 at the request of the FDA. Celebrex is the only COX-2 inhibitor that has remained on the market.</p><p>Pfizer has emphasised that health authorities around the world have concluded that the benefits of Celebrex continue to outweigh its risks &ndash; but sales have been hurt by the safety concerns.</p>
