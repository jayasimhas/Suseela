<p>The French Agence de Medecine Preventive (AMP) has received $10 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the development of national vaccine advisory committees across Africa and Asia.</p><p>The seven-year grant will help GAVI-eligible countries establish the committees, in order to develop sustainable vaccination plans tailored to each country's specific needs.</p><p>Philippe Stoeckel, chairman of the AMP, said the need for national vaccine expertise was increasing as new inoculants being developed could soon be introduced, and poorer countries could struggle to implement the treatments if they were expensive, required new approaches to organising vaccination and had to compete for limited resources with other healthcare priorities.</p><p>Both the AMP and the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), along with the World Health Organization, will provide technical assistance and guidance for the committees, including developing decision-making protocols, on-site and distance training and an interactive website, as well as resources to help the development of the committees.</p><p>The AMP will be responsible for the implementation of the grant in Africa, whilst the IVI will oversee the project and funding in Asia.</p><p></p>
