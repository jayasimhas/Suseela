<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission's New York regional office has notified Dendreon that it has completed an informal inquiry begun in July 2007, and will not recommend any enforcement action, Dendreon said in its most recent 10-Q filing. Dendreon said the inquiry involved the clinical trials for its investigational therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine, Provenge (sipuleucel-T), the BLA and the FDA review of the product (<i>Scrip</i> Online, July 18th, 2007).</p><p>Last year, the FDAtold the firm it was seeking additional clinical data on efficacy. Dendreon said in March that the agency had accepted an amended protocol to the Phase III IMPACT study, and that the company was looking to provide data by the second half of 2009. In July, the company said that an interim analysis, expected in October, provides the company with the potential to accelerate its BLA amendment for Provenge.</p><p>"If the independent data monitoring committee reports in October that pre-specified criteria for statistical significance [are] not met, then the company anticipates continuing the trial with the expectation of reporting final results in the second half of 2009," it said.</p>
