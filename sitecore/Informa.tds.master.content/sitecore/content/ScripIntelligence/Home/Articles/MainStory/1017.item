<p>A Phase III clinical trial ofLilly's long-acting injectable formulation of Zyprexa, olanzapine LAI, suggests that it maintains its therapeutic effect across a range of dosing regimens, the company reports. Lilly has also analysed the occurrence of olanzapine LAI post-injection syndrome across all trials, and suggested measures to manage it.</p><p>This summer, Lilly submitted a complete response to an FDA nonapprovable letter issued in February, which expressed concern about excessive sedation, one of the symptoms of the post-injection syndrome (<i>Scrip</i> Online, February 28th, 2008). The company continues to work with regulatory agencies in support of the review of olanzapine LAI, Lilly says.</p><p>The product, a formulation of olanzapine with pamoic acid, has been submitted for approval in the EU, Canada, Australia and the US, and the company is proposing a comprehensive plan for managing the syndrome, including a detailed product label, a post-injection observation period, and extensive healthcare provider training and education.</p><p>The current study evaluated 1,065 adult outpatients with schizophrenia who were previously stabilised on open-label oral olanzapine. They were randomised to one of three injected doses of olanzapine LAI (150mg every two weeks, 300mg every two weeks or 405mg every four weeks), a low dose of olanzapine LAI (45mg every four weeks), or remained on oral olanzapine.</p><p>The therapeutic effects of olanzapine LAI were maintained throughout the 24-week study, the company reports. The mean baseline-to-endpoint changes in PANSS total scores for patients treated with therapeutic doses (150mg every two weeks, 300mg every two weeks or 405mg every four weeks) differed significantly from those treated with the reference doses. Significant separations in PANSS total scores were observed after 11 (150mg/two weeks), three (300mg/two weeks) and two (405mg/four weeks) weeks and maintained throughout the study.</p><p>The safety profile was consistent with that of oral olanzapine except for injection-related events, Lilly says. The incidence of weight gain of 7% or more from baseline was significantly higher for patients treated with oral olanzapine (21.4%), olanzapine LAI 150mg every two weeks (16.4%), olanzapine LAI 300mg every two weeks (20.7%) and olanzapine LAI 405mg every four weeks (15.2%) when compared with patients treated with olanzapine LAI 45mg every four weeks (8.3%).</p><p>The incidence of all injection site reactions, including injection pain was 2.8%, although two patients experienced and recovered fully from olanzapine LAI post-injection syndrome. The symptoms of the syndrome can include sedation, delirium, extrapyramidal symptoms, dysarthria, ataxia and aggression.</p><p>Lilly has analysed the findings of olanzapine LAI post-injection syndrome. As of May 31<sup>st</sup>, the syndrome was seen in 28 patients after more than 40,000 olanzapine injections, indicating a rate of 0.07% per injection and a per-patient rate of 1.4%. No clinically significant declines in vital signs were observed and all patients recovered within 1.5 to 72 hours.</p><p></p>
