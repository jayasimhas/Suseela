<p>GileadSciences has signed an agreement with Merck & Coto distribute the HIV treatment Atripla (efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in 12 countries primarily in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Atripla, which was launched in Europe earlier this year, will be registered, manufactured and distributed in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Uruguay. The two companies will share any revenues and costs associated with the registration and distribution.</p><p>Gilead and Merck signed an agreement in August 2006, allowing Merck to distribute Atripla at a discounted price in 94 developing countries, including those areas of the world most heavily affected by HIV and AIDS (<i>Scrip</i>Online, August 14<sup>th</sup>, 2008).</p><p>Gilead has also issued a safety notice concerning Atripla, the only once-daily single tablet treatment for HIV currently on the market, warning that the drug is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and that severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued Emtriva (emtricitabine) or Viread (tenofovir DF), which are components of Atripla. Furthermore, 53% of patients taking Atripla reported central nervous system symptoms, including dizziness, insomnia, impaired concentration, somnolence, abnormal dreams and hallucinations, compared with 25% of patients receiving control regimens.</p>
