<p>Stronger than expected second-quarter revenues, in particular for biologicals and vaccines, sawBaxter's share price rise to an all-time high of $69.66 on Thursday July 17th, and to close at $67.96, up by 3.2%.</p><p>Baxter's Bioscience business, which includes its recombinants, plasma proteins, antibody therapies, regenerative therapies and vaccines, reported a 16% increase in sales to $1.4 billion, although half of the increase was attributed to favourable currency exchange.</p><p>CFO Rob Davis said that double-digit growth across the portfolio more than offset the loss of BeneFIX (exclusive distribution rights for which were returned to Wyeth last year), sales of which last year amounted to $65 million.</p><p>Revenues during the quarter from its recombinant products rose by 18% (10% excluding foreign currency impacts) to $508 million &ndash; most of this was from international sales, which increased by 30%. US sales were up by 4% which Baxter attributed to the timing of shipments in the quarter and strong double-digit growth in the first quarter. Sales of Advate (octocog alfa) now represent 75% of Baxter's total recombinant sales, Mr Davis said, and he expects continued patient conversion to the product to drive this business.</p><p>International sales also accounted for the lion's share of growth for Baxter's plasma products in the quarter. Worldwide sales were $291 million, up by 20% including an 8% currency benefit; international sales increased by 32%, while US sales were up by 1%. The performance was helped by continued strong demand for plasma proteins and improved pricing, particularly for albumin, Baxter said.</p><p>The company's antibody therapies saw sales growth of 32% to $315 million, driven mainly by conversion to Gammagard Liquid and better pricing. Vaccine sales in the quarter were about $150 million up by roughly 20% (excluding foreign currency benefits) because of increased demand for the FSME encephalitis vaccine.</p><p>Overall Baxter reported a net income of $544 million in the second quarter, up by 26% on the same quarter last year, on worldwide sales of $3.2 billion (up by 13% including an 8% foreign currency impact). Earnings per diluted share were $0.85 &ndash; better than Baxter's previous guidance of $0.81-0.83 per diluted share, and also ahead of analysts' expectations. On an adjusted basis, net income and earnings per diluted share increased by 14% and 18% respectively, compared with the same period last year.</p><p>SG&A costs for the quarter were $703 million, up by 13% from $621 million but flat at 22% of sales. R&D expenses were $222 million (7% of sales) up from $177 million (6.3% of sales) for the same period last year.</p><h1>full-year guidance</h1><p>Based on the performance, Baxter has raised its full-year guidance and now expects sales growth for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, of 5-6%, with earnings per diluted share of $3.28-3.32 before any special items. Its previous earnings guidance was $3.18-3.24.</p>
