<p>Several pharmaceutical companies have reduced the prices of their antiretrovirals in Mexico following negotiations with the government there, the Mexican health ministry has said. Thanks to the reductions, the ministry estimates that it will save Ps310 million ($30.6 million) annually.</p><p>The ministry announced in July that it would be negotiating with the industry in order to guarantee the provision of free drugs for HIV/AIDS patients affiliated with the national health insurance programme. "Every time there have been negotiations between the industry and a Latin American country, important reductions have been achieved in the prices of this type of pharmaceutical," said the ministry.</p><p>Merck Sharpe and Dohmeagreed to reduce the price of Stocrin (efavirenz) from $2.23 per patient per day to $1.46 per patient per day &ndash; around 41%, the company told <i>Scrip</i>. In addition, the company offered its new integrase inhibitor Isentress (raltegravir) to Mexico's public sector for an initial price of Ps6,581.25 per patient per month. Since its launch there last October, the drug has only been available in the private sector at Ps9,050 per patient per month.</p><p>Earlier in the year the company received heavy criticism for its antiretroviral prices in Mexico. A print ad taken out by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) entitled "Shame on Merck" claimed that the company charged Mexico six times more than other Latin American countries for Stocrin. "Stocrin costs approximately $140 in Honduras, yet Merck charges $893 for Stocrin in Mexico," the ad said.</p><p>However, the company told <i>Scrip</i> that "Merck/MSD's HIV pricing policy considers both the level of a country's development, as measured by United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI), and the burden of disease, as measured by the adult prevalence (UNAIDS), to determine price. The previous pricing was established when Mexico was categorised as a middle-income country by the UNDP's HDI." Stocrin is now among the lowest cost ARVs available in Mexico, says the company.</p><p>Boehringer Ingelheimwas also among the companies to negotiate discounts. It offered a 22% price reduction on its liquid presentation of Viramune (nevirapine) and a 10% reduction on Aptivus (tipranavir), according to the ministry of health. The company was unable to give any further specifics on the prices reached, but said that they would only apply to purchases made by the health ministry. The ministry also reported that Stendhal had offered a 25% price cut for Truvada (emtricitabine plus tenofovir). Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKlinesaid that it had reduced the prices of its antiretrovirals by between 20 and 43%.</p><p>However, single-digit percentage price reductions offered by Abbottand Bristol-Myers Squibbwere rejected by the health ministry as "absurd", Dr Patricia Campos, chief of AHF's Latin American bureau, told <i>Scrip</i>. Dr Campos recently met the Mexican president Felipe Calderï¿½n to discuss lowering ARV prices alongside other NGO representatives. She described the other discounts as "good start", but said there was more to be done. "A 50% price reduction on Kaletra (lopinavir plus ritonavir) is very important," she said. "Mexico currently pays four times the prices charged in Brazil," she added. Both Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb declined to comment.</p><p></p>
