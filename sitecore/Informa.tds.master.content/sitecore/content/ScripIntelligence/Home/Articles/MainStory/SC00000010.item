<p>In the US, fast track designations for new drug candidates &ndash; first introduced in 1998 &ndash; have grown substantially during the last five years, from an average of 22 per year during 1998-02 to 49 per year during 2003-07, according to a new study conducted by the Boston-basedTufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.</p><p>The group found that fast track candidates do reach the market sooner &ndash; and this occurs because they have shorter FDAapproval times, despite the fact that average clinical development times are longer. A total of 344 drugs were reviewed (and these drugs had received at least one FDA fast track designation since 1998). The study was published in the September/October Tufts Impact Report.</p><p>Overall, drugs that are designated fast track are aimed at serious conditions, such as AIDS or breast cancer, which means that development hurdles are significant, often resulting in longer clinical times than drugs as a whole, says Janice Reichert, senior research fellow at Tufts CSDD. "Speedier FDA review, however, leads to shorter combined clinical and approval times for fast track drugs," she said.</p><p>This is reflected in the following facts: clinical development time for the fast track drugs in the study was 6% longer than it was for all drugs (64.7 vs 61.2 months). But average FDA approval review time was considerably shorter than for drugs as a whole &ndash; an average of 8.4 months vs 15.8 months (for products that began clinical testing in 1992 or later and were approved during 1998-07).</p><p>Despite these differences, CSDD found that, on average, total clinical and approval time for fast track drugs was 5% faster than for all drugs &ndash; 73.1 vs 77 months. The study also found that:</p><p></p><p>* Anticancer candidates received the largest share of fast track designations since the programme began;</p><p></p><p>* Fast track indications are more likely to be terminated during development than non-fast track indications, with efficacy being the primary reason; and</p><p></p><p>* For the 2003-07 candidates cohort, the reason for terminating fast track candidates was as follows: efficacy (50%), commercial concerns (30%), safety (15%) and other (5%).</p><p></p>
