<p>An alternative brand of the thyroid medicine Eltroxin (levothyroxine) tablets may soon be available in New Zealand, following a number of adverse events reported with the use of a new, and only, formulation of the product in the country.</p><p>New Zealand's medicines safety authority Medsafe and pharmaceutical management agency Pharmacplan to work together to introduce alternative, funded options to GlaxoSmithKline's current reformulated version of the drug, which has received over 700 reports of ADRs since the company changed its original Eltroxin formulation in July last year.</p><p>Medsafe received an application from Abbottfor an alternative brand of levothyroxine on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, Medsafe group manager Dr Stewart Jessamine said. The authority also expects a second alternative application next week from Goldshield Healthcare NZ for their levothyroxine product. Goldshield currently supplies its product as an unapproved medicine under section 29 of the Medicines Act. Pharmac funding and procurement manager Steffan Crausaz said Pharmac would be able to provide an update on funding an alternative within the next two weeks.</p><p>Medsafe began contacting manufacturers and distributors in May following a rise in ADRs associated with the new Eltroxin, encouraging applications for alternative brands of levothyroxine. Pharmac also expects to complete negotiations with at least one of these companies shortly; it has been holding discussions with suppliers in parallel with Medsafe's work, and will work quickly on funding, Mr Crausaz said.</p><p>Applicants will not be required to include all the information normally requested for an application; for example a bioequivalence study comparing these products to a product previously registered in New Zealand will not need to be included. Instead, Medsafe will make an assessment of the clinical safety and efficacy of the products by less direct methods, such as a history of the use of a medicine and bioequivalence against other medicines, to fast-track applications.</p><p>Eltroxin has been solely supplied to New Zealand by GSK for at least 10 years. GSK voluntarily submitted an application to Medsafe to change the formulation in March 2004, and the new formulation was approved in November 2006 and supplied in New Zealand last July. However, supplies of old tablets continued to be used up by pharmacies, meaning many patients did not receive the new formulation until either later 2007 or early 2008.</p><p>Adverse reactions to the new formulation began being reported during 2008, with the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) reporting 746 ADRs by September 2nd, approximately 1% of all patients treated with Eltroxin in New Zealand. Symptoms after changing brands of Eltroxin included eye pain, conjunctivitis, headaches and visual disturbance, and after several weeks or months included headache, weight gain, lethargy, alopecia, insomnia and palpitations. Allergic reactions such as rash, facial oedema and angioedema were also reported.</p><p>In response to the initial increase in ADRs to the new formulation, CARM reassessed the formulation, confirming it met international standards for quality, safety and bioequivalence. Medsafe also obtained batch information for all batches supplied in New Zealand, required a third notification of the change in formulation from GSK to GP's and pharmacies, and initiated independent testing with ESR, which ruled out contamination or a poor quality product. Expert endocrinologists were also consulted, who advised the reactions were most likely due to patients absorbing lower amounts of levothyroxine from the new tablets.</p><p>Medsafe additionally investigated adverse reaction patterns in other countries supplying the new Eltroxin, but found no increase in ADRs. Medsafe also contacted all 83 countries on the WHO adverse reactions monitoring scheme, and found no reports of increased rates of adverse reactions to the new formulation. Australia and the UK, in which the GSK brand is not available, found adverse reactions of a similar nature noted when patients changed brands of levothyroxine, but these were described as "in keeping" with expectations with a narrow therapeutic index product such as levothyroxine.</p><p>In line with this, Medsafe said it believed most patients experiencing ADRs required thyroid function monitoring and dose adjustment.</p><p></p>
