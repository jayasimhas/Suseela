<p>TheEuropean Medicines Agency's new approach to benefit-risk evaluations could help pricing and reimbursement authorities in their decisions on the relative value of medicines, according to Thomas Lönngren, the agency's executive director.</p><p>As reported earlier this year, the EMEA is trialling a new kind of benefit-risk template with a more structured list of the criteria used to make assessments (<i>Scrip</i> Online, June 9th, 2008). The aim is to provide a checklist for assessors and rapporteurs to show that all the necessary elements have been addressed.</p><p>"This exercise is a priority for us, for several reasons," Mr Lönngren said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>. For one thing, there is an increasing demand for more transparency in terms of the parameters that are used to determine both the benefit and the risk of a product. Also, benefit-risk evaluation has so far not been conducted with a proper methodology. In other fields where risk assessment is carried out, various models are used, and now "everyone realises that there is a need to somehow standardise how we do it too", he noted.</p><p>The aim now is to see whether a more quantitative methodology can make decisions more predictable and ensure they are consistent with previous benefit-risk evaluations. This new, more objective approach could also help to better structure discussions between assessors and industry, Mr Lönngren said.</p><p>He also suggested that such an approach could be of use in the post-authorisation phase. "If you can establish criteria and these change over time, you could say, OK, what is the magnitude of this change for the benefit-risk assessment? It is very complex and we are just starting, but this is a priority."</p><p>Furthermore, Mr Lönngren said, it could be of benefit to EU pricing, reimbursement and health technology assessment bodies. "Some of them, such as IQWiG in Germany, are starting to re-do our benefit-risk assessments, because I think that many of them think that our EPARs [European Public Assessment Reports] don't give enough information and they want a more structured explanation for our benefit-risk assessments. As we approve nearly all new molecules in the EU, we feel we want to give them more information so that they understand our decisions."</p><p>He believes that the European agency's assessments will then ultimately feed into these bodies' own decisions. "What we are doing is relative benefit-risk assessment, with comparative clinical trials, which is the basis for approval." When the product has been on the market for a while, much of the information that becomes available is on relative effectiveness, which takes into account clinical experience and any new safety information, Mr Lönngren noted.</p><p>"Then the pricing and reimbursement authorities look at relative cost-effectiveness &ndash; we are not involved here, but it is all linked together from the beginning. Our assessments will feed through all the way to pricing and reimbursement, and will also help to avoid duplication of work. With transparency in our decisions, they could be used by pricing and reimbursement institutes all over the EU."</p>
