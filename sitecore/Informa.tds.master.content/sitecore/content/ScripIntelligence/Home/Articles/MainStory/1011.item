<p></p><p>Older EU member countries are spending around 40% more on pharmaceuticals per inhabitant than new members, says a report published by the Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Information (PPRI) project.</p><p>The report, commissioned by the European Commission and the Austrian health ministry, analyses the pricing and reimbursement systems in 27 countries (the PPRI 27) comprising the 27 EU member states, excluding Spain and Romania but including Turkey and Norway.</p><p>In 2004, EU-15 countries (the 15 states which joined the EU before May 2004) spent &euro;360 per inhabitant on out- and in-patient pharmaceuticals compared with &euro;254 spent by the EU-10 countries (those which joined after May 2004), says the report. Figures are expressed in euro purchasing power parities to apply a common currency and equalise price levels.</p><p>But the new EU states spend a bigger proportion of their healthcare budgets on pharmaceuticals in comparison with the older states. The EU-10 spends 26% of their budget of pharmaceuticals while the EU-15 spend 16%. One possible explanation for this is that the prices of new, patented medicines are high throughout the EU (in new and old member states alike) but labour costs &ndash; which comprise a significant portion of healthcare expenditure &ndash; are considerably lower in the EU-10. Therefore, the portion of the budget spent on labour in the new EU countries is comparatively lower than in the older states.</p><p>Meanwhile, disparities in population age structures, country specific attitudes to the use of pharmaceuticals, and differences in co-payments mean that there are significant differences in pharmaceutical consumption from country to country within the PPRI 27.</p>
