<p>A new law that could dramatically reduce the price of generic medicines in Portugal is likely to be published formally in the official journal within the next few days.</p><p>The health ministry is to make generic medicines prices 30% lower than they were in 2007 by amending decree-law 65 2007, it told <i>Scrip</i>. This is largely because generic medicines have higher prices than elsewhere in Europe.</p><p>Unlike in other European countries, generic medicines in Portugal take a higher share of the market in terms of value than they do in volume, say industry sources. The government wishes to redress this balance, they say.</p><p>They claim that generic medicines are more expensive in Portugal because originator brands also have higher prices there, complaining that this issue is not being addressed.</p><p>Apifarmahas said that it is "perplexed and worried" by the reductions. "Measures like this jeopardise the workings and balance of the entire medicines sector, and clearly affect investments and future perspectives.&rdquo;</p><p>The association is also concerned about domestic companies which it says have made an important contribution to boosting Portuguese exports. "The pharmaceutical industry is considered a strategic sector for Portugal," says Apifarma. The industry has already been hit by two significant price reductions and it has been nine years since any general increase in prices, the association points out.</p><p>Apogen, the generic medicines association, said that it would not comment on the measures until the law had been published in the official journal.</p><p>Nevertheless, the health ministry told <i>Scrip</i> that measures for supporting the generic medicines sector would be taken towards the end of the year. More details would be made available soon, it said.</p>
