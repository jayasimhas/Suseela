<p>Pfizer's positive second-quarter results have surprised many figures in the industry, including Credit Suisse analysts who predicted EPS of $0.49, $0.06 below the company's adjusted diluted EPS.</p><p>Pfizer's fortunes had appeared to be in decline after it failed to reverse last year's poor performance in the first quarter of this year, and there were fears that the company's profit slowdown would carry into the second quarter. However, increases in sales of its lead products, such as Lipitor (atorvastatin; +9%), Lyrica (pregabalin; +52%) and Celebrex (celecoxib; +23%), helped the company's net income increase by 119% compared with the same period last year. These particular products outperformed Credit Suisse estimates by a total of 17%.</p><p>However, the analysts still doubt whether the company will continue to improve over the long term. Though Credit Suisse increased its full-year EPS estimates for Pfizer to $2.34 following the results, the analysts remain neutral on the company's prospects given its challenging growth outlook. Incremental gains in revenues via pipeline or asset acquisition would make them more constructive on Pfizer's stock, the analysts said.</p>
