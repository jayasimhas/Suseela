<p>Six patients who have received Lillyand Amylin's injectable type 2 diabetes drug Byetta (exenatide) and who have also had pancreatitis have died so far, the companies have revealed in a conference call.</p><p>Earlier this month the US FDA issued an alert about reports of six patients receiving Byetta who had suffered haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis, a severe form of the condition, two of whom had died, the agency said (<i>Scrip</i> Online, August 19th, 2008). Lilly and Amylin said that they were aware that the alert had caused confusion and decided to host a conference call to clarify the situation. They revealed that, since the launch of Byetta, they had received reports of a total of six patients who had taken Byetta, had experienced acute pancreatitis and subsequently died. These included the reported cases of two patients with haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis. All six cases had been reported to the FDA before the agency issued its alert earlier this month.</p><p>The companies said that one of the two patients with haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis who died was morbidly obese and had extensive gallstone disease and the other had discontinued treatment with Byetta "some months" before being admitted to hospital with pancreatitis. In the other four cases, the causes of death did not appear to be directly attributable to pancreatitis, the companies said. Two patients died from post-operative complications and one from a relapse of leukaemia two months after recovering from pancreatitis. Information regarding the fourth case has not been provided, despite repeated and ongoing requests, they said.</p><p>The reported incidence of pancreatitis in patients receiving Byetta is no higher than that seen in the general population, the companies said. From Byetta's launch in 2005 to July 2008, one million patients have received Byetta. There have been 0.34 cases per 1,000 patient years of Byetta exposure and the proportion of cases resulting in complications or death is no higher than in the general population. A paper published in the journal <i>Pancreas</i> in 2006 showed that, in the general US population, there are 0.33-0.44 cases of acute pancreatitis per 1,000 adults per year, 15-20% of which involve haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis and 2-6% of which lead to death. In addition, patients with type 2 diabetes were at three times the risk of acute pancreatitis, they said.</p><p>Lilly and Amylin stressed that no definite causal relationship between Byetta and pancreatitis has been established, although it is possible that there is an association. The companies said they were continuing to pursue a comprehensive drug safety programme, including extensive internal and external review of cases and epidemiological studies. They are also in discussion with the FDA about possible changes to the product's label. They said they could not speculate on when these might be made, but said that changes could include additional wording, adjusting the prominence of the current wording, or revising the status of the current advice from a precaution to a warning.</p><p>The companies said that following the FDA's announcement they had made direct contact with physicians. Once the context of the cases had been explained, the doctors were happy to continue prescribing Byetta and prescriptions were continuing at a similar level to before the announcement.</p><p>Last October, the FDA alerted US doctors to the suspected links between Byetta and 30 cases of acute pancreatitis, but emphasised that they had no post-marketing reports of haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis (<i>Scrip</i> Online, October 17th, 2007). Following this alert, information about acute pancreatitis was included in the precautions section of the product's label.</p><p>Byetta is the first in a new class of diabetes medicine, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues, or incretin mimetics. In May, Novo Nordisk applied for US and EU approval of its investigational GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in type 2 diabetes. Roche's GLP-1 analogue taspoglutide (R-1583) and Sanofi-Aventis's AVE0010 are in Phase III development.</p><p>Byetta is currently given twice daily. A once-weekly formulation of Byetta is in development, and the companies said that they did not expect an increased incidence of pancreatitis with the longer-acting formulation.</p>
