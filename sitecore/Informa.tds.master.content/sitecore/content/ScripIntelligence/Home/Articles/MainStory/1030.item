<p>Iceland-based generics maker Actavishas recalled from the US market all drug products made at the company's Little Falls, New Jersey solid oral dose facility owing to good manufacturing practice deficiencies. The recall impacts 66 products, many with multiple formulations, and involves a facility with a history of compliance problems. The affected medicines include some that have not received formal FDA approval.</p><p>The action resulted from a GMP inspection conducted by the FDAfrom February to April. The inspection "revealed operations which did not meet the FDA's or Actavis' standards for good manufacturing practices", the company said. A spokesman told <i>Scrip</i> the GMP deficiencies included documentation issues.</p><p>The recall was initiated down to the pharmacy/retail level, including wholesalers and hospitals. The action was not prompted by any complaints or safety issues with the recalled medicines, and was not requested by the FDA, Actavis said.</p><p>The FDA issued a Form 483 list of observations after the inspection, to which the company has responded. Actavis has not received a formal FDA warning letter stemming from the recent inspection and continues working with the agency to remediate the deficiencies, implement corrective actions and return the products to market, although it could not provide a timeframe for doing so. The privately held company declined to give the value of the recalled inventory or the impact on earnings.</p><p>The recall affects only Actavis Totowa products made in Little Falls. Medicines manufactured by other Actavis divisions in the US and at other locations are not impacted.</p><h1>troubles</h1><p>The Little Falls site, which Actavis gained through its acquisition of Amide in 2005, has had a troubled regulatory history. An FDA warning letter in 2006 cited the facility for failing to comply with adverse event reporting requirements and manufacturing unapproved drugs, including extended-release products containing guaifenesin.</p><p>The current recall includes two guaifenesin-containing products &ndash; guaifenesin plus codeine phosphate tablets and guaifenesin plus phenylephrine tablets.</p><p>In February 2007 the FDA issued a second warning letter for significant GMP deviations. The problems included deficiencies in the Little Falls plant's quality control unit and failure to adequately investigate out-of-specification test results (<i>Scrip</i> Online, March 1st, 2007).</p><p>In April Actavis Totowa announced a nationwide recall of Digitek (digoxin tablets) distributed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals and UDL Laboratories. Tablets with double the appropriate thickness, and twice the level of active pharmaceutical ingredient, may have been commercially released, the company said, adding that several reports of illness and injuries had been received. Digitek was manufactured at the Little Falls facility.</p>
