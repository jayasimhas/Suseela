<p>Japan's ministry of health, labour and welfare is to consider lifting certain restrictions on the use of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) after a second expert committee found no evidence of a link between the neuraminidase inhibitor and unusual behaviour.</p><p>An expert advisory working group under Professor Yoshio Hirota of Osaka City University's medical school analysed data from around 9,700 flu patients under 18. In detailed results presented to the ministry, the group concluded that the incidence of all types of serious abnormal behaviour in the 7,487 patients taking Tamiflu was 12%, slightly lower than the 13% incidence for the 2,228 flu patients not given the Chugai/Roche product.</p><p>A ministerial drug safety committee is to consider next month whether it would be appropriate to change the current major restriction on the use of the product in standard-risk adolescents aged 10 to 19. This was imposed in March 2007 following a series of local reports of bizarre behaviour and "neuropsychiatric events", mostly in adolescent boys, which resulted in several deaths, mostly from falls from high buildings. Tamiflu's Japanese label has carried warnings on the potential for neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations since 2004.</p><p>Another expert group under the ministry recently reviewed new non-clinical studies on the metabolism and movement to the brain of oseltamivir and its active metabolites carried out by Chugai/Roche, and agreed with the companies' conclusion that there was no new clear evidence of any link with neuropsychiatric events (<i>Scrip</i> Online, June 26th, 2008).</p>
