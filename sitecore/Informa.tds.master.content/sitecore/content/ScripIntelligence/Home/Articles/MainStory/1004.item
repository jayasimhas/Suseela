<p>Plans to set up a "patent pool" to help generics firms produce combination therapies for use in developing countries have been welcomed by health activist groups. They say the move could increase poorer populations' access to cheaper and more appropriate medicines.</p><p>The patent pool concept is being pursued byUNITAID, the international drug purchasing facility launched in 2006. The organisation's board agreed in principle to establish the pool when it met on July 2nd-3rd in Geneva.</p><p>MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, the international NGO, said that in agreeing to set up the pool, UNITAID had shown "great vision and understanding of what needs to be done". But it warned that the success of the scheme would depend on whether patent holders were prepared to share patent rights.</p><h1>patent pools</h1><p>A patent pool is a mechanism whereby patents held by different entities such as companies, universities and research institutes are made available on a non-exclusive basis to others, such as manufacturers and distributors, for production or further development. Patent holders receive royalties from those who use the patents.</p><p>Pools are operated by a licensing agency that manages licences, negotiations with patent holders and the receipt and payment of royalties. They were relatively common in the early 20th century, particularly in the manufacturing of machinery, paper and chemicals, says UNITAID. More recently, patent pools have been used for digital communication technologies, such as MP3 and DVD.</p><p>Patent pools also feature in theWorld Health Organization's recently adopted Global Strategy on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property. The strategy recommends the development of new mechanisms to promote access to health-related technologies, including "voluntary patent pools of upstream and downstream technologies to promote innovation of and access to health products and medical devices".</p><p>The idea of setting up a patent pool for pharmaceuticals was first suggested by MSF and the non-profit corporation Essential Inventions soon after UNITAID was established. The organisations were concerned about the growing difficulties faced by lower-income countries in gaining access to new and better adapted drugs, particularly second-generation antiretrovirals (ARVs).</p><p>According to the activist group, Knowledge Economy International(KEI), a number of NGOs, academic experts, UN agencies and government experts contributed to the UNITAID discussions. An expert group at UNITAID had recommended that the pool should be voluntary, and that there should be flexibility for patent owners on the geographic scope of patents licensed to the pool, it added.</p><h1>task force to be set up</h1><p>UNITAID now plans to set up a task force to design the structure of the pool and develop the tools needed to implement it. It will consist of experts in patent law, legal and business risks, economic analysis, public health and medicines for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria.</p><p>The task force will make recommendations that will be discussed at the UNITAID board's next meeting in November, when a final decision will be taken on setting up the pool. Steps towards making it operational could then begin in early 2009.</p><h1>getting round patent barriers</h1><p>Ellen 't Hoen, director of policy at MSF's access campaign, said that patents on individual substances could be a barrier to the development and production of fixed-dose combination products. "A patent pool gets round that by offering producers a one-stop-shop for licences from the different intellectual property owners. Generic companies obtain licences against the payment of royalties that will enable them to put the different components of a fixed-dose combination together," she added.</p><p>UNITAID had shown "tremendous leadership" in creating the pool, which was "an important step in creating a framework for sustainable treatment for AIDS in developing countries", said James Love of KEI, which serves on the patent pool expert group.</p><p>Michelle Childs, head of KEI Europe and CEO of Essential Inventions, said that instead of litigation and confrontation, a voluntary pool offered "an innovative way to help meet the Millennium Development Goal to get more people into treatment".</p><h1>challenges</h1><p>However, both organisations cautioned that there would be challenges along the way and that much relied on the willingness of patent holders to contribute to the pool.</p><p>Ms 't Hoen said that its success depended on "the willingness of patent holders to share, in exchange for royalties, the relevant patent rights in the pool".</p><p>What was needed next, said Ms Childs, was a sound management team for the pool and "a strong civil society engagement with the patent owners to ensure that the pool obtains licences for second-generation AIDS drugs".</p><p>The European Generic medicines Association(EGA) was cautious in its appraisal of the initiative, commenting that it was "an interesting development that industry may wish to analyse". Its director, Greg Perry, said the pool might offer a case for the generics industry to engage in this area, "even if it is still early to say so. I expect it to be an intellectual property issue to feature in the forthcoming years."</p><h1>UNITAID</h1><p>UNITAID, which is hosted and administered by the WHO, traces its beginnings to 2004 when a group of 44 countries agreed on the need for innovative development financing mechanisms for medicines in the developing world. It was set up in 2006 by Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the UK in partnership with theClinton Foundation, and is funded by a solidarity tax on airline tickets.</p><p>The organisation operates by purchasing large amounts of medicines and diagnostics on a sustainable basis. Long-term commitments and high-volume purchasing mean that manufacturers are encouraged to increase their production, resulting in economies of scale.</p><p>It says it has already achieved substantial reductions in the prices of paediatric drugs and second-line ARVs, in partnership with the Clinton Foundation.</p><p>At its July meeting, the UNITAID board also approved an expansion of two ongoing projects against multidrug-resistant TB, as well as four new projects in areas such as prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and the provision of insecticide-treated nets against malarial mosquitoes in eight African countries.</p><p></p>
