<p>The US data management firm Phase Forward has acquired the web-based interactive response technology (IRT) company Clarix for $40 million in cash.</p><p>Phase Forward expects the acquisition to contribute non-GAAP revenues of $2.7 million this year with an operating loss of around $600,000 and a reduction of EPS of $0.01-0.02. It is expected to become accretive to Phase Forward in the second half of next year. IRT companies have attracted interest as acquisition candidates recently, for example with the UK firm ClinPhone being acquired by the CRO Parexel International in August (<i>Scrip</i> Online, August 19th, 2008).</p><p>Clarix is a privately held company based in Radnor, Pennsylvania, that has an IRT web system for randomising subjects in clinical trials, managing medicines supplies, and managing clinical reports. It will continue to operate from its existing offices as part of Phase Forward.</p><p>Phase Forward says that Clarix's system has 45,000 users in 62 countries, and estimates the IRT market to be worth $200-250 million. The market is evolving from a telephony-focused model to a fully web-integrated service, it adds.</p><p>Bob Weiler, the president and CEO of Phase Forward, noted that pharmaceutical companies had been looking for the integration of IRT and electronic data capture (EDC) systems, and that Clarix's advanced technology and rapidly growing user base set it apart from similar companies.</p><p></p>
