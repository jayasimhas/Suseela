<p>NanoCarrier has licensed the Asian rights outside of Japan to its pipeline cisplatin product to the Taiwanese company Orient Europharma, which has acquired an equity stake in the Japanese drug delivery firm as part of the alliance.</p><p>Orient has been awarded exclusive distribution rights in 17 regional markets, including China, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, to Nanoplatin, NanoCarrier's proprietary micelle formulation of the oncology drug. Orient will assist in the development of the product by carrying out regional clinical trials in Taiwan and elsewhere, with pancreatic cancer as the lead indication. The companies said they would also work together to develop other indications, which could include breast and kidney cancer.</p><p>NanoCarrier, which listed on the Tokyo Mothers market in March, will receive undisclosed milestones and royalties as part of the tie-up, and will also supply the product to Orient. The equity side of the deal involves the issue of &yen;75.0 million ($720,000) worth of new shares to Orient's wholly owned subsidiary Cyntec, in a third party allotment which will give Cyntec a holding of just over 3%.</p><p>NanoCarrier's 20-100 nanometer-sized particles comprise a hydrophobic polymer core containing the therapeutic agent which is then encapsulated by a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol outer layer. The aim of the technology is to achieve the gradual release and higher concentrations of drug in target tissues, with the added benefit of reduced side-effects through lower systemic exposure.</p><p>NanoCarrier began a Phase I trial with Nanoplatin in the UK in 2006 and is now preparing to take the product into Phase II development. Orient noted that there were around 11,000 pancreatic patients in Asia outside of Japan and that the potential annual market for Nanoplatin was valued at more than NT$100 million ($3.1 million).</p><p>The Taiwanese firm develops and markets drugs, nutritional consumer and other products and has a dedicated oncology division which handles products including Navelbine (vinorelbine, licensed from Pierre Fabre) for non-small cell lung and metastatic breast cancer. Total corporate sales were around $94.2 million last year.</p><p>Separately, NanoCarrier said that it had ended a 2006 joint basic research programme with Kirin Pharma into another targeted cancer therapy, NC-4010. This project was investigating the linking of antibodies targeting oncology-specific antigens with micellar nanoparticles.</p><p>NanoCarrier said that its research in the field had yielded some promising results and that it would look for other alliance partners.</p>
