<p>The ratio of pharmaceutical exports to imports in Slovakia fell by almost four percentage points to 21.6% last year compared with 2006, says the national health policy institute (HPI). Pharmaceutical imports increased by more than 10% to SK34.6 billion ($1.8 billion), and exports fell by 6% to SK7.5 billion.</p><p>Around one third of total healthcare expenditure was spent on imported pharmaceuticals in the three years to 2007, and they accounted for 89%, 82% and 86% of total spending on medicines in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. Patients spent SK4.1 billion (+14%) on OTC products and SK6.1 billion (+7%) on prescription medicines, compared with the SK30 billion (+4%) that insurance companies spent on them.</p><p>Total healthcare expenditure rose by 9% to SK108.1 billion in 2007, the same growth rate as in the previous year. The HPI estimated that the reduction of value-added tax on pharmaceuticals from the beginning of last year and a one-off price cut in the spring allowed the health ministry to save more than SK4 billion in its spending on medicines.</p><h1>online orders</h1><p>Separately, the Slovak health ministry is considering changes to the national law on medicines which should allow patients to order OTC medicines by telephone, fax, email or from online pharmacy websites. The changes might come into force next year.</p><p>Pharmacies which want to provide such services will have to receive a licence from the national institute for drug control, the SUKL. They will have to dispatch products within 48 hours and to deliver them within three days of receiving an order. Sellers will have to treat products returned by customers as waste and dispose of them securely.</p><p>Patients will also be able to order OTC products which have marketing authorisations in Slovakia from other EC member countries; in this case the product must have a patient leaflet in the Slovak language.</p>
