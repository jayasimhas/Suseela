<p>A federal judge in New York is urging Lillyto settle a putative class action lawsuit filed by insurance companies, labour unions and others who claim the company improperly marketed and made false claims about its top-selling product Zyprexa (olanzapine), causing Zyprexa "to command a higher price than it would have had the truth been known to those who prescribed, bought or paid for the product".</p><p>The plaintiffs seek reimbursement. In a 290-page draft court order issued on July 2nd, Judge Jack Weinstein of the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York said he was prepared to grant class-action status for the suit, which was brought in 2005. He has urged Lilly to negotiate a settlement with plaintiffs. The judge's draft cites two experts' estimates of the claims, one of $4.9 billion and another ranging from $3.9 billion to nearly $7.7 billion.</p><p>The judge considers his draft order to be a useful document "in framing a discussion" at a hearing scheduled for late July. His written draft is not a final order, and will undergo refinement. In urging a settlement, he stated: "A global settlement for the overpricing claims and any other claims is desirable." He added that a quick resolution of the case was desirable so that "the government, the medical profession and drug manufacturers can get on with their main job &ndash; protecting people's health effectively".</p><p>The judge also said a settlement class would ideally include actions for overcharges brought on behalf of government entities and individual payers &ndash; and that a settlement "could help end the entire Zyprexa litigation".</p><p>The insurers and labour unions claim that Lilly violated the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO) through mail fraud, predicated on overpricing supported by "excessive claims" about the drug's usefulness as well as "disavowal of adverse secondary effects of the product, primarily weight gain and diabetes". RICO is a federal civil statute.</p><p>"There is sufficient evidence of fraud under RICO to go to a jury," Judge Weinstein stated in his draft order, noting that proposed testimony of plaintiffs experts would permit a jury to determine the excess price. In addition to RICO, other causes of action are asserted: violations of 45 state consumer protection statutes, common law fraud, and unjust enrichment.</p><p>The judge has limited the damages to four years before the lawsuit was filed, or the period from June 20th, 2001, to June 20th, 2005. At the same time, he added that "a jury may considerably reduce or eliminate this window on finding that third-party payers knew or should have known of Zyprexa's alleged overpricing before they commenced suit on June 20th, 2005."</p><p>The plaintiffs allege that over the 11-year period since Zyprexa's introduction, Lilly has withheld information and disseminated misinformation about the safety and efficacy of Zyprexa and promoted and marketed the drug for uses for which it was not indicated and for patients who would have been better served by less expensive medications. As a result of these actions, alleged excess payments were made for the Zyprexa product.</p><p>At the direction of plaintiffs' counsel, Dr Rosenthal, an associate professor of health economics and policy at Harvard School of Public Health, undertook to: examine whether economic theory and evidence suggest that Lilly's allegedly unlawful Zyprexa sales, marketing and promotional practices resulted in common economic impact to the putative class; quantify damages to the class based on a "loss-of-value" theory, ie, as the difference in economic value that class members were allegedly led to believe they would obtain from Zyprexa and the actual economic value of the drug in light of limitations known to Lilly; and quantify the amount by which Lilly incrementally profited from the allegedly unlawful practices.</p><p>Lilly's general counsel Michael Harrington told the Indianapolis Star that multi-billion figures that have been thrown around by the plaintiffs' lawyers "are calculated to be inflammatory and get people's attention", and that Lilly has yet to present its case in court. Lilly could present additional evidence and move to have the case dismissed.</p><p>The case actually consists of two lawsuits purported to be nationwide class actions filed in the Eastern District of New York in 2005, both of which have been consolidated into a single suit, according to SEC documents. Besides these cases, Lilly has spent more than $1 billion to settle claims from patients over Zyprexa side-effects, and claims not covered in these settlements cover about 1,200 plaintiffs. In March, Lilly put behind it the first of several cases by US states claiming it withheld data, adding to state medical costs (<i>Scrip</i> No 3349, p 5). In April, Judge Weinstein dismissed a shareholder suit, claiming it was filed long after the statute of limitations had expired (<i>Scrip</i> No 3361, p 4).</p>
