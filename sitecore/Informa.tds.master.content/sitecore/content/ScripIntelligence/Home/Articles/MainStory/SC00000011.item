<p>Abbott Laboratories is to cut jobs as part of a four-year plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiency. The US firm will implement the changes in its core diagnostics business and this will affect around 1,000 employees, according to press reports.</p><p>It is believed that about 100 jobs will be lost this year and that the company's US manufacturing operations will be transferred to Europe. The plan to streamline its global manufacturing operations is expected to produce annual pretax savings of more than $150 million.</p><p>The company said that the restructuring would cost $370 million before tax and expects to book $150 million of these charges in the second half. The remainder of the charges will occur through 2011 as the firm transfers its product manufacturing to other Abbott facilities.</p><p>There will be employee-related costs of $110 million, accelerated depreciation of around $75 million and other related costs of $185 million.</p><p>During the second quarter the firm's worldwide sales increased by 15% to $7.3 billion, while global diagnostic sales rose by 17%. Abbott's diagnostic division accounts for $936 million, or 13%, of its total second-quarter revenues.</p>
