<p>A public consultation on whether to allow UK patients to pay for drugs that are not funded by the national health servicehas started, with the evidence gathering stage to be completed by August 22nd, and results announced in October. Professor Mike Richards, the national clinical director for cancer, will lead the review.</p><p>Patients who pay privately for drugs are required under longstanding NHS regulations to then pay for NHS care that they would otherwise have received for free. But this has meant that cancer patients, in particular, who have found that they are denied medicines because of a lack of a positive recommendation from the national institute of health and clinical excellence, cannot co-pay or top-up their treatment with those drugs without having additional cost penalties.</p><p>The rules were put in place to prevent the development of a two-tier NHS, with richer patients being able to receive better care, and also partly to prevent confusion over doctors&rsquo; NHS and private practices. Doctors attending the annual meeting of the British Medical Association supported the idea that patients should be able to purchase additional treatments, although they stopped short of demanding the introduction of co-payments. Instead they called for a Royal Commission to review the issue.</p>
