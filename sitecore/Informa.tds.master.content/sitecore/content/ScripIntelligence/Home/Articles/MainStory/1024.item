<p>The Canadian government has announced a Cdn$1 million investment to support the establishment of a drug safety and effectiveness network.</p><p>The network will assess the safety and effectiveness of drugs post-launch in a number of diverse patient groups in the "real world". It will link with pharmaceutical research centres to independently assess the findings, which will contribute to decision-making on access, prescriptions and use of drugs within the healthcare system.</p><p>The findings will also provide information to guide policy questions on the safety and effectiveness of post-marketed drugs, as well as highlight the value of existing investments and the need to fund new research to fill gaps in areas of post-market research.</p><p>Steven Fletcher, parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health, said the network would provide an "ongoing, pro-active assessment" of post-marketed drugs and their effects. The network will also complement other Health Canada initiatives aimed at strengthening post-marketing surveillance of health products, including the adverse reaction reporting system Canada Vigilance, and the promotion of adverse reaction reporting via MedEffect Canada.</p><p>The network also forms part of the Food and Consumer Safety Action Plan, which was announced last December in a bid to strengthen Canada's safety system for food, health and consumer products. The action plan intends to implement a number of initiatives, including increased safety tests for companies, increased penalties for offending companies, and the establishment of product traceability requirements, making it mandatory for suppliers to provide quick tracking of recalled products.</p><p></p><p></p>
