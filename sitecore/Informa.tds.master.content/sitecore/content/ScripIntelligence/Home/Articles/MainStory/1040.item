<p>New guidelines on treating different stages of breast cancer proposed by theNational Institute for health and Clinical Excellence, which evaluates technologies for the national health service in England and Wales, have identified gaps in current research on different types of therapy.</p><p>Although NICE has already issued a series of technology assessments and clinical guidelines relating to breast cancer, the two clinical guidelines just released for consultation take a comprehensive view of available treatments and the circumstances in which one course of treatment should be preferred to another. Available evidence for each of the guidelines was reviewed by a guideline development group, and each of these groups has appended recommendations for further research to its draft.</p><p>In draft guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of early and locally advanced breast cancer, the institute urges further research into the role of Roche/Genentech's Herceptin (trastuzumab) "in adjuvant therapy without chemotherapy, scheduling and duration of treatment in patients also receiving chemotherapy, and primary systemic treatment".</p><p>In HER2-positive, invasive breast cancer, trastuzumab dosed three times weekly for 12 months is routine adjuvant therapy, where appropriate, following surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the draft guideline notes, adding that more effective or cost-effective regimens need further study. "There are few studies assessing the role of trastuzumab as a primary systemic treatment and even less using it in hormone receptor-positive patients treated with hormone therapy alone and no chemotherapy," the draft continues.</p><p>It also makes recommendations for further research into optimum treatment of the axilla, different aspects of radiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy and follow-up mammography.</p><p>The institute's draft guideline addressing the diagnosis and treatment of advanced breast cancer recommends that the "use of continued trastuzumab in patients with progressive metastatic disease should be investigated". It notes a lack of evidence about "whether continuing trastuzumab is effective in prolonging survival in HER2-positive patients who develop progressive disease outside the central nervous system during or after first-line treatment with trastuzumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy".</p><p>The second guideline also recommends randomised, controlled trials to assess whether patients who have had adjuvant trastuzumab should receive further biological response modifiers.</p><p>Among its other recommendations for further research in advanced breast cancer, NICE mentions trials investigating endocrine therapy. "Although there is good evidence to support the use of third-generation aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive tumours, there is little evidence to determine what is the best sequence of alternative hormone treatments when they progress," the institute says.</p><p>Different sequences of chemotherapy should also be researched, NICE says. Additionally, "the problem of how best to manage uncontrolled local disease is very poorly addressed by the current evidence". For this latter research recommendation, the institute suggests a national register might be useful.</p>
