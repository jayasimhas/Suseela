<p>Dr Benjamin Zycher, one of the authors of a recent Manhattan Institute report debunking the idea that most drug innovation comes from publicly funded research (such as that from the US NIH) continues to be criticised by Dr Marcia Angell of Harvard University. The report was issued last month (<i>Scrip</i> No 3376, p 4).</p><p>She argues in a rebuttal to a commentary by Dr Zycher in the Wall Street Journal that large drug companies that license or otherwise acquire discoveries from universities or small biotech companies, then develop them for commercial production and sponsor the clinical research necessary for FDA approval "are hardly creative in the scientific sense".</p><p>She takes issue with Dr Zycher's statements that the private-sector contribution to pharmaceutical science is immense and indispensable. She states in her Journal rebuttal that she has her own interpretation of the review of 35 drugs and drug classes that were the most commonly prescribed in 2007 and/or were cited in academic literature as the most important.</p><p>Specifically she is not impressed that Dr Zycher found that of the 35 drugs he reviewed, private sector research was responsible for central advances in basic science for seven. "That's not much of a yield," she argues.</p><p>According to Dr Angell, the examples of innovation cited by Dr Zycher and colleagues date back to the 1980s or earlier. "Nearly every top-selling drug today has progenitors dating back many years, often based on NIH-funded research in universities," she states.</p><p>"The problem with this sequence &ndash; publicly-funded innovation handed off to the drug companies &ndash; is that the industry expects to be rewarded as though it were the source of innovation, pricing drugs as high as the traffic will bear and doing everything possible to extend its exclusive marketing rights," she concludes. "The only really innovative thing about this industry today is the claims of its apologists."</p><p>In his commentary, Dr Zycher claims that research conducted at NIH tends to be concentrated in the basic science of disease biology, while private-sector research is weighted heavily toward applied science, or discovering ways to exploit the findings of basic science. In this way, the efforts are complementary.</p><p>He states: "Among our 35 drugs and drug classes, our study found that private-sector research was responsible for central advances in basic science for seven; in applied science for 34; and in the development of drugs yielding improved clinical applications and/or manufacturing protocols for 28."</p><p>He stands by his statement that all or almost all of the drugs discussed would not have been developed or, at best, would have been delayed significantly in the absence of scientific or technical contributions of big pharma.</p>
