<p>Astellasmight have warned about a tough year ahead at the time its year-end results were announced in May, but all things considered the company got off to a reasonable start in the first quarter, overcoming currency losses and the April price cut in Japan to post modest overall growth. But some new questions have appeared over the development of its Factor Xa inhibitor YM150.</p><p>Total group sales came in 3% up on last year's period at &yen;254.5 billion ($2.35 billion), despite the stronger yen wiping out &yen;10.3 billion in gains. Top product Prograf (tacrolimus) managed to grow despite the expiry of its US patent in April, global sales of the immunosuppressant (including exports) rising by 6% to &yen;52.2 billion in the three months to June 30th, helped by new uses in Japan.</p><p>While Prograf's North American sales slipped by 8% in yen terms, they rose by 7% to $213 million in US dollars, helped by a 93% share of the North American calcineurin inhibitor market for new liver transplants, the company said. A generic version has yet to be launched in the US.</p><p>Although sales were still modest at &yen;17.8 billion, the star growth performer was the overactive bladder therapy Vesicare (solifenacin), which surged by 35% worldwide, helped by increases in all major markets.</p><table class="articleViewTable"><h2>Astellas's 1st Quarter Main Product Sales (&yen; bn)</h2><tbody><tr><td width="25%"><p>Product</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>N America</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>% chg</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>Europe</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>% chg</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>Japan</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>% chg</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="25%"><p>Funguard/Mycamine</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>0.9</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>n/c</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>&ndash;</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash;</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>3.0</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash;10</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="25%"><p>Harnal</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>&ndash;</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash;</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>7.1</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash; 5</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>9.2</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash; 8</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="25%"><p>Prograf</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>22.3</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash; 8</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>18.1</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+26</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>7.1</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+20</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="25%"><p>Protopic</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>2.1</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+ 5</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>1.5</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+13</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>0.7</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>&ndash; 1</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="25%"><p>Vesicare</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>7.3</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+11</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>5.6</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+34</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="13%"><p>4.8</p>&nbsp;</td><td width="12%"><p>+98</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td colspan="7"><p>Japanese sales on a gross basis; all figures Astellas only, excluding licensees. n/c = no change</p></td></tr></table></p><p>Total prescription sales in Japan rose by 4% to &yen;124.8 billion, helped by increases for hypnotic and antidepressant products; the growth came despite the industry-wide price cut and a 3% dip to &yen;24.4 billion for top product Lipitor (atorvastatin, licensed from Pfizer).</p><p>Corporate operating profit for the three months, at &yen;68.2 billion (-5%), was hit by a 43% rise in R&D spending to &yen;40.3 billion. This included a &yen;8 billion licensing fee payment to CoMentis under an April deal for Alzheimer's disease compounds (<i>Scrip</i> Online, April 28th, 2008). Helped by one-off losses and retirement benefit payments in last year's period, net profit increased by 5% to &yen;45.2 billion, yielding earnings per share of &yen;91.49 (+9%).</p><h1>YM150 issues</h1><p>Astellas said that following discussions with Europe's EMEA on data from a Phase IIb trial in venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the Factor Xa inhibitor YM150, it was now planning a new Phase IIb/III trial in the second half of this fiscal year. This will compare once and twice daily dosing in the prevention of VTE after major orthopaedic surgery, and could add to the development timescales for the product.</p><p>A similar comparative trial for prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation is also planned, and the company noted that it was considering the overall development strategy and target indications. Competition in the novel anticoagulant area is rising rapidly, with Bayer/Johnson & Johnson's Xarelto (rivaroxaban) recently recommended in the EU and filed in the US. The product is also in Phase II in the US and Japan/Asia in both settings</p><p>Astellas has also discontinued the US development of a topical cream formulation of tacrolimus for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Newly disclosed entrants to the Phase I pipeline include two cancer compounds from last year's acquisition of Agensys, AGS-16M18 and AGS-8M4, and an in-house immunosuppressant ASP015K.</p>
