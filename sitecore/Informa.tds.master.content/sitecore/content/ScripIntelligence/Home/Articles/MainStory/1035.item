<p>The first Phase II data for Kyorin Pharmaceutical's DPP-4 inhibitor KRP-104 show statistically significant reductions in haemoglobin A1c (HbA<Subscript>1c</Subscript>) levels versus placebo when added to metformin therapy and administered either once or twice a day.</p><p>The compound stems from a 2002 research collaboration with ActivX Biosciences, which led to the Japanese firm acquiring the US drug discovery venture in 2005. ActivX now acts as Kyorin Pharma's US research centre and has continued its development programmes for KRP-104.</p><p>The new top-line results came from a Phase IIa trial in a total of 220 patients in the US and India with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin alone. Mean baseline HbA<Subscript>1c</Subscript> was 7.9%, and the treatment groups received either 120mg of KRP-104 once daily or 60mg twice a day for 12 weeks on top of stable metformin therapy.</p><p>At the end of this period, both treatment arms showed significant reductions in HbA<Subscript>1c</Subscript>, although at 0.64% (p<0.0001) this was higher in the 60mg twice a day group compared with the 0.54% reduction for the 120mg once a day group (p=0.0003). Around 40% of patients in both arms reached the American Diabetes Association's recommended HbA<Subscript>1c</Subscript> target of <7%.</p><p>Both regimens provided greater than 95% inhibition of DPP-4 during the daytime, 60mg twice a day doing so around the clock while once daily dosing provided "considerably less" inhibition overnight, the companies said. There was no significant difference between the KRP-104 groups in terms of HbA<Subscript>1c</Subscript> reduction.</p><p>Against the secondary endpoint of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, this was reduced significantly over placebo in both groups, again with no significant difference between them. Safety and tolerability were "not substantially different" from placebo, the firms said.</p><p>Both Kyorin Pharma and ActivX hailed the results, ActivX's senior director of clinical development Dr Diane Plotkin commenting that the efficacy data was "comparable to the marketed and late stage DPP-4 compounds and supports the dosing flexibility possible with KRP-104". ActivX chairman and president Dr John Kozarich pointed to other studies the firms believe differentiate the compound and support their view that it has best-in-class potential.</p><p>Kyorin Pharma in Japan told <i>Scrip</i> that it expected further elucidation of these benefits to come in future Phase II and III studies, noting that KRP-104 had a favourable profile in terms of potency, safety and dosing flexibility. Following the positive Phase II results, it is now looking for development and commercialisation partners.</p><p>But despite its possible advantages, KRP-104 will be a relative latecomer to the DPP-4 arena, where Merck & Co's Januvia (sitagliptin) and Novartis's Galvus (vildagliptin) have already been commercialised in various forms and indications. Takeda's alogliptin was filed in the US at the end of last year.</p>
