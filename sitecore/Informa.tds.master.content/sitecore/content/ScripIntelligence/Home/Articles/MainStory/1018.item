<p>Gilead Scienceswill need to conduct another clinical trial of its investigational cystic fibrosis treatment aztreonam lysine for inhalation before the drug can be approved, the US FDAhas said.</p><p>In a complete response letter relating to the company's NDA for aztreonam lysine, the FDA said that it could not approve the application in its current form and that an additional clinical study would be required. Gilead said it would continue its dialogue with the agency to determine whether instead further analyses of existing data could lead to approval, or whether the company will need to conduct an additional study as stated in the letter.</p><p>Aztreonam lysine is being developed for people with cystic fibrosis who have <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections. It was filed last November on the basis of results from the AIR-CF1 and AIR-CF2 Phase III studies and interim results from the 12-month open-label Phase III AIR-CF3 trial. The 164-patient AIR-CF1 study and the 247-patient AIR-CF2 study both met their primary endpoints, change from baseline to day 28 in patient-reported respiratory symptoms (AIR-CF1) and time until inhaled or intravenous antibiotics were needed (AIR-CF2). The 274-patient AIR-CF3 trial is an ongoing open-label safety study which enrolled patients who had participated in the AIR-CF1 and AIR-CF2 studies. Interim results presented earlier this year showed that aztreonam lysine was well tolerated and lung function benefits seemed to be sustained for up to 12 months of treatment (<i>Scrip</i> Online, July 3rd, 2008). The study is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p><p>Aztreonam lysine for inhalation is delivered using the e-Flow electronic nebuliser, which uses a vibrating perforated membrane designed to aerosolise liquid medications efficiently and reduce treatment time. Aztreonam is already marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibbas Azactam, an intravenous treatment for Gram-negative infections of the lower respiratory tract, including lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. If approved, inhaled aztreonam lysine would compete with Novartis's Tobi (an inhaled formulation of tobramycin). In addition to the product's US filing, marketing applications have been submitted in the EU and Australia, and Gilead recently initiated a Phase III study comparing aztreonam lysine for inhalation with inhaled tobramycin.</p>
