<p>Innocoll Pharmaceuticalshas licensed its gentamicin surgical implant toBaxter Healthcare, giving Baxter exclusive rights to market and distribute the product in the US.</p><p>Baxter says its implant, a fully-biodegradable, leave-behind surgical sponge containing the antibiotic, will be the first and only one of its kind for preventing and treating surgical site infections (SSIs) in the US. The US agreement with Baxter covers use of the product as adjunctive therapy for preventing and treating SSIs.</p><p>The product is approved in 49 countries and is indicated outside the US as an adjunct to systemic antibiotic therapy for the treatment of localised deep tissue infections and the prevention of SSIs in both hard and soft tissues. The implant is currently in two Phase III trials in the US to support a regulatory submission, which is expected next year.</p><p>The gentamicin surgical implant is expected to give surgeons an option to help reduce the risk of post-operative complications of SSIs, which should in turn help reduce costs. The collagen-based implant, developed using Innocoll's proprietary drug-delivery technology, CollaRx, is saturated with a high concentration of gentamicin, and delivers the drug directly to the target tissue. Because it is biodegradable, the sponge can be left in the body after surgery.</p><p>Currently, surgeons use synthetic polymer beads loaded with gentamicin, such as Biomet Merck's Septopal, or collagen sponge haemostats with gentamicin such as Essex Pharma's Sulmycin implant. However, these require removal approximately 10 days after surgery, and are generally used in hard tissues such as bone where there is a poorer blood supply.</p><p>Innocoll focuses on developing targeted biodegradable surgical implants and topical products to reduce infection. Under the agreement, Baxter will pay a licence fee initially, and milestones. It will contribute to the costs of the Phase III trials and a portion of the registration fees. Innocoll will manage the clinical programmes and the regulatory filing. Baxter expects a pre-tax charge of around $12 million for in-process R&D associated with this transaction in the third quarter.</p><p></p>
