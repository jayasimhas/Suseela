<p>Oxford BioMedica&rsquo;s ProSavin, an investigational gene therapy product for Parkinson's disease, has shown initial benefit in a Phase I/II trial.</p><p>The first three patients in the trial showed improvements three months after ProSavin administration of 23-30% on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale "off" score, which measures the degree of mobility in the absence of dopaminergic therapies, the UK-based company said. The study's independent data monitoring committee has now reviewed the data and recommended that the trial continues, evaluating a higher dose of ProSavin. Further interim results from the study are to be presented at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Bruges in mid-November.</p><p>ProSavin is based on Oxford Biomedica's LentiVector technology, which uses a viral vector to deliver three genes associated with dopamine synthesis to the striatum, converting cells that normally do not produce dopamine into cells that do.</p><p>There is great hope for cell and gene therapies in Parkinson's disease. Although Titan Pharmaceuticals/Bayer Schering Pharma'sSpheramine, a human (retinal pigment epithelial) cell therapy, failed in a Phase II trial earlier this year (<i>Scrip</i> Online, July 7th, 2008), other companies are continuing to examine the potential of gene therapies.</p><p>For example, Ceregene is conducting Phase II trials of CERE-120, which uses a virus delivery system to deliver the gene for neurturin, a neurotrophic factor intended to restore lost motor function and protect against further degeneration, while Genzyme is carrying out Phase I trials on AV-201 (AAV-hAADC-2-003), a virus encoding human aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Neurologix is conducting a Phase II study of a product which seeks to restore the function of the glutamic acid decarboxylase gene, which is responsible for production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p><p></p>
