<p>Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), is retiring from the agency, acting Commissioner Stephen Ostroff and his intended successor, Robert Califf, deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco, confirmed to their staff on Oct. 2, declaring they had "mixed emotions" about her departure.</p><p>Midthun, who has been at the FDA since 1993, where she started as a medical officer, took the reins of CBER in 2010.</p><p>In a memo to FDA employees, Ostroff and Califf said that while Midthun has given her notice, she plans to remain in her job until a successor is chosen "so that she can maintain continuity and 'pass the baton' with minimum loss of momentum." </p><p>They said a search committee was being formed, with more details forthcoming.</p><p>Word in fact got out that Midthun was planning to retire when the FDA posted a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CBER/ucm465247.htm" target="_new">jobs notice</a> on its website on Oct. 1.</p><p>Sascha Haverfield, vice president, science and regulatory advocacy at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, praised Midthun's leadership and said she'd made "important contributions" to the FDA.</p><p>Along with overseeing approvals of biologics, blood products and vaccines and CBER's 1,140 employees, Midthun has played a critical role in the FDA's implementation of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the law that granted the agency the authority to approve biosimilars. </p><p>Midthun has worked hand-in-hand with Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, on the biosimilars implementation committee.</p><p>In an August 2011 <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1107285" target="_new">"Perspectives" article</a>, the two center chiefs, with two other colleagues, acknowledged the challenges they had ahead of them in reconciling the science of biosimilar development with the regulatory framework required by the BPCIA, including establishing the scientific criteria of addressing the key question of "how similar is similar enough when it comes to the substitution of complex biologic drug products in clinical practice."</p><p>The FDA has yet to issue its interchangeability guidance and it's unclear whether the document will be out before Midthun leaves the FDA in December. Woodcock insisted at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Woodcock-FDA-Focused-On-Biosimilars-Science-Before-Policy-360510" target="_new">recent Senate hearing</a> the agency was "working very hard" to get it done. </p><p>Ostroff and Califf praised Midthun's accomplishments as CBER director, including the approvals of vaccines to prevent rotavirus, human papillomavirus, pneumococcal disease and group B meningococcal disease and facilitating the entry of many new influenza vaccine manufacturers into the market.</p><p>While Ostroff and Califf said Midthun is "often reserved in her comments," she came out with guns blazing in an April 2014 op-ed in the <i>Washington Times</i> after the FDA was criticized in the midst of a meningitis B outbreak at Princeton University and the University of California Santa Barbara for "inappropriately" delaying access to and approval of a U.S. vaccine against the disease.</p><p>"This assertion is false," Midthun declared, adding that the FDA "takes its public health responsibilities very seriously" and insisted the health and well-being of patients is the agency's "top priority."</p><p>She emphasized that under the FDA's expanded access program for investigational products, the agency had worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to make Bexsero, which at the time was Novartis AG's product but is now owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc, available "as quickly as possible" for use on the two college campuses. </p><p>Bexsero eventually <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-meningitis-B-vaccine-Bexsero-OKd-in-US-356346" target="_new">won the FDA's approval</a> this past January &ndash; coming about three months after Pfizer Inc. gained the agency's blessing for its meningitis B vaccine shot <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-breakthrough-meningitis-B-vaccine-OKd-beats-Novartis-354744" target="_new">Trumenba</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Profits-didnt-drive-flu-vaccine-decisions-US-officials-356531" target="_new">In February</a>, Midthun tried to defend the FDA in the midst of congressional criticism over the debacle of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-vax-only-23-effective-12-most-adults-356168" target="_new">mismatch</a> of the 2014-15 influenza vaccine and the predominant virus that was circulating during the North American season and why the agency didn't require manufacturers to do a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">mid-course shift</a> when it was recognized early on the H3N2 strain had "drifted." </p><p>"Because of the time required to manufacture influenza vaccine, it would not have been possible to make adequate amounts of influenza vaccine containing the drifted H3N2 virus in time for our peak influenza season, which usually occurs between December and February," Midthun told members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.</p><p>She insisted that in spite of the difficulties inherent in preparing influenza vaccines, there has been great progress, like cell-based influenza vaccines, such as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-wins-1st-cell-culture-flu-vaccine-OK-in-US-with-Flucelvax-337411" target="_new">Flucelvax</a>, which was developed by Novartis but is now owned by CSL Ltd., and Protein Sciences Corp.'s recombinant product <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Protein-Sciences-wins-FDA-OK-for-egg-free-Flublok-339145" target="_new">Flublok</a>.</p><p>Ostroff and Califf also noted Midthun has led CBER through its work in assessing vaccine candidates to respond to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/MerckNewLink-Ebola-vaccine-100-effective-in-Guinea-trial-359726" target="_new">Ebola</a>, a virus that has sickened about 28,000 people and killed more than 11,300 in the current outbreak in West Africa.</p><p>Before joining the FDA, Midthun, who Ostroff and Califf called a "devoted, solid and reliable partner" to everyone at the agency and a "colleague, mentor and friend," was on the faculty of the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, where she was involved in the clinical development of investigational vaccines. She also was an attending physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p><p>Midthun received her bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her medical degree from the George Washington University School of Medicine. She trained as a resident in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital and as a fellow in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. </p><p>Midthun is a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and a member of the American College of Physicians and the American Society for Virology.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
