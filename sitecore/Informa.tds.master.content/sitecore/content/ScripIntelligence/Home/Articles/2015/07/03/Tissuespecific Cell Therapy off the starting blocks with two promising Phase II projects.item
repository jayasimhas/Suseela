<p>Over the past two weeks, little-known UK-based stem cell therapy company Cell Therapy has reported impressive Phase II data with two of its products that target completely unrelated indications &ndash; advanced heart failure and severe tendon injury. CEO Ajan Reginald, previously Roche's global head of emerging technologies, spoke to <i>Scrip</i> about why the company chose to remain under the radar until recently, and of his ambitious plans to get a product onto the market in 2017.</p><p>Very few people will have heard of Cell Therapy, and that is exactly how CEO Mr Reginald planned it. </p><p>"We were absolutely deliberate about our low profile. We started this company with a fundamentally different scientific approach, and also a different approach to how you build a biotech company. We didn't want to make a song and dance about what we were doing. We wanted to let the results speak for themselves."</p><p>And the results have begun to shout.</p><p>On 24 June, Cell Therapy reported an average 24-month (19-29 months) major adverse cardiac event (MACE)-free survival for all 11 patients in its Heartcel Phase II trial studying myocardial regeneration in patients at high risk of incomplete re-vascularization (ICR) undergoing coronary artery bypass fraft (CABG) surgery. This means that in these patients, who were suffering from advanced heart failure, all are still alive after an average of two years versus up to an expected 70% annual mortality rate, and none has suffered cardiac events such as heart attack or stroke.</p><p>The Heartcel trial investigated a new regenerative cell type, the allogeneic iMP cell (immuno-modulatory cell), as an adjuvant to mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with ICR. iMP cells are mesodermal progenitor cells.</p><p>Concomitantly with CABG, iMP cells were injected intra-myocardially into the areas of hypo-kinetic myocardium that bypass grafting would not re-vascularize. SPECT imaging was used pre-operatively to identify iMP injection sites and post-operatively to monitor/measure change in viability and contractility. </p><p>At the original 12-month follow up the trial met all study endpoints, reporting statistical and clinically significant results: MACE-free survival in all patients, improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%, reduced left ventricle (LV) scar size of 40% and improved quality of life of 50%. </p><p>"There are a number of companies that have looked at myocardial regeneration and there is an intrinsic problem that we're all trying to fix: the myocardium doesn't regenerate spontaneously. Following an infarct you end up with scar tissue which significantly impacts the function of the heart. The Holy Grail that people have been looking for is a cellular therapy that can drive regeneration. The focus of our trial was to look at patients with probably the worst possible prognosis, and yet we managed to show this, albeit in a small group of patients," said Mr Reginald. </p><p><b>commercialization plans</b></p><p>Cell Therapy intends to commercialize the product in Europe itself, and is in discussions with regulators with the aim of securing a conditional approval in 2017.</p><p>"We've got a clear commercial strategy which will be to take the product to market ourselves in Europe, as the centers are pretty well defined. There are 31 centers across Europe, and we've got a lot of experience in house on how to launch products and how to do sales and marketing, plus we're adding new folks to the team that we'll be able to announce next month that have got significant experience of how to launch products and running organizations in Europe."</p><p>In the US, Mr Reginald anticipates conducting a Phase III trial ahead of filing. "Once we have secured approval, also planned for 2017, we'll decide on our commercialization strategy there," he said.</p><p><b>tendon repair data</b></p><p>To add to the promising Heartcel data, on 30 June Cell Therapy reported positive Phase II results for Tendoncel, a topical regenerative medicine for severe tendon injury repair. Everything seems to be coming together at the same time for the company. </p><p>"So we have a platform technology, and two products have progressed through clinical trials and what you're seeing is what you'd expect to see from a development-stage company. We've got a few announcements because we've got quite a lot of data coming out at the moment," explained Mr Reginald.</p><p>Tendoncel is a regenerative allogeneic gel that contains a combination of growth factors including; PDGF-BB, VEGF, PDGF-AA, thrombospondin and angiopoietin and can be stored for up to three months.</p><p>The Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial studied Tendoncel in 34 patients suffering from chronic grade 3 lateral epicondylitis, (severe) tendon injury. Patients were treated daily with topical Tendoncel or analogue placebo gel for 21 days, with six week and three month follow-up. The trial endpoint was improvement in tendon injury, assessed with two validated metrics DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) and PRTEE (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation).</p><p>The trial demonstrated a 70% improvement in DASH and a 74% improvement in PRTEE with no serious adverse events and no change in IgE levels (which is an indicator of any potential systemic effects). </p><p>"It's a double-blind placebo controlled study, so exactly what you'd like to see," noted Mr Reginald. "The data is compelling, and we're in discussions with the usual suspects. Commercialization of Tendoncel will have to be via a partnership because it's much too big a market for a small company like us. We're looking at around 30 million patients."</p><p><b>funding</b></p><p>Cell Therapy was founded in 2009 by Professor Martin Evans, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology for his work in discovering stem cells, and Mr Reginald. It was funded initially by its founders. The company's first external fundraising was &pound;691,000 via the crowdfunding site Crowdcube.</p><p>"Crowdfunding was a very tactical move for us. We were in stealth mode and we wanted to bring awareness about regenerative medicine and specifically the potential of myocardial regeneration to a broader population. That was important for us at that stage of development for the company."</p><p>Meanwhile, "Our financial situation is relatively comfortable for at least the next 12 months, and that means we can progress Heartcel through the regulatory pathway, and stay on track for a 2017 launch."</p><p>Mr Reginald is keen to highlight where Cell Therapy's approach differs from other cell therapy companies. "We have a fundamentally different platform. We've got tissue specific cells for different indications. Most stem cell companies have one cell type that they apply to multiple different indications. We've got a fundamentally different approach which is a different cell type for each indication and that's perhaps why we're seeing interesting results."</p><p>In addition to the two programs that are progressing in the clinic, Cell Therapy has about a dozen other specific cell phenotypes that are in preclinical development.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/The-great-biotech-crowdfunding-debate-For-or-against-356684" target="_new">The great biotech crowdfunding debate: For or against?</a></p><p>
