<p><p>After more than a decade of effort and applying advanced math and physics methodology, Verseon Inc. believes it has developed a computer-driven drug discovery platform for small molecules that is a major advance on what has gone before.</p><p><p>"This is not your grandfather's computer-aided drug design (CADD). This is something that can truly drive the design of completely novel compounds on the computer," co-founder and CEO Adityo Prakash said in a Sept. 9 interview.</p><p><p>The company is backing its bold claim by developing its own discovered drugs; initial clinical trials with one of its compounds could start as early as next year, Prakash said. It has three potential products in preclinical studies: a first-in-class thrombin inhibitor that has activity as an anticoagulant and a potential reduced risk of major bleeding, a topical plasma kallikrein inhibitor with potential in the treatment of diabetic macular edema, and an angiogenesis inhibitor that unlike marketed products with a similar mode of action does not target vascular endothelial growth factor or other growth-related kinases.</p><p><p>Verseon expects to license out promising compounds to partners at progressively later stages of development.</p><p><p>Validation for its drug design process comes from the company's initial public offering on the UK's junior market AIM in May that raised $100m and attracted well-known investors including Neil Woodford. </p><p><p>Prakash said he became interested in the long-term outlook of a number of UK investors, and that led to having an lPO in the UK rather than the US. "We are not ruling out a US listing, but we are not keen on quarterly reporting at this stage," he explained.</p><p><h2>Aims To Be A Pharma Company</h2><p><p>Like other platform technology companies that have gone before, Verseon aims to become a fully-fledged pharmaceutical company, similar to other platform technology-based biotechs like MorphoSys AG and Evotec AG that have mixed having a proprietary pipeline with their work for other pharmaceutical companies. </p><p><p>The US company already has fully integrated biology and animal study labs and just purchased a new facility in California to bring under one roof its researchers who are currently scattered across Silicon Valley.</p><p><p>According to Prakash, Verseon's computer-driven platform can design new molecules that are unlikely to be discovered by traditional means, in large numbers and with a diversity of structures and properties. "The pharmaceutical industry currently works with a few million compounds, which is a small puddle compared with the vast ocean of possible compounds," he noted.</p><p><p>"We also generate compounds and structures with a recipe on how to make them, unlike others in the field that can't make the structures they come up with," Prakash said. "We are able to model interactions with a level of accuracy that is simply not touchable by anything else," he added.</p><p><p>When modelling a drug binding to a receptor, it becomes a physics problem and one that Verseon has solved by coming up with algorithms that keeps the issue tractable. Verseon is able to explore structures in 3D, and show how they flex and interact with water at the molecular level. Prakash and other Verseon co-founders have previously developed video compression technology, and the common theme between that and drug design is "math and physics," Prakash said.</p><p><p>The company wants to build a portfolio of potential small molecule drugs targeting a number of therapeutic areas, with multiple candidates in each indication.</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
