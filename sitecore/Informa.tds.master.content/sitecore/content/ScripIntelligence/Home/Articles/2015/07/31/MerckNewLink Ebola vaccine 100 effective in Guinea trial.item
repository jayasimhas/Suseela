<p>Early results of an experimental Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck and its partner NewLink, which licensed the product from the Canadian government, showed the candidate, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was 100% effective in protecting humans against the virus in a Phase III ring study being conducted in Guinea, researchers reported in the medical journal <i>The Lancet</i> on 31 July.</p><p>The results of the trial, said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, suggest a potential role for the firm's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the fight against Ebola, which has infected about 28,000 people, killing nearly 11,300.</p><p>The trial, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-ring-study-starts-in-Guinea-357504" target="_new">got underway</a> on 1 April and was supported and led by the World Health Organization (WHO), tested the vaccine in over 7,500 participants in Guinea. The data suggested the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine protected adults potentially exposed to Ebola as early as 10 days after being vaccinated, the researchers said.</p><p>The data also showed the vaccine continued to be safe.</p><p>As a ring trial, the results also suggested that unvaccinated people may be indirectly protected from Ebola &ndash; the first evidence of such a result.</p><p>The strategy consists of identifying recently infected patients and vaccinating all their contacts and the contacts of the contacts &ndash; thereby creating a "ring of immunity" around them to stop the virus from spreading, according to WHO.</p><p>It was the same approach used in eradicating smallpox in the 1970s.</p><p>"The initial result is exciting; the initial result is promising," declared Dr Margaret Chan, director-general at WHO.</p><p>"The data are very impressive and we're all very pleased that the results turned out this way," Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>But he also said there are still some questions that need to be answered, "particularly about the durability of the effect and what the effect would be in a population if you preemptively vaccinate people and over how long a period of time you can protect them."</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr Fauci said, "in the context of the study as it was done, we're all very pleased with the results because they're very impressive."</p><p>He noted the results of the WHO Guinea trial &ndash; Ebola &ccedil;a Suffit, or Ebola this is Enough &ndash; have implications for the ongoing National Institutes of Health PREVAIL study, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-vaccines-safe-but-quandary-for-Liberia-efficacy-enrollment-357521" target="_new">reported positive Phase II results in March</a>.</p><p>PREVAIL is testing the Merck-NewLink vaccine and also one developed by NIAID and GlaxoSmithKline. It had the goal of enrolling 27,000 people. </p><p>The first portion of PREVAIL, which got underway in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">February</a>, was conducted in Liberia. </p><p>The study <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NIH-Ebola-vaccines-trial-meets-1500-enrollment-goal-358247" target="_new">met its Phase II enrollment goal</a> in May of 1,500.</p><p>But because the virus had waned &ndash; with that nation actually declared Ebola-free in May, before a handful of patients again developed the disease in that country in June &ndash; the NIH research team decided it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Liberia-studys-27000-enrollment-no-longer-makes-sense-357890" target="_new">didn't make sense</a> to continue the study there and sought to move it to Guinea, where it now has permission to start the Phase III portion.</p><p>But Dr Fauci said the start of the Phase III portion of PREVAIL will depend on what the rate of infection is in Guinea and how the NIH study will be done in the context of the knowledge about the efficacy of the WHO-sponsored trial reported on 31 July.</p><p>"So I think the investigators will have to sit down, analyze the data and make some decisions about how to proceed," Dr Fauci said. "But those decisions have not been made yet." </p><p><b>Details</b></p><p>The WHO-sponsored ring trial is being conducted in Basse-Guinea, which was the only area in the West African country with new Ebola cases at the start of the study.</p><p>When a new Ebola case was diagnosed, the researchers traced all individuals who may have been in close contact with this first person. </p><p>Adult contacts 18 years or older and not pregnant or breastfeeding were offered the vaccine. </p><p>If consent was given, adults in the ring were randomised to receive the vaccine immediately or 21 days after randomization.</p><p>Vaccinated volunteers were then visited at home on days 3, 14, 21, 42, 63, and 84 after vaccination to record any adverse events.</p><p>The results showed 100% protection of Ebola in the 90 clusters who received either immediate or delayed vaccine of a single intramuscular injection of VSV-ZEBOV 10 days after randomization.</p><p>The researchers noted that while there were no cases of Ebola recorded 10 days after randomization in the immediate group, there were 16 cases in the delayed vaccination clusters.</p><p>A secondary analysis of the trial suggested that ring vaccination also reduced the risk of contracting EVD for non-vaccinated individuals in the clusters. </p><p>The overall effectiveness of the vaccine in adults, including both those who consented to vaccination and those who did not, was 75% against Ebola. </p><p>The researchers also said that in all members of the clusters, including non-vaccinated children and pregnant women, the risk of testing positive for Ebola was reduced by about 76%.</p><p>A <i>Lancet e</i>ditorial accompanying the study details noted the Guinea ring trial would be the "subject of intense scientific scrutiny and debate" about what the results mean for those most at risk of Ebola in West Africa, and insisted that more data on efficacy were needed before the Merck-NewLink product could be widely deployed.</p><p>Merck noted that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has been administered to more than 9,000 people in Phase I, II and III trials.</p><p>In addition to the Guinea ring and PREVAIL trials, rVSV-ZEBOV is being tested in other trials, including one in Sierra Leone being run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/25m-US-funded-study-goes-beyond-testing-Ebola-vaccine-357889" target="_new">STRIVE</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
