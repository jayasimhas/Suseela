<p>The lawmakers behind the 21st Century Cures initiative waited until the day before a House Energy & Commerce hearing on the topic to unveil their revised version of a draft legislative package, which quickly grabbed attention by calling for a $10bn funding boost over the next five fiscal years for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) &ndash; the thought of which could do nothing but have the agency's chief overjoyed.</p><p>Indeed, Dr Francis Collins has made several trips to Capitol Hill over his nearly six-year tenure as NIH's director where he has pleaded almost nonstop about the agency's plight of being short-funded &ndash; often telling lawmakers "some of the best science is being left on the table" because of the lack of dollars to carry it forward.</p><p>But while Dr Collins has openly yearned for an increase in his budget, which currently is about $31bn, he also knows that wish must be granted by House and Senate appropriators &ndash; the lawmakers that hold the power over the federal government's purse &ndash; who may have other ideas about how to spend taxpayers' dollars come budget funding agreement time.</p><p>Dr Collins even acknowledged during a "fireside" chat at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this past <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Path-to-cures-More-unfunded-FDA-NIH-mandates-356150" target="_new">January</a> that while Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan) &ndash; who has led the 21st Century Cures effort, along with Congresswoman Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) &ndash; has been "sympathetic to the idea of providing more resources," the panel he leads, the Energy and Commerce Committee, only has the power to authorize funds, not appropriate them.</p><p>But putting the funding request in the 199-page revised draft at least addresses the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Warren-picks-fight-with-Cures-author-over-NIH-funding-357475" target="_new">criticism</a> Senator Elizabeth Warren has been doling out since the release of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">initial draft</a> version of the Cures legislative package in January &ndash; which was void of how the measures would be paid for that were being proposed.</p><p>A day before Representatives Upton and DeGette revealed their latest version of the Cures draft, Senator Warren <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">again called out</a> lawmakers for not sufficiently funding the NIH &ndash; declaring "It is irresponsible and shortsighted, not prudent, to let financing for basic research dwindle."</p><p>"Medical research funding in this country is in crisis," Senator Warren said during a 28 April hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which launched efforts in January on a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">companion to Cures</a>. </p><p>She noted that many of the drugs on the US market today are based on scientific insights gained through the NIH or other publicly funded research &ndash; a remark for which Dr Christopher Austin, director of the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, said was indeed "a fact."</p><p>At that same hearing, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said that when her agency &ldquo;receives a large number of unfunded mandates, our attention can be diverted and review performances suffer.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s unclear how Cures will pay for the FDA-related provisions.</p><p>Dr Woodcock also pleaded "don't break what is working," but instead, "improve on the current system" when lawmakers consider the actions to better enable the progress of US biomedical innovation.</p><p>Dr Woodcock is slated to again testify before the House E&C at a 30 April hearing about the 21st Century Cures initiative &ndash; something she's done quite a few times since its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Time-to-go-big-on-cures-innovation-lawmakers-declare-351611" target="_new">launch last year</a>.</p><p>NIH's Dr Kathy Hudson, deputy director for science, outreach and policy, also is scheduled to speak at the hearing.</p><p>Along with funding, likely big topics of interest for both Drs Woodcock and Hudson will be the measures aimed at making it easier to repurpose drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions; modernizing clinical trials; breaking down barriers to increased collaboration and data sharing among patients, researchers, providers and innovators; and advancing the development precision medicines &ndash; the latter of which President Barack Obama has taken a personal interest and has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharmas-summoned-to-White-House-for-precision-med-reveal-356435" target="_new">launched his own initiative</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
