<p> Geno Germano is group president of Pfizer's Global Innovative Pharma Business, the unit focused on development, registration and commercialization of novel medicines. He is co-chair of the portfolio strategy and investment committee, which aims to maximize the return on R&amp;D investment across the Pfizer portfolio. Germano also manages Pfizer's global health and value function, which works to demonstrate the value of innovation and supports access to Pfizer's medicines. In the latest edition of <i>Scrip's</i> executive profile series, he tells Sukaina Virji of his childhood propensity for hard work, how youthful impatience led him to a successful career in the pharmaceutical industry, and the influence of culture on effectiveness. </p> <p> <p> <img src="-/media/6184A39BFC3D4D789DF90F3ED0C5E5DA.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>Geno Germano</i> </p> <p> <p> <i><b>Sukaina Virji:</b></i><b> How did you get into this leadership position? </b> </p> <p> <i><b>Geno Germano:</b></i> I started my career as a pharmacist. I went to pharmacy school and I was really excited by understanding how medicines can influence disease processes and improve patients' lives and I've been pretty excited ever since that early part of my career. I'm also the kind of person that's wired to focus on results - I'm a pretty results oriented individual, and I'm very competitive. So when you put those three things together: a fascination for science and what it can do for patients, a results orientation, and a competitiveness, you can kind of see how I got into the pharmaceutical business. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> What was your first ever job?</b> </p> <p> <b>GG:</b> My mother likes to say that I've been working since I was seven years old. She seems to be concerned about that for some reason but I was the kid in the neighborhood who was cutting the next-door neighbors' lawn and shoveling snow from my neighbors' driveways to make a couple of bucks. Then throughout high school I had all kinds of jobs, and through college, until I got into my profession. So I have been really working my whole life. I'm motivated to achieve and that was always part of finding ways to satisfy my drive. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> What was your first ever job in the pharma industry?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> I started in pharma in sales. After I got out of pharmacy school I decided I didn't want to be a pharmacist. I went to graduate school and decided I didn't want to do research. I finally figured out that it was that combination of a love of the science and medicine but also a strong interest in business and that led me to the pharmaceutical industry, and frankly as an entry level professional, sales was the best option for me to get started. I started as a sales representative for a pharma company back in 1984. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Why was a career in research not for you?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> When I was in graduate school I just felt very impatient and while I knew that I liked learning about science, doing science was completely different and it required a level of patience and a long-term perspective that I maybe I was too young and immature for. I did love to know the science but actually working in the lab and working out a problem for what could be a very long time without getting a result was something that left me looking for something more or something different. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Pharma is all about the long game. Are you a more patient person now? </b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> I hope so, now that I've spent 30 years in the business and raised four children. I am a little more patient today. Maybe I should go back to graduate school! </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Did you know from that first sales job that it would form the basis of the rest of your career?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> It's funny but yes. I went to pharmacy school because I really was drawn to pharmacy and I loved it at school; I thought it was fantastic and I was fascinated by what I was learning. But the practice of pharmacy just left me unsatisfied and then of course I went to graduate school and I found myself unsatisfied again, so I was starting to get worried that there was something wrong with me. But when I got into the industry and I got into sales and I could put my knowledge of pharmacology and medicine together, with my energy and drive to perform, it was really the right combination for me and it set me off on a career that's now spanned 30 years and a dozen or so different jobs in different parts of the world. It's just been a phenomenally satisfying experience. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> So you joined Pfizer through the Wyeth acquisition, having spent time at J&amp;J prior to that. What were the highlights at each company?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> Actually I was with Wyeth, then I was at J&amp;J, then I went back to Wyeth, and then I came to Pfizer. So it was kind of the three companies. </p> <p> Wyeth was what I would consider a medium sized company, and over the time that I was there it went through a lot of change, there was a lot of growth by acquisition. It went from a small pharma company to more medium sized then to maybe an upper middle sized company. Because we were integrating different companies into one there was a lot of work that went into standardizing processes and there was a little bit of an underdog mentality at Wyeth. We were always trying to get better and always trying to keep up with the big guys in the industry, so I always felt like it was a building process. We took a lot of pride in getting better and better all the time and bringing important medicines to the marketplace. It was a very disciplined organization, it always seemed like resources were relatively scarce so there was a lot of fact based decision making, a lot of discipline in spending and investing, a little bit of risk aversion I would say. </p> <p> <p> When I went to J&amp;J, the thing I remember most is that it was such a large organization: multiple companies, decentralized. I learned how to work in a more matrixed kind of environment and the value of networking and connecting with people in various parts of the company who could help you or whom you could help. I think those skills have been incredibly helpful for me since then. </p> <p> <p> And then coming to Pfizer, which is another large organization, has given me the opportunity to become more aspirational &ndash; and a little bit more risk taking occurs at Pfizer. Pfizer is a major player in the industry globally, so there is much greater interaction with stakeholders throughout the healthcare system than I had with my previous experiences: governments, major foundations, different stakeholders. Everybody wants to know what Pfizer thinks when something happens in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, so from a policy standpoint I've grown in that dimension since being at Pfizer. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Could you tell me about a change that you have effected at Pfizer that you believe has been invaluable to Pfizer?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> One change that we've made in the company over the last couple of years is to create an organization within Pfizer called Global Health and Value, and this is really in recognition of the growing importance of being able to understand and communicate the scientific and clinical value of our products in a more financial way to help payers and governments understand the value that our medicines are bringing. We're getting better and better at that. We have integrated various components of the company that were involved in various elements of the value equation, so health economics, health outcomes, research, real world data and analytics, market access experts, and brought them together in a more integrated fashion. This way we can take a more organized approach to both understanding the value of our medicines and also describing and articulating this to other stakeholders, and then incorporate our understandings of value in terms of decisions that we make about how we develop new medicines. I've been one of the leaders here at Pfizer who was instrumental in making that pretty important change. </p> <p> <p> I've come to really appreciate the influence of culture on effectiveness, particularly in large organizations like the ones that I've worked in, at Wyeth, J&amp;J and Pfizer, and I spend a lot of time now, focusing on trying to build the culture and creating a culture where people feel that it's safe to take risks, that they can exercise aspirational thinking and strive to achieve more than is expected without the feeling of fear that if they don't achieve their aspiration that they've failed. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Who has been your biggest influence and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> That's an interesting question. I can't think of a single individual. I'm the type of person that likes to really study people and try to understand what makes them tick and what makes them great, and clearly there are many different sizes and shapes and styles of successful leaders in the world and in business and government and politics. I've learned things from everyone, from my parents to school teachers to senior executives in our industry and in other industries and I take a lot of interest in what makes different leaders successful. It's also led me to find comfort in knowing that there's not a one size fits all way of doing things and what's important is that you understand what your tools are, what your strengths are, what helps you be successful, and that you apply that as effectively as you can. Also, that you are equally as aware of things that you're not the strongest at and that you accommodate that through the people that you hire and the people that you work with and the people that you bring into your decision making. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Is there any piece of standout advice that you've been given that you really felt resonated with you?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> Maybe two things. One would be that it's a long game and sometimes you're going to win and sometimes you might not be at the front of the pack, but tomorrow offers another opportunity. So think about it being more of a marathon than a sprint, and I think in conjunction with that is this idea of being willing to take a chance. Set a big goal and imagine things beyond what you think might be possible and you might just get there if you allow yourself to aspire for more; but if you don't allow yourself to think beyond the expected then you'll never really achieve more than would be expected. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> What have been your proudest moments, personally and professionally?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> Personally, I'm very proud of my family. My wife and I just celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary and we have four children. That's where I get all of my pride on a personal side. Professionally, there have been lots of things that I've been proud of doing. Bringing products that can really change peoples' lives make you feel great, but there's one that maybe stands out and that is, we developed a vaccine that prevents pneumococcal disease in children (Prevnar 13), and until we developed that vaccine pneumococcal disease was the leading cause of childhood mortality in the world. The vaccine was very successful in all of the countries that bought it for their population but there were many countries that couldn't afford to buy it. We were able to do a program with GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, to bring this vaccine to the underdeveloped world and now we've provided hundreds of millions of doses to children around the world and prevented tens of thousands of deaths that would have occurred had this vaccine not become available. It's just incredibly satisfying to know that and to be part of it. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> If you weren't a pharma executive what do you think you'd be?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> I think if I wasn't in pharma I would still be in healthcare doing something that relates to improving peoples' lives. I almost can't imagine not having that as part of what I do because it gives me so much satisfaction and enrichment in my life. I like the business side, I like to achieve goals and to make numbers, but doing it in a business that you feel that you're improving peoples' lives and their health and wellbeing gives you a level of reward that goes way beyond what you can achieve from a business perspective. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> What are the biggest changes that you expect to see in the industry over the next ten or twenty years?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> Technology is clearly going to make significant change to healthcare. Many technology companies are getting involved in healthcare today. Whether it's sensor technology that can help monitor progress that patients are making or devices that directly influence peoples' ability to overcome disabilities or technology related to data capture and data analysis that lead to better understanding about how effective therapies are, I think that the development of all of these technologies and big data and data analytics are going to lead to much greater efficiency and effectiveness of medicines and other healthcare interventions that will enable us to achieve better outcomes at lower costs. Things are going to be profoundly different in even five years from now compared to today. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>SV:</b></i><b> Can you tell me one myth about the industry that you would like to set straight?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>GG:</b></i> There's a feeling that all the medicines are priced too high and I think that that's a myth. It's a complex situation related to the cost of medicines and the value that medicines bring and it's complicated by the fact that the impact that medicines can have on patients and the costs associated with treating patients, the cost of the medicine occurs at one point in time and the value or the benefit can extend over a much longer period of time and so this creates a situation where it can seem like there's a high cost but there's a less visible benefit. </p> <p> There's another component where innovation requires an incentive. If there isn't an opportunity to benefit from the risk that you take to innovate then we're going to have a lot less innovation, so the cost of medicines is also influenced by the need to have incentives for innovation, and the payoff for society is that we do innovate and we do bring new therapies and we do advance the standard of care. There are these different time elements and dynamics that make the cost and the pricing of medicines seem hard to understand. It creates the misunderstanding sometimes that all these medicines cost too much, and I don't think that's the case. </p> <p>
