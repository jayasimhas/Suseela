<p>Hot on the heels of Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generics business, Hikma Pharmaceuticals has agreed to buy US generics firm Roxane Laboratories from Boehringer Ingelheim in a deal worth around $2.65bn, making Hikma "the sixth largest generics company" by revenue in the US. "The US generics market is currently a very attractive place to be," Hikma's CEO Said Darwazah told <i>Scrip</i>. "If you want to grow fast, there is no other market that can provide you with this kind of opportunity."</p><p>Under the agreement, London-listed Hikma will pay $1.18bn in cash and issue 40 million new Hikma shares to Boehringer. This represents around a 16.71% stake in Hikma, which was founded in Jordan. Based on an agreed issue price for the new shares of &pound;23.50 each and current exchange rates, the value of the deal is $2.65bn. Hikma has also agreed to make contingent cash payments of up to $125m, subject to certain performance milestones.</p><p>The deal adds significant breadth to Hikma's US portfolio, bringing 88 new products in specialized and niche segments of the market, including oncology, respiratory, extended release and controlled substances. It also adds 89 R&D projects to Hikma's pipeline, including 57 Paragraph IV products, 13 of which are first-to-file opportunities. The deal includes a manufacturing facility in Ohio.</p><p>According to Mr Darwazah, Boehringer's equity stake "reflects a shared conviction in the future growth potential of Hikma" and allows Boehringer to focus on growing its global core businesses, an industry trend of late.</p><p>"We're targeting Roxane revenue of $725m to $775m in 2017 and an EBITDA margin of around 35% over the medium-term," he added. </p><p>The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in 2016 and "very strongly accretive" in 2017.</p><p>"I am pleased to be strengthening our relationship with Boehringer. We acquired Bedford Laboratories from them in 2014."</p><p>Hikma <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hikma-to-buy-Ben-Venues-Bedford-Labs-for-up-to-300m-352041" target="_new">bought Bedford</a> Laboratories for $225m up front and a potential $75m in contingent cash payments.</p><p>Michael Raya, CEO of West-Ward, Hikma's wholly-owned subsidiary in the US, said: "Roxane is highly complementary to our existing US business. Today we are a market leader in generic injectables with a large and increasingly differentiated product portfolio. The acquisition of Roxane will significantly strengthen our non-injectables business."</p><p>"This is a great opportunity for Roxane to continue to build on its position in the global generics market as part of a fast growing company that has a primary focus on generics. Boehringer is confident that this transaction can better support the already successful Roxane business to realize its growth potential," added Professor Andreas Barner, chairman of Boehringer. </p><p>Boehringer had a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Boehringer-Ingelheim-jolted-in-2014-358015" target="_new">challenging 2014</a>, reported a decline in sales and after-tax profits after suffering the indignity of having to settle medical liability litigation over its anticoagulant Pradaxa while maintaining it would have won in court. The negative publicity damaged sales of Pradaxa. The company was also blindsided by pricing pressures in the US that affected many in the sector.</p><p>In April, Professor Barner was quoted saying the company was still considering the options for its US Roxane Laboratories OTC business, which "lacks critical mass", but that it had not yet decided whether to build that critical mass or to divest the business.</p><p><b>acquisition target?</b></p><p>With consolidation rife in the generics sector, surely Hikma is fighting off numerous suitors.</p><p>"Hikma has always been a very attractive acquisition candidate," stated Mr Darwazah. "In the beginning it was our MENA business that a lot of companies were interested in. Then of course our injectables business became very attractive. Now we look attractive again. But for us it has always been about focusing on our business and making sure it grows. We don't build it with the idea that we want to sell it. I always said that as long as &ndash; as a family &ndash; we can continue doing that, and getting value for our shareholders, and having fun doing it, then there is no sense in selling the business."</p><p>Where will the sixth largest US generics firm (by revenue) go from here?</p><p>"We've always looked at Hikma as a global business, and we'd like it to remain a global business," said Mr Darwazah. "We have three wonderful businesses and we've tried our best over the years to keep them more or less equally sized. Sometimes we might buy something and the injectables grow, now we have a chance to grow the generics. So we need to focus on keeping ourselves a global business."</p><p>In the emerging markets and the MENA, Hikma is looking for "small bolt-on acquisitions, but we're also doing a lot of greenfield operations." It is also in the process of setting up manufacturing facilities in Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. In addition, "We are looking at different markets like Russia and Indonesia to see if we can establish new businesses there."</p>
