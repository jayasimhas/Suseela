<p>EU regulators have sketched out the future challenges facing the European regulatory network and its stakeholders over the coming five years and more, and have come up with solutions aimed at allowing innovation to be fostered while protecting public health and pursuing greater global collaboration and the wider adoption of common standards.</p><p>In their draft "Network Strategy to 2020", the European Medicines Agency and the Heads of Medicines Agencies enumerate a list of challenges facing regulators, such as the increase in antimicrobial resistance, the growth in chronic diseases like dementia, and new and emerging threats such as Ebola. </p><p>They also look at regulatory responses to developments in science in the form of personalized medicine, adaptive pathways, and the growing need for closer collaboration with HTA bodies, and in some cases medical device regulators. A key priority is reducing the regulatory burden on the pharmaceutical industry and the administrative burden on regulatory agencies, while working more closely with those it regulates.</p><p>The draft, which is out for public consultation until 30 June, is described as "a single strategy for the entire network to reflect the need for a coordinated approach to address the multiple challenges that face the network". It is intended as a high-level strategy concentrating on the key overarching priorities for the next five years, with more detail to be given in separate multi-annual work plans for both the EMA and the HMA.</p><p>The network strategy is broken down into four broad themes.</p><h2>Contributing to human health</h2><p>This section looks at facilitating the development of novel medicines and improving access to them, while promoting public health, in a world where the costs and complexity of new drugs are increasing and society is asking for more timely access to them.</p><p>"To enable promising new medicines to get to patients at the earliest opportunity requires us to explore flexible licensing pathways and a life-span approach with clinical drug development, licensing, reimbursement, use in clinical practice and monitoring viewed as a continuum," it says, in a clear reference to the EMA's adaptive pathways pilot.</p><p>It says the network will need to take the adaptive pathways initiative forward, review the outcome of the exercise, and promote ways of ensuring timely access to new medicines. Key to access will be the strengthening of collaboration with health technology assessment/pricing and reimbursement bodies, as well as healthcare groups, in order to share information and seek appropriate decision making. </p><p>While acknowledging that HTA/P&R processes themselves are not part of the network's remit, it points out that they play an important role in fostering innovation, and that efforts are under way to "bring convergence in the assessment of therapeutic added value of new medicines and patient outcomes".</p><p>But it is aware of the importance of preserving the separation between the two kinds of assessment: "The network will strengthen the collaboration with HTA/ pricing and reimbursement bodies taking into account the discrete roles regulators and HTA/pricing and reimbursement bodies have in bringing medicines to patients."</p><p>More effort will also be needed to incorporate patients' values and preferences into the scientific review process "which could influence benefit risk decision making across the network," the document says.</p><p>Looking at how the regulatory network currently functions, and at the growing importance of regulatory science, it calls for regulators to work more closely with the academic community, industry and other stakeholders. Different countries have different regulatory capacities, it says, noting that "in our networked approach to regulation NCAs rely on each other&rsquo;s work in the centralised, decentralised and mutual recognition procedure, EU-wide pharmacovigilance procedures, and inspections and on a voluntary basis for clinical trials. The network must ensure that all NCAs that participate in a specific type of regulatory activity continue to have the capability to do so."</p><p>The transparency and use of clinical trial data has of course been high on the EU agenda for some years now. With the EMA&rsquo;s policy on proactive publication of clinical data, and the new Clinical Trials Regulation whose provisions will apply from the middle of 2016, the document says "the EU has set a global example for increased transparency but the network will need to consider extending this level of transparency to all of its work whilst keeping personal data and truly commercially confidential information out of the public domain". </p><p>In future the network will look at situations where individual patient-level data from trials could be used in benefit-risk based decision-making. It will also explore the potential of big data and the use of anonymized data from health records to inform the way medicines are monitored once on the market. "Such real world databases have the potential to pick up and analyse safety issues and potentially provide information about effect sizes in a real world setting and in sub populations much more quickly, allowing regulators to take action at an earlier stage." </p><p>The network also needs to take steps to facilitate the development of and access to new antibiotics, particularly for resistant infections, from both the human and veterinary angles. It will also look at specific areas that could benefit from future regulatory initiatives, particularly populations with specific needs such as children and the elderly, and those with rare diseases, where horizon scanning for potential orphan drugs could be of benefit. The network will need to be able to better respond to public health emergencies like Ebola.</p><h2>Optimizing the operation of the network</h2><p>With pressure growing on human and financial resources, and an ever greater workload, the sustainability of the regulatory network is a key challenge over the coming years. </p><p>The strategy document says that sustainable, high-quality scientific and regulatory expertise is what the network must have at its fingertips if progress is to be made in regulatory science. It must have efficient and cost-effective procedures, and must minimize "as much as possible the administrative burden for [the] pharmaceutical industry commensurate with public and animal health".</p><p>Efforts have been made over the past years to reduce the regulatory burden on stakeholders and the administrative burden on NCAs, but "there are still demands by the pharmaceutical industry for further work to be undertaken in this field", the strategy document notes. "Therefore, the network will consider further optimisation of the regulatory framework within the current legislative provisions." If the need for further legislative change is identified, it will need to reflect on how this could be best taken forward. Whatever happens, "reducing administrative burden should not lead to a situation whereby the quality of the scientific work is affected which would compromise either human or animal health".</p><p>The network will also need the skills needed to assess innovative therapies of the future and new methodologies to support clinical trial activities, and to address the challenges resulting from meta-data analysis. Organization of available expertise needs to be improved to avoid duplication of work, increase collaboration and allow a more synergistic approach. A key priority &ndash; and one that has been raised on numerous occasions by transparency campaigners &ndash; is to work on achieving the best balance between ensuring the impartiality and independence of experts while making the best use of the scientific expertise within the network.</p><p>The document also raises the question of relations between drug and device regulation, and how far these will need to be drawn closer together in future. Although legislation on medical devices is in the legislative works, there will remain areas, "irrespective of the national situation, where collaboration between medicines regulators and medical devices regulators will have to be strengthened, such as in the field of combination products, companion diagnostics, borderline products, and ancillary medicinal substances". </p><p>The network plans to explore how such collaboration could be reinforced, and depending on the outcome of the discussions on the medical device legislation, "further areas for collaboration with medical devices authorities may be identified, learning from areas of best practice including NCAs who already have joint medicines and devices responsibilities."</p><h2>The global regulatory environment</h2><p>Turning to the wider regulatory scene, the strategy document notes that, in the face of increasing economic constraints, international collaboration can help national regulators to create synergies, avoid duplication and facilitate work and information sharing. It suggests that the EU system could act as something of a template: "Non-EU regulators are increasingly looking to the network for support and capacity building and as a model for their regional harmonisation initiatives."</p><p>Opportunities for the network to contribute to the future shape of international collaboration include new cooperative mechanisms between international regulators such as the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA), the International Pharmaceutical Regulators Forum (IPRF) and the International Generic Drug Regulators Pilot (IGDRP).</p><p>Another area where the document says the EU system is a model to be followed is in generic medicines, where a pilot collaboration mechanism has been launched involving both the decentralized and centralized procedures. "Extending these approaches to innovative medicines should also be explored," it says.</p><p>International collaboration will also be vital in manufacturing, which is now a global business. Industry figures, the draft strategy says, show that about 80% of APIs used in medicines approved in Europe are made outside the EU, and that a significant percentage of finished drugs are imported. Sharing information and ensuring the same standards are applied irrespective of manufacturing location will help to protect the integrity of the supply chain. </p><p>At another level, free trade agreements such as TTIP, CETA and deals with Japan and Singapore will help to extend reliance on GMP and GCP inspections with those authorities who already apply equivalent standards, "and it is important that the network contributes actively to these discussions". </p><h2>Animal and human health</h2><p>While this section looks mainly at veterinary medicines per se, it also includes a paragraph on the implications of veterinary antibiotics for the treatment of human infections. It says that the network "will continue to work on better understanding the relationship between the use of antimicrobials in animals, the development of antimicrobial resistance and the transmission pathways between animals and man so as to target control measures effectively".</p>
