<p>If 10 drug development firms launched initial public offerings in the US during June and only two biotechnology companies have priced IPOs this month as of 17 July, does that mean the bubble will soon burst and let the air out of the biotech IPO market?</p><p>The month isn't a wash yet. In addition to Chiasma and ProNAi Therapeutics, which became public companies in mid-July, five other drug developers set price ranges this month in anticipation of entering the public market and four firms filed their first set of documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in support of an eventual IPO.</p><p>Chiasma grossed $101.84m from the sale of 6.4m shares at $16 each on 15 July after it set a preliminary price range of $13 to $15 each for 5.36m shares, bringing in $21.4m more than anticipated nine days earlier. The company will use the money to fund US FDA approval and commercialization of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Chiasmas-oral-ocreotide-controls-acromegaly-in-some-patients-356629" target="_new">oral ocreotide</a> for the treatment of acromegaly and to pay for additional clinical trials.</p><p>As often happens in the biotech IPO market, investors rewarded New York and Jerusalem-based Chiasma for taking the company public while its drug candidate is in late stages of development. Chiasma's stock closed 25% above the IPO price at $20 per share on 16 July.</p><p>ProNAi Therapeutics priced 8.1m shares at $17 each on 16 July to gross $137.7m. That's $30.5m more than expected at the high end of the Canadian cancer drug developer's previous $14 to $16 price range. Vancouver, Canada-based ProNAi <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Top-6-US-venture-capital-deals-in-2nd-quarter-352825" target="_new">previously raised</a> $59.5m in Series D venture capital a year ago to fund development of its oncology drugs based on DNA interference.</p><p>The company's stock closed its first day of trading on 16 July at $30.80 &ndash; 81.2% above the IPO price &ndash; but dropped down to $30 on 17 July. </p><p>The average US biotech IPO price during the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-A-US-biotech-IPO-surge-Data-are-mixed-359219" target="_new">first half of 2015</a> was $16.23, but the average first day closing price was $20.16.</p><p>So, who's next in the IPO pipeline? July's other price range-setters were gene therapy developer BioCardia ($12 to $14), extended-release ADHD drug specialist <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Former-Sanofi-CEO-Viehbacher-joins-PureTech-board-three-venture-financings-four-deals-and-a-dropped-drug-356996" target="_new">Neos Therapeutics</a> ($14 to $16), cancer immunotherapy firm NantKwest (formerly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Ten-deals-and-a-breakup-GileadOno-VernalisNovartis-SorrentoNantWorks-and-more-355774" target="_new">Conkwest</a>, $20 to $23), ophthalmology-focused <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-invests-in-EyeGate-uveitis-drug-359385" target="_new">EyeGate Pharmaceuticals</a> ($15 each for 870,000 shares), and Parkinson's disease drug developer Intec Pharma (4.5m shares at $8.36 each).</p><p>The IPO-tracking firm Renaissance Capital expected BioCardia to launch its IPO during the week of 13 to 17 July, but the San Carlos, California-based cardiovascular disease specialist apparently decided to wait a little longer to enter the public market.</p><p>Biotech companies that submitted new IPO filings to the SEC so far in July are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-PhaseBio-closes-40m-Series-C-round-led-by-AstraZeneca-plus-five-other-VC-financings-357270" target="_new">Aimmune Therapeutics</a> (up to $115m), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-17-23-April-2015-358050" target="_new">Oasmia</a> ($23m), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-venture-capital-off-to-a-659m-start-in-2015-355964" target="_new">Global Blood Therapeutics</a> ($115m) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GenSight-takes-phenture-capital-for-A-to-X-optogenetic-therapy-342193" target="_new">GenSight Biologics</a> ($100m). Renaissance noted that five of the 11 companies filing for IPOs during the two weeks ending 10 July were biotech firms.</p><p><p><p><p>
