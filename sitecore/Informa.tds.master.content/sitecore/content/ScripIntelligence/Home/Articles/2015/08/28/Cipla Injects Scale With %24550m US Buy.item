<p>Cipla is acquiring the US-based firms InvaGen Pharmaceuticals and Exelan Pharmaceuticals for $550m, a deal which is expected to arm the India company with a ready basket of on-market generic drugs and attractive filings in addition to a manufacturing base as it ramps up in the US.</p><p>This is the second such buyout deal involving an Indian firm in the US, after Lupin snapped up the privately owned niche firm Gavis Pharmaceuticals LLC and Novel Laboratories for $880m in July.</p><p>The all-cash transaction has been routed through Cipla's UK arm and both Invagen and Exelan are owned by the promoter group of India's Hetero. Cipla said that the combined revenue from the transactions is more than $200m for the year ended 2014. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> had recently indicated that a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Musical-Chairs-As-Indian-Firms-Rejig-Top-Appointments-360226" target="_new">potential deal</a> between Hetero and Cipla may be in the making. </p><p>The buyout will give Cipla scale in the US generics market through a broad portfolio in CNS, CVS, anti-infectives and diabetes segments as well as other value added generics. </p><p>InvaGen comes with a large capacity manufacturing base in Hauppauge, New York, a US-based R&D unit and about 500 employees, cementing Cipla's first such presence there. It also provides Cipla with access to large wholesalers/retailers in the US. </p><p>Cipla said that the InvaGen deal gives it access to around 40 approved ANDAs, 32 marketed products, and 30 pipeline products which are expected to be approved over the next four years. </p><p>"They represent a balanced, diversified and growing portfolio targeting highly attractive, large and niche markets. In addition, InvaGen has five first-to-file products which represent a market size of about $8bn in revenue by 2018," a company statement said. </p><p>The Hetero group, though, has clarified that Hetero currently has 130 ANDAs filed in the US and will continue to strengthen its presence there by investing in generics and speciality products through its US subsidiary firm Camber Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Exelan, on the other hand, provides Cipla access to the government and institutional market in the US.</p><p>Subhanu Saxena, Cipla's managing director and global CEO, said that the firm saw InvaGen as a strong strategic fit with a relevant diverse portfolio as well as a strong market and customer presence. "With a local manufacturing facility, Cipla can further strengthen its presence and commitment to serve patients in the country," he added.</p><p>Early reactions from analysts tracking the deal termed it as a "good" acquisition with "reasonable" valuation. "For Cipla, gaining a front end with an interesting product portfolio is the key to expanding fast in the US market," one analyst told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-takes-more-shots-at-the-goal-with-880m-US-buy-359600" target="_new">Lupin-Gavis deal</a> valued Gavis at nine times FY14 sales of $96m &ndash; a tad pricey some analysts then suggested &ndash; though Lupin's top brass maintained it was "fairly competitive" going by the EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] multiples on complex generic asset transactions over the recent past. </p><p>Cipla, which has been scaling up in the US with its own ANDA filings and front end in addition to partnered products, recently launched its first set of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CFO-quits-to-turn-entrepreneur-firm-cites-bench-strength-358698" target="_new">own label products</a> there, namely amlodipine, meloxicam, lamotrigine, topiramate, valaciclovir and doxycycline. </p><p>For the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Generic-Nexium-Lifts-Cipla-In-Q1-Amid-Respiratory-Build-Up-359964" target="_new">first quarter</a> ended June, Cipla reported a significant jump in revenues buoyed by a sharp increase in exports including supplies of generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) to Teva for the US market. </p>
