<p>If investors were worried over the FDA's concerns about whether Vertex's investigational cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi &ndash; a combination of the firm's marketed CF medicine Kalydeco (ivacaftor) with a new agent, lumacaftor &ndash; worked well enough for the intended population, they sure did not show it on 8 May.</p><p>In fact, investors appeared to be in a mellow mood &ndash; even giving Vertex shares a nice 5% boost in morning trading, or a gain of $6.37. Shares of Vertex closed the day on 8 May at $127.44, up $2.39, or about 2%.</p><p>Vertex is seeking approval to market Orkambi as a treatment for CF patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance (CFTR) gene as the cause of their disease. </p><p>But FDA drug reviewers sounded skeptical in documents posted on the FDA&rsquo;s website on 8 May about whether the combo drug provided any benefit over the single agent &ndash; even though the medicines are intended for very different populations.</p><p>F508del is the most common CF-causing mutation in the CFTR gene &ndash; with about 90% of patients with the disease having that mutation on at least one allele and about 50% being homozygous for it.</p><p>But currently, the labeling for the single agent Kalydeco emphasizes the drug is "not effective in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene" &ndash; the indication the company is now seeking for the combination product Orkambi.</p><p>Kalydeco was the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">first medicine approved</a> in the US to treat the underlying cause of CF, a rare, life-threatening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, which causes poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs.</p><p>Kalydeco, which initially was approved in January 2012, is indicated in the US to treat patients as young as two years with the G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R mutations.</p><p>The drug also is approved for patients two years or older with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kalydeco-expanded-in-CF-patients-with-R117H-mutation-355875" target="_new">R117H mutation</a> in the CFTR gene.</p><p>On 29 April, Vertex reported first quarter net product revenues from Kalydeco of $130.2m, versus $99.5m for the same quarter in 2014. </p><p>The company said it expected Kalydeco net revenues of $560m to $580m for 2015.</p><p>Analysts have predicted a favorable future also for Orkambi, which will be used in a much broader population than Kalydeco &ndash; a drug that targets only about 2,000 of the 30,000 patients in the US with CF.</p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision by 5 July on Orkambi's new drug application (NDA).</p><p>But Vertex must first convince the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) to recommend Orkambi in the F508del mutation population.</p><p>The panel is expected to meet on 12 May to examine the Orkambi NDA.</p><p><b>A question of efficacy</b></p><p>Ahead of the meeting, however, FDA drug reviewers said Vertex's study data raised questions about whether lumacaftor contributed any added benefit over Kalydeco alone. </p><p>Vertex's NDA for Orkambi is based on studies 809-103 and 809-104, which together enrolled 1,122.</p><p>Of those, 1,108 &ndash; 549 in study 809-103 and 559 in study 809-104 &ndash; received at least one dose of the study drug. </p><p>Overall, the results of Orkambi in the two studies demonstrated a small but statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory capacity in one second (ppFEV1) at 24 weeks with a difference from placebo of 2.7% to 3.0%. Improvement in the secondary endpoint relative percent predicted FEV1 also was statistically significant in both studies. </p><p>But the secondary endpoints of change in body mass index and CF questionnaire-revised respiratory domain failed to show substantial evidence of a treatment effect, regulators said.</p><p>The Orkambi response rate and number of pulmonary exacerbations demonstrated nominal improvements, regulators said, but are not considered statistically significant, since the prospective statistical testing hierarchy stopped before the comparisons were made. </p><p>Regulators pointed out that the results from Vertex's study 770-104 &ndash; initially conducted for the original ivacaftor monotherapy program &ndash; demonstrated a small statistically significant change in sweat chloride, versus placebo.</p><p>While nominal treatment effects for lung function endpoints and pulmonary exacerbations were comparable to those for Orkambi, the FDA's reviewers said the trial was not powered for efficacy and statistical significance was not achieved.</p><p>But they said the similarity of the nominal treatment effects in study 770-104 for 150mg ivacaftor alone and studies 809-103 and 809-104 for the lumacaftor 400mg/ivacaftor 250mg "raised the question of whether lumacaftor contributes any added benefit over that of ivacaftor alone and begs the question if study 770-104 were powered similarly to studies 809-103 and 809-104, would the treatment effects for ivacaftor monotherapy also have been statistically significant, especially in relation to improvements in lung function and reductions in CF pulmonary exacerbations?" </p><p>In the absence of an ivacaftor alone arm in the Orkambi studies, the FDA conducted a statistical comparative analyses between Kalydeco and the proposed the combination drug at the proposed dose in an attempt to determine whether the addition of lumacaftor contributed to the overall treatment effect of the combination for lung function and pulmonary exacerbation endpoints. </p><p>The results from those analyses, regulators said, "could not exclude with any level of confidence" that Orkambi was different from Kalydeco &ndash; meaning the possibility the combination drug was not equivalent to the single-agent medicine in changes in ppFEV1 and pulmonary exacerbations.</p><p><b>Odds of a positive vote, approval?</b></p><p>The FDA has drafted six questions for its PADAC to mull over at the 12 May meeting &ndash; three of which the committee will be called on to vote, including whether the available efficacy and safety data support approval of Orkambi.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the odds of a positive PADAC vote at around 60% to 70%. </p><p>The <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts assigned a 99% chance Orkambi would ultimately make it to the US market &ndash; given the high rate of approvals in the respiratory indication &ndash; which was 2% above the average probability of approval for the same disease group based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Even though the FDA raised questions about Orkambi's efficacy, Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum said he believed the "preponderance of evidence" will push the clinicians on the panel, and the FDA, to not withhold the drug from F508del patients.</p><p>The "nuanced statistical arguments," he said, are "unlikely to sway a panel of clinicians, in our view."</p><p>Dr Schoenebaum said a postmarketing study, if deemed necessary, could be sufficient to resolve the FDA's concerns about the benefit of Orkambi over Kalydeco alone.</p><p>"Therefore, we believe the risk of regulatory non-approval is still low," he said, although he added "not zero."</p><p>Dr Schoenebaum also pointed out that the FDA's concerns may make reimbursement discussions outside the US more difficult.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
