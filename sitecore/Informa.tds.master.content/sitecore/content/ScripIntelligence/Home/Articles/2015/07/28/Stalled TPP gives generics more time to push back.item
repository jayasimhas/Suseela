<p>Generic drug makers and others who oppose certain portions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free-trade deal will have more time to try to convince negotiators and ministers to change course after the 12 nations involved failed to reach an agreement at what the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) had hoped would be the final meeting of the pact in Hawaii.</p><p>USTR chief Michael Froman said the next round of talks has not yet been scheduled, although there were some rumors the negotiators could try again later this month.</p><p>The intellectual property (IP) issues concerning biopharmaceuticals were apparently significant sticking points that bogged down the talks in Hawaii among the trade representatives from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US, although disputes over dairy and auto trade also played major roles in derailing the timeline to clinch a deal on the TPP.</p><p>Ambassador Froman noted that with any trade deal, "nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to."</p><p>"There are an enormous number of issues that one works through over a period of time, narrowing differences, finding landing zones, building consensus, all towards ultimately building a package that must be seen as a whole and must be accepted as a whole," he told reporters during a 31 July press conference.</p><p>"The exercise we're undergoing is a very complex and ambitious undertaking," Ambassador Froman said, pointing out the TPP would be "defining the rules of the road" in trade for the region.</p><p>Nonetheless, he insisted the negotiators worked through a "long list of issues to resolve differences" at the Hawaii meeting and had "made significant progress" and "advanced towards a conclusion."</p><p>"There are, of course, at the end of the day a limited number of difficult issues that require additional attention to be resolved," Ambassador Froman said.</p><p>But he said he was "very impressed with the work that has been done" and was "confident that through intensive engagement we will be able to tackle the remaining issues successfully."</p><p>Ralph Neas, who is departing soon from his position as president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), told <i>Scrip</i> the crucial time to get any changes into the TPP is before a deal is sealed.</p><p>For the US, once an agreement on the TPP is reached, President Barack Obama must provide Congress with a 90-day notice of his intent to sign it.</p><p>But before he does, Americans must get 60 days to review it. </p><p>Under the trade promotion authority (TPA) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-gets-his-fast-track-to-seal-trade-deals-359110" target="_new">signed into law in late June</a>, Congress may only vote up or down on the TPP &ndash; with no ability to filibuster or amend the deal.</p><p>While the TPA vote in the Senate was 60-38, the measure barely squeaked by in the House, where lawmakers there voted 218-208.</p><p>The TPA votes may be a good measure on how things may go for the TPP in the House and Senate &ndash; although, some lawmakers who backed the former have expressed doubts on the latter.</p><p>Indeed, in a 23 July letter to Ambassador Froman, a group of 11 House members emphasized that fact &ndash; specifically pointing out they were concerned about biopharmaceutical IP issues and said they wanted to ensure the TPP has a "balanced approach" so there are no unreasonably delays in the timely and affordable access to medicines in certain countries involved in the pact.</p><p>Mr Neas said GPhA does not want to stop an agreement on the TPP &ndash; insisting that has never been his group's goal in raising its opposition.</p><p>Rather, GPhA and generic companies are concerned about the 12 years of exclusivity protection the TPP may grant to biologic innovators against biosimilars and the proposal to make patent linkage mandatory for all nations in the pact.</p><p>Although the TPP talks have taken place behind closed doors, various draft chapters, including the ones on intellectual property and investment, have been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">leaked</a>, although the USTR has refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the contents of those documents.</p><p>While "big pharma and big bio won in 2010" with the inclusion of the 12 years of exclusivity protection in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was signed into law under the Affordable Care Act, Mr Neas said GPhA has always hoped "there would be moments in our nation's history ahead of us where we are going to be looking for more savings" and Congress may decide to trim that amount of time down. </p><p>"We are going to be having sustainability issues with our healthcare system and addressing affordable medicines will be a very important part of the solution," he said.</p><p>But if 12 years is mandated under the TPP, "that's probably locked in forever," Mr Neas said.</p><p>He said he was "puzzled" as to why the USTR would back 12 years in the TPP, when President Obama has consistently opposed it &ndash; calling for it to be cut to seven years in his last several budget proposals to Congress.</p><p>"We are definitely disappointed this provision is being advanced by the United States in these negotiations," Mr Neas said.</p><p>The inclusion of patent linkage in the TPP also is a major concern for GPhA and generic drug makers, he said, asserting other nations do not have the same mechanisms in place like the FDA's abbreviated new drug application, with the paragraph IV certification, and other legal processes to handle such an approach.</p><p>Without the FDA-like protections and incentives, patent linkage would delay and possibly eliminate generics from entering the markets in the other TPP nations &ndash; crippling government spending for drugs because they would be forced to pay higher prices, Mr Neas argued.</p><p>The ultimate effect of patent linkage, the generic firms have contended, would be an inequality in healthcare, since many patients in the TPP nations would not be able to afford the high costs of innovator drugs.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
