<p>Time to crank up the air conditioning system and stock up on ice, biopharma.</p><p>It's already looking like a long, hot summer ahead in Washington, if not another wacky ride, especially for President Barack Obama, with his trade agenda &ndash; what he had hoped would be his signature achievement of his second term &ndash; getting beaten up by his own party and the triumph of his first term, the <i>Affordable Care Ac</i>t (ACA), on the verge of potentially going over a cliff. </p><p>The failure by Mr Obama to get members of his own party on board with his trade agenda is being viewed in Washington as yet another sign the president's power as a political leader is nearing its expiration date.</p><p>The administration also appears to have relinquished the responsibility of ensuring Americans who enrolled in healthcare plans through the ACA's federally run online exchanges don't lose their coverage if the US Supreme Court this month decides those people are not eligible for the tax credit subsidies intended to help pay for their insurance.</p><p>If the justices rule against the Obama administration in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">the case</a>, "the critical decisions will sit with the Congress and states and governors to determine if those subsidies are available," Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told members of the House Ways and Means Committee last week. </p><p>Secretary Burwell also said the president would reject two legislative proposals from the Senate aimed at replacing the ACA &ndash; including one that would extend the tax credits to 2017, if the Supreme Court rules against the Obama administration in the case, known as <i>King v Burwell</i>, and declares Congress never intended for those subsidies to be available outside of the online exchanges run by the states.</p><p>Representative Paul Ryan (Republican-Wisconsin), chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee &ndash; who declared the ACA "busted" &ndash; said a post-King bill from his chamber would be ready soon. </p><p>The outcome of the case, in which a decision is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">expected</a> by 30 June, will impact the biopharmaceutical industry, which stands to potentially lose millions of new customers if the court rules in the challengers' favor. </p><p>The drug industry also holds major stakes in the outcome of the free-trade agreements the US currently is negotiating with Asia and Europe &ndash; the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), respectively.</p><p>To effectively complete those deals, President Obama said he needs trade promotion authority (TPA), often called fast track, which would allow him to send negotiated agreements to Congress for an up or down vote, with lawmakers having no ability to filibuster or amend them.</p><p>But one of the president's closest allies in the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (California), on 12 June led a revolt by the Democrats against the TPA &ndash; declaring it needed to be slowed down to ensure Americans got a better deal with the TPP, a pact currently being negotiated between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand and the US.</p><p>Even Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jumped ship on 14 June and said President Obama needed to listen to Representative Pelosi on trade.</p><p>Ms Clinton also suggested that drug makers that benefit from deals like the TPP should be required to offer better discounts to US government programs, like Medicare.</p><p>In a quirky twist of events on 12 June, the TPA actually survived a vote &ndash; passing the House 219-211.</p><p>But the failure of another measure, the trade adjustment assistance (TAA) &ndash; a provision intended to provide US workers adversely affected by trade deals with job training, career counseling, wage supplements and other support &ndash; caused the TPA to effectively be stuck in the House because the chamber was required to adopt the same package as the Senate, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-closer-on-trade-but-will-biopharma-get-its-way-358580" target="_new">passed its bill in May</a>.</p><p>It was the TAA that Representative Pelosi led to defeat, even though she said she actually supported the measure.</p><p>Killing that measure, which was voted down 302-126 on 12 June, was the only way to stop the TPA, she said.</p><p>But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest dismissed the initial TAA failure in the House as simply a "procedural snafu &ndash; gleefully declaring the "hard part" was done because the TPA measure passed and refusing to acknowledge the situation was actually a defeat for the president.</p><p>Meanwhile, the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks last week leaked another TPP document &ndash; the "healthcare annex" to the draft "transparency" chapter, which ignited more debate over the agreement.</p><p>The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen asserted the document revealed the 12-nation pact could expose the US Medicare system to attacks by biopharmaceutical companies and could constrain Congress' ability to enact policy reforms, including the ability of the US government to curb rising and "unsustainable" drug prices.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) declined to comment on the leaked text, but a spokesperson insisted the group believes "transparency provisions are very important." </p><p>"Policy and regulatory procedures and decisions regarding how medicines are approved, regulated and reimbursed should be governed by transparent and verifiable rules guided by science-based decision making," the spokesperson told Scrip. "There should be meaningful opportunities for input from manufacturers and other stakeholders to health authorities and other regulatory agencies and a right of appeal to an independent, objective court or administrative body." </p><p>The Office of the US Trade Representative declined to comment on the Wikileaks' document, which was dated December 2014.</p><p>But the Obama administration has insisted the trade negotiations for TPP and TTIP must be held behind closed doors to ensure countries can be free to make the deals.</p><p>The White House's Mr Earnest last week pointed out the TPA legislation would require the text of any final trade agreements to be made public for 60 days so that Americans can review them before the US Congress takes a vote on the deals.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lawmakers-expand-anthrax-probe-69-labs-affected-358934" target="_new">Lawmakers expand anthrax probe; 69 labs affected</a></p><p>US lawmakers have expanded their probe into how the US military sent shipments of live anthrax to multiple private, academic and federal laboratories in five nations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed live anthrax in 22 samples it tested, which originated at the Army's Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-panels-Nissens-take-358915" target="_new">PCSK9 panels: Nissen's take</a></p><p>An FDA advisory panel got it right this week when it recommended to approve, but limit the use to certain patient populations, two experimental proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, said Dr Steven Nissen, chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University. But Dr Nissen said some members of the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee were being overly concerned about the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, which are intended to bring down high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when statins have not been enough to do the job.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-backs-GSK-severe-asthma-drug-in-adults-not-adolescents-358914" target="_new">Panel backs GSK severe asthma drug in adults, not adolescents</a></p><p>GlaxoSmithKline won the full support of an FDA advisory panel on 11 June for the company's severe asthma drug mepolizumab as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with eosinophilic inflammation.</p><p>But the committee said it could not endorse the use of the drug in adolescents 12-17 years because of a lack of safety and efficacy data in that population.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Panel: Approve, but limit Amgen PCSK9; payers have final say</a></p><p>Like it had a day earlier for Sanofi's and Regeneron's Praluent (alirocumab), the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee said the agency should permit Amgen to market its investigational drug in the class Repatha (evolocumab), but only for certain patients.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">US advisers endorse PCSK9 Praluent, but limited population</a></p><p>Not wanting to withhold a new type of cholesterol-lowering drug for two years from desperate patients while waiting for cardiovascular outcomes trial data, a panel of experts on 9 June supported Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals putting their proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) on the US market, despite fears that an FDA approval could mean the large study testing the medicine's ability to prevent heart attacks may be abandoned.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">Repatha review not quite Praluent mirror; dosing stands out</a></p><p>While it may appear at first glance the FDA's review of Amgen's proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab) mirrors in many ways what the agency said late last week about Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' experimental drug in the same class, Praluent (alirocumab), regulators have identified some differences &ndash; mostly notably around the dosing of the products.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NIH-XDR-tuberculosis-case-spotlights-drug-resistance-threat-358855" target="_new">NIH 'XDR-tuberculosis' case spotlights drug resistance threat</a></p><p>The National Institutes of Health on 8 June disclosed that a woman with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which is particularly difficult to treat, was admitted three days earlier to the agency's Clinical Center, where she is being treated in an isolation room. The case again brings the spotlight to the threat of drug-resistant bacteria and the diminishing arsenal of medicines the world has left to fight diseases like XDR-TB</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Titan-plans-2nd-half-Probuphine-resubmission-on-new-data-358854" target="_new">Titan plans 2nd half Probuphine resubmission on new data</a></p><p>With new positive Phase III results in hand, Titan Pharmaceuticals on 8 June said it will be ready by the second half of this year to resubmit its new drug application to the FDA for Probuphine (buprenorphine hydrochloride/ethylene vinyl acetate), a subdermal implant that's under investigation as a maintenance treatment for opioid addiction. Shares of Titan soared nearly 24% on 8 June, before closing at 89 cents, up 11.7%, or 9 cents.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
