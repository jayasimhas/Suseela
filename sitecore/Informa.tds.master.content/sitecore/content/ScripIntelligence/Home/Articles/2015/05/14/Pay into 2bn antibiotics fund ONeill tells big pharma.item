<p>In its third report, the Jim O'Neill Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is making some bold proposals and pointing to big pharma to act with a long-term vision in mind. </p><p>The review, commissioned by UK Prime Minister David Cameron with the aim of determining an international action plan by 2016 to combat AMR, has previously made the case that the potential future human and economic costs of AMR are too catastrophic to ignore; and has set out five necessary steps that should be taken immediately to tackle this challenge. But in its third analysis the independent group is tackling antibiotic economic and R&D issues head on. </p><h2>$2bn needed&#8230;pay up big pharma</h2><p>Addressing the lackluster antibiotics pipeline and economic issues facing developers was always an aim of the O'Neill Review. However, real numbers are now coming to light in proposals being put forward. </p><p>The latest report, published on 14 May, said that a global AMR Innovation Fund of around $2bn spread over 5 years would help boost funding for "blue-sky research into drugs and diagnostics, and get better ideas off the ground." </p><p>But the report writers are pointing the finger at big pharma to help this proposal become reality: "Big pharma should have a role in paying for this innovation fund," the report said. Adding that Pharma "needs to look beyond short-term assessments of profit and loss, and act with 'enlightened self-interest' in tackling AMR, recognizing that it has a long term commercial imperative to having effective antibiotics, as well as a moral one."</p><p>The <a href="http://amr-review.org/" target="_new">O'Neill Review</a> noted that this cost is "modest" in comparison with the cost of drug resistance to healthcare services. The report said that today antibiotic resistance in the US costs its healthcare system an additional $20bn a year. In comparison, it estimates that a comprehensive package of interventions could cost just $16bn and no more than $37bn over the course of 10 years. "This is hardly a high price to pay given that antibiotics are essential to so many aspects of healthcare, from common infections to surgery and chemotherapy," the report said. </p><p>Chair of the ABPI Antibiotics Network, Mark Lloyd Davies, said the idea of an innovation fund is welcomed. However, he highlighted that the O'Neill review still has work to do. "It is important that the next phase of work by the O&rsquo;Neill Review addresses how these funds will work in more detail and looks at potential gaps that these funds would leave unaddressed." Â </p><h2>demand but no supply</h2><p>The report also noted that analysis of antibiotics that have been recently approved and those at various stages of development showed a mismatch between what the world needs, given emerging levels of drug resistance, and the size and quality of the pipeline to address this growing challenge. However, Mr Lloyd Davies highlighted that, "The pharmaceutical sector's long history of research and development of successful antibiotics should not be overlooked."</p><p>The main reason for this "mismatch" of supply and demand in antibiotic R&D is because commercial return for new antibiotic products is uncertain, the report said. </p><p>In other medical fields, a new drug is meant to significantly improve on previous ones and so will become the standard first choice for patients quickly once it comes to market. That is often not true for a new antibiotic: except for patients with infections that are resistant to previous generations of drugs, a new antibiotic is most probably no better than any existing and cheap generic product on the market," it noted. This structure means that by the time that new antibiotic becomes the standard first-line of care, it might be near or beyond the end of its patent life.</p><p>To resolve this commercial paradox, the review is suggesting that a new system be put in place by which a global organization has the authority and resources to commit lump-sum payments to successful drug developers. </p><p>"Such an approach would 'de-link' the profitability of a drug from its volume of sales, supporting conservation goals by eliminating the commercial imperative for a drug company to sell new antibiotics in large quantities &ndash; a key factor in contributing to the development and spread of resistance," the report highlights. </p><p>GlaxoSmithKline, which describes itself as one of the few companies still conducting research in antibiotics, said it was "encouraged" by these suggestions for new economic model for antibiotics. "We are very encouraged by the ideas it sets out to modernize the economic model to encourage investment in research and ensure reasonable returns for successful innovation while discouraging unnecessary use of new antibiotics. We look forward to working closely with the AMR Review Team and others to take these ideas forward," the British big pharma said in a statement. The O'Neill Review will now work with government and industry internationally, to develop these proposals further, it said. A full and final report outlining an international plan of action is expected to be presented in the summer of next year. </p><h2>Related stories</h2><p>First O'Neill report: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Averting-a-100tn-disaster-355694" target="_new">Averting a $100tn disaster</a></p><p>Second report: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/ONeill-Review-outlines-five-steps-for-immediate-AMR-relief-356603" target="_new">O'Neill Review outlines five steps for immediate AMR relief</a></p><p>For more on AMR visit <i>Scrip</i>'s dedicated <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/amr/" target="_new">microsite</a>. </p>
