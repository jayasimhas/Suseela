<p>The US may be getting closer to adopting lower corporate tax rates, territorial-like systems and incentives like innovation boxes, also called "patent boxes," which would put the nation more in line with other developed countries &ndash; that is, if lawmakers pushing for those ideas get their way in the current tax reform efforts in the House and Senate.</p><p>At a 39% combined state and federal rate, the US has the highest corporate rate in the industrialized world, "and to add insult to injury, our government taxes American businesses for the privileges of taking their overseas profits and reinvesting them here at home, which is something we should be encouraging, not discouraging," Senator Rob Portman (Republican-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), declared during a 30 July hearing.</p><p>Earlier in July Mr Portman, along with Senator Chuck Schumer (Democrat-New York), released a proposed <a href="http://www.portman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=923a866b-9c71-429a-a655-5dd0adef2caa" target="_new">framework</a> out of the Senate Finance Committee for international tax reform, which called for the US to adopt a "hybrid" territorial-like system, patent boxes, base erosion and deemed repatriation. </p><p>In a research note, Evercore ISI political analyst Terry Haines said he thought Senator Portman was using the PSI hearing and subcommittee report to "help buttress" his work on the Finance Committee and help convince his fellow senators that the time to make tax code changes to help US global competitiveness was now.</p><p>Mr Haines was bullish that some sort of tax reform with repatriation would happen by the end of this year &ndash; noting there are "serious" negotiations have been ongoing between Congress and the White House.</p><p>Most other nations with advanced economies have adopted competitive tax rates and territorial tax systems where corporations only pay on their domestic and not their foreign income, and as a result, US firms too often have a significant incentive to relocate their headquarters overseas, subcommittee investigators wrote in an analysis released on 30 July in advance of the PSI hearing, convened by Senators Portman and Claire McCaskill (Democrat-Missouri), the panel's ranking member.</p><p>"The high US corporate tax rate and worldwide system of taxation are competitive disadvantages that make it easier for foreign firms to acquire American companies," the subcommittee investigators said. "Those policies also strongly incentivize cross-border merging firms, when choosing where to locate their new headquarters, not to choose the United States. The long-term costs of these incentives can be measured in a loss of jobs, corporate headquarters and revenue to the Treasury."</p><p>They noted that a 2009 study from Oxford University concluded that multinational corporations that face high repatriation taxes, like US businesses, were significantly more likely to relocate through merger and acquisition. </p><p>"We are in agreement that the current US tax system is broken and needs reform," Ms McCaskill said, calling the US "out of sync" with its economic peers in the use of territorial models and patent boxes.</p><p>As a result of lagging behind other nations, "we see more and more profits and intellectual property shifted out of the United States to low-tax jurisdictions overseas" and US companies are "stashing $2.1tn in earnings overseas to avoid the tax rate they would face upon repatriation," the Missouri Democrat argued. </p><p>"We see increasing numbers of US companies heading for the exits, whether through an inversion or by otherwise relocating overseas," she insisted.</p><p>But Ms McCaskill also warned that some of the solutions offered to address the competitiveness gap between the US and foreign firms "may not be so clear cut." </p><p>The move to a territorial system, she said, carries the risk of providing greater incentives for companies to shift profits overseas, and without stringent rules to prevent abuse and ensure transparency, it could cost US taxpayers $130bn over 10 years. </p><p>And while the patent boxes, under which business income derived from intellectual property is taxed at a reduced rate &ndash; typically 5% to 15% &ndash; may be a very promising approach, Senator McCaskill warned "there are challenges in determining which IP rights we should protect and the types of R&D activity we should incentivize."</p><p>But Representatives Charles Boustany (Democrat-Louisiana) and Richard Neal (Democrat-Massachusetts), who are leading an effort out of the House Ways & Means Committee to adopt patent boxes, insisted that using such a measure would protect American companies from "current vulnerabilities that have led to inversions and acquisitions by foreign competitors, provide a lower effective tax rate for most corporations across many industries, encourage greater investment in R&D, and attract R&D jobs back to the United States from overseas." </p><p>Representatives Boustany and Neal, who released a discussion draft on 29 July of their proposal to adopt the patent box approach in the US, noted that type of incentive currently is used in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hungary, Spain, Italy and China.</p><p>During the 30 July Senate PSI hearing, Senator McCaskill asked witnesses whether Congress should require companies that want to use the patent box approach to not only keep their IP in the US, but also their research and development.</p><p>"I think that would be very sound for the United States, given our strength in R&D, the whole background of huge investment and in the [National Institutes of Health], which is a national jewel, as well as all the benefits that then spill into our start-up companies, universities and so on," said former Allergan chairman and CEO David Pyott, who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">testified</a> at the hearing &ndash; describing how the "significant disadvantage caused by our uncompetitive US corporate tax system" led to his firm being acquired by a foreign company, Actavis.</p><p>He also suggested patent boxes should become an item of trade negotiations.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
