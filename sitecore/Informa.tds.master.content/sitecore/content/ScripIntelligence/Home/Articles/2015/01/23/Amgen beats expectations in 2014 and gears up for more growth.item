<p>Amgen, the world's biggest biotech company, reported better-than-expected full year and fourth quarter 2014 financial results on 27 January. Revenues for 2014 increased 7% to $20.1bn while EPS increased 14% to $8.70. Estimates had put full-year revenue at $19.94bn and EPS at $8.59 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-Amgen-Biogen-BMS-Celgene-Novartis-Pfizer-and-Roche-356329" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>For the fourth quarter, total revenues increased 6% to $5.33bn, with product sales growing at 8%. </p><p>"Growth for the quarter was due primarily to higher unit demand, and to a lesser extent, price," noted Amgen. However, Enbrel (etanercept) sales increased 11% compared with the same period in 2013, and 3% for the full year "driven by price, and to a lesser extent, higher unit demand." </p><p>Fourth quarter numbers were also flattered by an extension of the federal R&D tax credit, as well as certain other business tax provisions for 2014, which resulted in a tax benefit of $109m for the company.</p><p>Amgen began a "significant transformation" of its business in 2014 to position it to capitalize more effectively on its pipeline, said CEO Robert Bradway at the recent JP Morgan healthcare conference. He is expecting 2015 to be a year "full of clinical data, a year full of launch activity." Positive pivotal data were generated for six of its programs over the past 12 months.</p><p>"2015 is shaping up to be an important year for the company, with several potential approvals including most importantly [PCSK9 inhibitor] Repatha (evolocumab) as well as [cancer vaccine] T-VEC, and [heart failure drug] ivabradine, the ongoing launch of Neulasta On-Body that could help to protect an important franchise and to a lesser extent Blincyto (blinatumomab) as a novel immuno-oncology agent and AMG334 Phase IIb migraine data presentation," noted Leerink analysts.</p><p>For the full year 2015, the company reaffirmed its previously stated guidance. Total revenues are expected to be in the range of $20.8bn to $21.3bn and adjusted EPS in the range of $9.05 to $9.40. </p><p>Amgen also said this week that it had filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) with the US FDA and a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the EMA for Kyprolis (carfilzomib) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. It acquired the product via its $10.4bn purchase of Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013. </p><p>The drug is currently generating revenues just under expectations but this will be remedied if the sNDA is successful. </p><p>In the US, the sNDA will support the conversion of the accelerated approval to full approval and expand the current approved indication. In the EU, Kyprolis received orphan drug designation and the MAA has been granted accelerated assessment. </p><p>The sNDA and MAA are based on data from the Phase 3 ASPIRE trial (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASH-2014-AmgenOnyxs-Kyprolis-improves-survival-quality-of-life-355471" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 December 2014</a>) and other relevant data. </p><p>Amgen may come up against some headwinds however. "Several key franchises could face new competition, including Neupogen/Neulasta (from Apotex and Sandoz biosimilars) and Epogen/Aranesp (from Roche's Mircera) as well as potential ixazomib Phase III data from Takeda that could be relevant to Kyprolis," noted Leerink.</p>
