<p>As Capitol Hill budget hearings tend to go, it was a free-for-all at the 3 March House hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies where top officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were grilled on everything from why the agency halted the congressionally authorized National Children's Study to the legalization of marijuana. </p><p>Also typical of such hearings was the agency's chief listing off the new and continuing projects where he&rsquo;d like to spend the funding the president has proposed.</p><p>It was no surprise NIH Director Dr Francis Collins started off by promoting President Barack Obama's initiatives in precision medicine, research into unraveling the mysteries of the brain and the pursuit of new ways to combat antimicrobial resistance (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">03 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">1 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">17 September 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">4 April 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BAM-Obama-aims-for-job-creation-economic-growth-with-brain-initiative-341691" target="_new">2 April 2013</a>).</p><p>Dr Collins also engaged in his usual Capitol Hill pleading for more funding for the NIH, for which the president has proposed a budget of $31.311bn for fiscal year 2016, a boost of $1bn over FY 2015, or a 3.3% increase.</p><p>While the US remains the leader in biomedical research, "When you look at the trajectory that our funding is on compared to other countries, there are deep concerns," Dr Collins insisted.</p><p>"What the NIH desperately needs and what would be such an inspirational moment for our community, especially those early-stage investigators, is a sense of stable trajectory that we have the chance to be able to plan, to take risks, to do innovative research without the uncertainty about what will happen one year or the next," he said.</p><p>Doubling the NIH's budget, as some have proposed, "would be a nice thing," Dr Collins said, but "what would be even better, would be an opportunity to see a path forward that keeps up with inflation plus a little bit we could count on and then people could flex their innovative muscles and take advantage of this amazing talent that we have in this country."</p><p><b>Discrepancies in disease funding</b></p><p>While the president has proposed $3.1bn for HIV/AIDS research for the NIH for FY 2016, Representative Andy Harris (Republican-Maryland) took issue with that amount, declaring there was a discrepancy between what is being spent on that condition versus heart disease &ndash; the most prevalent disease in the US and the one that killed his wife three days shy of her 58th birthday.</p><p>"The amount we spend is 100 times less on heart disease per death than HIV/AIDS," declared Representative Harris, who is a physician.</p><p>"That kind of discrepancy needs to be justified," he insisted. "It is stunning what that discrepancy is and how the fact is we dedicate as little as we do to heart disease."</p><p><b>Pot research</b></p><p>But from that line of questioning, Representative Harris jumped to inquiries outside the topics in the president's budget proposal &ndash; specifically, whether the NIH has conducted research on the effects of marijuana use on the US workforce and education and if there have been any economic impacts.</p><p>"These are important things to study and things we need to know before we go willy-nilly into legalizing a dangerous, addictive drug," Representative Harris argued. "It affects the brain, memory and motivation."</p><p>Dr Nora Volkow, director of the NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), told lawmakers there have been many studies that have evaluated the consequences of the use of marijuana on teenagers' academic achievement, "and they have consistently shown that its use decreases likelihood finish school or get a degree."</p><p>But, she said, the impact of marijuana on the workforce is much less clear because those studies have not been done.</p><p>"We know in general that the use of drugs in the workforce is responsible for 30% less productivity, but that has not been distinguished from marijuana, cocaine or methamphetamine," Dr Volkow said.</p><p>Representative Harris demanded that Americans should "expect scientific answers" to questions about the overall effects of marijuana. </p><p>But Representative Harold Rogers (Republican-Kentucky), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, praised the work by Dr Volkow and NIDA on searching for abuse-deterrent strategies for opioids, including oxycodone &ndash; a drug that has plagued his home state.</p><p>NIDA is partnering with Signature Therapeutics to develop an abuse deterrent formulation using prodrug technology, which attaches an extension to the opioid molecule that renders it neutral and unable to interact with opioid receptors if it is injected, snorted or smoked.</p><p>The abuse-deterrent drug must pass through the digestive system where enzymes would trigger the release of the active ingredient, she said.</p><p><b>Children's Study</b></p><p>While the hearing was mostly cordial, with lawmakers effectively extolling the virtues of the NIH &ndash; especially on its recent progress in entering efficacy trials for two Ebola vaccines and the experimental drug ZMapp &ndash; Dr Collins was interrogated over why he terminated the National Children's Study (NCS) this past December after Congress had pumped $1.5bn into the project over the past nearly 15 years (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapps-moment-of-truth-efficacy-trial-starts-356995" target="_new">27 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Given the study was authorized by Congress, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (Democrat-California) demanded to know under what authority Dr Collins disbanded the study, which had intended on enrolling up to 100,000 children to investigate how environmental influences affect the overall health of that population.</p><p>"In every fiscal appropriations report there have been specific instructions directing continuation of the study," Representative Roybal-Allard said. </p><p>In 2013, Congress requested a review by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which concluded there were conceptual methodological and administrative challenges that must be addressed, she said. </p><p>But, Representative Roybal-Allard argued, the IOM also concluded the NCS "still offered enormous potential," and that when the study was completed, "it would add immeasurably to what we know about children's health in the US."</p><p>She insisted that a better outcome for the $1.5bn investment would have been for the NCS study to be completed.</p><p>But Dr Collins contended the IOM was actually very critical of the NCS, which is why he convened a working group of his advisory committee to examine whether it was feasible to continue the study.</p><p>"They came back and said frankly they did not believe that it was," he said.</p><p>The NIH director's advisers determined it would be more responsible to end the study and ensure the data collected through the NCS pilot, known as the Vanguard Study, was made available to those who could learn from it, Dr Collins said.</p><p>"This has been one of the more difficult decisions since I've been NIH director over the last almost six years," he said.</p><p>Dr Collins noted the NCS was designed in various pieces over a long period, and "as that time passed, some of the design issues in retrospect maybe were not serving the need for getting information, which we all agreed was crucial to understand the environmental impact factors that occur during pregnancy and beyond that influence child health."</p><p>"The problem that seemed increasingly clear was that the design of the Children's Study, which carried with it a certain historical legacy, was not fitting with the way in which technology was developing over the course of the almost last 20 years, but that we really ought to think about coming up with a new strategy to get answers to these same questions in pediatric health," he said. </p><p>Dr Collins said the NIH has been "vigorously engaged" in that effort over the course of the last two months, and will in the very near future announce new programs for the current fiscal year, "which I think you will find to be quite innovative."</p><p>"I believe the silver lining here is this gives us a change to step back from the legacy of the last 14 or 15 years in 2015 and say, 'Now with all the technology that's advanced in the interim, what could we do that would get better answers for perhaps less cost than what was originally contemplated for a 21-year study,'" Dr Collins said </p><p>He urged lawmakers to be patient until the NIH discloses its next steps after rethinking the whole idea. </p><p>Dr Collins said new proposals would be revealed "very shortly."</p><p>"Ultimately, I think we will get to where we need to be, but in a different way than was imagined back in 2000," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
