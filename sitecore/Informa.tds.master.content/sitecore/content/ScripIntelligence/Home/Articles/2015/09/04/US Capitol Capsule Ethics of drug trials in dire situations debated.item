<p>The waning Ebola epidemic in West Africa, in which more than 25,500 people have been infected with the virus, which has killed about 10,600, is likely to be over long before the debate is settled about whether using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is ethical to test drugs and vaccines in dire situations when a deadly infectious disease is rapidly spreading.</p><p>The dispute on the matter continued last week in the most recent issue of the <i>American Journal of Bioethics</i> (AJB), where three New York researchers maintained that alternative trial designs can identify effective therapies just as well as RCTs, if not better &ndash; an argument for which officials from the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in separate articles strongly disagreed.</p><p>It's not the first time FDA officials have argued the case for using RCTs to test Ebola therapies.</p><p>This past <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-officials-Randomized-trials-necessary-for-Ebola-drugs-354877" target="_new">November</a>, Drs Luciana Borio, the agency's new chief scientist, and Edward Cox, director of FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products, were vocal on the matter at a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.</p><p>NIH officials also have been adamant RCTs are the only way to know for sure if vaccines will work against Ebola, although they also have acknowledged the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-Ebola-remains-emergency-vaccine-trials-a-challenge-357842" target="_new">current difficulties</a> in completing the ongoing trials due to the recent rapid decline in newly infected patients.</p><p>But in their AJB paper published last week, Drs Arthur Caplan and Carolyn Plunkett from New York University Langone Medical Center and Bruce Levin of Columbia University Medical Center insisted RCTs are not morally or methodologically always desirable because they are not the best design to address the key question being asked: which of the current experimental therapies is most promising and works best. </p><p>They also contended that testing against the null hypothesis is "neither appropriate nor necessary" when there exists an out-of-control lethal epidemic, like currently in West Africa. </p><p>Dr Caplan and his co-authors argued there are practical reasons why placebo or best available standard of care (SOC)-RCTs will be difficult, if not impossible, to complete during the current outbreak of Ebola. </p><p>For instance, they said, there are logistical challenges, like poor infrastructure, shortage of healthcare workers, lack of computers and the need to destroy all materials exposed to infected persons and treatment units with limited capabilities.</p><p>There also is a climate of distrust in the Ebola-affected nations about research conducted by Westerners, and RCTs would only further add to the erosion of trust, the New York researchers said. </p><p>And, they warned, widespread mistrust could put healthcare workers and the security of treatment facilities at risk. </p><p>"There is danger of harm to already overwhelmed staff, who may be seen as withholding beneficial treatment, exploiting the desperate by not providing promising drugs, or, mistakenly, as providing agents surreptitiously intended to do harm," said the co-authors of the AJB paper, <i>Selecting the Right Tool For the Job</i>.</p><p>Mistrust also may lead to the integrity of the trial data being undermined because participants may share their study drugs to increase the likelihood of getting the active agent, the New York researchers said. </p><p>Another practical argument against using an RCT, they asserted, is the fact there are limited quantities of the experimental drugs and poor capabilities for storing them in the poor nations of West Africa.</p><p>"Randomization by itself will not compensate for small numbers when only a tiny supply of experimental drug exists," the researchers argued. </p><p>The greatest challenge RCTs face in the current Ebola outbreak, they said, is the fact some Americans and Europeans infected with the virus were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Uproar-erupts-over-zMapp-WHO-to-convene-ethics-panel-353231" target="_new">given access</a> to experimental drugs, like Mapp Biopharmaceuticals' monoclonal antibody ZMapp, while people dying in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were not.</p><p>So West Africans now are more likely to demand that the experimental drugs be made available to them rather than having to take a placebo or SOC alone.</p><p>"To do otherwise is to violate the requirement of fairness that like cases ought to be treated alike," the New York researchers said.</p><p>"When available conventional care means a high probability of death and a novel intervention holds some possibility of benefit due to promising prior if limited use in humans, animal studies, or simply theoretical plausibility, it is morally problematic to insist on randomizing patients to a control arm in the context of an ineffective standard of care," they said. "Few of us would consent to be randomized when facing utterly lethal circumstances. Where a remotely possible treatment is available for a likely fatal disease, no matter how risky, the sick will almost always opt for it."</p><p>That is why there has been a push in the US for compassionate use and expanded access to experimental drugs, devices and biologics for the terminally ill, the researchers pointed out.</p><p>They recommended the use of a so-called randomized selection (RS) trial design, with the objective of identifying the best treatment among the available experimental drugs.</p><p>But six officials from the FDA, including Drs Borio and Cox and Dr Robert Temple, deputy director for clinical science, took aim at using that proposed design &ndash; calling it "ethically, scientifically and pragmatically deficient relative to an SOC-RCT."</p><p>Plus, the FDA officials said, the description offered by Dr Caplan and his colleagues appeared to "deviate" from the RS design they referenced and said the study plan they outlined in their paper was hard to follow &ndash; noting that rather than randomizing participants, the New York researchers had proposed to "divide" treatment centers into groups corresponding to the number of experimental products. </p><p>Dr Caplan and his colleagues would then "randomly select one center from each group and enroll one subject from each chosen center," while matching subjects across the centers on "major risk factors such as the severity of illness,&rdquo; the US regulators said.</p><p>But they said Dr Caplan and his co-authors failed to describe how treatment centers would be divided, study participants would be chosen at each center or matching for risk factors would be accomplished.</p><p>It also was not clear whether investigational products would be provided to all patients at each treatment center or only to those selected for enrollment, Dr Temple and the other officials said.</p><p>The New York researchers&rsquo; "lack of specificity in the description of the RS design seems careless, as evaluation of the supposed advantages of the proposed design on efficiency, interpretability, feasibility and fairness requires a clear understanding of the proposed methods,&rdquo; the FDA officials changed.</p><p>The US regulators, who added a disclaimer that the views in the paper were their own and not the FDA's, asserted the approach by Dr Caplan and his colleagues "puts patients at risk from exposure to investigational products while having little chance of providing interpretable efficacy and safety data &ndash; an approach that we believe is unethical."</p><p>In a separate paper, NIH's Dr Joseph Millum, a staff scientist at the NIH's Department of Bioethics, said the approach proposed by Dr Caplan and his co-authors might make sense if it were true the most important question really was which of the existing experimental therapies is the most promising and if there were no other ways in which the limited resources expended on distributing investigational drugs could be used to combat Ebola. </p><p>But, he said, "neither of these is the case." </p><p>First, Dr Millum argued, the probability that any particular new drug going into human testing will turn out to be safe and effective is relatively low, therefore, the assumption cannot be relied on that at least one of the current experimental therapies will turn out to be substantially effective.</p><p>And, he added, there are multiple alternative uses of the limited healthcare resources that would be expended on supplying the winning treatment to patients.</p><p>Dr Millum contended that instead of spending money on manufacturing drugs of uncertain efficacy and using the limited healthcare infrastructure and personnel to distribute them, policymakers should focus on increasing access to supportive care.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-Ebola-remains-emergency-vaccine-trials-a-challenge-357842" target="_new">WHO: Ebola remains emergency; vaccine trials a 'challenge'</a></p><p>Even though there's been a steep decline in the number of Ebola cases in West Africa, the outbreak continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a special emergency committee on Ebola for the World Health Organization declared on 10 April. But while the rapid decline in Ebola cases is a significant advance in the fight against the disease, it's bad for the pursuit to find a safe and effective vaccine to combat the virus for future outbreaks, Dr Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general at WHO, acknowledged.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-AstraZenecas-Onglyza-may-increase-death-risk-357841" target="_new">FDA: AstraZeneca's Onglyza may increase death risk</a></p><p>An FDA analysis of a cardiovascular outcomes trial conducted on AstraZeneca&rsquo;s type 2 diabetes drug Onglyza (saxagliptin) found that the medicine appeared to increase the risk of death &ndash; news that caused the firm's shares to drop by 2% on 10 April.
