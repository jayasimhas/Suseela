<p>NICE, the HTA body for England and Wales, has set out the case for the development of an Office for Market Access (OMA) to help companies navigate their way through the turbulent reimbursement process in the UK. NICE claims that the OMA has been designed to perform "existing functions via a more effective mechanism" and that providing a focus at NICE for market access related activities "will increase the effectiveness of engagement."</p><p>However, some observers are sceptical. </p><p>"I'm keen to see the evidence that this is (a) needed, and (b) a top NHS/health priority," Dr Ben Goldacre, <i>Bad Pharma</i> author and a founder of the AllTrials campaign, said on <a href="https://twitter.com/bengoldacre/status/602925189777723392" target="_new">Twitter</a>.</p><p>Some are surprised by the scope of the OMA's brief, considering only three full-time staff have been allocated to the project. Others point out that companies already use specialist consultancies with years of experience of submitting NICE appraisals, and only a small number of companies that are new to the process are likely to make use of the service. </p><p>NICE says the intention is that the OMA will become self-funding through fee for service and possibly also through a subscription service. "Fee for service OMA products will be developed to meet stakeholder needs. The portfolio of products is likely to include NICE engagement meetings relating to the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, exploratory discussions of patient access schemes and company portfolio discussions." </p><p>According to NICE, the project is in reaction to the rapidly changing landscape for R&D, regulation and adoption of new health technologies. "In particular, developments in regulatory processes are supporting earlier market entry of promising new medicines through opportunities such as the EMA conditional marketing authorization and adaptive pathways pilots and the UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)," it said.</p><p>It also noted the creation of a new Innovation, Growth and Technology Directorate within the Department of Health which has joined its life science functions with the Department of Business Industry and Skills into a new, expanded, Office for Life Sciences. </p><p>"These developments magnify the challenge faced by NICE in balancing its gatekeeper and facilitator roles," it said. "We believe that the establishment of an Office for Market Access (OMA) provides the mechanism for us to increase visibility, influence and impact on &#8230; adoption of innovative, cost effective health technologies." </p><p>NICE envisages that the OMA will serve as a 'hub' for interaction with key groups outside NICE including medicines regulators such as the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Innovate UK, UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) and life science trade associations. </p><p>"For individual life sciences companies, OMA will be able to provide for different levels of interaction with NICE, ranging from relatively straightforward sign-posting to NICE and other evaluative services to brokering discussions with guidance producing teams and with the NICE Scientific Advice service," said NICE.</p><p>NICE provided a case study for what the OMA might do. "Let's take a pharmaceutical company that already has products on the market in England. Such a company may well, at the moment, engage with NICE only during the technology appraisal scoping and evidence submission and assessment stages in order to respond to technical queries related to their evidence base. If such a company wanted to discuss the opportunities for improving the chance of a positive NICE recommendation, either via a patient access scheme, or by exploring the potential for a recommendation with evidence development, or indeed strategic issues around the totality of the product portfolio, a discussion at this stage would be much too late. OMA would be able to assist in a much earlier discussion around these issues, allowing the company to adjust their plans and the potential to secure access for patients."</p><p>The MHRA already has an Office for Innovation. "By focusing on market access issues, OMA is fully synergistic with, and does not duplicate, activities of the MHRA Office for Innovation," stated NICE.</p><p>Performance indicators will be used to assess the success, or otherwise, of the OMA and to inform risk mitigation plans. NICE suggests that performance indicators could include the number of enquiries handled and the number of key external events where the OMA is invited to participate.</p><p>NICE believes it has stakeholder support for the move. Correspondence between NICE's chief executive and the Department of Health has "signaled strong support." Meanwhile, "preliminary discussions" with NHS England have confirmed "strong in-principle support." </p><p>In addition, "engagement of life sciences companies and their trade associations will be a key priority following board approval. Based on discussions to date strong support for the establishment of OMA has been signaled by the ABPI, ABHI and BIVDA. These organizations have also agreed to engage in more detailed discussions to help ensure that OMA meets the needs of their members," said NICE.</p><p>"The OMA is a helpful development and the ABPI is supportive of it. However, what we need is much more fundamental reform of the way we evaluate medicines and make them available to patients," Paul Catchpole, Value & Access Director at the ABPI, told <i>Scrip</i>. "The Accelerated Access Review is the key initiative which needs to be truly 'end to end', not only addressing components such as earlier launches for promising medicines, but aiming to create a 'sustainable' system for access and uptake."</p><p>If approved by its board, NICE expects that the OMA will open fully by October 2015.</p>
