<p>A 40% chance for success and mere "publicity stunt" are some of the sharp early reactions to the surprise compulsory license (CL) application for AstraZeneca's saxagliptin by the Hyderabad-based Lee Pharma, though the less know firm appears confident that its arguments hold water.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> spoke to a clutch of experts, including Lee's attorney, Afzal Hasan, managing partner, Hasan and Singh, to get a ringside view on what may just be the next David versus Goliath patent battle In India. </p><p>Mr Hasan was confident that neither the fact that the Indian DPP-4 inhibitor market has several other cut-price gliptins &ndash; saxagliptin had the lowest market share among the gliptins as per IMS moving annual total data for May 2015 and new entrant <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-pioneers-Mitsubishis-teneligliptin-in-India-358948%5d" target="_new">teneligliptin</a> is available at INR19.90 ($0.31) per tablet - nor AstraZeneca's recent <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-unveils-second-brand-play-in-India-358707%5d" target="_new">distribution arrangement</a> with Dr Reddy's Laboratories to expand access to the drug were likely to stymie Lee's efforts. </p><p>Interestingly, Lee's managing director Mr A Venkata Reddy started his career with the Dr Reddy's group, till he went on to co-promote a clutch of other firms including Hetero Drugs.</p><p>"All gliptins have their own market just like various antibiotics. Existence or non-existence of one gliptin does not affect the existence of another gliptin. If the doctor feels it is better to prescribe saxagliptin, he won't switch over to another gliptin," Mr Hasan told <i>Scrip</i> in a telephone interaction.</p><p>Ranjan Narula, managing partner of RNA Intellectual Property Attorneys, however, said that if one were to compare the situation to the earlier <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharma-sees-red-as-India-allows-Natco-to-produce-patented-Nexavar-at-3-of-Bayers-price-327972%5d" target="_new">CL granted</a> (for Bayer's Nexavar) the price difference was huge INR280,000 for Nexavar (sorafenib) against around INR8,800 being offered by Natco for a month's supply. </p><p>"The difference in price here is less and there are substitutes available. Thus, I see little merit in this claim/argument," Mr Narula told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Lee is reported to have claimed that it can offer saxagliptin at around INR30 per tablet.</p><p>Overall, Mr Narula predicts a "40% chance of success" for Lee's CL attempt.</p><p>An expert with a frontline foreign firm, who termed Lee's challenge as more a publicity stunt on first look, though, said that prices of products may have little to do with CL applications. </p><p>"It is obviously the lucrative nature of the market that draws more players trying their luck with the various allowances in India's patent law. If prices were as important or prohibitive as [they are] made out to be, you would not see the kind of market size that DPP-4s have garnered," he said. </p><p>He added, however, that while the current price points are "relatively low", they are by "no means affordable."</p><p>Mr Hasan also referred to AstraZeneca's arrangement with Dr Reddy's as a "smart game" in the backdrop of the fact that Lee had been negotiating with AstraZeneca for a voluntary license for around a year, though it's unclear if the deal with Dr Reddy's had been in the works prior to that. </p><p>He emphasized that merely entering into a deal with Dr Reddy's does not ensure that the medicine is available to all those who require it and the price at which DRL sells the product would be vital. </p><p>AstraZeneca did not respond to specific queries from <i>Scrip</i> on the CL or whether DRL was free to determine its own price for saxagliptin and only said that it was aware of Lee's CL application filed with the Indian Patent Office and was reviewing its options. "AstraZeneca enables affordable access to our medicines in India and elsewhere. AstraZeneca has complete confidence in its intellectual property that protects our inventions and does not believe that such intellectual property is a barrier to access to medicines in developing countries.&rdquo;</p><h2>CL application</h2><p>Lee has in its CL application &ndash; the third in the Indian pharmaceutical segment after BDR's CL attempt for Sprycel (dasatinib) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/India-rejects-compulsory-license-application-for-Sprycel-347730%5d" target="_new">failed</a> &ndash; claimed that saxagliptin met all the three grounds laid down to qualify for a CL under Section 84 of India's patent regulations. </p><p>These rules suggest that any person can, after three years from sealing of a patent, make an application for a compulsory license if: </p><p>?the "reasonable" requirements of the public with respect to the product have not been satisfied; or</p><p>?the patented invention is not available at a "reasonably affordable" price; or</p><p>?the patented invention is not "worked" in India. [This is broadly construed to imply manufacturing in India].</p><p>And Section 84(7) of India's Patent Act deems that the reasonable requirement of the public is not satisfied if the demand for the patented article is not met to an "adequate extent or on reasonable terms".</p><p>Lee has also indicated that it made concerted efforts to obtain a voluntary license from AstraZeneca.</p><p>India approved in March 2012 its first ever CL in the area of medicines for Nexavar, allowing Natco to self-manufacture and sell a version of the product for just over 3% of the price that Bayer sells the drug for in India. A court judgement in the Nexavar CL case had, however, earlier implied that manufacture [by the patent holder] in all cases may not be necessary to establish working in India. </p><h2>reasonable requirements</h2><p>Lee's CL application, as was first reported by the intellectual property blog, www.spicyIP.com, referred to how the entire supply of saxagliptin continues to be imported even after eight years since the patent had been granted. The quantity imported each year was reported to be adequate to meet just 0.23% of the demand.</p><p>In addition, a significant part of the imported medicine was being exported to certain countries. </p><p>On the exports question, Mr Hasan indicated that Lee was merely trying to establish that AZ was already supplying "very less quantity" in India and even of this some part was being exported. </p><p>"Hypothetically, if 100 strips are required and AZ is supplying 20, it means that 80% patients are already deprived of this medicine in India. Out this 20, if 10 [are] exported out of the country&#8230;," Mr Hasan said.</p><p>Mr Narula said that the argument had also to be examined in the light of alternatives being available to the patient. Further, it has to be seen if exports were being done by the patentee or traders owing to cheaper prices. "If there are market forces that are playing their role (in exporting the product) due to price differential, it cannot be strictly speaking tied to the patentee not making adequate quantities available," he said.</p><p>The expert with the foreign firm added that Lee's claim of AstraZeneca "limiting supplies to serve Indian patients" does not seem to be accurate, considering that there are other gliptins available which are not "too different" in delivering outcomes from saxagliptin. Vildagliptin and sitagliptin, he noted, are more popular with doctors as market data will show.</p><p>"What AZ does after it imports its product to India is its own decision. It is, however, difficult to believe that AZ will choose to ignore and under-serve a market as large as India."</p><h2>mail woes</h2><p>Lee has also claimed that during the course of its efforts to negotiate a voluntary license, it received an email from AstraZeneca which it apparently "could not open".</p><p>Mr Hasan said that no attempt was being made to "blame" AstraZeneca since there appeared some "technical problem." </p><p>"Their lawyers sent copy of their 'sent mail' folder, so we realised on the back of it that they might have sent [the mail] and we did not receive it."</p><p>He underscored however that even after the mail was resent and Lee provided all the "requirements/documents/information" to AstraZeneca, which it acknowledged, Lee had not heard from the company.</p><p>"Lee Pharma made several follow up [attempts] but when they did not respond, there was no other option but to go for the CL route."</p><p>At the time of rejecting BDR's CL application for Sprycel, India's controller general of patents, designs and trademarks, Chaitanya Prasad, said that BDR had not followed the "scheme of the law" as well as the procedure mandated by the law. Controller Prasad also referred to the "deliberate intent" on the part of BDR to refrain from entering into "any kind of dialog" with the patentee for securing a voluntary license.</p>
