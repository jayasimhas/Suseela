<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales, has drafted recommendations for both Bayer's Eylea (aflibercept), and Allergan's Ozurdex (dexamethasone) in diabetic macular edema (DME). However, both companies are disappointed with the restrictions NICE has placed on their products.</p><p>The two drugs, if recommended in NICE's final guidance, will compete for DME market share in the UK, along with Roche's Lucentis (ranibizumab), and off-label Avastin (bevacizumab).</p><h2>Eylea</h2><p>NICE has recommended Eylea for use in DME, but only in patients with a central retinal thickness of 400 micrometers or more at the start of treatment. The recommendation is also contingent on a patient access scheme. </p><p>NICE compared Eylea with laser treatment in patients with a CRT of less than 400 micrometers, and greater than 400 micrometers. It found that in patients with a CRT higher than 400 micrometers, Eylea "significantly improved visual acuity gains and prevented visual acuity losses." In the group with a lower CRT, however, Eylea had no significant improvement in these outcomes.</p><p>The committee also found that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the group with a smaller CRT was &pound;49,421 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared with Lucentis, above the range considered to be cost-effective (&pound;20,000-30,000 per QALY gained).</p><p>In the subgroup with the larger CRT measurement, the ICER was less than &pound;20,000 per QALY compared with Lucentis, making Eylea a cost-effective option in this population.</p><p>Bayer said it was pleased that NICE had recognized the benefits of Eylea, but "disappointed that a core group of patients diagnosed with early stage DME would be denied treatment until their disease has progressed to a stage where permanent damage to the eye has already begun." The company said it will work with NICE through the rest of the appraisal process to ensure that all SME patients have access to Eylea when the institute makes its final decision, which is expected in June.</p><p>NICE has already recommended Eylea for use in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-aye-for-Bayers-Eylea-343678" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 31 May 2013), and macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-issues-final-guidances-for-Pixuvri-and-Eylea-350281" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 27 February 2014).</p><h2>Ozurdex</h2><p>Despite the positive draft guidance for Ozurdex, NICE has left Allergan disappointed because the recommendation excludes a significant subsection of patients.</p><p>NICE's recommendation applies to patients only if the implant is to be used in an eye with an intraocular (pseudophakic) lens; and their diabetic macular edema does not respond to non-corticosteroid treatment or such treatment is unsuitable for them. In this patient group, NICE said that the cost-effectiveness of Ozurdex was similar to the comparator, fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant.</p><p>Allergan noted that the recommendation excluded certain patients, notably those who still have their natural lens, for whom Ozurdex is also licensed. The company said that this recommendation left out groups with significant unmet need, and added that it would continue working with NICE to broaden access to Ozurdex.</p><p>In patients who still have their natural lens, the standard response is currently watch and wait. NICE found that compared with watch and wait in people who do not have a pseudophakic lens, and have DME which has not responded adequately to non-corticosteroid treatment, Ozurdex was likely to have an ICER of around &pound;1.17m per QALY gained &ndash; far beyond the institute's cost-effectiveness range of &pound;20,000-30,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY).</p><p>NICE has also not recommended the drug in people with a pseudophakic lens and a central retinal thickness of 400 micrometers or more, because the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with Roche's Lucentis fell outside of the institute's cost-effectiveness range. The institute also concluded that Ozurdex was less effective and more costly than laser photocoagulation and Roche's Avastin in people with a pseudophakic lens and a central retinal thickness of less than 400 micrometers.</p><p>NICE has already recommended Ozurdex for other indications, including macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion, and branch retinal vein occlusion (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-gives-Allergans-Ozurdex-final-nod-319094" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 27 July 2011). </p>
