<p>French allergy company Stallergenes could be on the brink of a merger with its US partner Greer Laboratories, as proposed by Ares Life Sciences, the majority shareholder of both companies.</p><p>The combined business would be owned by Ares Allergy Holding, the English subsidiary of Ares Life Sciences, with shares listed on EURONEXT Paris, though Ares confirmed that "there is no intention to change the established Stallergenes brand." Ares Life Sciences currently owns 100% of Greer and 77.3% of Stallergenes. </p><p>The transaction would be a no-cash merger. Stallergenes' shareholders would receive one share of Ares Allergy Holding for each share of Stallergenes. Following the transaction Ares Life Sciences would hold around 86% of the shares of Ares Allergy Holding. </p><p>The two companies, both focused on allergy immunotherapy, are currently partnered for the marketing and distribution of Oralair in the US, a hay fever product combining freeze-dried extracts from the pollens of five grasses. Oralair won FDA approval in April 2014, having been approved in Europe since 2008 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Stallergenes-Oralair-1st-US-sublingual-allergen-extract-351011" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 2 April 2014).</p><p>Stallergenes said that the merger would bring together the companies' "complementary strengths" and result in an allergy company with sales of around &euro;330m. Stallergenes itself just reported full year 2014 revenues of &euro;251.3m, up 1.3% over 2013.</p><p>Christian Chavy, CEO of Stallergenes, said: "Ares Life Sciences' proposal gives us a tremendous opportunity to reinforce our relationship with Greer. It would enable us to take advantage of Greer's leadership position in the US market to accelerate sales of Oralair and launch our future products in the US."</p><p>The company's board is currently reviewing the project. Patrick Langlois, chair of Stallergenes, said: "The board of directors considers that the transaction proposed by Ares Life Sciences would be a unique opportunity to create the worldwide leader in allergy immunotherapy. It could also have a positive effect for all shareholders through the combination of Greer's and Stallergenes' portfolio of products."</p><p>Ares Life Sciences said that: "The new company would have a broader pipeline as Greer has developed an advanced ragweed sublingual program of which application is in progress and Stallergenes's dust mite allergy tablet is currently in clinical development in different parts of the world, including the US." Stallergenes is primarily working on a house mite immunotherapy tablet for allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Phase II studies are currently underway. </p><p>If Stallergenes decides to go ahead with the proposition, the transaction is expected to take effect during the third quarter of 2015.</p>
