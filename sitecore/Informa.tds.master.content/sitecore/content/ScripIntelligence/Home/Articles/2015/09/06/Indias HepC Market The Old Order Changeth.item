<p>Is peginterferon alfa 2b potentially heading for near obsolescence on the Indian market as a therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, now with the availability of cut-price sofosbuvir versions? Probably yes, if a clutch of industry pundits are to be believed and going by some market-related activity or indeed the lack of it.</p><p>Industry experts highlighted how within months of the launch of numerous sofosbuvir brands on the Indian market, their sales are approaching ever nearer to the sales of established pegylated interferon alfa 2b brands such as Merck & Co's Viraferon Peg. </p><p>Data from AIOCD AWACS, a the market research agency that tracks retail sales, indicated that Viraferon Peg's MAT (moving annual total) sales were about INR100m ($1.5m), while firms like Zydus Cadila and Cipla that launched their versions of sofosbuvir in March this year have reported sales of INR90m (Zydus's SoviHep) and INR70m (Cipla's HepCVir) respectively.</p><p>The basket of pegylated interferon alfa 2b brands covered in the data reported cumulative MAT sales of INR550m with Zydus Cadila's PegiHep leading the pack, while the clutch of sofosbuvir brands launched just earlier this year reported cumulative MAT sales of INR300m. The basket of interferon alfa 2b brands reported MAT sales of just INR20m.</p><p>"The peg- interferon alfa market is expected to be short-lived, now with the entry of sofosbuvir and probably more so whenever the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir becomes available," an industry expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Others were more dramatic, suggesting that the end was nigh for interferon alfa 2b and predicting a sharp expansion of the market for sofosbuvir but lamenting the super competitive market in terms of prices.</p><p>There also appear to be some tell-tale signs of a pull back on the peginterferon alfa market, if these experts are to be believed. They indicated how Merck & Co's out-of-the-box hepatitis C therapy <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MSD-Indias-out-of-the-box-Hep-C-financing-how-why-and-what-next-352206" target="_new">financing initiative</a> in India &ndash; involving a clutch of other stakeholders including a financial credit firm named Sambhav (meaning "possible" in Hindi) &ndash; that was earlier said to have improved accessibility to its Viraferon Peg in pockets of the country had been rolled back, though it's not clear if potentially lower market prospects was the only reason. </p><p>"The whole treatment scenario in hepatitis C is changing. It's [the scale back] probably just that the product is becoming less viable. As therapeutic opportunities change it dramatically alters the system. As therapies become easier, older therapies tend to get less attractive," the head of a foreign firm told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Multiple e-mails on the issue sent through August to MSD India, Merck & Co's local arm, elicited no response. </p><p>In December 2013, Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) was approved by the US FDA and became the first drug that had demonstrated safety and efficacy to treat certain types of HCV infection without the need for co-administration of interferon. Last year Gilead entered into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">licensing deals</a> with seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Strides, Ranbaxy and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries. </p><p>Biocon subsequently joined the list of licensees, followed by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Patent-challenger-Natco-is-now-Gilead-licensee-for-Sovaldi-357020" target="_new">Natco</a>, which had previously challenged the Sovaldi patent. </p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CFO-quits-to-turn-entrepreneur-firm-cites-bench-strength-358698" target="_new">Cipla indicated</a> that its sofosbuvir had notched around 250 prescribers in just 45 days of launch and that it expected a market share of 25%. The Mumbai-based firm then told <i>Scrip</i> that the total number of hepatitis C patients requiring therapy was estimated at approximately 100,000 and with the introduction of sofosbuvir in India, the number of patients expected to be enrolled may reach 30,000 each year. </p><p>Significantly, the interferon alfa 2b market in India appears to be at a near standstill with at least half a dozen brands, including Sanofi Pasteur group firm Shantha Biotechnics' Shanferon (interferon alpha-2b), reporting no or then negligible sales as per the AIOCD AWACS data. </p><p>Shantha told <i>Scrip</i> that it had stopped manufacturing Shanferon in December 2009. </p><p>"The last batch of Shanferon was supplied to the market in October 2010. The reason behind this move was to focus primarily on the vaccines, in line with Shantha's mission of providing high quality affordable vaccines with access to all."</p><h2>Peginterferon alfa 2a</h2><p>Not everyone, though, seems to buy the theory that the market for peginterferon will become obsolete in India.</p><p>Roche, whose portfolio includes the chronic HCV treatment, Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) &ndash; now available as Exxura in India &ndash; told <i>Scrip</i> that India was predominantly a genotype 3-market, where some protocols recommend the usage of peginterferon alfa 2a in combination with direct acting antiretrovirals, to provide maximum benefit to the patients. </p><p>Roche also noted how the 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommends a peg-based triple therapy (combination of pegylated INF + ribavirin + sofosbuvir) for the treatment of HCV across genotypes along with INF-free options. </p><p>"This becomes even more relevant in the Indian context where predominantly patients are of genotype 3 &ndash; where a triple-drug regime would be one of the preferred options. Additionally, peginterferon is also indicated for certain populations of patients suffering from hepatitis B, which is why a market for peginterferon will continue to exist," the company told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Earlier this year Roche was reported to have effected a sharp cut in the price of Exxura. Roche said that the Exxura was available at a substantially lower price 65% less than its original price across all public sector institutions in India. </p><p>"The move to reduce its cost of therapy is in line with Roche's commitment to treating patients with hepatitis C," it added.</p><p>Sovaldi's efficacy has been established in subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma meeting Milan criteria (awaiting liver transplantation) and those with HCV/HIV-1 co-infection. Monotherapy of Sovaldi is not recommended for treatment chronic hepatitis C (CHC) &ndash; it should be used in combination with ribavirin or in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for the treatment of CHC in adults, the FDA said at the time of the product's approval.</p>
