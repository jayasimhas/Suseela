<p>The UK government has provided further details of a review that is intended to improve the speed at which medical innovation gets to patients. It also announced that it would be led by the erstwhile Department of Health permanent secretary and current NHS hospital trust chair Sir Hugh Taylor, supported by an expert advisory group headed by Professor Sir John Bell, REgius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. </p><p>The Innovative Medicines and Medtech Review, a flagship project for the new life sciences minister George Freeman, has been welcomed by industry as an opportunity to position the UK as a leader in the development as well as the deployment of innovative therapies and related products.</p><p>The review will examine three areas of potential reform: regulation (how to speed up the assessment of innovative therapies, for example); reimbursement (how to adapt health economic assessment systems to reflect technological advances in genomics, precision medicine and informatics, while reducing time spent and risk in the traditional R&D model, and pioneering new models of reimbursement for innovation; and uptake (how the NHS can support and drive medical innovation).</p><p>"I don't think any country has got it right for the businesses that are going to emerge as technology companies come together with healthcare companies come together with biotech companies, and that's what's exciting about this review: the opportunity that lies in it for the future," Steve Bates, CEO of the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA), told <i>Scrip Intelligence.</i> "The UK has set the benchmark in its breakthrough science in many of the areas in which the next generation of healthcare companies are likely to be built. We now have to set the benchmark with some of the other things you need in an ecosystem to turn that into a thriving economy and most crucially rapid adoption of next generation therapies for patients. That's what I hope this review can do."</p><p>He noted also that whereas "in the old days" the link between access to medicines for patients in a country and the level of investment by the biopharma industry there was less tight, "nowadays, there is an immediate feedback loop with personalized medicine. If you look at the NHS potential on data and then the ability to feed that back through modern types of manufacturing where you need quality and regulatory systems in place, the UK is a great place to develop and sell drugs to the NHS, then you can make that feedback loop happen much faster. That's within grasp for the next generation. It's becoming increasingly important as the data feedback comes out of the NHS to go back into the companies, and then you get a virtuous circle of the two feeding each other: that's the trick in the next period of time."</p><p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said the UK "lags behind comparable countries when it comes to patients seeing the benefit of new medicines" and added that improving access could help patients and also "unlock the value of the life sciences sector." It said the review had "the potential to create a reformed health system fit for the 21st century" &ndash; but cautioned that it would need to reconsider the role and the methods of the health technology assessment body NICE, as well as its alignment with the NHS.</p><p>Mr Bates said it was important to seize this "brief window of opportunity" and encouraged companies in the space to engage in the process and be confident &ndash; but also to be patient. The outcome of the review is expected in the autumn, but it will likely to take some time longer to see changes implemented, particularly where legislation may be needed.</p><p>The news of the review comes in the run-up to the UK's general election in May, but its aims enjoy cross-party support. It coincided with the news that Merck & Co's Keytruda, yet to be approved in the EU, will shortly be made available to patients in the UK under the country's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS), which was launched a year ago to bring innovative therapies to patients in need of life-saving medicines even before they are licensed (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-UK-patients-to-get-Mercks-Keytruda-after-landmark-early-access-decision-357232" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 11 March 2015</a>).</p>
