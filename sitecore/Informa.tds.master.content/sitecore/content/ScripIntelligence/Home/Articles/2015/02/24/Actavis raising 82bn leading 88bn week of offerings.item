<p>Actavis recently launched an offering of ordinary and preferred shares that will raise $8.2bn to fund the company's cash obligation in its $66bn purchase of Allergan, which is expected to close in March or April.</p><p>The Actavis offering led an active week of fundraising by public pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies between 23 and 27 February. AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Relypsa, Xencor, Lion Biotechnologies and Curis said they will raise $555.9m combined &ndash; more than $100m each on average.</p><p>This year has seen a flurry of public biopharma stock offerings and convertible note sales to fund drug development and commercialization as well as to build up cash reserves in case a compelling acquisition opportunity arises. Twelve companies launched offerings to raise up to $2.6bn immediately following the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in mid-January, which typically sets the tone for investor sentiment for the industry each year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Up-to-2.6bn-in-post-JP-Morgan-stock-offerings-plus-six-IPO-updates-356349" target="_new">25 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Actavis is selling 13.2m ordinary shares at $288 each for $3.7bn in gross proceeds and the company will gross $4.5bn from the sale of 4.6m 5.5% Series A convertible shares priced at $1,000 each. The money will be combined with proceeds from additional debt financing to fund the cash portion of Actavis's Allergan buyout.</p><p>Actavis agreed in November to pay $129.22 in cash plus 0.3683 Actavis shares per outstanding Allergan share under the companies' acquisition agreement (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>). With 300.24m outstanding shares at last count, Actavis will have to pay Allergan shareholders $38.8bn.</p><p>Details of the other five major stock offerings announced during the last week of February are listed in the table below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Offering terms</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Use of proceeds</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AMAG Pharmaceuticals;</p><p>Waltham, Massachusetts</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AMAG priced almost 4m shares at $44 each to gross $175m.
