<p>Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark, two US pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that have been increasingly vocal about high drug prices, have revised their formularies for 2016 and cut dozens of brand-name therapies from the lists of pharmaceutical products that they will cover on behalf of their health plan clients. </p><p>Express Scripts and CVS, with input from independent scientific advisors, seem to think that some pharma companies did a better job than others of proving value and offering acceptable prices and discounts for their products. The two PBMs excluded many of the same drugs, but went in opposite directions on others. Notably, Express Scripts favored Eli Lilly & Co.'s insulin products over insulins sold by Novo Nordisk, but CVS kept Novo's <i>Novolin</i> and <i>Novolog</i> on its formulary while excluding Lilly's <i>Humalog</i> and <i>Humulin</i>.</p><p><b>Calling Out Pharma Prices</b></p><p>Express Scripts seems to be taking the lead in calling out biopharma companies over what they see as exceedingly high prices for many medicines, making Gilead Sciences with its $1,000-per-pill hepatitis C drug <i>Sovaldi</i> (sofosbuvir) and even more expensive <i>Harvoni</i> (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) the poster child for the industry's supposed excesses.</p><p>As expected following the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">exclusive deal</a> Express Scripts struck with AbbVie in late 2014, the PBM included the pharma company's four-pill hepatitis C treatment <i>Viekira Pak</i> (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir) on its formulary and excluded Sovaldi and Harvoni for the treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C. Sovaldi will be covered for patients with genotypes 2, 3, 5 and 6 hepatitis C, but only with prior authorization from Express Scripts.</p><p>CVS/Caremark struck a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gileads-CVS-exclusive-may-best-AbbVies-Express-Scripts-hepatitis-C-deal-355940" target="_new">deal with Gilead</a> in January that favors Sovaldi and Harvoni, so CVS excluded Viekira Pak on its updated formulary and included Harvoni. </p><p>Both the Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark formularies pertain to about 25m patients covered by public and private health plans that use the PBMs' services. </p><p>The table below shows diabetes drugs listed in the Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark formulary updates. It illustrates how the PBMs' coverage decisions are the same in some areas, but diverge in others.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Pharma

Testosterone and More</b></p><p>There were several other notable exclusions from the Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark formularies, as described here:</p><p>*Amgen said during its second quarter 2015 earnings conference call that its erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) <i>Aranesp</i> (darbepoetin alfa) and <i>Epogen</i> (epoetin alfa) are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Q2-sales-rise-but-growth-depends-on-Repatha-and-beyond-359713" target="_new">losing market share</a> to Roche's <i>Mircera</i> (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta), so news that Express Scripts will exclude Mircera probably brings little comfort to Amgen and its investors, since the biotech giant's blockbuster ESAs also will not be covered by the PBM. <i>Procrit</i> (epoetin alfa) from Johnson & Johnson's Janssen subsidiary will remain on the Express Scripts formulary.</p><p>*Express Scripts, but not CVS, also updated its stance on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other therapies that treat inflammatory diseases, including arthritis &ndash; an indication with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/A-test-for-anti-TNF-non-responders-Few-alternative-RA-therapies-available-359693" target="_new">few treatment options</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-RA-pipeline-has-limited-new-options-359695" target="_new">little in development</a> beyond anti-TNF therapies. </p><p>The PBM will cover the TNF inhibitors <i>Enbrel</i> (etanercept) from Amgen and <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) from AbbVie regardless of the indication, but reimbursement for Janssen's <i>Simponi</i> (golimumab) 100mg is limited to ulcerative colitis. Janssen's <i>Stelara</i> (ustekinumab), which targets Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23, also is included on the PBM's formulary. Excluded medicines for inflammatory diseases are Simponi 50mg, Pfizer's oral JAK inhibitor <i>Xeljanz</i> (tofacitinib) and UCB's TNF inhibitor <i>Cimzia</i> (certolizumab). </p><p>*Express Scripts did not provide an update on excluded multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies, but CVS excluded EMD Serono's <i>Rebif</i> (interferon beta-1a). Rebif is one of European parent company Merck KGaA's top-selling products, but first quarter 2015 sales <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pharma-sales-growth-at-Merck-KGaA-amid-transformation-358501" target="_new">declined 16%</a> year-over-year. </p><p>Included on the CVS formulary are EMD Serono's oral <i>Gilenya</i> (fingolimod) and Biogen Idec's <i>Tecfidera</i> (dimethyl fumarate) along with the injectable MS therapies <i>Plegridy</i> (peginterferon beta-1a) from Biogen, Novartis's <i>Extavia</i> (interferon beta-1b) and Teva Pharmaceutical's <i>Copaxone</i> (glatiramer), which is facing its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-cautiously-optimistic-on-Copaxone-despite-generic-359707" target="_new">first generic competition</a>.</p><p>*In inflammatory bowel disease, which has seen a lot of consolidation of therapies under a smaller number of companies, Express Scripts and CVS excluded <i>Asacol</i> (mesalamine) and <i>Delzicol</i> (mesalamine), which were marketed by Warner Chilcott when it was acquired by Actavis. That was before Actavis bought Allergan and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">changed its name to Allergan</a>. </p><p>Both PBMs still cover <i>Apriso</i> (mesalamine) from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which recently bought the drug in its $15bn Salix Pharmaceuticals <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-completes-Salix-purchase-357658" target="_new">acquisition</a>, as well as Shire's <i>Lialda</i> (mesalamine) and <i>Pentasa</i> (mesalamine) from Ferring Pharmaceuticals. CVS also kept <i>Uceris</i> (budesonide), another drug Valeant acquired from Salix, on its formulary. Express Scripts excluded UCB's <i>Dipentum</i> (olsalazine).</p><p>*Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark generally agreed on coverage for topical testosterone products, which is a category with several competitors. Both PBMs excluded <i>Natesto</i> and <i>Testim</i> from Endo Pharmaceuticals as well as <i>Vogelxo</i> from Upsher-Smith Laboratories. However, Endo's Testim was excluded from Express Scripts formulary, but remains on the CVS list. AbbVie's <i>Androgel</i> and Lilly's <i>Axiron</i> will be covered by Express Scripts, but CVS excluded Androgel.</p><p>The PBMs' decisions are particularly troubling for Endo, which has been building up its portfolio of men's health products, most recently with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Endo-wins-over-Auxilium-QLT-dropped-354371" target="_new">acquisition of Testim</a> and related assets through its $2.2bn purchase of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals. It's the second part of a one-two punch to Endo's testosterone franchise after the US FDA said in March that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-imposes-heart-attack-stroke-warnings-on-testosterones-357055" target="_new">stroke and heart attack warnings</a> must be added to the labels of testosterone replacement therapies. </p><p>*In yet another blow to Endo, Express Scripts excluded the erectile dysfunction drug <i>Stendra</i> (avanafil) from its 2016 formulary. Stendra was developed by Vivus, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Auxilium-licenses-Vivuss-erectile-dysfunction-drug-Stendra-347279" target="_new">licensed the drug</a> to Auxilium in 2013.</p><p>Both Express Scripts and CVS will reimburse costs for the Pfizer and Lilly erectile dysfunction drugs <i>Viagra</i> (sildenafil) and <i>Cialis</i> (tadalafil), and both PBMs exclude Bayer's <i>Levitra</i> (vardenafil). Express Scripts also blocked GSK's <i>Staxyn</i> (vardenafil) from its formulary.</p><p>*Express Scripts excluded three transmucosal fentanyl analgesics, including Galena Biopharma's <i>Abstral</i> and <i>Subsys</i> from Insys Therapeutics. The exclusions are an additional disappointment for the specialty pharma companies' investors, considering Insys has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Insys-TetraLogic-Corcept-Mallinckrodt-Celsus-348749" target="_new">under investigation</a> for its Subsys marketing practices since 2013 and Galena bought Abstral in 2013 to generate revenue and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/No-pain-no-gain-Galena-buys-US-Abstral-rights-from-Orexo-341272" target="_new">create a sales force</a> ahead of commercialization of its cancer treatments. Galena is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SEC-probe-hits-Galena-hard-350750" target="_new">under investigation</a> for suspected securities law violations.</p><p>The only competing brand name that Express Scripts lists as an alternative to Abstral, Subsys and Teva's <i>Fentora</i> is the nasal spray <i>Lazanda</i> from Depomed, which is fighting an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lawsuits-On-The-Horizon-For-Depomed-359752" target="_new">unwanted buyout offer</a> from Horizon Pharma. </p><p><p><p><p>
