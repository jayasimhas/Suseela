<p>Mallinckrodt, a UK-based specialty biopharmaceutical company, is selling off its global contrast media and imaging delivery systems (CMDS) business to Guerbet, pharmaceutical group dedicated to medical imaging, in a transaction valued at approximately $270m. The sale is consistent with the company's stated plan to streamline its portfolio and focus on its higher-growth, higher-margin specialty brands and generics businesses. The decision was made following a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, Mallinckrodt said.</p><p>"With our strategic goals and priorities focused in the specialty biopharmaceutical space, we believe Mallinckrodt is no longer the best long-term owner for this CMDS portfolio," said CEO and president Mark Trudeau. "Given its long industry experience and strong European and South American footprint, we believe Guerbet is ideally situated to maximize the value of this business," he said. </p><p>For the first six months of 2015 sales of Mallinckrodt's CMDS business &ndash; which manufactures and markets diagnostic imaging products &ndash; were $210m. </p>
