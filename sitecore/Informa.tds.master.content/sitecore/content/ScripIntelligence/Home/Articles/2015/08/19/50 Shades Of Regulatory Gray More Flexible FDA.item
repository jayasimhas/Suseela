<p>The FDA's approval on Aug. 18 of Sprout Pharmaceuticals' libido-boosting pill Addyi (flibanserin) had some Americans scratching their heads about why the agency would give its blessing to a twice-rejected, side-effect-ridden drug and wondering if US regulators had simply crumbled under pressure from a politically charged public relations campaign.</p><p>Indeed, the FDA last week found itself embroiled in controversy over whether it was no longer being demanding enough of drug makers and was now making it too easy for products to enter the US market &ndash; with some pointing to the high approval rates in the past few years as evidence the agency has gone soft on its standards.</p><p>But the high rates of approvals also may be another sign the FDA is getting better at using the tools that science, innovation and Congress have provided, which have allowed for more regulatory flexibility &ndash; although there still are a lot of gray areas as US regulators try to figure it all out, said Greg Daniel, managing director for evidence development and innovation at the Brookings Institution's Center for Health Policy and a fellow in economic studies at the Washington think tank.</p><p>Nonetheless, those new flexibilities could be game changers for some drugs and may spur more investment overall in biopharma.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Embraces-Sex-Pill-For-Women-Restrictions-Apply-360015" target="_new">Addyi</a>, which will be marketed under <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bumps-May-Grind-Female-Sex-Pills-Sales-360016" target="_new">tight restrictions</a>, including a registration program for prescribers and pharmacies, was the 21st new molecule entity (NME) approved by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) so far in 2015. </p><p>An analysis by Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, showed the FDA has granted approvals to 89% of the NME indications in applications for which the agency has completed reviews so far this year.</p><p>The FDA, however, has a ways to go to catch up to the 41 NMEs and novel biologics <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-2014-a-year-for-orphan-drugs-anti-PD-1s-2nd-chancers-355915" target="_new">cleared in 2014</a> by CDER &ndash; the agency's best year since 1996, when it granted 53 approvals of new medicines. </p><p>But Brookings' Daniel argued it's "meaningless" to simply look at approval ratings without examining the outcomes of those medicines and how the drugs are helping patients.</p><p>"Why are we not saying, wow, we are getting better, safer drugs to patients, and that's a good thing?" he said. </p><p>Daniel noted it was not that long ago the FDA was being criticized for being too risk-averse &ndash; an outcome of the firestorm that erupted a decade ago over questions about why the agency ever approved Merck's Vioxx (rofecoxib), which was yanked from the market in September 2004 after it was tied to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. </p><p>"So we saw some tightening up and much more conservative approaches," he said. </p><p>While that response may have been appropriate at the time, the FDA lost part of its mission, Daniel pointed out, noting the agency is not only required to protect the nation's public health, but also to promote it.</p><p>And getting new effective and safe medicines to patients quicker, he said, falls under that latter mandate.</p><p>"There is a detriment to patients when it takes too long to get drugs to the market," Daniel said.</p><p><b>Culture Change</b></p><p>Thanks to new tools, like biomarkers and surrogate endpoints, and new study designs, like adaptive trials &ndash; intended not just to speed R&D, but to get better data &ndash; there's been a culture change at the FDA, in which regulators are now more flexible, Daniel said, although he insisted the agency has not lowered its evidentiary requirements. </p><p>He noted, however, the evidentiary standards for some of the tools, such as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/No-More-Biomarker-Fumbling-Time-to-Get-Serious-360094" target="_new">biomarkers</a>, aren't clearly black or white, but often reside in gray areas.</p><p>But Daniel said the FDA has been willing to work through the gray areas by holding workshops and other meetings and working with stakeholders to improve guidances and standards.</p><p>That willingness by the FDA may prompt some firms to pursue products they otherwise may not have attempted and could drive more investment.</p><p>Another key tool that's played a big role in the FDA's culture change, he said, is having the ability to require drug makers to develop risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) plans for medicines that carry serious potential or known risks, said Daniel, who noted the programs have been the subject of at least three forums hosted by Brookings, <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2015/05/18-rems-continuing-education" target="_new">including one in May</a>.</p><p>The FDA may require a REMS before a drug is approved or post-approval if new safety information becomes available that shows a serious risk of adverse events associated with the medicine. </p><p>Manufacturers are responsible for designing, implementing and evaluating a REMS program, although the FDA specifies the required elements.</p><p>Since gaining the authority to require the programs under the <i>FDA Amendments Act of 2007</i>, the FDA has approved more than 80 REMS, including about a half-dozen aimed at classes of drugs. </p><p>Daniel also attributed the FDA's comfort with permitting more drugs with adverse effects onto the US market to the ability to better monitor medicines in the postmarketing environment through the use of the agency's Sentinel system, an active risk identification and analysis database that uses electronic health records representing about 178 million patients from 18 healthcare plan data partners, which retain the physical and operational control over their data, to track medical product safety issues. </p><p>"The FDA can now query virtually all the major health insurance plans' data in a timely fashion to see if a brand new drug approval is actually resulting in any severe safety reactions," he said. </p><p>"Now we have more trust in our ability to monitor the safety of drugs," Daniel added, although he emphasized the FDA is still proceeding cautiously.</p><p>But with the more robust safety systems in place, the FDA can feel free to promote innovation and ensure there is a feasible path for getting promising therapies to market, he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
