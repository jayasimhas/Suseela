<p>With the US federal government spending $130bn annually on research and development, President Barack Obama has ordered his administration to seek out ways to get a better return on the nation's investment, said Dr Doug Rand, assistant director for entrepreneurship at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p>One area the White House specifically has been looking at recently is improving the government&rsquo;s processes for developing human capital through finding better ways to transfer knowledge between the private and public sectors, Dr Rand told the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during a 9 January update on improving US lab-to-market activities.</p><p>The question the White House has been wrangling with is "how do we get more individuals with really deep private-sector expertise into the government, into the national labs, not just to go hunting for the one promising technology that they are going to pop out and form a company around in their next act, but really to deeply embed in an agency," he said.</p><p>Dr Rand noted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has had some "promising" success with pioneering programs, in which it has brought in private-sector experts to evaluate the agency's portfolio.</p><p>He pointed to the Innovation-Corps program, launched last June, as one of NIH's most recent endeavors at improving human capital. The program is aimed at teaching drug, diagnostic and device startups funded by the agency smarter and more focused processes for commercializing their products (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-I-Corps-takes-startups-on-focused-path-to-commercialization-355648" target="_new">15 December 2014</a>).</p><p>You may also read this article at US Capitol Capsule <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p>
