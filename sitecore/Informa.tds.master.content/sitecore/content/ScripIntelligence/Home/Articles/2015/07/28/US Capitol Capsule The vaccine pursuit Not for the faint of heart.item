<p>With the successes in the past few weeks of vaccines for Ebola and malaria &ndash; both being described as game-changers for the diseases they are intended to prevent &ndash; the industry and researchers have much to celebrate.</p><p>But the achievements for those products, in particular, have neither been easy, nor fast, although the pace was sped up in the past year for the Ebola vaccine out of fear the virus would spread, even though malaria has killed much greater numbers of people &ndash; 11,300 versus 550,000, respectively, in the past year. </p><p>Nonetheless, researchers were able to report on 31 July that Merck's and NewLink's experimental Ebola vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/MerckNewLink-Ebola-vaccine-100-effective-in-Guinea-trial-359726" target="_new">100% effective</a> in protecting adults in Guinea potentially exposed to the disease as early as 10 days after being vaccinated.</p><p>And GlaxoSmithKline <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-Mosquirix-vaccine-clears-EU-hurdle-but-is-no-complete-answer-to-malaria-359609" target="_new">won a positive opinion</a> from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the firm's malaria vaccine Mosquirix, also known as RTS,S, for approval in children 6 weeks to 17 months. </p><p>Mosquirix, which GSK spent about 30 years developing, would be the first malaria vaccine available anywhere in the world.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) still must finish its review of the vaccine and sign off on its use before the company can roll it out.</p><p>GSK plans to sell Mosquirix at cost, plus 5%, so the London firm is unlikely to see a profit.</p><p>It's unclear whether Merck and others pursuing an Ebola vaccine, which includes GSK, will make any big profits from those products, given it's not yet known who will cover the costs of buying them.</p><p>But Merck has fared well in other parts of its vaccine business, which includes its product that target the human papillomavirus, Gardasil, which brought in $1.7bn in 2014, and its shingles shot Zostavax, which racked in $765m.</p><p>Pfizer also has done well in the vaccine market, particularly with its pneumococcal shot Prevnar 13, whose sales climbed to $1.5bn in the second quarter, up from $1.1bn for the same period a year earlier, or 37%.</p><p>The company in June agreed to buy two meningitis vaccines from GSK &ndash; Nimenrix and Mencevax.</p><p>Pfizer recently gained approval of its meningitis B vaccine, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-breakthrough-meningitis-B-vaccine-OKd-beats-Novartis-354744" target="_new">Trumenba</a>, which is competing with Bexsero, which was Novartis' product, now owned by GSK.</p><p>Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, whose vaccine sales unit had been experiencing declining sales, decided last year to get out of that business &ndash; divesting its influenza products to CSL, which acquired it for $275m, and its non-influenza vaccines to GSK for $7.1bn plus royalties.</p><p>Novartis finalized its deal with GSK in March, but just announced on 3 August it had completed its transaction with CSL.</p><p>CSL is calling its new combined vaccine business Seqirus &ndash; a name derived from "securing health for all of us," said Mr Paul Perreault, CEO and managing director at the Australian company.</p><p>He said Gordon Naylor, who currently is the chief financial officer at CSL, will run Seqirus, which Mr Perreault said will be the second largest influenza vaccines business in the $4bn global industry, coming in behind Sanofi &ndash; with manufacturing plants in the US, UK, German and Australia and commercial presence in about 20 countries.</p><p>Pursuing influenza vaccines especially "is not for the faint of heart," Mr Perreault told <i>Scrip</i>. "This stuff is hard."</p><p>Companies must reformulate their flu shots every year, with that process starting six months beforehand, he explained.</p><p>The FDA and the WHO choose the influenza strains each year for the vaccines &ndash; in February for the Northern Hemisphere and September for the Southern.</p><p>Meanwhile, by the time the companies have produced their flu vaccines, there could be some drift in the strains, meaning there's been some mutation of a strain selected for the vaccine &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">like last season</a> with the predominantly circulating H3N2 virus, when the shot had only a 23% effectiveness rate &ndash; or there could be a shift in the strains altogether, with a new virus popping up, Mr Perreault said.</p><p>"There will always be a mismatch in strain," he said, noting most of the time the vaccine effectiveness rate is around 70%.</p><p>It's not that the shot was not effective last year, Mr Perreault said.</p><p>"It was just not as effective as we'd like it to be," he said.</p><p>Lawmakers late last week sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell wanting to know what the mismatch risks are for the 2015-16 US flu season &ndash; demanding to know if the agency has any contingency plans in place.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said having a universal flu vaccine could solve the problems with having to select a new strain on an annual basis.</p><p>He noted that researchers from his agency recently reported positive results of an experimental universal flu vaccine that he said were impressive. </p><p>The NIAID researchers created a vaccine cocktail incorporating four of the 16 different subtypes of hemagglutinin &ndash; H1 and H3, which are commonly found in seasonal flu, and H5 and H7, which are avian influenza viruses. </p><p>The experimental vaccine was made from non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) that stimulated an immune response, but could not replicate or cause disease, Dr Fauci explained. </p><p>Preclinical results reported late last month showed that the VLP cocktail not only protected mice against the subtype viruses contained the vaccine, but also against other H subtypes, like H2, which wasn't in the vaccine, "which means this broad array of a cocktail induces not only the specific immune response, but also crosses over into related viruses that were not even in the vaccine cocktail," Dr Fauci told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>About 95% of the mice administered the cocktail vaccine were protected against eight strains of flu &ndash; surpassing the team's expectations.</p><p>"So that's really very interesting," Dr Fauci said.</p><p>The next step is to take the experimental universal flu vaccine candidate into ferrets, he said.</p><p>"But I'm really impressed with the breadth of this response," Dr Fauci said.</p><p>Mr Perreault said his company is in the early stages of pursuing a universal flu vaccine. </p><p>According to <i>Citeline</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, there are about a dozen companies in preclinical development with a universal seasonal influenza vaccine.</p><p>BiondVax Pharmaceuticals and Immune Targeting Systems also each have products in Phase II development, while Inovio has one in Phase I testing, <i>Citeline's</i> data showed.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/MerckNewLink-Ebola-vaccine-100-effective-in-Guinea-trial-359726" target="_new">Merck/NewLink Ebola vaccine 100% effective in Guinea trial</a></p><p>Early results of an experimental Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck and its partner NewLink, which licensed the product from the Canadian government, showed the candidate, known as rVSV-ZEBOV, was 100% effective in protecting humans against the virus in a Phase III ring study being conducted in Guinea, researchers reported in the medical journal <i>The Lancet</i> on 31 July.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stalled-TPP-gives-generics-more-time-to-push-back-359736" target="_new">Stalled TPP gives generics more time to push back</a></p><p>Generic drug makers and others who oppose certain portions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal will have more time to try to convince negotiators and ministers to change course after the 12 nations involved failed to reach an agreement at what the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) had hoped would be the final meeting of the pact in Hawaii.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Territorial-systems-patent-boxes-urged-for-US-tax-reform-359712" target="_new">Territorial systems, 'patent boxes' urged for US tax reform</a></p><p>The US may be getting closer to adopting lower corporate tax rates, territorial-like systems and incentives like innovation boxes, also called "patent boxes," which would put the nation more in line with other developed countries &ndash;

playing a major role in the overall acceleration in dollars spent on US healthcare for 2014, government actuaries said on 28 July</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nearly-200-RandD-labs-stung-by-anthrax-debacle-359663" target="_new">Nearly 200 R&D labs stung by anthrax debacle</a></p><p>US government officials stunned lawmakers on 28 July by acknowledging the number of private, academic and federal laboratories that may have received live anthrax from a US military base lab in Utah had doubled from what was reported just last week &ndash;
