<p> In the wake of the recent divestment of its stake in smaller rival Ildong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Green Cross Corp., which specializes in the development and manufacturing of plasma derivatives, vaccines, recombinant proteins, therapeutic antibodies and cell therapies, is now looking outside the country for possible acquisitions to grow and beef up its R&amp;D pipelines. </p> <p> <p> &quot;We would prefer to acquire foreign firms, unless a particularly good candidate emerges at home. We are primarily looking at firms in the cell and gene therapy as well as some other sectors,&quot; said B.G. Rhee, president of Green Cross Holdings. &quot;We will continue to look for other opportunities and if there is a chance, we will proceed with it anytime.&quot; </p> <p> <p> Green Cross Holdings and its two pharma affiliates - Green Cross Corp. and Green Cross Cell Corp. - have recently sold off 7.36 million shares, equivalent to a 29.36% stake, in Ildong Pharm to Ildong&rsquo;s chairman, in a move to allow Green Cross to focus on its global business (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/6/3/green-cross-daewoong-diverge-in-global-expansion-push" target="_new">&quot;Green Cross, Daewoong Diverge In Global Expansion Push&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Jun. 3, 2015 6:38 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> &quot;From the beginning, we weren't thinking of taking over the management control of Ildong Pharm despite such rumors,&quot; Rhee explained. &quot;Green Cross also fits well with other local pharmas like Daewoong or Yuhan, but Ildong has a strong OTC business, so we expected [the share investment] to create synergies in terms of R&amp;D and marketing.&rdquo; </p> <p> <p> However, it eventually became clear that there was no need for Green Cross to keep its money in Ildong's shares and the firm instead decided to look for other opportunities, said the president. </p> <p> <p> Although Green Cross had never officially revealed its intention to take over the firm, speculation that it may attempt this were raised after it hiked its stake to 15.35% by buying 1.77 million shares, and became Ildong&rsquo;s second largest shareholder in 2012. Then in January 2014, it has again bought additional shares to raise its stake to 29.36%. </p> <p> <p> Eventually, Green Cross attempted to participate in the management of Ildong, and last year it scuttled Ildong&rsquo;s plan to transform into a holding firm. Early this year, Green Cross demanded that its officials be included in Ildong&rsquo;s board, but the plan wasn&rsquo;t approved by shareholders in March. </p> <p> <p> Indeed, Green Cross has already been keeping itself busy with expansions abroad. </p> <p> <p> Last month, Green Cross Holdings invested in the clinical-stage U.S. biotech firm Juventas Therapeutics Inc. in a bid to diversify into the cell and gene therapy sector. Along with Posco Capital, Green Cross led a $7.5 million investment in the Cleveland-based company, which focuses on developing non-viral gene therapies to treat advanced cardiovascular diseases (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/5/21/green-cross-juventas-investment-shows-gene-therapy-appetite" target="_new">&quot;Green Cross Juventas Investment Shows Gene Therapy Appetite&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, May 21, 2015 4:11 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> Green Cross Holdings and Green Cross Corp. have also made investments in several overseas biotech firms including Stemedicana Cell Technologies and Argos Therapeutics Inc. in the U.S. </p> <p> <h2> Biotech Focus </h2> <p> <p> According to Rhee, South Korean firms, including Green Cross, have recently been trying to focus on cell and gene therapies as they can't compete with multinational pharma giants in other sectors. For cell and gene therapies, the gap is that much smaller and it is easier to catch up in terms of technology. </p> <p> <p> &quot;South Korea has an excellent hospital system. If the government and the pharma industry head for the right direction, then South Korean firms will be able to compete in the global markets,&quot; he said. </p> <p> <p> For the cell therapy space, it is looking to advance into other Asian countries and Russia through ways such as business partnerships, rather than building more plants. </p> <p> <p> In China, Green Cross operates a plant producing plasma derivatives and in late April signed a final contract with the Guizhou provincial government in China for an investment in the cell therapy sector. Under the contract, the company will build a production facility in the southwestern Chinese province in order to produce and distribute cell therapy products in the country. </p> <p> <p> Construction of the plant will begin late this year but financial terms weren&rsquo;t disclosed. </p> <p> <p> The firm also operates a plasma center in the U.S. and in April last year, it announced that it will build a new biologics manufacturing facility in Montreal, Canada, as part of efforts to expand its biologics business to North America. </p> <p> <p> Green Cross is also making inroads into the rapidly growing Russian pharmaceutical market through a strategic partnership with Nanolek to commercialize its biologics (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/3/31/nanotek-biologics-deal-gives-green-cross-route-to-russia" target="_new">&quot;Nanotek Biologics Deal Gives Green Cross Route To Russia&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Mar. 31, 2015 11:20 PM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <h2> Pipeline </h2> <p> <p> Speaking on its R&amp;D pipeline, the president said the company has finished Phase III clinical trials for I.V.-Globulin SN (IVIG SN) in the U.S. and Canada, and plans to file for a Biologic License Application (BLA) to the U.S. FDA in September to October. Intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG) is a plasma product administered intravenously to protect the body against infection. </p> <p> <p> The FDA is expected to conduct a review early next year and if it approves the product, the company expects to launch it late next year or early 2017, he said. </p> <p> <p> &quot;This is a very important issue for us,&quot; he said. &quot;After commercialization, we expect annual sales from the Montreal plant to reach KRW300 billion [$267.4 million].&quot; </p> <p> <p> Green Cross Biotherapeutics (GCBT) kicked off construction of a biopharmaceutical facility that will be located on the Montreal Technoparc&rsquo;s Saint-Laurent Campus in June. The CAD315 million ($316 million) project represents one of the largest green field investment projects in Canada in the biopharmaceutical industry, and will be the first intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and albumin manufacturing plant in the country. </p> <p> <p> GCBT expects to annually process one million liters of plasma at this facility and targets to begin commercialization in 2019. Once it reaches full operations, GCBT expects to generate annual revenues of over CAD300 million from its own manufactured products. </p> <p> <p> However, the company is also seeking to license out GreenGene F, or third generation recombinant Factor VIII, for treating hemophilia A, which is also in Phase III clinical trials in multiple countries including the U.S., Rhee said. </p> <p> <p> &quot;Things are progressing slower for GreenGene F because of the limited number of patients and as a number of companies are also looking into this sector,&quot; he noted. </p>
