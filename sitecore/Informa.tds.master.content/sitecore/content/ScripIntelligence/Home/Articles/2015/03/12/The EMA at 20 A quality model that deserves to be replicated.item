<p><b>Despite initial industry misgivings, the European Medicines Agency has been a huge success, and initiatives like adaptive pathways and greater patient involvement show it is not resting on its laurels. But more could be done in areas such as pharmacovigilance, priority reviews and co-ordination among the agency's committees, say EFPIA's Richard Bergström and Pär Tellner.</b></p><p>When the European Medicines Agency was in the process of being established, and indeed even when it became operational in 1995, its emergence on the scene was greeted by a significant amount of scepticism in the pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>"Some people predicted that governments would never be able to agree on the same clinical trials design, comparators, endpoints or efficacy. There were also those in industry that felt it might be better to maintain all the national regulatory systems because it might not be wise to put all your eggs in one basket," says Richard Bergström, director general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations*.</p><p>Today, Mr Bergström says, without a single dissenting voice, pharmaceutical CEOs have declared that the EMA is one of the greatest positive achievements of the sector. "Similarly," he adds, "taken together, orphan drug regulations in the US and Europe and the supplementary protection certificate (SPC) scheme for patent restoration in Europe are clearly additional examples of successful legislation. This is also the case for the Innovative Medicines Initiative." In fact, not only is the EMA enthusiastic about the IMI, it is apparent that many of the ideas are actually put forward by regulators.</p><p>The EMA also has a magnificent internal vehicle for assessment: the dual rapporteur system under which two rapporteurs carry out the initial assessment of a pharmaceutical marketing application independently of each other. "This is a welcome form of healthy competition at the start and the outcomes must then be consolidated into one view. This has a created a culture of quality and is one of the reasons that the EMA has reached such a great level of decision-making and is able to steer clear of bias," Mr Bergström says.</p><p>Pär Tellner, director of regulatory affairs at EFPIA, agrees that the EMA has had a significant impact on the overall speed of the approvals process, with the introduction of the centralised marketing authorisation. Prior to the establishment of the agency, there were some member states of the EU that lagged behind in terms of timeliness.</p><p>"From that perspective, it has been a fantastic success. We have a system that is working and actually delivering," says Mr Tellner, adding that this is happening in a situation in which differences in opinion are respected and resolved within the confines of the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). "If you look from this historical perspective that we in industry often forget &ndash; because we often have our hands full with the implementation of new legislation such as pharmacovigilance and paediatrics rules &ndash; we have to say that the EMA has been a resounding success.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, other countries are so impressed with EMA that its operational model could be set for export. For example, the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which emerged out of the former Soviet Union, are looking to implement a system based on the European model. "They are considering inviting Europeans to tell them about how the EMA functions,&rdquo; says Mr Tellner.</p><p>What also impresses about the EMA, Mr Tellner adds, is that it is not resting on its laurels. "It is actually, for example, taking the life-cycle issue and supporting the need for another pathway to help progress what comes out of new science."</p><p>Moreover, the EMA is also taking on a co-ordinating role in offering joint scientific advice with health technology assessment bodies.</p><p>Mr Bergström believes that the EMA has also enjoyed success in terms of boosting the European consciousness. "By handing out an EMA base to those working for it in the individual member states, who have to travel occasionally to London, the EMA has helped foster the European identity," he says.</p><h2>Not all a bunch of roses</h2><p>It is clear for the most part that the EMA has already delivered on what was promised in terms of benefits to patients and the industry. That is not to say that there have not been a few disappointments. These, however, says Mr Bergström, have been largely outside of the agency's control.</p><p>For example, the new pharmacovigilance system that was created after the Mediator issue is "disproportionate" and, says Mr Bergström, it has been "a vehicle for added bureaucracy accompanied by increased reporting". The industry feels that there should be more focus on reaping evidence from real world data, rather than relying solely on the reporting of spontaneous events.</p><p>"Basically, the idea that you should in Europe make a central decision on pharmacovigilance issues is sound, but there remain in this area some challenges because we see that individual member states are still making their own decisions," Mr Tellner says. He points out that some member states have referred issues to the EMA, but have then taken unilateral action when they did not agree with the centralised decision.</p><p>This type of reluctance to adhere to pharmacovigilance rules of the centralised model has translated into a level of unease on the part of European regulatory affairs personnel about the comprehensive and effective delivery of the European pharmacovigilance system.</p><p>There is also a perception within industry that the EMA's various committees do not always sing from the same hymn book, and that this lack of comprehensive co-ordination erodes confidence and trust in the system. "Companies have indeed expressed concern on occasion that the PDCO [the paediatric medicines committee] might say one thing, but that a future CHMP decision may say something different," says Mr Tellner.</p><p>This is also problematic in terms of public perception, Mr Tellner suggests, because it might seem strange to publish the minutes from the meeting of a lower-ranking committee only to see its conclusions rejected by the CHMP. This raises issues of confidence in the system.</p><h2>A springboard for EU collaboration on relative efficacy?</h2><p>Some in industry also wish to press for even faster assessments from the EMA and for a priority review system for Europe. "Timelines have not become shorter &ndash; but at least the EMA has respected them," says Mr Bergström. He adds that any drive towards a priority review system would require participation and acceptance from the individual member states who contribute to making the EMA as successful as it already is &ndash; and achieving this is not always a simple matter.</p><p>What has been supported enthusiastically by the EMA and is welcomed by industry is the adaptive licensing/pathways approach in which regulatory &ndash; and even relative effectiveness assessment &ndash; processes will focus on a life-cycle approach for drugs and will be more flexible, involving all stakeholders and variable sources of data.</p><p>Going forward, it will be essential that all the world's top regulatory bodies &ndash; with the EMA at the forefront &ndash; are more aligned with each other. "Whereas regulatory harmonisation through the International Conference on Harmonisation constituted retrospective harmonisation, based on standards that had already been set, we want to ensure that for new science, standards are harmonised from the beginning," says Mr Bergström.</p><p>Among the long-term issues for the EMA are whether it can maintain the current level of high-quality service and keep to existing timelines for assessments as austerity drags on in Europe, and national health authorities in the member states cut back on these services and reorganise.</p><p>At the same time, though, the EMA has been a model for continuous evolution and modernisation within the regulatory environment. "A major step forward, for example, was the decision by the agency to start to host patient groups and eventually involve them in some of its decision-making processes, Mr Bergström notes. He suggests that the next phase might be to work together with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and payers on relative efficacy at launch and on effectiveness over time. EFPIA is currently developing a clear policy position on this.</p><p>In fact, the sheer success of the EMA and the regulatory system has already prompted calls for the same type of ideology that lay behind its establishment to be applied to the worlds of HTA and payers. There is no economic consideration in the EMA's decisions, a fact that resonates well with pharmaceutical companies. "We think this should be respected and we don't want it to go anywhere in this direction," says Mr Bergström.</p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
