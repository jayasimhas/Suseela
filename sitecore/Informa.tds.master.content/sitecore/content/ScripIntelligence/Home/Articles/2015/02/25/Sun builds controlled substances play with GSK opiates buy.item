<p>Sun Pharmaceutical Industries has acquired GlaxoSmithKline's opiates business in Australia &ndash; a move that is expected to help the Indian firm build significantly on its interests in the controlled substances space.</p><p>The deal includes GSK's related manufacturing sites in Latrobe (Tasmania) and Port Fairy (Victoria) and its portfolio of opiate products along with inventory. The portfolio essentially consists of poppy-derived opiate raw materials primarily used in analgesics for the treatment of pain. </p><p>GSK's crop handling facility at Latrobe facilitates the efficient harvesting and processing of the poppy crop, while medicinal alkaloids are extracted from the poppies at the Port Fairy site. A joint statement from the firms said that all employees from both sites will be offered employment by Sun with the opiates business. </p><p>GSK supplies 25% of the world's medicinal opiate needs from poppies grown by farmers in Tasmania, with the poppy industry there pioneered by the company in the early 1960s. More than 90% of the thebaine, codeine and morphine produced is sold to export markets, details on the firm's website said.</p><p>Iftach Seri, Sun's executive vice president, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) business, said that the global opiates market holds ''good'' potential and the addition of GSK&rsquo;s business would strengthen Sun's positioning further. The transaction, subject to various regulatory and other approvals, is expected to close by August.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that the deal would allow Sun to ramp up its controlled substances business, an area where the Indian firm had previously made a clutch of acquisitions &ndash; Chattem Chemicals, Able Laboratories and a Hungarian site.</p><p>''It appears to be a good deal, assuming the acquisition cost is moderate. Sales from the growing, acquired GSK business is estimated to be in the region of $70-90m,'' Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>In 2005, Sun acquired a facility in Hungary authorized to make controlled substance APIs, starting from the initial stage, i.e. poppy farming. In 2006, Sun completed the acquisition of the dosage form manufacturing operations of Able, which brought with it ownership and lease rights to manufacturing operations at two sites in New Jersey, including those for the manufacture of controlled substances. </p><p>In 2008, Sun snapped up the US-based registered narcotic API importer and producer, Chattem Chemicals. Chattem had been licensed by the US Drug Enforcement Administration to manufacture schedule 1 to 5 controlled substances including oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine, codeine and hydromorphone and Sun had at the time of the deal underscored its resolve to be a more active player in the US pain management segment <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-Pharma-acquires-Chattem-Chemicals-9155%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 26 November 2008)</a>. </p><p>GSK</p><p>Meanwhile, GSK said that the deal with Sun would allow it to ''simplify'' its operations in Australia and focus on its innovative product portfolio, which is core to the British multinational's growth strategy there. </p><p>While the opiates business has been an important part of GSK's Australian business, the company maintained that with portfolio transitions this was the ''right time'' to hand the business over to someone else. </p><p>Agency reports also said that GSK's decision to shed the opiates business comes as Tasmania's poppy industry is facing a tough crop and the United Nations is expected to cut the state's poppy crop area this week.</p><p>The deal with Sun also comes just as GSK and Novartis have wrapped up their landmark three-part transaction announced last April <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Its-a-wrap-GSK-and-Novartis-megadeal-completes-357034%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 3 March 2015)</a>. CEO Sir Andrew Witty has indicated that he was not ruling out a significant corporate reorganization following the closure of the deal.</p>
