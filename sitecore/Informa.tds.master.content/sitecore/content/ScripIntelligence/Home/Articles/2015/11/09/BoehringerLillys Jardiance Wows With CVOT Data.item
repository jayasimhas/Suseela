<p>"Wonderful" and "profound" were just two of the adjectives thrown around at Sept. 17's symposium presentation of Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly & Co.'s EMPA-REG OUTCOMES study, the cardiovascular outcomes trial for their type 2 diabetes therapy <i>Jardiance </i>(empagliflozin), at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. </p><p>After top-line data caused quite a stir <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Jardiance-To-Change-The-Game-In-Diabetes-360052" target="_new">last month</a>, full data from the EMPA-REG trial saw a packed room of delegates applauding, with even a smattering of cheers, at key data reveals. Lilly and Boehringer did a good job of building suspense prior to and during the data presentation &ndash; holding embargoed press releases and a <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> report under lock and key until the hour leading up to the presentation in Stockholm, Sweden. </p><p>During the results report, a graph displaying CV death decreases in patients treated with Jardiance made a steady, animated climb to display its superiority over placebo, with audible intakes of breath heard throughout the room. </p><p>And while not all areas of the trial were successful, the data are impressive &ndash; Jardiance, a selective inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), is the first diabetes drug to display a significant effect on CV deaths, producing a 38% reduction in the EMPA-REG study. That's important, because about 50% of deaths among people with type 2 diabetes are caused by CV disease. </p><p>Overall safety of Jardiance was consistent with previous trials. Incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was at or below 0.1%. Patients treated with the drug did experience an increase in genital infections, but Boehringer's Professor Klaus Dugi, medical director for UK & Ireland, told <i>Scrip</i> this was not unexpected and that the benefits of the drug far outweigh the side effects.</p><h2>Not A Class Effect</h2><p>Dugi told <i>Scrip</i> in an exclusive interview following Jardiance's data presentation at EASD that these positive results do not automatically spell a class-wide effect. Quite the opposite: "This is not a class effect, this is an empagliflozin effect," he said. </p><p>"Why do I say this? Well physicians who have been treating patients with diabetes will attest to the fact we often don't see a class effect. For example in the TZD class, one had to be taken off of the market because of liver toxicities and the other two at the time had very different results regarding CV outcomes. More recently," he noted, "the DPP-4 inhibitors: one has been associated with heart failure whereas the other DPP-4's available were not."</p><p>Furthermore he cited that just last week the FDA strengthened its warning on the risk on bone fractures with one SGLP-2 inhibitor. "We did not see this in our data," he noted. "Patients with type 2 diabetes can see very different efficacy results with different products in one class. That is why I feel very strongly about saying this is not a class effect, it is an effect of our product."</p><p>EMPA-REG involved more than 7,000 type 2 diabetes patients with proven CV disease from 42 countries observed over a median period of 3.1 years. It tested Jardiance 10mg and 25mg added to standard of care compared with placebo added to standard of care. It was designed to test the product first for non-inferiority and then superiority. The primary endpoint was defined as time to first occurrence of either CV death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke. </p><p>While the commentator on the study, Dr. Hertzel C. Gerstein, said the trial raised more questions than it answered, he said this was a positive effect. He called EMPA-REG "a very important study." Gerstein also noted that while the drug's effect on stroke or non-fatal heart attack was not superior, it was not inferior either. He also highlighted that combining these endpoints does not always work and "one should look at them separately." </p><p>The latest positive data for Jardiance has pushed it far ahead of competitors, with some spectators even suggesting the product could become a first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes patients with risk of CV disease. However, Dugi noted that more investigation of the CVOT data is needed before any big decisions are made. </p><p>Other SGLT-2s are being studied in CV outcomes trials, but the results will not be available for several years. Johnson & Johnson doesn't expect to see results for <i>Invokana</i> until 2017, while AstraZeneca plc will have results on <i>Farxiga</i> (dapagliflozin) in 2019 and Merck & Co./Pfizer Inc.'s ertugliflozin won't read out until 2020.</p><h2>Full Data </h2><p>Overall, 97% of patients completed the study, with 25.4% of patients prematurely discontinuing. Final vital status was available for 99.2% of patients.</p><p>The primary outcome occurred in a significantly lower percentage of patients in the empagliflozin group (490 of 4687 [10.5%]) than in the placebo group (282 of 2333 [12.1%]). The trial saw p<0.001 for="" non-inferiority="" and="" p="0.04" for="" superiority.=""></0.001></p><p>The key secondary outcome, which included hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris as well as the other CV events, occurred in 599 of 4687 patients (12.8%) in the empagliflozin group and 333 of 2333 patients (14.3%) in the placebo group; p<0.001 for="" non-inferiority="" and="" p="0.08" for="" superiority.=""></0.001></p><p>All categories of death from cardiovascular causes contributed to the reduction in cardiovascular death in the empagliflozin group. However, there were no significant between-group differences in the occurrence of myocardial infarction or stroke.</p><p>Lilly and Boehringer <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-attracts-Boehringer-Ingelheim-to-diabetes-venture-308490" target="_new">teamed up to develop Jardiance</a>, the latter firm's drug, amongst other diabetes programs in 2011. The CV outcomes trial for the drug had been planned before the start of this alliance.</p><p><p><p>
