<p>Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and Eli Lilly are revamping the operational structure of their diabetes alliance in India &ndash; among the few markets where going solo is expected to improve efficiencies and launch focus in the segment.</p><p>BI India country manager, Sharad Tyagi, said that under a revised agreement, going forward, BI and Lilly will commercialize the respective molecules they brought to the alliance in India. </p><p>The duo's three-year long alliance in India had jointly commercialized BI's oral anti-diabetics Trajenta (linagliptin) and Trajenta Duo(linagliptin/metformin) as well as contemporary injectable insulins like Humalog from the Lilly stable. These will now revert to their respective firms. </p><p>"BI India has robust plans of strengthening its presence in diabetes by increased focus on product launches in oral diabetes. Similarly Lilly has increased focus on its insulin business," Mr Tyagi told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The Indian diabetes market is valued at around INR64bn($1.02bn) and growing at 22%, of which oral anti-diabetes therapies account for roughly INR49.5bn (+23%).Almost 90% of prescriptions in India are believed to be for oral anti-diabetes therapies.</p><p>Late October last year, BI and Lilly said that they expect to change the operational and financial structure of their diabetes alliance in certain countries &ndash; some of which were expected to transition to exclusive promotion in 2015. The partners, though, then explained that 17 countries representing more than 90% percent of the alliance&rsquo;s anticipated market opportunity will continue their co-promotion work. In all other countries, the partners will exclusively commercialize the respective molecules they brought to the alliance.</p><p>In 2012, BI and Lilly had launched Boehringer's once-daily dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Trajenta 5mg, in India at <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Trajenta-launched-in-India-at-fraction-of-international-prices-331797%5d" target="_new">a fraction of its international prices</a>. The partners had then also indicated that Humalog had reported significant growth under their co-promotion initiative. </p><p>Products such as Jardiance (empagliflozin), currently "under regulatory approval" in India and expected to be launched in due course, would be marketed by BI in India under the new structure. </p><p>Mr Tyagi added that BI expects to expand its sales force in India, but gave no specifics. Currently more than 60% of BI's field force in India is focused on diabetes.</p><p>Asked whether the alliance's combined field force, believed to have comprised about 375 personnel, would be split between the partners or then dismantled, BI said: "The field force was equally contributed by BI/Lilly and after the end of the alliance, BI will increase its field force to maintain same coverage."</p><p>On how BI expects to ensure no confusion among healthcare professionals on the changed strategy and going solo, given the highly competitive diabetes space in India, BI said: "Together with Eli Lilly (India), we will ensure a seamless transition for HCPs and patients."</p><p>Significantly, in 2011, Lilly and India's Lupin had linked up to <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lilly-Lupin-link-revs-up-Indian-diabetes-319366%5d" target="_new">promote and distribute</a> Lilly's human insulin range of products in India and Nepal, then doubling doctor reach for the products to about 45,000. In 2013-14 Lupin's "Metabolics" divison, which handles the promotion of the Lilly range, had introduced a patient support and awareness service, "Humrahi" with 31 diabetes educators aimed at supporting, educating and counselling patients on diabetes and its effective management. Last year, Lupin inked a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-to-market-LG-Lifes-glargine-in-India-353230%5d" target="_new">pact</a> to introduce LG Life Sciences's insulin glargine on the Indian market. </p><p>The restructured BI-Lilly alliance also comes at a time when BI has been gearing to move into the oncology segment, with products such as afatinib. Mr Tyagi had previously indicated that BI was evaluating a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/INTERVIEW-New-products-key-to-B-Ingelheims-long-haul-Indian-plans-348680%5d" target="_new">pricing approach</a> to "facilitate access" to afatinib and had commenced capacity building activity in the oncology segment ahead of the potential launch. </p>
