<p>The overuse of antibiotics is being blamed for the nearly 500,000 infections caused each year by <i>Clostridium difficile</i> &ndash; a hard-to-treat pathogen that kills more than 29,000 Americans annually within 30 days of a diagnosis, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on 25 February.</p><p>While most of those <i>C diff</i> infections were contracted by people while they were inpatients at a hospital, 150,000 were acquired in the "community," likely at doctor or dentist offices or outpatient facilities.</p><p>Nursing home residents are hit especially hard by <i>C difficile</i> &ndash; with about 100,000 infections each year at those facilities, the CDC investigators reported in an <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1408913?query=featured_home" target="_new">article</a> published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>In fact, more than 80% of the deaths associated with <i>C diff</i> occurred among Americans 65 years or older. </p><p><i>C difficile</i> causes an inflammation of the colon and deadly diarrhea, said Dr Michael Bell, deputy director of the CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. </p><p>In the past, he said, the diarrhea that was associated with <i>C difficile</i> often was perceived as a nuisance, but not a major problem. </p><p>Now, however, the type of <i>C diff</i> circulating in the US "produces such a powerful toxin that it can cause a truly deadly diarrhea," Dr Bell told reporters during a 25 February media briefing.</p><p>Unfortunately, <i>C diff</i> is very easy to spread &ndash; and often does so by healthcare workers that have failed to thoroughly wash their hands and wear gloves or because equipment is not cleaned well, he said.</p><p>Dr Bell pointed out that hand sanitizers don't kill C diff spores. </p><p>People who take antibiotics are vulnerable for contracting C diff, he said.</p><p>Antibiotics damage the normal bacteria in a person's intestines and create the opportunity for <i>C diff</i> to take over. Once infected with the deadly pathogen, it can be very difficult to restore the normal balance of intestinal bacteria needed for health, Dr Bell said.</p><p>Patients receiving antibiotics are at risk for intense illness, which can include damage to the bowels so painful and severe that part of the colon needs to be surgically removed &ndash; a condition known as toxic megacolon, he said. </p><p>And even though a patient may recover from <i>C diff</i>, they can easily relapse.</p><p>Indeed, at least one in five relapse, Dr Bell declared. </p><p>"This is a very severe illness that causes tremendous suffering and death," he said. </p><p><b>Efforts to battle C diff</b></p><p><i>C diff</i> will continue to spread, with illnesses and deaths climbing until antibiotics are used more appropriately and healthcare workers practice good infection control, Dr Bell said. </p><p>"If we can improve antibiotic prescribing we expect to see rates of <i>C difficile</i> infections improve dramatically," he said. </p><p>Dr Bell said there is good evidence to back up that statement based on the 60% drop of <i>C diff</i> infections in England because of that nation's improvements in antibiotic prescribing. </p><p>He pointed out that better antibiotic prescribing is part of President Barack Obama's national strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) launched last fall (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Most recently, the president called on Congress to double the nation's current investment in battling AMR &ndash; requesting $1.2bn in his fiscal year 2016 budget to help battle AMR (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Mr Obama's proposal includes a plan to create an AMR clinical trial network aimed at rapidly testing new medicines against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which will be run by the National Institutes of Health, backed by $100m in new funding.</p><p>He also asked for $100m in new funds for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the development of new antibiotic therapies and diagnostics.</p><p>There currently is only a few drugs approved in the US to treat <i>C diff</i>, including Dificid (fidaxomicin), marketed by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, now part of Merck, and Vancocin (vancomycin), which was developed by ViroPharma, which was acquired in early 2014 by Shire.</p><p>There are several products to combat <i>C diff</i> in the pipeline, however, from companies like Merck, Shire, Pfizer, Actelion, Summit Therapeutics, AmpliPhi Biosciences, Synthetic Biologics and Rebiotix, among others, according to Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
