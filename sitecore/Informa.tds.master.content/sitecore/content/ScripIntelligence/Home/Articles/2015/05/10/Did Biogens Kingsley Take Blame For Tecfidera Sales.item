<p>The timing of Biogen's Oct. 9 announcement that Tony Kingsley, executive vice president of global commercial operations, is leaving the company came at an unfortunate time &ndash; just weeks before third quarter earnings will reveal whether <i>Tecfidera</i> (dimethyl fumarate) sales are growing, stable or sliding.</p><p>Biogen's stock ended the day down 3.8% at $269.16 per share, which is the company's lowest closing price of the year, as investors and analysts wondered whether Kingsley's departure &ndash; either voluntarily or at the request of his employer &ndash; is a sign that sales for Tecfidera and the rest of the company's multiple sclerosis franchise continued to disappoint in the third quarter. </p><p>Tecfidera quickly became a blockbuster drug and Biogen's top-selling product with $883.3m in sales during the second quarter of 2015 when the company declared that it was the top-selling oral MS therapy in the US. Even so, sales this year have come in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogen-too-slow-to-act-on-MandA-359628" target="_new">below analyst consensus and investor expectations</a>, and the sales growth rate has slowed as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogens-Tecfidera-Dogged-By-PML-360555" target="_new">cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy</a> (PML) have been reported in MS patients treated with the drug.</p><p>But is Kingsley to blame for Tecfidera's sales not meeting high expectations for the oral MS drug? Or is he taking the blame for sales impacted by both an emerging PML risk and rising sales for the company's own new therapies, including <i>Plegridy</i> (peginterferon beta-1a) &ndash; the only interferon for MS that's dosed every two weeks?</p><p>Back when Biogen reported full-year Tecifdera sales for 2014 that pushed the company's revenue 40% higher than in 2013, Kingsley <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tecfidera-pushes-Biogen-revenue-40-higher-in-2014-356453" target="_new">warned that PML concerns and Plegridy</a> were likely to contribute to a slowing growth curve for the oral drug. Despite those headwinds, the drug's sales are still rising &ndash; at least, they did in the first half of this year &ndash; just not as much as investors had hoped.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in his weekly video report on publicly-traded biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that the timing of Biogen's announcement that Kingsley will leave the company is "worrisome," but he noted that the move was not necessarily surprising. </p><p>"My guess is the company needed a fresh set of eyes on the [Tecfidera] franchise," Schoenebaum said.</p><p>John Cox, Biogen's executive vice president of pharmaceutical operations and technology, will take on Kingsley's job on an interim basis while the company searches for a new commercial business head.</p><p>Biogen CEO George Scangos praised Cox's 12 years of working at Biogen and his knowledge of the company's operations, but the chief executive also didn't give the impression that he's happy to see Kingsley &ndash; a five-year Biogen veteran &ndash; go. </p><p>"He led the successful introduction of five important new products and helped serve patients around the world with our life-transforming therapies. All of us wish Tony the best in his future endeavors," Scangos said in the company's public statement.</p><p>Kingsley joined Biogen in January 2010 as a senior vice president and was promoted to executive VP in November 2011, and during his tenure the company's revenue grew 108%. </p><p>Before Biogen, Kingsley worked in the medical device and diagnostic side of the life science industry as senior VP and general manager of gynecological surgical products at Hologic Inc. and as division president of diagnostic products at Cytyc Corp. Before those industry roles, he was a partner at the business advisory firm McKinsey & Company.</p><p><p><p><p>
