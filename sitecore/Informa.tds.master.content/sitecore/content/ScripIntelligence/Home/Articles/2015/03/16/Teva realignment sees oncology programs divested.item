<p>Teva Pharmaceutical has signed over worldwide rights to four oncology programs to San Diego-based Ignyta. The move comes after Teva conducted a strategic review of its core therapeutic areas under new CEO Erez Vigodman. This resulted in the decision, announced last October, to move away from oncology and woman's health and focus CNS and respiratory diseases. </p><p>Teva <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Womens-health-and-oncology-out-as-Teva-realigns-pipeline-354333" target="_new">said at the time</a> that 14 pipeline programs would be discontinued, but didn't disclose what these were. "These projects amount to more than $150m in R&D costs in 2015 and in excess of $200m for each in 2016 and 2017," it stated.</p><p>Teva handed over the four oncology programs in exchange for 1.5 million shares (6%) of Ignyta's common stock. Concurrently, Ignyta has entered into stock purchase agreements with Teva and selected additional healthcare investors, whereby Teva will purchase a further 1.5 million shares of common Ignyta stock at a price of $10 per share in a registered direct offering. The other investors will purchase an additional 2.7 million shares at $10 per share, valuing the total offering at around $41.6m. </p><p>"Teva has committed to finding novel ways for the ongoing development of early clinical stage and preclinical oncology R&D programs," said Michael Hayden, Teva's president of global R&D and CSO on the latest news. "Ignyta's capabilities and focus in oncology will give these assets the best chance of realizing their potential for patients, and of maximizing their value for Teva."</p><p>Acquiring the four programs from Teva is "truly transformational", added Dr Jonathan Lim, chairman and CEO of Ignyta. "These oncology programs add critical mass to our pipeline and further enable us to leverage our precision oncology platform. These new assets [also] complement our entrectinib development program and extend our ability to target the majority of known oncogenic drivers across multiple solid tumor indications."</p><p>The development programs Ignyta purchased from Teva include: </p><p>?CEP-32496, which Ignyta has renamed RXDX-105, a potent small molecule inhibitor of BRAF, EGFR and RET that is currently in a Phase I/II dose escalation trial; </p><p>?CEP-40783, which Ignyta has renamed RXDX-106, a potent, highly selective, pseudo-irreversible inhibitor of AXL and cMET that is in late preclinical development; </p><p>?CEP-40125, which Ignyta has renamed RXDX-107, a nanoformulation of a modified bendamustine with potential activity in solid tumors that is in late preclinical development; and </p><p>?TEV-44229, which Ignyta has renamed RXDX-108, a potent, selective inhibitor of the atypical kinase PKCiota that is in preclinical studies. Ignyta has also acquired next generation PKCiota inhibitors in addition to the lead compound. </p><p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/4Q-EARNINGS-Teva-talks-MandA-after-solid-2014-356606" target="_new">Teva talks M&A after solid 2014</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/3Q-EARNINGS-Tevas-Copaxone-sales-surprise-boosts-stock-354762" target="_new">Teva's Copaxone sales surprise boosts stock</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Teva-faces-further-disruption-as-company-reorganizes---again-352150" target="_new">Teva faces further disruption as company reorganizes - again</a></p><p>
