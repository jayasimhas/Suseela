<p>Every year, the US president delivers a large document to Congress outlining the administration's spending wish list, and every year, lawmakers from the opposing party quickly declare it dead on arrival.</p><p>Therefore, it was fitting that budget day this year fell on Groundhog Day &ndash; wherein just like the Bill Murray movie, Washington was stuck in a time loop, in which much of the same criticisms that came from Capitol Hill were reruns from a year earlier.</p><p>Remarks came fast and furious from the trade groups representing the innovator biopharmaceutical industry about President Barack Obama&rsquo;s proposal in his nearly $4tn fiscal year 2016 budget to grant authority to the head of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prices of high-cost drugs &ndash; the definition of which officials said must be decided by Congress.</p><p>The Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also objected to the president&rsquo;s proposals to trim down the exclusivity protection from innovator biologics &ndash; something not likely to happen in the Republican-controlled Congress. </p><p>Nonetheless, President Obama insisted his FY 2016 budget request would replace the "mindless austerity" of lawmakers imposed cuts under sequestration with "smart investments" &ndash; although Republicans interpreted those remarks as simply more "tax and spend."</p><p>Mr Obama had already laid out some of his biggest health and science initiatives days earlier &ndash; requesting $1.2bn to help battle the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, which includes proposals for funds to develop new antibiotics and the creation of a clinical trial network aimed at rapidly testing the drugs; and a grand plan for precision medicine, in which the president said he needed $215m to fund the endeavor, which involves establishing a one-million person research cohort, whose genetic and other data will be gathered (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, 3<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">0 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>In unveiling the full budget proposal, President Obama laid down his full demands in how he wants his government run over the next year &ndash; insisting it is "fully paid for, through a combination of smart spending cuts and tax reforms" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-seeks-one-time-14-tax-on-offshore-profits-356505" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>While it's highly unlikely Congress will go along with most of the president's proposals, lawmakers may be willing to back the modest boosts in funding the president is seeking for the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for FY 2016, especially given the Republican-proposed reform efforts from the House Energy & Commerce Committee, in which the agencies will likely need added funding to accomplish the tasks laid out for them under the 21st Century Cures draft legislative package (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>For HHS overall, Mr Obama is requesting $83.8bn in discretionary budget authority, a $4.8bn increase over FY 2015. </p><p>Included in that request is an extra $1bn for the NIH, or 3.3% increase over FY 2015, which would bring its budget up to $31.311bn for FY 2016.</p><p>The agency said a significant portion of the added $1bn for FY 2016 would be devoted to raising the number of new and competing research project grants &ndash; boosting its levels by over 1,227 from the FY 2015 estimate. </p><p>The NIH said it plans to spend $200m of its requested funds on the precision medicine initiative &ndash; $130m of which would be newly allotted dollars, which it plans to use on the research cohort.</p><p>During a media briefing with reporters, NIH Director Dr Francis Collins said the BRAIN Initiative &ndash; a collaborative project unveiled in April 2013 between the US government and the private and academic sectors aimed at shedding light on the complex links between brain function and behavior &ndash; would get a "significant" increase of $70m under Mr Obama's proposal, which will be added to the $65m the program received over 2014-15, bringing the project's total spending for FY 2016 to $135m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">1 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">17 September 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">4 April 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BAM-Obama-aims-for-job-creation-economic-growth-with-brain-initiative-341691" target="_new">2 April 2013</a>).</p><p>The president also is seeking an additional $50m for NIH for Alzheimer's research.</p><p>Mr Obama's proposed FY 2016 budget includes an increase of $20m for the NIH's Common Fund &ndash; programs designed to pursue major opportunities and gaps in biomedical research that no single NIH institute or center could tackle on its own, but are ones the agency as a whole must address to make the biggest impact possible on the progress of medical research (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wacky-science-today-may-be-tomorrows-next-big-thing-352435" target="_new">20 June 2014</a>).</p><p>It also includes $3.1bn for HIV/AIDS research. </p><p><b>FDA funding</b></p><p>President Obama is seeking a 9% increase, or an extra $424.8m, in funding for the FDA in his FY 2016 budget, for a total of $4.9bn, $2.7bn of which is budgetary authority and the remaining $2.2bn coming from user fees paid by the industries the FDA regulates.</p><p>The budgetary authority amount would be an increase of $147.7m, or 6%, over FY 2015, and a boost of $277.2m, or 15%, for the user fees. </p><p>The largest portion of the FDA's requested increase would go towards food safety &ndash; with the president asking for a 25% bump in that area, or an added $301.2m over FY 2015.</p><p>Mr Obama also is calling for separating the food inspection and oversight duties from the FDA and creating a new standalone agency &ndash; a proposal that's been kicked around Washington before, but never supported by Congress (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Splitting-food-from-FDA-could-be-painful-for-drugs-356506" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The medical products area would get an increase of $84.8m, or 3%, above FY 2015.</p><p>The FDA's budget proposal includes $5m to continue the ongoing implementation of the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act</i>.</p><p>The president also is seeking $14.8m for the FDA for its activities involving combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.</p><p>The FDA also would get $9.7m for President Obama's precision medicine initiative.</p><p>The agency also would be allotted $700,000 for compounding oversight if Congress accepts the president's plan.</p><p>"It is a national priority for FDA to have the resources it needs to meet the challenges of medical advances, a changing global economy and food safety," said Cynthia Bens, vice president of the advocacy group Alliance for a Stronger FDA. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
