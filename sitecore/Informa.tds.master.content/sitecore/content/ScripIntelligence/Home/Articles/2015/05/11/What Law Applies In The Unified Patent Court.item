<p><b>When the pan-European Unified Patent Court comes fully into force, it will have divisions in a number of EU member states. But given its geographical scope, what is the law that will apply to disputes in the court? In the latest in his series of columns on the UPC, Paul England explains the law applicable to infringement, validity and "objects of property".</b></p><p>The substantive law on acts of infringement and their exceptions that will apply in the UPC are found in Articles 25 to 27 of the UPC Agreement, while the rules on provisional measures, including preliminary injunctions, are included in the Rules of Procedure. </p><p>These provisions apply to unitary patents and European patents litigated in the new court. However, there is no single model approach to how these provisions should be applied in detail in any particular case, and the national laws of infringement, which can provide guidance, differ. Instead, the UPC judges must develop their own approach in their own case law, over time. </p><p>Similarly, although the approach to determining the scope of protection of patent claims is a matter set out in Article 69 of the European Patent Convention (EPC) and its Protocol, the UPC will need to decide how exactly to apply it. </p><p>The EPC is also the principal source of law on matters of validity in Europe, and is one of the sources of law on which the judges of the UPC must base their decisions. However, as with infringement, the UPC must develop a single, consistent approach to the EPC. </p><p>Unlike matters of infringement, the judges are also able to take notice of the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the EPO on validity matters. Although the judges are not bound to apply this case law, as the largest single body of European law interpreting the provisions of the EPC on patent validity, it will be influential. </p><h2>"Objects Of Property"</h2><p>Unitary patents as "objects of property" are treated differently. The law applied to unitary patents for this purpose is to be determined according to the residence or place of business of the applicant at the time of filing the patent application. If that country is not participating in the unitary patent, the matter will be determined according to German law. Compare this with European patents as objects of property, which are subject to the law of the country in which they are registered. </p><p>But when does a dispute about a patent concern an "object of property"? The most likely answer is that this refers to entitlement and co-ownership matters. But it is unlikely that the law governing patent agreements, such as licences, is included. This would override the important freedom of parties to choose their own law of contract. </p><p>Matters concerning the entitlement of employee inventors and their compensation are also likely to be excluded. These are matters of national law according to the place of employment, rather than the place of the applicant's residence or business. </p><p>The practical effect of the above is that it will take time for the UPC to establish its own approaches to infringement and validity law. In the meantime, parties to disputes in the UPC will need to bring their knowledge of the major legal traditions in Europe in order to play a role in shaping how UPC law develops.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at law firm Taylor Wessing.</i></p>
