<p>The Scottish government has allotted &pound;80m to the New Medicines Fund, which is used to help pay for treatments for patients with rare or end-of-life conditions, for 2015-16. This is double the amount given to the fund in the previous year, and will help pay for the expected rise in the number of such products being recommended by the HTA body, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC).</p><p>The New Medicines Fund, which was set up last year to expand and replace the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund, helps health boards to pay for orphan, ultra-orphan and end-of-life drugs. It also supports changes to how these drugs are assessed for use in NHS Scotland.</p><p>Last year, the SMC changed the way in which it evaluates end-of-life medicines and those for very rare conditions, with the introduction of a Patient and Clinician Engagement (PACE) system that gives patient groups and clinicians more of a voice in SMC decision-making. </p><p>The PACE process allows the SMC to take greater account of the added benefits of the medicine as seen by patients and clinicians &ndash; such as the effect on the patient's life, the level of unmet need in that population, and the impact on carers &ndash; which may not be fully captured in the conventional economic assessment process. </p><p>The idea is to give the SMC more clarity on the need for and the potential role of new medicines and thereby increase the likelihood of positive recommendations for drugs with a higher cost per QALY. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Scots-say-yes-to-cancer-drugs-after-patients-have-their-say-357863" target="_new">Recent recommendations</a> by the consortium include the go-ahead in April for three anticancer drugs that had so far been largely rejected for use in the NHS in England: Ariad's Iclusig (ponatinib), Boehringer Ingelheim's Vargatef (nintedanib) and Bayer's Stivarga (regorafenib).</p><p>Health Secretary Shona Robison said that the Scottish government, together with the parliament's health and sport committee, had " radically overhauled access to treatments for people with rare and end-of-life conditions, and the New Medicines Fund has been key to removing a potential barrier to accessing expensive new drugs". </p><p>The fund, she said, would work in tandem with the changes introduced to the SMC process, which had "given patients greater say over decisions and resulted in more drugs approved for widespread use on the NHS". </p><p>Since 2013/14, more than 1,000 patients have started treatment funded first by the Rare Conditions Medicines Fund and now the New Medicines Fund, the government said. </p><p>Resources for the fund come from rebates paid by the pharmaceutical industry under the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) agreed with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). </p><p>Sandra Auld, acting director of ABPI Scotland, said: "I am glad to see that the Scottish government are leading the way in continuing to re-invest the money from PPRS repayments in new medicines. Doubling the fund to &pound;80 million for 2015/16 is recognition of the commitment made by the pharmaceutical industry for patients to receive the best new medicines available. The ABPI is committed to continuing to work with the Scottish government and all other stakeholders to ensure patients benefit from the better use of medicines&rdquo;.</p><h2>Non-SMC recommended products</h2><p>While most of the money from the fund is expected to pay for medicines recommended by the SMC, it may also be used in some instances where drugs don't pass the SMC test, a spokesperson for the SMC said. In such cases doctors can make an Individual Patient Treatment Request (IPTR) to prescribe the medicine in question. </p><p>The IPTR system was introduced in 2011 on the grounds that not all patients respond to a medicine in the same way and to acknowledge that a "not recommended" conclusion from the SMC, based on results in a particular patient population, may not necessarily be appropriate for an individual patient because of their clinical circumstances.</p><p>This system is due to be replaced shortly by a "Peer Approved Clinical System" (PACS), the spokesperson said. This is a more flexible process intended to give doctors more freedom to prescribe the drugs they think their patients need, and to minimize variations in such decision-making by imposing strict auditing arrangements. </p>
