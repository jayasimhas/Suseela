<p>Janssen Research & Development, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, has three new platforms that it's integrating into its existing therapeutic areas to shift the focus of R&D from disease treatment to prevention, according to global head of Janssen R&D William Hait.</p><p>Research in Janssen's five therapeutic areas &ndash; cardiovascular and metabolism, immunology, infectious diseases and vaccines, neuroscience and oncology &ndash; will not change dramatically, but it will incorporate aspects of the new R&D platforms with an eye on improving health rather than treating sickness. And some Janssen's early-stage projects, both in-house and in partnership with collaborators, are in line with the recently revealed platforms: disease prevention, disease interception and the microbiome.</p><p>As people live longer and spend more years of their life in poor health, Dr Hait said it is J&J's responsibility as the world's largest health care company to focus on innovation that can aid in the prevention of illness associated with aging and lifestyle. Progress in those areas could make a difference for patients and improve the sustainability of health care systems globally.</p><p>"The current model of disease care rather than health care is unsustainable with soaring costs, growing global disease rates, and the innovation bar that continues to rise. With major advances in new areas of science and precision diagnostics, we will be increasingly able to prevent and intercept disease and, in turn, will be increasingly expected to do so," Dr Hait told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>With Janssen's three new R&D platforms, "Our vision is that the lives of people and their families will drastically improve; the role of industry and medicine will completely transform; and the impact on communities, governments, payers and the global economy will be dramatic and far-reaching."</p><p><b>What does that mean for J&J?</b></p><p>Does that mean that J&J and its Janssen research operations will make big changes to their priorities and staffing to achieve such lofty goals? Not especially, according to Dr Hait.</p><p>"Our R&D strategy has been highly successful and we are not deviating from it," he said. "The new teams will collaborate closely with Janssen's five therapeutic areas as well as external partners, to underpin ongoing research and propel scientific knowledge in these areas of significant potential to change the way diseases are managed."</p><p>Dr Hait noted that "advancing science more aggressively in disease prevention, disease interception and the microbiome requires a concentrated, dedicated effort and investment to fully realize the inherent potential of these platforms for the future," but he said there have been no job cuts and only a minor shifting of existing staff to accommodate the new R&D platforms.</p><p>A small group of employees from the former Crucell Vaccine Institute, acquired in J&J's 2011 purchase of the vaccine company Crucell, is now part of Janssen's infectious diseases and vaccines therapeutic area. Crucell's experts will advise the Janssen Prevention Center (JPC) headquartered in the Netherlands, which will be the epicenter for the new disease prevention R&D platform.</p><p>The other two platforms will be represented by the Disease Interception Accelerator (DIA) in Raritan, New Jersey, and the Janssen Human Microbiome Institute (JHMI), which will work with partners in the US and Europe through research centers in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Beerse, Belgium.</p><p>The JPC will focus on prevention of chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases via laboratories in Leiden, the Netherlands; San Diego, California; and London, England. </p><p>The DIA will address the root causes of disease in an effort to preempt illness and stop disease progression. The group will research genetic predisposition, environmental exposure and phenotypic alterations to understand disease susceptibility.</p><p>And the JHMI will develop a better understanding of the microbiome, the population of bacteria living in and on the human body, to understand its role in disease and identify new diagnostic biomarkers and drug targets for autoimmune and other diseases. </p><p><b>What are some representative projects?</b></p><p>Janssen recently announced its first project through the DIA, which is a collaboration with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) to identify ways to intercept type 1 diabetes, such as diagnostics, therapeutics or combination approaches that can halt progression of the disease. </p><p>The microbiome institute will work with Janssen's academic and commercial partners, including Vedanta Biosciences, a microbiome-focused drug development firm with which Janssen recently agreed to partner on VE202, a treatment for irritable bowel disease. The deal worth up to $241m in upfront and milestone fees was negotiated by the Johnson & Johnson Innovation Center (JJIC) in Boston (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Vedanta-strikes-deal-with-Janssen-for-IBD-therapy-356145" target="_new">14 January 2015</a>). </p><p>"The new platforms will harness the innovation network that has been established through the J&J Innovation Centers and benefit from the scouting of potential unique collaborations and scientific opportunities in the strategic life-sciences hotspots where the Innovation Centers are located &ndash; California, Boston, London and Shanghai," Dr Hait said.</p><p>Janssen also is investigating treatments for bowel diseases via the microbiome in partnership with Second Genome (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/JandJ-enters-deal-with-Second-Genome-to-study-gut-bacteria-343799" target="_new">5 June 2013</a>).</p><p>"The future of health care will increasingly depend on identifying and correctly interpreting the earliest signals of disease susceptibility, preventing or intercepting disease before it even begins, and using the latest scientific insights from promising, emerging fields, like the microbiome, to transform medicine," Dr Hait said in response to a question about whether Janssen's new R&D platforms will yield more devices than therapeutics. "To realize this vision, we will need the most advanced diagnostics in order to identify disease earlier than today's clinically accepted point of diagnosis, and identify solutions that stop, reverse or inhibit progression to disease."</p><p>He noted that Janssen's diagnostics business underpins all of the R&D group's therapeutic areas and the new research platforms will enable J&J's shift in focus to accommodate the health care industry's move toward disease prevention rather than treatment. </p><p>Janssen anticipates many more announcements in the coming months and years about collaborations like the one with the JDRF to intercept type 1 diabetes, but Dr Hait is hopeful that other companies involved in drug development will take a forward-looking approach to disease prevention.</p><p>"We're proud of our position today as a leading biopharmaceutical and global health care company, and were certainly optimistic about the future. As [former US president] John F Kennedy said, 'The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining,'" he said.</p><p><p><p><p>
