<p> Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) has recommended that Hospira's biosimilar infliximab product Inflectra should be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. And in a highly controversial move, the PBAC has also said that Inflectra should be &quot;a&quot;-flagged, meaning that it can be substituted by pharmacists for the originator drug, Johnson &amp; Johnson's Remicade. </p><p> The PBAC has lost no time in seeking a listing for Inflectra: the product has only just been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as the first biosimilar infliximab in Australia. The move follows a consumer hearing in July at which various issues surrounding biosimilars were discussed, including &quot;a&quot;-flagging. </p><p> The Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (GBMA) welcomed the PBAC recommendation, saying that biosimilars needed to be supported in order to encourage their uptake by doctors, pharmacists and patients. It CEO, Belinda Wood, said the decision to apply an &quot;a&quot;-flag to a biosimilar in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits was &quot;an uptake driver that will enable a pharmacist to substitute the biosimilar for the reference biological medicine in exactly the same way as generic medicines.&rdquo; </p><p> But Medicines Australia, which represents originator companies, said it was concerned by the PBAC's recommendation that pharmacists be allowed to substitute a biosimilar in place of the biologic medicine prescribed by a doctor. It said it was &quot;critical that a patient&rsquo;s doctor is involved in any decision to move a patient from one biologic or biosimilar medicine to another and they need a strong evidence base to rely upon to make that decision.&quot; </p><p> The practice of &quot;a&quot;-flagging has long been applied to generic medicines, where the originator and generic versions are declared equivalent and therefore suitable for pharmacy substitution without having to involve the prescriber. But because of their specific characteristics, this has not been the case for biosimilars &ndash; until now. </p><p> It's a bold move, and one that seems to put Australia in the lead where pharmacy substitution is concerned. In the EU, the acknowledged pioneer in the biosimilars field, individual member states have tended to shy away from biosimilar substitution, the preferred option seeming to be product switching with the oversight of the prescriber. In the US, the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) is currently working on draft guidance on biosimilar interchangeability. </p><h2> Factors considered by PBAC </h2><p> The PBAC has said all along that &quot;a&quot;-flagging of products would be done on a case-by-case basis, and that the evidence would have to support such a move &ndash; it clearly believes that this is the case with Inflectra. </p><p> In its <a href="http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/industry/listing/elements/pbac-meetings/pbac-outcomes/pbac-outcomes-2015-07/" target="_new">recommendation</a>, the committee said that in relation to the &quot;a&quot;-flagging of Remicade and Inflectra, it considered a range of factors, including: </p><ul> <li> There is evidence from three randomised clinical trials in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients initiating on either Inflectra or Remicade that support a finding that Inflectra has equivalent effectiveness and safety to Remicade. </li><li> The key randomized clinical studies in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis did not indicate differences in efficacy or safety of Inflectra compared with Remicade. The supportive evidence from a series of non-comparative studies in patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease or ulcerative colitis showed that treatment with Inflectra was also effective and safe in these conditions. </li><li> The clinical data provided in the submission did not suggest that there were any identified populations where the risks of using the biosimilar product in place of the reference biologic were disproportionately high. </li><li> In the two trials with extension studies (Study 1.1 and Study 3.1), there was switching from Remicade to Inflectra, and the clinical evidence suggested no difference in efficacy, safety or immunogenicity between the biosimilar and reference biologic in these studies. </li><li> The Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM) has declared Inflectra a biosimilar of Remicade. The ACPM was satisfied about the similar safety and efficacy of Inflectra and Remicade in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. </li> </ul><p> &quot;The PBAC advised the minister that it considered the Remicade and Inflectra brands of infliximab could be marked as equivalent in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits (&quot;a&quot;-flagged), for the purposes of substitution by the pharmacist at the point of dispensing,&quot; it declared. </p><h2> &quot;Public Misunderstanding&quot; </h2><p> The committee said that in making its recommendation it considered the issues discussed at the July 7 consumer hearing. It also took issue with claims that there would be a &quot;free-for-all&quot; in terms of biosimilar substitution, and that problems could arise in terms of traceability and multiple switching. </p><p> It said there appeared to be &quot;a public misunderstanding about how substitution occurs&quot;, pointing out that the prescriber of an originator biologic can choose not to permit brand substitution, and that the patient has the final say in which brand they receive from the pharmacist. </p><p> As for concerns about the traceability of substituted products, the committee said that the healthcare program, Medicare, routinely collects information on the brand that is dispensed to the patient. In relation to multiple switching with infliximab, it considered that this was unlikely to happen in practice because infliximab is administered via an infusion, with most patients receiving all courses of treatment at a single centre, reducing the likelihood of switches among brands. </p><p> The PBAC clearly feels that implementation of its recommendation should not be rushed, and that there is a need for more communication on biosimilars to the public and health professionals. </p><p> It advised that the department of health develop an implementation strategy for infliximab before an &quot;a&quot; flag was placed against the Inflectra and Remicade brands on the Schedule. &quot;This implementation strategy should include an education campaign designed to support and promote the use of biosimilars, improving awareness and confidence by both health professionals and consumers to choose these products,&quot; it advised. </p><h2> Industry Reactions </h2><p> The GBMA, which recently changed its name from the Generic Medicines industry Association (GMiA), said that patients and health professionals should be &quot;reassured that the PBAC has taken an evidence-based approach&quot; in making the recommendation on infliximab, which it said &quot;recognizes the important role biosimilars play in supporting PBS affordability today and in the future.&quot; </p><p> As a result of competition, the savings that are expected to be generated from PBS listing of biosimilars &quot;can provide an opportunity to improve patient access to life-changing medications,&quot; the GBMA said. With brand-name biological medicines now accounting for A$2.3bn ($1.7bn), or around 25% of annual PBS expenditure, the increased availability of biosimilars is expected to deliver significant savings to the PBS, it added. </p><p> But Medicines Australia was not convinced. It said the PBAC's recommendation &quot;goes against all the advice they have received from international and local experts that there is an absence of an agreed evidence base to support the safety and efficacy of repeated, or multiple, switching between a biologic and one or more biosimilar medicines.&quot; </p><p> It said that while it &quot;absolutely affirms the safety and efficacy&quot; of biosimilars that have undergone a thorough assessment by the TGA, biosimilars have a &quot;range of variations which may or may not have an adverse impact on patients.&quot; It added that it strongly supported the introduction and uptake of biosimilar medicines, but stressed this had to be done appropriately, based on reliable evidence. </p><p> &quot;The medical and patient community need confidence that the Australian government and its appointed advisory bodies are making the right decisions in the interests of their health and safety and not based on the government's own bottom line savings targets,&quot; it said. </p><p> &quot;Medicines Australia strongly urges the government to begin a formal process of consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including patient groups and doctors to develop a comprehensive biosimilars policy, based on evidence, and including appropriate education, which puts patient safety first.&quot; </p><p> This story has also been published in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers. </p> <p>
