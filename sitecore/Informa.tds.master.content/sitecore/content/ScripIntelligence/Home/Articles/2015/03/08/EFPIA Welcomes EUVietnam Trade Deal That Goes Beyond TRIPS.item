<p>The R&D-based pharmaceutical industry in Europe has welcomed the agreement between the EU and Vietnam on a free trade deal that will remove almost all tariffs on goods traded between the two economies while implementing strong intellectual property protections for pharmaceuticals.</p><p>After two and a half years of negotiations, EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström and Vietnamese industry and trade minister Vu Huy Hoang reached an agreement in principle that they say will produce a "mutually beneficial and balanced package". Once some remaining technical issues have been settled and the legal text finalized, the agreement will require approval by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.</p><p>"Vietnam is a growing economy and once this agreement is up and running, it will provide significant new opportunities for companies on both sides, by increasing market access for goods and services," said Ms Malmström. </p><p>This is the first agreement of its kind that the EU has concluded with a developing country. According to the commission, it "shows the shared conviction of the EU and Vietnam that trade is essential to growth, the creation of jobs and sustainable development".</p><p>As well as eliminating tariffs, Vietnam will progressively remove almost all of its duties on EU exports to Vietnam. About half of EU pharmaceutical exports to the country will be duty free when the FTA enters into force, and the rest after seven years.</p><p>In the spirit of "creating a level playing field for EU companies and innovative products", the commission says, Vietnam has committed to "a high level of protection, going beyond the standards of [the] WTO [World Trade Organization] TRIPs (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) agreement." </p><p>The pharmaceutical sector will benefit from "improved data protection" and the possibility to obtain a patent extension of up to two years if there are delays in the marketing authorization process. </p><p>A special annex to the FTA includes a set of other provisions facilitating trade in medicines, which the commission says "are of great importance" in trade between the EU and Vietnam. Pharmaceuticals are the second-top export item, amounting to about 9% of total EU exports to Vietnam. </p><p>The south-east Asian country has also made a number of commitments regarding the procurement of pharmaceuticals, and foreign-invested companies will be able to import and sell medicines to Vietnamese wholesalers and distributors.</p><h2>"Excellent work," says EFPIA</h2><p>Applauding the "excellent work" done by the commission on the FTA, EFPIA said the agreement would "benefit Vietnamese patients significantly" by promoting wider and faster patient access to innovative medicines." It said it also represented a boost for innovation and research, and welcomed the provisions on improved data protection, patent extension, and procurement.</p><p>"With other trade negotiations this agreement in principle offers convincing evidence that the EU remains committed to expanding free trade and to supporting innovation and knowledge-based industries," EFPIA continued. </p><p>Its director general, Richard Bergström, said the industry was "committed to working with the Vietnam government to expand access to medicines. We will assess in a comprehensive manner the implementation of the FTA, seeking to ensure that improved IP conditions do not stand in the way of patients' access to the medicines they need, and monitoring other developments influencing the availability and effective distribution of innovative and high-quality medicines," Mr Bergström continued. "As my member companies have shown in many countries, there are novel approaches to improve access to medicines while supporting the innovation system."</p><p>The commission added that the FTA includes a "robust and comprehensive" chapter on trade and sustainable development, and will also contain a legally binding link to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) that governs the overall relationship between the EU and Vietnam, thereby ensuring that human rights, democracy, and the rule of law are essential elements of our bilateral trade relations."</p><p>But the idea of a trade treaty that goes beyond the requirements of the TRIPS agreement will not be music to the ears of generics firms or NGOs working on access to medicines in developing countries. The European Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (EGA) was not immediately available for comment, and the NGO, Health Action International (HAI), said that while it had been closely monitoring developments in the negotiations on the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) and the US/EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), it had not been following the EU/Vietnam FTA and so could not comment at this point.</p><h2>"Corporate lobby"</h2><p>However, Jamie Love of the NGO Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) made no bones about his concerns. He said: "If the EU is pushing Vietnam into higher IPR standards than they already face with TRIPS, for medicines, the results are predictable, and when targeted at people with such low incomes, death-inducing." </p><p>15 years ago, he said, it would have been "unthinkable for the EU to push these standards in a country with such low incomes. Today, the corporate lobby is much stronger than the human rights and development lobby in Brussels."</p><p>KEI has also just leaked the intellectual property rights chapter of the TPP, which is being negotiated by the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and a number of Latin American and Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam.</p><p>Like TTIP, the TPP includes several measures on intellectual property regarding pharmaceuticals. According to Mr Love, the proposals contained in the TPP "will harm consumers and in some cases block innovation. In countless ways, the Obama Administration has sought to expand and extend drug monopolies and raise drug prices. The astonishing collection of proposals pandering to big drug companies make more difficult the task of ensuring access to drugs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases and conditions," he declared.</p>
