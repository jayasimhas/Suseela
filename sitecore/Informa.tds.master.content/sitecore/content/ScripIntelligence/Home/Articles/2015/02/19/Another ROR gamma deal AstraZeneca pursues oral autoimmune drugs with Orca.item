<p>AstraZeneca has broadened its R&D activity in the field of retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor gamma (ROR&#947;) inhibition to treat autoimmune disorders through a tie-up with UK biotech firm Orca Pharmaceuticals. It will gain access to oral ROR&#947; inhibitor candidates from Orca to integrate into its existing in-house development programs for selective ROR&#947; inverse agonists; the aim is to identify lead compounds for progression and characterize the autoimmune condition for which they are best suited.</p><p>Dr Maarten Kraan, head of AstraZeneca's respiratory, inflammation and autoimmune diseases innovative medicines unit, described ROR&#947; inhibitor development as a "hot area of immunology science" and said the aim was to "create potentially best in class candidate drugs for patients who currently do not have any oral medicines available to treat their chronic conditions."</p><p>The field is certainly active: only last week Sanofi signed a similar tie-up with ROR&#947;-focused Lead Pharma of the Netherlands (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-signs-new-deal-for-small-molecule-approach-to-autoimmune-disease-356829" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 February 2015</a>). Other firms active in the ROR&#947; space include Lycera, which has partnered with Merck & Co, GSK spin-off Tempero Pharmaceuticals, Exelixis, which has partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Karo Bio and partner Pfizer, and Phenex, which has partnered with Janssen. Japan Tobacco is the most advanced with a compound in Phase I, according to Citeline's Pharmaprojects database.</p><p>ROR&#947; has a central role in the autoimmune system because it helps convert CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into T-helper 17 (Th27) cells, which produce cytokines to drive the immune response. Excessive activity of of Th27 and other ROR&#947;+ immune cells have been implicated in conditions including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>At present, injected anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) drugs dominate the autoimmune space, generating combined global sales of around $31bn in 2014, according to Credit Suisse. Other drug targets already on the market and in late-stage pharma pipelines include IL6 (interleukin 6), JAK (janus kinase), IL17 (interleukin 17) and S1P (sphingosine-1-phosphate). Credit Suisse forecasts new drug launches will drive branded autoimmune drug sales from around $59bn in total today to $75bn in 2023.</p><p>Orca was founded in 2013 and is based in Oxford UK, with funding from BioMotiv and NYU Innovation Ventures Fund. It is based on the work of two of its co-founders, Professor Dan Littman, Dr Jun Huh and colleagues at New York University, who discovered the essential role ROR&#947; plays in the development of pathogenic Th27 and innate lymphoid cells, and showed that ROR&#947; activity can be inhibited by small molecule compounds. The firm has been aiming to establish proof of concept in humans of its orally available drug candidates by 2016.</p>
