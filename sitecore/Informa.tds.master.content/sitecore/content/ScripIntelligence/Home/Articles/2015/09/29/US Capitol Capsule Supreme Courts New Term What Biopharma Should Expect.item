<p>Don't expect the decisions out of the U.S. Supreme Court in its new term to have as big of an impact on the biopharmaceutical industry as the rulings in <i>Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics</i> and <i>Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories</i> or even the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> cases.</p><p>And it may be another year or so before the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-Amgen-Sandoz-Tango-Across-Old-Ground-360426" target="_new">biosimilars lawsuits</a> &ndash; the first to interpret the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act </i>&ndash; make their way to the Supreme Court.</p><p>But there are several lawsuits the justices could take up later in their 2015-16 term that may have broad implications for drug makers, court watchers told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>One of those cases, said New York lawyer Marylee Jenkins, a partner at Arent Fox LLP and head of the firm's intellectual property group, is <i>Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Apotex Inc</i>.</p><p>In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Apotex had standing to seek a declaratory judgment that it would not infringe a patent held by Daiichi Sankyo, even though the latter company had disclaimed the patent, known as '703, in 2006. </p><p>The dispute stemmed from the fact that the '703 patent, despite being disclaimed, remained listed in the FDA's <i>Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations</i> &ndash; a large volume commonly called the <i>Orange Book</i>, which contains patent numbers and expiration dates &ndash; for the drug Benicar (olmesartan), Jenkins explained.</p><p>Daiichi had disclaimed the '703 patent when it was first challenged by an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed by Mylan, she told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Jenkins noted that Daiichi was able to successfully assert a second <i>Orange Book</i>-listed patent, known as '599, and therefore blocked Mylan's entry into the market. </p><p>But as the first party to file a so-called Paragraph IV certification, Jenkins said Mylan should have been entitled to a 180-day exclusivity period if it entered the market within 75 days of a final judgment that the relevant patents are invalid or not infringed, regardless of whether that judgment is obtained in litigation involving the company or a later ANDA filer.</p><p>Under the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984</i>, generic makers submit Paragraph IV certifications to the FDA stating the patents covering the branded product are invalid, unenforceable or uninfringed by the proposed copycat version &ndash; an action that generally results in the innovator firm bringing patent litigation.</p><p>A so-called Paragraph III certification indicates that an ANDA may be approved on the patent expiration date.</p><p>Jenkins noted that Apotex filed an ANDA in June 2012 with a Paragraph III certification alleging that no infringement of the '599 patent would occur and also a Paragraph IV certification for the disclaimed '703 patent. </p><p>When Daiichi did not bring suit to enforce the disclaimed '703 patent, Apotex filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it would not infringe the '703 patent, but the district court found that the latter company lacked standing and dismissed the case. </p><p>On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a "justiciable" case or controversy existed because a judgment of non-infringement could open the door for Apotex to enter the market earlier, as it would trigger the 75-day deadline for Mylan to enter or forfeit exclusivity, Jenkins said.</p><p>In Mylan's petition to the Supreme Court, the company is asking the justices to review whether a party has standing to ask for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of a disclaimed patent, she said. </p><p>Washington lawyer William Jay, a partner at Goodwin Procter and a co-chair of the firm's appellate litigation practice, said he was not surprised <i>Mylan v. Apotex</i> was not on the Supreme Court's Oct. 1 grants list because Mylan itself had asked that the case be held pending the high-court's decision in another case about standing, <i>Spokeo v. Robins</i>, which is scheduled to be argued before the justices on Nov. 2.</p><p>"I think Mylan was basically trying to hook onto Spokeo and if the company wins in Spokeo, maybe they could get a do-over before the Federal Circuit," Jay told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Washington lawyer Michael O'Shaughnessy, a partner at McDermott, Will & Emery, said another case that may come before the Supreme Court this term is <i>In Re Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC</i>, which was an appeal from the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Patent and Trial Board (PTAB) involving an <i>inter partes</i> review (IPR).</p><p>Cuozzo owns patent '074. Garmin International Inc. and its subsidiary Garmin USA Inc. petitioned for an IPR certain claims of the '074 patent, which was instituted for trial. </p><p>The PTAB determined the claims were "obvious" and it also denied Cuozzo's motion to amend the '074 patent by substituting new claims.</p><p>On appeal to the Federal Circuit, a three-judge panel held that the court lacked the jurisdiction to review the decision to institute the IPR and affirmed the PTAB's final determination &ndash; finding no error in the board's claim construction under the broadest reasonable interpretation standard, its obviousness determination and the its denial of Cuozzo's motion to amend.</p><p>The full Federal Circuit in July declined to rehear the case <i>en banc</i>.</p><p>Cuozzo is one of the leading IPR cases and "shows the breadth of discretion at the patent office in implementing IPRs and invalidating claims at the IPR stage," O'Shaughnessy explained.</p><p>"That case addresses the standards at which the patent office is supposed to review claims," he said. "They applied the broadest reasonable interpretation to the claims, which creates a broader patent scope to challenge, which could result in increased likelihood of invalidity. The court held that a decision not to institute an IPR is not appealable. Those decisions could impact patentees by increasing the chances of the patents being held invalid and it may result in the IPR petition not being instituted."</p><p>Because the Cuozzo case addresses the standard for construing the claims to be considered in the IPR, O'Shaughnessy said it addresses a "fundamental issue for the IPR petitions and therefore might warrant consideration by the Supreme Court."</p><p>Goodwin Procter's Jay noted a petition in the case is due to the Supreme Court by mid-October.</p><p>If the case is filed on time and fully briefed, it could be heard this term, he said.</p><p>But unless the Supreme Court thinks the PTAB's decision was "grievously wrong" it likely won't hear the case, Jay said.</p><p>"But anything is possible," he said, adding that the Supreme Court sometimes "grants a whole bunch of cases" at the end of December, early January &ndash; the timeframe a few years ago when it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-New-SCOTUS-term-could-be-another-patent-palooza-347072" target="_new">decided to hear</a> several patent cases, including <i>Highmark v. Allcare</i> and <i>Octane v. Icon</i>, both about attorneys' fees<i>; Limelight v. Akamai</i>, on divided infringement for inducement; and <i>Nautilus v Biosig</i>, on indefiniteness. </p><p>Another case the Supreme Court could hear this term is <i>New York v. Actavis</i>, in which a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York in May <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-Actavis-Namenda-hard-switch-coercion-anticompetitive-358576" target="_new">upheld</a> a lower court's ruling ordering Actavis, now Allergan plc, to keep its twice-daily immediate-release version of its Alzheimer's drug Namenda (memantine hydrochloride) on the U.S. market &ndash; declaring the firm's plan for a "forced switch" to a newer version before generics are available is "coercion" and "anticompetitive."</p><p>The full Federal Circuit declined to hear the case <i>en banc</i>.</p><p>"The drug companies certainly pushed very hard in their rehearing petition on the notion that there was a circuit conflict created by this decision and they may well take a shot at trying to get it to the Supreme Court before it has to go back to the district court for litigation on the merits," Jay said.</p><p>The <i>cert</i> petition is due to the Supreme Court in November.</p><p>But Jay noted that if the plaintiffs don't respond promptly, the case, if granted, could get pushed over until the Supreme Court's next term.</p><p>While it may be months before it's known what other cases the Supreme Court will hear this term, McDermott's O'Shaughnessy said the justices' biggest influence on the biopharmaceutical industry this term could be, in fact, how lower courts apply the 2014-15 rulings in patent cases like <i>Teva v. Sandoz</i>, a claim construction case decided <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270" target="_new">Jan. 20</a>; <i>Commil v. Cisco</i>, a good-faith defense case decided on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Good-faith-belief-no-defense-in-inducing-patent-infringement-358600" target="_new">May 26</a>; and <i>Kimble v. Marvel</i>, a patent royalty terms case decided on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-superpowers-time-limits-upheld-biopharma-implications-359072" target="_new">June 22</a>.</p><p>"Those will all have potentially wide-ranging impacts on [the biopharmaceutical] industry, O'Shaughnessy said.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mercks-Keytruda-U.S.-Lung-Cancer-Nod-Broad-Enough-360803" target="_new">Merck's Keytruda US Lung Cancer Nod: Broad Enough?</a></p><p>When Merck & Co.
