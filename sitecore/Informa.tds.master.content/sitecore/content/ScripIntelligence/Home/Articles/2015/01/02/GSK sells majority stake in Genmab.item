<p>Denmark's Genmab has lost one of its majority shareholders, as GlaxoSmithKline prepares to sell of around 4.5 million shares in the company.</p><p>GSK previously owned a 7.9% stake in the company, with whom it was partnered for the development of blood cancer drug Arzerra (ofatumumab). The UK giant said that since its asset-swap deal with Novartis, in which GSK is transferring rights to oncology products including Arzerra, it now considers its stake in Genmab to be a "non-core asset." GSK is still working with Genmab on developing Arzerra for autoimmune disease indications.</p><p>Genmab also announced full-year revenues for Arzerra, which have fallen around 27% year-on-year. Arzerra brought in &pound;54.5m in 2014, compared with &pound;74.9m in 2013. Genmab's royalty income from the drug was DKK101m. </p><p>Genmab's share price plummeted 6% on the news, from a close of DKK471 ($72.27) on 4 February to DKK443 by mid-afternoon on 5 February. However, the stock was still higher than it had been earlier in the week thanks to a 9% rise on 4 February on the back of positive Phase II results for daratumumab (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Genmab-rises-on-Phase-II-daratumumab-promise-in-double-refractory-myeloma-356537" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 4 February 2015). </p><p>The company told <i>Scrip </i>that it now has just three shareholders who own more than a 5% stake in the company: Fidelity Management and Research, ATP, and Johnson & Johnson.</p><p>Genmab commented: "GSK has been a long-term supportive shareholder and we thank them for the good co-operation we have had. We look forward to working with shareholders who acquired the GSK shares."</p>
