<p>Following a first approval in Japan last month, Alexion Pharmaceutical's <i>Strensiq</i> (asfotase alfa) has now received market approval in Canada as a treatment for ultra-rare disease hypophosphatasia (HPP) &ndash; with a US decision to follow later this month. </p><p>The drug, which was given the green light by regulators Health Canada on Aug. 17, is the first approved treatment for pediatric-onset HPP &ndash; a genetic, metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization that can lead to destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, respiratory failure and premature death.</p><p>Strensiq, a first-in-class bone-targeted enzyme replacement therapy, is intended to supplement tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity, and is thought to exert its beneficial effects by promoting mineralization of the skeleton in patients with HPP.</p><p>A US approval for the drug in the same indication as it has been approved for in Japan and Canada is slated for Aug. 28. Alexion is also awaiting a decision on its market authorization application (MAA) for Strensiq in Europe. The drug got a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee, the CHMP (committee for medicinal products for human use), in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Alexion-gets-EU-nod-for-two-rare-genetic-disease-drugs-359145" target="_new">June this year</a>. A final decision in Europe is expected in the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, in Japan, Alexion expects HPP patients will start commercial treatment with Strensiq by late 3Q 2015. </p><p>A spokesperson for the company told <i>Scrip</i>, Alexion had "anticipated these nearly simultaneous approvals and is prepared to launch in these countries." However, Alexion said it has not announced the price of the drug in any country. </p><p>Alexion's stock, traded on NasdaqGS, gained 2.5%, or $4.6, to reach $191.22 on Aug. 17 following the Canadian approval announcement. </p><h2>Clinical Performance</h2><p>Cheryl Rockman-Greenberg, distinguished professor in the department of pediatrics and child health, University Of Manitoba, clinician scientist in the Children's Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, and lead Canadian investigator in the HPP trials, noted that in clinical studies to date, Strensiq has reduced mortality in affected infants with HPP with 89% overall survival after three years of treatment compared with almost 100% mortality documented in the past. </p><p>She also said Strensiq had "greatly reduced pain associated with HPP and improved physical functioning of patients, including healing of the 'rickets' and improvement in mobility.</p><p>"It is very exciting to now have an approved therapy for patients who previously only faced early death, or had to live with severe disability and pain," Rockman-Greenberg said. </p><p>Strensiq was granted approval under Health Canada's Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy. Approvals under the NOC/c policy are granted to products that are "intended for the treatment of a life-threatening or severely debilitating illness, have promising evidence of clinical effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile, and respond to a serious unmet medical need in Canada." Under this NOC/c approval, Alexion is required to complete and submit additional data from existing trials and conduct one additional study with Strensiq. The additional study is designed to provide confirmatory data regarding the clinical benefit of Strensiq in adults, Alexion said. </p><p>According to HPP advocacy group, Soft Bones Foundation, it has been estimated that severe forms of hypophosphatasia occur in approximately one per 100,000 live births. The more mild childhood and adult forms are probably somewhat more common.</p><p>Alexion currently has one other program at a preclinical stage investigating asfotase alfa as a potential treatment for neurofibromatosis type 1.</p><p>
