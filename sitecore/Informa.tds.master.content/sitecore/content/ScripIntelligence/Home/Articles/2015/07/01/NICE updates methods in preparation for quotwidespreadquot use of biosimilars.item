<p> The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has reviewed and updated its methods for providing guidance and advice on biosimilars in preparation for an expected increase in the number of such products coming onto the market. Among other things it says biosimilars could be subject either to a technology appraisal (guidance) or to a less prescriptive &quot;evidence summary&quot;. </p><p> It says that biosimilars have the potential to offer &quot;considerable cost savings&quot; for the National Health Service, particularly in long-term conditions. A number of top-selling biologicals have come off patent, or will do so over the next few years, especially TNF inhibitors or receptor antagonists for use in cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and insulin. </p><p> NICE has previously included a couple of biosimilars in its technology appraisal (TA) process. In TA88 on &quot;human growth hormone (somatropin) for the treatment of growth failure in children&quot;, dating from May 2010, one of the seven products included was a biosimilar agent (Sandoz Omnitrope). </p><p> An update of TA142 on &quot;anaemia (cancer-treatment induced) &ndash; erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (epoetin and darbepoetin), two of the products are biosimilars, according to a NICE note from November 2014, which also says that the availability of biosimilar filgrastim &quot;could be relevant to an update of CG151 on &quot;prevention and management of neutropenic sepsis in cancer patients&quot;. </p><p> However, experience is limited, and with the use of biosimilars set to become more widespread, the institute says it has had to review its position on biosimilars and its process for developing relevant guidance and advice. </p><p> The new approach is outlined in a &quot;biosimilars position statement&quot; published on NICE's website. The statement, which was put out in draft form for a six-week consultation among stakeholders in March-April 2014, says that the institute will consider biosimilars notified to it by the National Institute for Health Research's Horizon Scanning Centre. </p><p> Biosimilars will generally be considered as part of a multiple technology appraisal (MTA), in parallel with their respective reference products, although this will not always be the case. </p><p> The original draft explicitly stated that biosimilars would not be considered for single technology appraisals (STAs), but some stakeholders suggested that NICE should have flexibility on this, so this sentence was removed in the final version. A NICE spokesman confirmed that the institute wanted to &quot;reserve the right to conduct an STA if necessary&quot;. </p><p> The documentation on TAs will use the name of the active substance, including for reference products and branded biosimilars, &quot;to inform clinical decision making and to reflect the remit received from ministers&quot;, it says. </p><p> The launch of a less expensive biosimilar will not automatically trigger a review of a TA, but NICE will consider any new biosimilar when a TA is updated. If a biosimilar is approved for an indication based on extrapolated evidence, it will be &quot;considered within the context of reviews of existing guidance on the reference product&quot;. </p><p> Where a technology appraisal remit has been referred to NICE, the same remit, and any resulting guidance, can be applied to any biosimilar versions that subsequently reach the market. This means that if an active substance has already been recommended by NICE, any funding direction (an instruction to make funding available) will apply to a new biosimilar containing that substance. </p><h2> Evidence summaries </h2><p> However, in some cases, where it believes that a review of the evidence for a biosimilar is necessary, NICE may decide to produce an &quot;evidence summary: new medicine&quot;, rather than a TA. Evidence summaries do not constitute formal NICE guidance, but are designed to support the managed introduction of certain new medicines or new indications for products not covered by the TA program. </p><p> &quot;Evidence summaries take the process a step beyond the regulatory requirements needed for a new drug to be able to be prescribed,&quot; the NICE spokesman said. As well as considering the strengths and limitations of the available evidence of the drug&rsquo;s safety and efficacy, they also consider the context of the new drug in terms of what other treatments are available for the condition and their cost, as well as the likely place of the new drug in local prescribing and its estimated cost impact for the NHS, he said. &quot;We'd consider producing an evidence summary if the topic met our inclusion criteria, which includes not being covered in a TA.&quot; </p><p> Unlike TAs, evidence summaries will use the biosimilar's brand name, &quot;because substitutability and interchangeability cannot be assumed&quot;, NICE says. Evidence summaries do not make recommendations, so the decision on whether to prescribe a biosimilar or an originator biologic &quot;rests with the responsible clinician in consultation with the patient&quot;. </p><p> &quot;Biosimilar medicines should be considered as being medicines in their own right rather than generic versions of a branded originator,&quot; the spokesman said. The MHRA recommends that all biologic medicines are prescribed by brand name, in order to avoid automatic substitution at the pharmacy level, he added. </p><h2> Horizon scanning </h2><p> A key part of the appraisal process is the work done by the NIHR Horizon Scanning Centre, which keeps track of technologies with cost implications that are likely to be approaching the market. At present, the NIHR aims to notify NICE and NHS England about emerging pharmaceuticals around 20 months before they become available to the health service. </p><p> However, a question was raised during the consultation as to whether there would be enough information on biosimilars to allow accurate horizon scanning and to determine when they are likely to be coming to market. </p><p> The NICE spokesman said this was &quot;an issue around our contract with the National Horizon Scanning Centre. The SLA we have includes a 20-month lead time, but because information about biosimilars is new, and often difficult to find, we have waived this requirement for biosimilars.&quot; </p>
