<p>Novartis, unlike several of its big pharma peers, has itself a healthy looking pipeline now and for the foreseeable future &ndash; allowing the company the luxury of "being a bit choosy" when it comes to selecting investments.</p><p>Dr Dhavalkumar Patel, head of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Europe, spoke to <i>Scrip</i> on the side lines of the company's recent financial results press conference in Basel, Switzerland, about Novartis's strong position and commitment to R&D. </p><p>2014 saw a year of mass M&A activity in the industry, especially amongst the market leading drug makers which are seeking product candidates to boost their struggling, in-house research pipelines. But Novartis's biomedical research head Dr Patel told <i>Scrip</i> that in the opinion of outside parties of note, Novartis's R&D offering comes out on top. This leaves it to make strategic deals around compatibility, like its mega transaction with GlaxoSmithKline in April 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 22 April 2014</a>), rather than go in for the kill with a big takeover bid. </p><p>He said the Swiss firm's busy pipeline has been a long-term investment. "This company has had that vision; the shareholders are in general long-term investors with the same vision in mind. [R&D investment] is probably on a little more of a limited scale than it was in the past, but the successes you see today are in large part investments that were made more than 10 years ago. And this continues."</p><p>This is not to say that Novartis does not keep its finger of the pulse for intriguing developments on the outside of its business. "We are not na&iuml;ve," Dr Patel said. "We do not think that we are the only ones with a brain. There are many people outside of our company doing incredible work and we are very open to looking at these opportunities. But we probably have the luxury to be a bit choosier than others."</p><p>Novartis's main area of development focus is oncology, followed by immunology and inflammation, both of which are areas of high activity for drug developers. But Dr Patel said, "One of the biggest things that will differentiate us in the future is going to be the cell and gene therapies area."</p><p>He added, "We are the first big pharma company that has really invested in this space."</p><p>Dr Patel highlighted a specific stem cell therapy partnership ongoing between Novartis and Louisville start-up company Regenerex. The two companies are looking at stem cell technology that may help kidney transplant patients avoid taking anti-rejection medicine for life. The two companies entered a global licensing deal in 2013 for Regenerex's technology, which may also be used in a number of inherited metabolic diseases such as sickle cell disease or metachromatic leukodystrophy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-signs-licensing-deal-for-novel-cell-therapy-program-346404" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 September 2013</a>).</p><p>"This is the holy grail for transplantation," Dr Patel said. </p><h2>gene editing</h2><p>He also noted Novartis's move into gene editing. "Many people under estimate the amount of work and investment it's going to take for the technical development of these products," Dr Patel said. "But we really believe we will have the infrastructure and setting."</p><p>In January this the Swiss company signed a collaboration and licensing agreement with Intellia Therapeutics for the discovery and development of new medicines using the CRISPR genome editing technology. It simultaneously entered a deal with Caribou Biosciences for the development of drug discovery tools in the nascent field (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-to-use-gene-editing-tool-with-CAR-T-therapies-355979" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 January 2015</a>). </p><p>CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is an approach that allows scientists to edit the genes of targeted cells. Novartis says that in a short period of time it has proven to be a powerful tool for creating very specific models of disease for use in drug discovery.Â </p><p>Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez, at the firm's annual results conference, said the technology, though very early, was "very exciting."</p><p>Novartis has been building up its gene and cell therapy investments over previous years. In the summer of 2014 it invested $35m in stem cell therapy developer Gamida Cell in exchange for a 15% stake of the Israeli firm and an option to acquire the company (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-takes-a-15-stake-in-stem-cell-developer-and-an-option-to-buy-353463" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 August 2014</a>). </p><p>It also has two other cell therapy compounds in clinical development. HSC835 is a novel cell therapy approach that enables an expanded single umbilical cord blood derived hematopoietic stem cell transplant in patients with limited treatment options. HSC835 is currently in a Phase II trial in patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. A second cell therapy product, CTL019, is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy currently in Phase II development in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).</p><p>Other big pharmas are also participating in the fresh wave of interest in gene and cell therapies, though. Just two weeks after Novartis announced its CRISPR collaboration, AstraZeneca reported its own plans to strike four deals in the ground-breaking genome editing field, in order to position itself well against its pharma peers (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-deals-take-CRISPR-to-its-drug-discovery-heart-356437" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 January 2015</a>). AstraZeneca is teaming up with the Wellcome Trust, the Innovative Genomics Initiative, the Broad Institute/Whitehead Institute and Thermo Fisher. </p><p>Experts say CRISPR is set to change the way biomedical research is conducted. The technology has the potential to reduce attrition rates by improving cell lines/transgenic animal models, boosting the quality of drug candidates and the speed with which they are produced, and even possibly reducing the size of clinical trials further down the line (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-deals-take-CRISPR-to-its-drug-discovery-heart-356437" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 January 2015</a>).</p>
