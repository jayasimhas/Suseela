<p>As much as Americans like getting freebies, they crave knowledge of their health information over things like activity trackers, such as a Fitbit, Jawbone or Misfit, or smartphones.</p><p>Indeed, a survey conducted by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that 90% of responders said the best incentive they could get for participating in the million-person cohort study under President Barack Obama's precision medicine initiative (PMI) would be knowledge about their own health, versus 55% who said they'd prefer an activity tracker. </p><p>The survey showed that about 52% said a smartphone would entice them to participate.</p><p>About 80% of the responders, however, said they still would like to be paid for their involvement in the cohort, said Dr Dave Kaufman, a program director in the Division of Genomics and Society at the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute.</p><p>In the survey of 2,600 Americans, 22% said the cohort study should definitely be completed, while 57% said it should probably be done. About 16% responded that the study should probably not be pursued, while 5% said it definitely should not be done.</p><p>Of those that supported the PMI cohort study, 86% said they thought it could leave to improved treatments, cures and lives saved, Dr Kaufman said on 1 July on the first of a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trust-Precision-medicine-effort-fails-without-it-359222" target="_new">two-day workshop</a> hosted by the NIH at its Bethesda, Maryland campus.</p><p>About 40% of the survey responders said they would probably participate in the cohort, while 14% said they definitely would take part, he said.</p><p>About 30% said they probably would not enroll, while 16% said they had no desire to be involved.</p><p>Of those who said they would join the study, 23% said they would stay for one year, while 11% and 10% said they would continue for five or 10 years, respectively.</p><p>While 79% said they would allow NIH scientists to use their samples and information for research, only 52% said they would be willing to let drug makers to use it. </p><p>Importantly, Dr Kaufman said, a high showing &ndash; 71% &ndash; insisted the cohort participants and the researchers should be equal partners in the study.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
