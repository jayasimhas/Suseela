<p><p>The Japanese pharma has inked a collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to study the h8F4 technology in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The monoclonal antibody, developed by Dr Jeffrey Molldrem, professor of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy at MD Anderson, targets an HLA-restricted peptide called PR1/HLA-A2, which is expressed in cancer cells and cancer stem cells. The Texas-based cancer center will handle Phase Ia and Phase Ib and Astellas has the right to opt into a worldwide license at the end of the early-stage testing. The agreement includes a $26m option payment, as well as research and develop funding. The antibody for the hard-to-treat target was developed through MD Anderson's Mood Shot program, which works to fast track scientific discoveries into clinical programs. "Current treatments for aggressive leukemias are often toxic," said Dr Molldrem in a statement. "We desired to develop a safer, yet more potent, therapy for these aggressive cancer types that currently have poor survival outcomes. Unfortunately, advancing novel discoveries from the laboratory to drug development has been historically challenging. We hope that this important collaboration will allow us to deliver much-needed antibody-based treatment to the patient's bedside more quickly."</p><p><p><p>
