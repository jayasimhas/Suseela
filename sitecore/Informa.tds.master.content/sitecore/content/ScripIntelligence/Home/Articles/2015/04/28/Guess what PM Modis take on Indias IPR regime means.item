<p>A seemingly mild reference concerning intellectual property rights (IPRs) towards the end of a recent speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the launch of a Global Exhibition on Services in New Delhi has set off an avalanche of interpretations (or misinterpretations) on India's IPR position. </p><p>That the US and India have been engaged in bilateral dialogue around IPR issues only seems to have made the avalanche more intense.</p><p>Within days, PM Modi's statement found its way into the US Trade Representative's (USTR) 2015 "Special 301" report released 30 April, adding to the flow of polarised views on what the Prime Minister really meant. </p><p>"The United States also welcomes April 2015 statements made by PM Modi recommending that India align its patent laws with international standards and encourages India expeditiously undertake this initiative," the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-keeps-India-on-IPR-watch-list-but-expectations-run-high-358181%5d" target="_new">Special 301 report</a> said. </p><p>Here's the nugget of the PM's 23 April speech that set off the chain of interpretations. If seen in isolation, the relevant two lines of the speech delivered in Hindi broadly mean: "In IPR, if we don&rsquo;t work towards taking our IPR in the direction of global parameters, then the world will not keep relations with us."</p><p>PM Modi then went on to refer to the strength of India's entertainment industry, switching back to IPRs and how if India gives confidence to the world on IPRs, it can become a destination globally for creative work.</p><p>India's commerce and industry minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, was, on 4 May, reported in the local media as suggesting that the PM meant that while India was compliant with global standards, it must remain so. </p><p>Nobody appears to be buying Ms Sitharaman's clarification, though, at least for now &ndash; Indian firms are demanding more clarity and foreign firms say they are going by the PM's word. The minister is also reported to have underscored that India will safeguard its interests while adhering to international rules. </p><h2>Local interpretation </h2><p>Indian industry experts said that the PM was probably referring to copyright issues with reference to sectors such as music, films and information technology and not the pharmaceutical sector per se, but underscored the need for measured talk in the area of IPRs, given the "sensitivity" of the subject.</p><p>"Not just the PM, but the government at all levels should be circumspect and very cautious when making statements on IPR. The world picks up every word they say," Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic firms, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Experts also warned that the US' demands on the IPR front were insatiable, underscoring the risk of entertaining negotiations with such an ally in the first place.</p><p>Health policy experts also point to how the USTR report keeps India on the "priority watch list" of partner nations that present the most significant IPR-related concerns for the US, but is laced with "full expectation" that the new channels for engagement created between the US and India in the past year will bring about "substantive and measurable" improvements in India&rsquo;s IPR regime.</p><p>"What are these substantive improvements the US is referring to? Does India plan to introduce TRIPS Plus provisions like data exclusivity through the back door by amending the Drugs and Cosmetics Act or then permit patent linkage? IPR doesn't mean only the patent legislation," a health policy expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The expert said that the Prime Minister's Office and the commerce and industry ministry must clarify India's position on such key issues. </p><p>Last December the US said that it was <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-softening-on-Indian-IPR-fuels-trade-off-claims-355657%5d" target="_new">concluding its out-of-cycle review</a> of India with respect to IPR-related issues amid "useful commitments" made by India including to institutionalize high-level engagement on IP issues, fuelling trade-off allegations.</p><p>Experts also decried the "constant emphasis" on enforcement of IPRs, especially court injunctions, which they claim can't be simply imposed in the area of healthcare where patient lives are involved. The Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+) has urged India to stay "vigilant" with regard to the very real risk of "over enforcement measures" being applied in the country , which would be felt beyond its borders, as exports of medicines could be delayed or stopped due to IP enforcement disputes.</p><h2>Foreign firms</h2><p>Foreign firms are, however, hopeful that PM Modi will walk the talk on IPR issues.</p><p>Ranjana Smetacek, director general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), the voice of foreign innovator firms in the country, said that the PM was "pretty categorical" in his view that India&rsquo;s patent laws should be brought on par with global standards, to make Asia&rsquo;s third largest economy a hub for outsourced creative services.</p><p>"We assume that Prime Minister Modi meant what he said," Ms Smetacek told <i>Scrip</i>, referring to media reports on the PM's speech at the Global Exhibition on Services.</p><p><a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Foreign-firms-Deception-and-hope-in-Indias-IPR-regime-358086%5d" target="_new">OPPI had earlier referred</a> to how Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s "Make in India" vision lists a vibrant IPR regime as one of its stated goals and that robust IP protection will reduce business uncertainty and improve investor confidence. </p><p>Patient groups, on the other, have warned against using IP as a frontline strategy in the "Make in India" plan. "Increased levels of intellectual property &ndash; over and above what international rules mandate &ndash; will not bring investments but create exclusive rights for profiteering and further serve to undermine what remains of generic competition from India," DNP+ said in a note dated 28 April to the government.</p><p>
