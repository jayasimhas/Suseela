<p>Sanofi expects further launches of biosimilars versions of its top-selling diabetes product Lantus (insulin glargine) in Europe in the second half of 2015. There have already been launches in three Eastern European countries, executive vice-president of global commercial operation Peter Guenter told an analyst briefing on Sanofi's second-quarter results on July 30.</p><p>Biosimilar versions of Lantus are now available in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Estonia, priced at a 15-20% discount to Lantus, and Eli Lilly is expected to launch its biosimilar Lantus in the UK this September at a 15% discount to Lantus, Mr Guenter said. In Western Europe, sales of Lantus in the second quarter were &euro;230m, up by 6.3% on the same quarter last year.</p><p>Other sales the French multinational expects to be affected by generic erosion in the second half include those of the antithrombotic Plavix (clopidogrel) in Japan, where sales in the second quarter totaled &euro;208m, and generic competition to the hyperphosphatemia therapy Renagel/Renvela (sevelamer) in Europe and possibly the US. Thirty companies have launched generic versions of Plavix in Japan, but they do not have the full range of Plavix's indications, slowing their uptake, Mr Guenter added.</p><p>Another of Sanofi's established products, the LMW heparin Lovenox (enoxaparin) is also facing sales erosion by biosimilars. Sanofi said it was aware competitors had filed biosimilar versions of Lovenox in Europe. The compound has generic competitors in the US, and its sales were flat in the second quarter at &euro;433m.</p><p>As well as biosimilars holding back sales, higher operating expenses are expected by Sanofi in the second half because of promotion of the lipid lowering PCSK inhibitor Praluent (alicuromab), just approved for marketing in the US. Clinical Phase IV studies with the new basal insulin glargine formulation Toujeo and funding of the new immuno-oncology alliance recently forged with Regeneron will also contribute to higher operating expenses in the second half, noted Sanofi CFO Jerome Contamine. </p><p>The new Regeneron alliance will involve the development of a PD-1 inhibitor currently in Phase I studies, and the evaluation of a series of preclinical antibodies targeting LAG3, GITR and PD-L1, and is expected to build on Sanofi's small group of oncology products that had sales of &euro;390m in the second quarter.</p><p><b>unchanged earnings forecast</b></p><p>Nonetheless, with Sanofi's overall business strongly growing in the second quarter, and an expected 10% positive impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations in the second half, Sanofi is not changing its earnings forecast for the year, consisting of flat to slightly growing earnings per share at constant exchange rates. </p><p>"We will remain rigorous in managing costs," said Sanofi's CEO Olivier Brandicourt. He previously announced plans to divide Sanofi's commercial operations into five business units, and he further explained during the call that these were to "focus and simplify" Sanofi's operations.</p><p>"To effectively market a large product portfolio, specialization is needed. At the same time, business functions common to business units are going to be managed on a global basis," he added. The aim is ultimately to generate savings, but it's difficult to say what these savings will be, if any, Dr Brandicourt said.</p><p>Dr Brandicourt also signaled the return of Sanofi to the mergers and acquisitions arena: "M&A is part of the tools we use for the right opportunity. With a strong balance sheet, it's definitely part of what we can do," he said. </p><p><b>Dengue, lixisenatide filings</b></p><p>During the briefing, Sanofi revealed it expects to have first approvals for its Dengue vaccine before the end of 2015. It has been submitted for approval in key endemic countries in Asia and South America. The GLP-1 receptor agonist Lyxumia (lixisenatide), developed in collaboration with Denmark's Zealand Pharma, has also been submitted for approval in the US this week, following positive results from the ELIXA cardiovascular safety study. The product recorded sales of &euro;10m in the second quarter.</p><p>A combination of lixisenatide with insulin glargine is expected to be filed for approval in the US in the 2015 fourth quarter, and in Europe in the first quarter of 2016. A single once daily injection of the combination has shown positive top-line results in the LixiLan-O study, reported July 29, with superiority over monotherapy with lixisenatide or insulin glargine with regard to reducing HbA1c levels in patients not controlled on oral antidiabetics. A second pivotal Phase III study, LixiLan-L, is due to be completed during the third quarter.</p><p>Phase III studies with the IL-6 targeting antibody sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis recently met their primary endpoints, and a marketing submission is expected in the US before the end of 2015 and in Europe a year later.</p><p><b>Genzyme and MS products in driving seat </b></p><p>Sanofi's 2015 second quarter financial results were driven by its rare diseases subsidiary Genzyme and its animal health business Merial, and held back by its diabetes franchise, particularly by disappointing Lantus sales in the US, that declined by 15.4% compared with the same quarter last year to reach &euro;1.01bn. The decline was caused by the need to offer increased rebates to health care payers to maintain favourable formulary positions, Sanofi said.</p><p>Toujeo had an encouraging start following launches in the US in March and in European markets, and total sales were &euro;13m in the second quarter. 73% of lives covered by commercial health care plans in the US have unrestricted access to Toujeo, including 45% of lives with preferred Tier 2 access. In Medicare Part D, 91% of lives are covered with unrestricted access to Toujeo. </p><p>In Germany, where Toujeo has been available for a number of weeks, 60% of patients treated with the new product have been switched from Lantus, 25% are new patients, and 15% have been switched from other insulins, Sanofi executives said. In contrast, Novo Nordisk's competing product insulin degludec (Tresiba) appears to be making limited inroads into the European diabetes market, possibly because of the company's premium pricing policies, they added. </p><p>Sales of the inhaled insulin product Afrezza, partnered with MannKind, were only &euro;2m in the second quarter since its launch in the US in February 2015, and the lack of any discussion about the product in the briefing suggests it may face being side-lined because of its poor initial uptake, commentators said.</p><p>Among other recently launched products, sales of Genzyme's multiple sclerosis therapy Aubagio (teriflunomide) increased by 80.4% in the quarter to &euro;204m, with a particularly strong performance in France, and the MS franchise is heading to become a blockbuster part of the business with annual sales of more than &euro;1bn. Second quarter sales of the second recently launched MS therapy Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) were &euro;56m, following its launch in the US late last year.</p><p>The oral Gaucher disease therapy Cerdelga had sales of &euro;16m following its recent launch in Europe and the US. </p><p>In the second quarter, Sanofi opted out of evaluating the anti-GDF8 monoclonal antibody SAR391786 with Regeneron that was in Phase II in sarcopenia, and proof-of-concept was not achieved with fresolimumab in focal segmented glomerulosclerosis.</p><p><b>pharma sales up </b></p><p>Overall, Sanofi's pharmaceutical sales grew by 3.7% in the second quarter on a constant exchange rate basis compared with the 2015 second quarter, reaching &euro;7.8bn, with sales at its rare diseases business Genzyme growing by 26.6% to reach &euro;907m, its animal health business growing by 14.2% to reach &euro;691m, and its generics business growing by 9.2% to reach &euro;520m. Group sales increased by 4.9% compared with the 2014 quarter at constant exchange rates to reach &euro;9.4bn.</p>
