<p>Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc. has reported positive results from its second Phase III trial for <i>Rhopressa</i> (AR-13324), which is being tested to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The news sent the company's share price soaring by almost 70% (Sep. 17), and Aerie expects to file its NDA for Rhopressa in mid-2016.</p><p>ROCKET 2 showed that Rhopressa, dosed both once daily and twice daily, achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by demonstrating non-inferiority compared to twice-daily timolol. The news was particularly welcomed as results from ROCKET 1 had prompted the company to change the primary endpoint measures of the second study. </p><p>"As expected, Rhopressa dosed twice-daily generated a higher incidence of adverse events and was slightly more efficacious than Rhopressa dosed once-daily," noted the company.</p><p>"Encouragingly, ROCKET 2 met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority with the beta-blocker timolol for both the QD and the BID dose," commented analysts from Sagient Research's BioMedTracker. "The primary endpoint involved patients with baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) between 20 and 25 mm Hg. This was chosen because the drug had failed to meet non-inferiority criteria in ROCKET 1 in those with IOP <27 mm="" hg="" (the="" primary="" endpoint="" of="" that="" study),="" but="" did="" so="" in="" those="" with="" lower="" baseline="" iops=""></27><26 mm="" hg="" and="" lower),="" even="" performing="" numerically="" better="" than="" timolol="" in="" that="" study."=""></26></p><p>In the current study, Rhopressa also failed to meet non-inferiority in those with IOP <27 mmhg.="" it="" is="" unclear="" why="" rhopressa="" does="" not="" work="" as="" well="" in="" patients="" with="" higher=""></27></p><p>On a conference call accompanying the data announcement, Aerie's newly appointed chief medical officer Dr Richard Lewis said he believed Rhopressa could be used first line in those with lower IOP levels (< 25="" mmhg),="" but="" a="" bigger="" opportunity="" would="" be="" as="" adjunct="" therapy="" to="" prostaglandin="" analogs,="" "which="" is="" half="" the="" market="" in="" the=""></p><p>There are four Phase III registration trials for Rhopressa. Rocket 2 is a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day interim efficacy readout. Safety data for the 12-month period of the Rocket 2 trial are expected late 2015 or early 2016. Rocket 1, the results of which were initially reported in April 2015, was a 90-day efficacy trial that did not achieve its primary endpoint, but did achieve its pre-specified secondary endpoint. Rocket 3 is a 12-month safety-only study in Canada which is currently in progress. A fourth Phase III trial, Rocket 4, is expected to commence in late September 2015. Based on the results of Rocket 2, Aerie expects to submit a NDA filing for Rhopressa in mid-2016.</p>
