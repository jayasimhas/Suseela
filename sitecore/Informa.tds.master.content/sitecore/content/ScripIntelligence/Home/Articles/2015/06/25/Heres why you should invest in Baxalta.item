<p><p>Hospital-focused company Baxter has been planning the spin out of its biopharma business for a couple of years now. The board of directors of the company officially gave the greenlight at the beginning of June and the new company, dubbed Baxalta, is expected to begin trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BXLT on 01 July. </p><p>Baxalta, formerly known as Baxter BioSciences under the former parent company, intends to use its leadership role in the hemophilia market to extend into other therapeutic areas, including immunology and oncology. </p><p>The company has been filling out its leadership ranks over the last few years with executives from competitors like Novo Nordisk and Novartis. Baxalta will have 16,000 employees with about 1,000 in the R&D function and most of them based at the new campus its building in Cambridge, Mass. </p><p>"We're so excited to be here in the heart of the biotech community," said Baxalta Head of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer John Orloff in an interview. "Our model is one of external innovation. So we bring in new assets to feed our pipeline from the outside through in-licensing or M&A. Being in this community and in such close proximity to the biotech partners completely meshes with our strategy."</p><p>Baxalta has already been conducting M&A to bring oncology assets into the pipeline and intends to have 20 new products that will contribute approximately $2.5bn in revenue by 2020 &ndash; a strategy the company has dubbed 20x20. </p><p>"Oncology is a new growth pillar for us and has a natural synergy with hematology," said the CSO. "Our plan is not to compete directly with the big players in oncology, but rather to focus on orphan, niche disease where there are unmet needs. We plan to play in our own sandbox."</p><p>Yet, Orloff acknowledged that Baxalta will face plenty of competition in each of the areas that it has chosen to focus. Its most successful product is the hemophilia A treatment Advate (antihemophilic factor (recombinant)), which accounted for nearly half of the company's $6bn in revenues in 2014 and Baxalta has been working on several different iterations of the drug including longer-acting versions. But even though Advate has maintained its place as the market leader in the space, a host of competitors from the likes of Bayer, Novo Nordisk and Biogen Idec are entering the market.</p><p>Expect to hear big news coming out of Baxalta over the next few years as its gene therapy treatments for hemophilia reach pivotal stages. Currently, hemophilia patients get treated daily; gene therapy could result in only one infusion annually. </p><p>Beyond that, Baxalta will be developing immuno-oncology compounds for combination, as well as monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of immune deficiencies. </p><p><b>What AbbVie says about Baxalta</b></p><p>This isn't the first time the industry has seen a large medical device company spin out its smaller biopharma business; Abbott Laboratories did just that in early 2013 when AbbVie became a publicly traded company. Many investors at the time speculated that spinning off AbbVie was a way for Abbott to limit its exposure to the patent expiration of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira (adalimumab). Investors of Baxter could make the same claims about Advate (albeit on a smaller scale). </p><p>If the success of AbbVie is any indication, Baxter investors should not fret about moving their money over to Baxalta. Two years later, AbbVie has been holding its own as a big pharma, with a market capitalization over $106bn &ndash; more than double its market cap when it debuted as an independent company. Abbvie has been making every effort to diversify its revenue base away from Humira, including its $21bn acquisition of Pharmacyclics for the cancer drug Imbruvica (ibrutinib). </p><p>AbbVie has been nothing but a growth story since its debut on the public markets, and Orloff hopes its patient-centric approach will help it achieve the same level of success. </p><p>Here are just a few of the similarities: </p><p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">DÃ©j&agrave; vu: Baxalta follows in AbbVie's footsteps&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Baxalta&nbsp;</td><td>AbbVie&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Spin out date: </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>July 1, 2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>January 2, 2013</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Headquarters Location: </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>North Chicago, Ill; but a new R&D hub is being built in Cambridge, Mass.
