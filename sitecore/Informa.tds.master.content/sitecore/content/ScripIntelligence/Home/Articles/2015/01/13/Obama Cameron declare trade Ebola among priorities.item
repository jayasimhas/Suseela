<p>President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron at a joint news conference from the White House on 16 January said they plan to push hard to make significant progress this year towards getting the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) done.</p><p>The TTIP, a proposed trade and investment pact between the US and 28 member countries of the European Union &ndash; which has been eagerly embraced by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations when first revealed in February 2013 &ndash; is envisioned to boost economic growth and add new jobs by ironing out regulatory differences (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/USEU-trade-investment-big-deal-pact-could-serve-biopharma-well-339997" target="_new">14 February 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Biopharma-weighs-in-on-US-EU-trade-pact-343084" target="_new">13 May 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Biopharma-weighs-in-on-US-EU-trade-pact-343084" target="_new">17 December 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Trade-officials-TTIP-aims-to-lift-smallmid-sized-firm-barriers-350660" target="_new">17 March 2014</a>).</p><p>"We believe that this needs to be the year when the United States and the European Union make real progress toward the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership," President Obama told reporters. "And we share the view that boosting demand in Europe can also keep our economies growing."</p><p>"We agreed that 2015 should be a pivotal year for an ambitious and comprehensive EU-US trade deal, which could benefit the average household in Britain by &pound;400 a year," Prime Minister Cameron added. "The UK is now the top destination for American and foreign investment, with 500 projects last year providing 32,000 jobs. And America is the UK's biggest trade partner, with exports worth nearly &pound;90bn. We want to build on this." </p><p>Earlier this month, the European Commission released a number of texts laying out the EU's proposals on specific issues, including pharmaceutical and medical device regulation, which are under discussion with the US government as part of the TTIP negotiations (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EU-reveals-proposals-on-pharma-in-TTIP-talks-356024" target="_new">8 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Last week, however, the EC confirmed talks on one of the most controversial parts of the proposed TTIP trade treaty &ndash; the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system &ndash; have been temporarily halted after an online consultation produced what the trade commissioner called "huge skepticism against the ISDS instrument" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Negotiators-suspend-talks-on-investor-protection-in-EU-US-trade-treaty-356165" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Messrs Obama and Cameron also noted both of their nations have made large contributions to the Ebola response efforts.</p><p>"As the two leading contributors to the global response to Ebola in West Africa, we urge the world to continue stepping up with the resources that are required so that we don's simply stop this disease, we do more to prevent future epidemics," President Obama declared. </p><p>"The entire world faces a growing threat from diseases," Mr Cameron said. "Today our fight is against Ebola. In the future, it could be against a global flu pandemic."</p><p>"We must get better at responding to these global health emergencies and make sure we can master them before they master us," the UK prime minister insisted.</p><p>He called on nations to assist in reforming the World Health Organization and establishing a team of experts to be on standby to deploy anywhere in the world.</p><p>Prime Minister Cameron also said there needs to be a new international platform to stimulate the design and development of new drugs.</p><p>This article may also be read at US Capitol Capsule <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p>
