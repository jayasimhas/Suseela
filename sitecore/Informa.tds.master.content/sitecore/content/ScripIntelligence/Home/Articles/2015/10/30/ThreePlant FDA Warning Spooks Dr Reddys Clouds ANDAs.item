<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories was bludgeoned on Indian bourses after the firm said that it had received FDA warning letters at three manufacturing sites, including an oncology plant, in India.</p><p>The announcement, coming days ahead of India's Diwali festival, ruffled investors, who believe that the development could potentially put at risk a string of important US generic approvals, plunging the firm into a "difficult" situation, at least in the short term. </p><p>The Dr Reddy's stock ended 14.65% lower at INR3629.55 ($55.2) on Nov. 6, on the Bombay Stock Exchange. </p><p>Dr Reddy's said that the FDA warning letter dated Nov.5 concerned its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) facilities in Srikakulam and Miryalaguda, as well as an oncology formulation manufacturing site in Duvvada. The agency's action followed inspections of these sites in November 2014, January 2015 and February 2015 respectively.</p><p>The tainted sites are reported to account for an estimated 10-12% of the firm's revenues.</p><p>On Nov. 6, Dr Reddy's informed bourses that it will respond with a comprehensive plan to address these observations within the stipulated time-frame of 15 days.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that the FDA action would put new ANDA approvals "under strain", with the potential risk of escalation to an import alert only making things worse.</p><p>Generic versions of <i>Gleevec</i> (imatinib mesylate) and <i>Copaxone</i> (glatiramer acetate) risk getting delayed, he said.</p><p>"Bulk of the important filings could potentially be under a cloud," Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Some analysts also referred to Health Canada's action late last year, which sought to quarantine health products from the Srikakulam site due to data integrity concerns.</p><p>Last month Dr Reddy's launched generic <i>Nexium</i> (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) in the US, after effecting a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Plan-B-takes-Dr-Reddys-Into-Hot-US-Nexium-Market-360726" target="_new">site transfer</a>, following compliance concerns at Srikakulam. </p><p>Dr Reddy's did not immediately respond to queries from <i>Scrip</i> on the latest FDA warnings.</p><h2>Disclosures</h2><p>Some analysts also appeared peeved that the company was not very specific about the brewing plant-related concerns at its recent quarterly results announcement.</p><p>Surajit Pal, pharma analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher, was reported on CNBC-TV18 as saying that the three-plant warning came as a surprise because investors were focusing on Srikakulam and "nobody ever said a word on the other facilities". </p><p>Others, though, told <i>Scrip</i> that there were some warning signs, which the market seemingly underestimated. </p><p>They referred to the Dr Reddy's statement at the time of its second quarter results on how two of its API customers had received ANDA approval "rescission" letters from the FDA. Each letter, the company said, cites that Dr Reddy's API facility was classified as potential "Official Action Indicated (OAI)" on the date of approval. These ANDAs of customers were approved in January and February 2015, post the FDA's inspection of the Indian firm's API facilities.</p><p>Dr Reddy's chief operating officer, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strong-Q2-For-Dr-Reddys-Amid-Shadow-Of-Plant-Woes-361306" target="_new">Abhijit Mukherjee</a>, in a post-results investor call, said that the firm was "updating the FDA and putting in significant resources" towards improving the systems and quality. </p><p>"How they [the FDA] will move ahead in future is more important, which is still unknown to us and we are engaging with them," Mukherjee then said.</p><p>In its Nov. 6 statement Dr Reddy's CEO, G V Prasad, said that the firm will continue to actively engage with the FDA to resolve issues and has also embarked on an initiative to revamp quality systems and processes, as an "organization-wide priority."</p><p>Indian industry experts also underscored that plant related concerns are not India-specific and companies "across the globe" have had similar issues in the past, including a Pfizer site in China and GlaxoSmithKline's Irish site.</p><p>They also pointed to how Dr Reddy's had in the past set right compliance issues that resulted in an import alert at its manufacturing facility at Cuernavaca, Mexico, in a relatively short time span.</p><p>An <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioAsia-2015-FDA-bioresearch-483s-in-India-dip-356565" target="_new">FDA official</a> commenting on the general experience concerning compliance levels and data integrity concerns in the backdrop of a spate of warning letters against Indian sites had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that the sheer number of facilities and volumes in India may be skewing the debate compared to other nations, which also had similar issues.</p><p>
