<p>Pfizer's last remaining Indian manufacturing facility in Thane will be closed down from 16 September, the second recent plant-related action by a foreign firm after Sandoz said that it intended to discontinue operations at its Turbhe unit by the end of next year. Both facilities are located in the western state of Maharashtra.</p><p>The Thane site, commissioned in 1960s and seen as part of Pfizer India's heritage, has been embroiled in labor-related issues recently, though the American multinational said that the decision to shut the site was based on an assessment of its "long-term viability and ability to achieve the needed production". </p><p>Pfizer India said that there had been practically no production activity at the Thane plant since 2013, and the closure would not impact the supply of any of its medicines to patients. The Thane site was said to produce certain non-sterile formulations of oral liquids, tablets and capsules</p><p>Last year, the Thane site was placed under a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indiscipline-forces-lock-out-at-Pfizers-India-site-353182" target="_new">lock-out</a>, after the company said that worker indiscipline was threatening the safety of management personnel there. Some workers had then alleged that a real estate deal could be on the horizon should the plant be eventually shuttered. </p><p>Some years ago Pfizer divested its Chandigarh, Kalyani and Ankleshwar units in India.</p><p>Some industry experts also claim that large foreign firms have, in general, preferred the outsourced/contract approach to manufacturing and research in India focusing essentially on marketing, though there have been examples of multinational companies committing to fresh manufacturing investments in the country as well.</p><p>The Thane plant employs 212 workers and Pfizer said that it had offered a "generous" voluntary retirement scheme to employees last year upon their request, and this was accepted by 132. </p><p>"The remaining 80 workmen have continued to receive full wages, despite plant inactivity. As a part of the closure process, the company will honor its obligations towards requisite compensation, as mandated by law, for the remaining workmen." Pfizer said in a statement dated 15 July.</p><p>It added that that it remained committed to providing high quality medicines to patients and customers in India. </p><p>Wyeth, which was amalgamated with Pfizer India in December 2014, has a facility in Verna, Goa. Details in Pfizer's latest annual report referred to a "matter of conciliation" concerning the Goa site between the union and the management that was being heard at the state labour commissioner's office following a charter of demands made by the union. </p><p>"The company has adequate manufacturing capacity through existing and other arrangements to ensure continued supply of products," Pfizer said in the annual report. </p><p>Pfizer, however, clarified that the Thane plant closure was not related "in any manner" to its facility in Goa and reiterated the reasons for its decision to close the Thane site. "Pfizer remains committed to its manufacturing operations in Goa and we are in discussions with the union to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution," the company told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The acquisition of Hospira globally is also seen as bringing into the Pfizer fold certain manufacturing assets in India. The Pfizer-Hospira deal was cleared by the Competition Commission of India in June.</p><p>The Thane plant closure announcement comes close on the heels of a report in the local media highlighting Sandoz's intent to discontinue operations at its Turbhe site by end of December 2016. A statement from Sandoz said that it was "refocusing" its manufacturing setup in India as part of efforts to optimize its global manufacturing network while continuing to serve patients in the country.</p><p>The company said that it planned to focus manufacturing at its other sites that employ more than 1,300 associates and produce over 3bn tablets and 180 tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) annually. The Turbhe site employs 170 associates and manufactures antibiotics and APIs.</p><p>In 2012 Sandoz had shuttered its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sandoz-shutters-formulations-RandD-unit-Indian-generic-plans-intact-337710" target="_new">formulations R&D unit</a> in India, prior to which it also closed its API R&D unit. </p>
