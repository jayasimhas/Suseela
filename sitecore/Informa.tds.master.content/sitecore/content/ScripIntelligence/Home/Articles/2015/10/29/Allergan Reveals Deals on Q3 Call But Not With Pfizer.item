<p>Allergan PLC kept mum on its ongoing merger discussions with Pfizer Inc. during its third quarter earnings call Nov. 4, citing Irish takeover laws, but the company still revealed deal news and indicated it is aggressively evaluating business development opportunities. </p><p>Allergan and Pfizer confirmed they are in friendly merger negotiations on Oct. 29, a combination that would create the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. But before the merger talks were announced, Allergan already was in the midst of a major deal to divest its generic drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for $40.5bn.</p><p>The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292" target="_new">potential Pfizer deal</a> and the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-36bn-from-Teva-what-should-Allergan-buy-next-359644" target="_new">transaction with Teva</a> are occurring only months after today's Allergan was created out of the $66bn <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">merger between Allergan and Actavis</a>. The sale to Teva is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016 <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Theres-No-Out-For-The-Allergan-Deal-Teva-CEO-Says-361297" target="_new">regardless of what happens with Pfizer</a>, both Allergan and Teva have said. </p><p>It has been a whirlwind year for Allergan and the action doesn't appear poised to let up. The company presented an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-Seeks-Opportunities-To-Dominate-In-Key-Therapeutic-Areas-361378" target="_new">R&D overview of its pipeline</a> after its earnings conference call. </p><p>While management declined to comment further on the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PfizerGan-Whats-it-Worth-158bn-361313" target="_new">potential mega-deal with Pfizer</a>, the acquisitive company did come to the quarterly call with one deal to announce, a small licensing deal for a candidate for dry eye disease owned by biotech Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals Inc. </p><p>Allergan agreed to pay $50m upfront in exchange for rights to develop and commercialize tavilermide, a topical formulation of a novel small molecule TrkA agonist. Allergan will also fund Phase III development and pay milestones and royalties. </p><p>Allergan has been ramping up its eye care portfolio, currently led by <i>Restasis</i> (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion) for chronic dry eye, which generated $328.3m in the third quarter. </p><p>Allergan has had a lock on the dry eye market, but Restasis could face new competition in the market from Shire PLC's lifitegrast, which the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Could-Get-More-Out-Of-OPUS-3-Than-Refiling-Lifitegrast-361260" target="_new">company plans to resubmit</a> to the FDA after releasing positive data results in October.</p><p>President of branded pharma William Meury said there is enough room in the market for both products. "I don&rsquo;t believe that this is going to be a fight to the death between Shire and Allergan," he said. "The gap between the prevalent population and the prescription-treated population is enormous," he said, adding, "We'll have to see how lifitegrast stands up in the real world."</p><p>Taveilermide is different from other therapies in development for dry eye disease because it induces the production of mucin, a naturally occurring component of tear film, and works upstream prior to inflammation, according to Allergan. </p><p>The drug is currently being evaluated in two Phase III clinical studies. In Phase II testing, the drug demonstrated improvements in signs and symptoms versus placebo with strong comfort and tolerability. </p><p>"This adds a Phase III program further strengthening our dry eye portfolio with potential to launch six new products over the next five years," CEO Brent Saunders said during the conference call. </p><p>Allergan has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/After-152bn-In-Deals-Could-Allergan-CEO-Saunders-Double-His-Money-361329" target="_new">aggressively bringing in new assets</a> this year on top of negotiating larger deals and integrating two earlier mergers, with Forest Laboratories Inc. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Analysts-play-MandA-chess-with-Actavis-Pfizer-352617" target="_new">last year</a> and Actavis this year. </p><p>In ophthalmology, the company already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beyond-Restasis-Allergan-buys-Oculeve-dry-eye-device-359267" target="_new">acquired Oculeve Inc.</a>, a medical device company developing novel treatments for dry eye disease, for $125m upfront. In other areas, the firm bought rights to a portfolio of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-migraine-portfolio-grows-with-Merck-CGRP-antagonists-359295" target="_new">oral CGRP receptor antagonists</a> for the treatment and prevention of migraine for $250m up front from Merck & Co. Inc., and acquired <a href="http://" target="_new">Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc. for $2.1bn</a>, gaining the injectable aesthetic product <i>Kybella</i> (deoxycholic acid).</p><p>In October, Allergan licensed rights to develop and commercialize <i>Constella</i> (linaclotide) for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in Europe and select international markets from Ironwood Pharmaceuticals Inc. </p><p>Saunders indicated the company intends to continue evaluating business development opportunities. One priority, he said, is expanding internationally, an important growth area. </p><p>He also sought to differentiate Allergan from some rivals like Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which have come under fire recently by the public and government for raising prices on old drugs, taking a moment to discuss the issue. </p><p>"We are bold in acquiring and investing in promising treatments for serious diseases, Alzheimer's, severe depression, glaucoma, debilitating gastrointestinal diseases," Saunders said. "Our business model does not involve purchasing old products already in the marketplace and taking excessive price increases. We prefer to acquire mid- to late-stage drugs and invest extensively in their developments."</p><p>Allergan's third quarter sales jumped 90% to $4.1bn versus the prior-year quarter as a result of the merger. Net income was $5.23bn versus a net loss of $1.45bn in the prior year.</p><p><p><p>This article is also published in "<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from sister publications to subscribers.</p><p><p><p>
