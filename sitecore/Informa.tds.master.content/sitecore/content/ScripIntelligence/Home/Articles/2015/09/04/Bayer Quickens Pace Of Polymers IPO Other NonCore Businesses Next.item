<p><p>Bayer will become more focused on its life sciences businesses and able to invest more in supporting its high-growth marketed pharmaceuticals and product pipeline with the sooner-than-expected initial public offering (IPO) for its spun-out plastics and polymers business Covestro, announced Sept. 4.</p><p><p>The diversified German multinational Bayer may now turn to consider the long-term prospects for other possibly non-core businesses within Bayer &ndash; its animal health and consumer/OTC businesses for example, as the success of its portfolio of new pharmaceutical products such as <i>Xarelto</i> (rivaroxaban) and <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept) drives its overall growth.</p><p><p>Bayer has rebuffed such ideas in the past, saying it wants to work on the potential synergies of different parts of its life sciences businesses that includes pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals and seeds. But there may still be assets that are surplus to that vision. Earlier this year Bayer announced it was selling off its diabetes care business to Japan's Panasonic Healthcare for $1.1 bn, a transaction that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. </p><p><p>News of the planned IPO for Covestro on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange comes just days after Covestro was finally separated from its parent company; it became legally and economically independent on Sept. 1, but remained a 100% subsidiary of Bayer. The company said it expected the IPO to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, earlier than previous estimates of mid-2016.</p><p><p>The IPO proceeds will be used to repay Bayer debt - markets analysts believe about 25% of Covestro will be sold to raise around &euro;2.5bn, although market conditions will dictate the exact offering size. At the end of the 2015 first half, Bayer had around &euro;21.1bn in debt.</p><p><p>The new Covestro shares will be offered publicly in Germany and Luxembourg to private and institutional investors, and outside of these countries by private placements. If Covestro had been a stand-alone company last year, it would have achieved net sales of &euro;11.76bn and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of &euro;1.16bn.</p><p><p>
