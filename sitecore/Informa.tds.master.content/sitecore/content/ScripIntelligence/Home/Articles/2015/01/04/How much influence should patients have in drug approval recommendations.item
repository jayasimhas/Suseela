<p>Just how far should patients be involved in decision-making processes regarding new drug evaluations? It's a question that the European Medicines Agency is poring over as it looks at how best to match regulatory science to clinical needs, based partly on the views of those who are on the receiving end of innovation in medicine.</p><p>Patients are now being involved even more closely in the agency's work, and considerable effort is being made to give them more intimate contact with the CHMP, the committee that recommends whether a drug should be approved or not. However, this move to give more patients' views more clout will stop short of giving them a seat on that committee.</p><p>Patient organizations have played a part in discussions at the EMA for many years now, as members of various scientific committees, for example, and as participants in scientific advice procedures at the CHMP and in scientific advisory groups (SAGs). SAGs can be convened by the CHMP or the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (PRAC) when they need advice in connection with the evaluation of specific types of medicines, and patients are invited to take part as individual experts to share their real-life experiences.</p><p>According to Hans-Georg Eichler, the EMA's senior medical officer, and Tomas Salmonson, chair of the CHMP, patient involvement is expected to become "more intense" in future, although exactly how this will happen is not yet entirely clear.</p><p>Speaking to <i>Scrip</i> at the EMA's 20th anniversary conference last month, Dr Salmonson said: "I have to be absolutely honest and say that we don't know the best way for getting patient preferences, so we are trying various ways. Clearly we have patient representatives, and it's almost always on scientific advice procedures." He noted that the agency was allowing patients to participate at the time of the oral explanation at the CHMP, and to have an input to the committee's deliberations.</p><p>Last year, patient representatives were invited to take part in the CHMP's oral benefit-risk discussion of Clinuvel's new phototoxicity drug, Scenesse (afamelanotide) &ndash; something that had not happened with any drug before. Then, in October, the EMA announced a one-year pilot project in which patients would be invited to take part in benefit-risk discussions at the CHMP on specific new products whenever it was thought that their involvement would benefit the discussions.</p><p>Under this pilot, patients will be able to give their views and participate actively in the discussions (including the possibility of asking the company questions). They can join the meeting for the briefing by rapporteurs, followed by the company presentation and the subsequent Q&A session. However, they will have to leave before the committee votes on whether to recommend the product for approval, and so will not take part in the actual recommendation procedure. </p><p>There is little likelihood that patients will get a vote (ie a seat) on the CHMP any time in the foreseeable future &ndash; Dr Salmonson said that "other approaches" to increasing patient involvement would be considered instead. "We will try other ways, more a type of patient panel situation where we will ask a greater group of patients specific questions. We are testing different things, and will see what is working, but we are not having a CHMP patient representative."</p><p>Dr Eichler observed that it was not up to the CHMP to decide whether patients should have a vote on the CHMP, as this would require a change in the legislation. Dr Salmonson said that "personally I think the more important thing is to get specific input on the specific application in the specific disease setting to calibrate the regulator perspectives."</p><p>Guido Rasi, former executive director of the EMA and currently its principal adviser in charge of strategy, spoke of the ever-increasing role of the patient in an interview with <i>Scrip</i> recently. "[Patients] contribute a lot, but I think it is time for them to contribute to the final decision," Professor Rasi said. It's now clear that that contribution does not involve a seat at the CHMP.</p><h2>Training in advocacy</h2><p>Meanwhile, efforts to boost patient advocacy in the regulatory process are being taken forward by the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EPATI), an initiative funded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private partnership between the industry federation EFPIA and the European Commission</p><p>EPATI is running an online course on becoming an "Expert Patient" in the area of drug development. The idea, it says, is to "equip patient advocates with information and tools to understand how the medicines development process works, and motivate them to become more involved in it to make sure research is truly centered around their needs". </p><p>The pharmaceutical companies collaborating in the project "are looking forward to helping the students learn about the process of medicines development so they can go on to become better patient advocates, as well as learning from them", EPATI adds.</p><p>The course includes two five-day training sessions, the first of which was held at the end of March and covered issues such as personalized and predictive medicine and the safety and benefit-risk profile of drugs. The second meeting, in about six months' time, will cover pharmacoeconomics, health economics, clinical trial design, and the roles of patients in that design. </p><h2>Regulatory network strategy</h2><p>The future of the patient role at the EMA is also addressed, albeit briefly, in the "EU Medicines Agencies Network Strategy to 2020", a draft of which has just been released for consultation (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EMA-and-national-agencies-outline-their-vision-of-the-future-regulatory-network-357704" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 7 April). It says that collaboration with key bodies such as patient and healthcare groups will need to be strengthened in order to enable appropriate decision-making and the sharing of information.</p><p>"Further efforts should be made to incorporate patients� values and preferences into the scientific review process which could influence benefit risk decision making across the network. This is particularly important in view of the fact that patients are the ultimate beneficiaries of medicines and that, therefore, their views should be heard," the draft strategy declares. "The network will explore &ndash; together with patients and healthcare professionals &ndash; how to achieve product information more aligned with stakeholders� expectations and needs."</p>
