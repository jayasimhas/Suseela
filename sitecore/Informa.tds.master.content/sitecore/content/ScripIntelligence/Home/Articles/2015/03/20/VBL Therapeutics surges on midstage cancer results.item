<p><p>Israeli biotech VBL Therapeutics, also known as Vascular Biogenics, jumped almost 30% to trade near $7 per share on 25 March after it presented interim, topline results from an ongoing Phase II study of its glioblastoma drug, VB-111. The data was an injection of positivity for a company that has faced tough times so far this year. </p><p>The positive interim results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival over Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) alone. The trial included 46 patients with recurrent glioblastoma who were given VB-111 alone until progression occurred. After progression, patients were given either Avastin alone or a combination of VB-111 plus Avastin. </p><p>One patient remains on VB-111 monotherapy at 424 days. </p><p>Those patients on the combination therapy achieved a median overall survival of 414 days, compared with 235 days for those patients taking Avastin alone (p=0.05). </p><p>Full results from the study will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting 29 May to 02 June in Chicago. </p><p>VB-111 is a gene-based biologic that is being developed for the brain cancer. It has received orphan designation in both the US and Europe, and has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. The company intends to begin a Phase III trial of the drug later this year under a special protocol assessment granted by the FDA. The drug is also being tested in thyroid and ovarian cancer. </p><p>VB-111 is an intravenously-administered anti-angiogenic agent, which uses VBL's "Vascular Targeting System" to target endothelial cells.</p><p>The compound contains a non-replicating adenovector, a proprietary modified murine pre-proendothelin promoter and a Fas-Chimera transgene to angiogenic tumor blood vessels, leading to their apoptosis.</p><p>VBL said VB-111 is the first agent based on transcriptional targeting of tumor endothelium to be assessed in the clinic.</p><p>The US regulatory agency lifted a partial clinical hold on the drug in February after requesting more data on the potency of the drug from the company. </p><p>While investors seemed enthused about the prospects for the drug, late-stage trials of VM-111 could be a bit trickier. The Phase I/II trial had a small patient population and that often skews results; the condition is also hard to treat and has tripped up other drugs in the past. </p><p>"We note that Avastin has had highly variable survival data in the past because of the severity and heterogeneity in treatment of GBM. Many cancer trials fail in Phase III and we caution given the small size of this Phase II in a highly variable population. However, we do see these data as encouraging," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Alethia Young in a 25 March note to investors. </p><p>The news is a much-needed positive for the company, which was dealt a blow earlier this year when its Phase II drug, VB-201, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/VBL-psoriasisUC-trials-flop-but-glioblastoma-hold-lifted-356798" target="_new">failed to meet its primary endpoint</a> in two separate trials for psoriasis and ulcerative colitis.</p><p><p>
