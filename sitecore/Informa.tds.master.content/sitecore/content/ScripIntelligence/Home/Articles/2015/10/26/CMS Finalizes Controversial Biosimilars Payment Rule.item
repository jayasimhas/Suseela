<p>Ignoring the objections by several lawmakers and various lobbying groups, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) late last week finalized a rule it proposed in July that would lump biosimilars referenced on the same innovator into the same Medicare Part B reimbursement rate.</p><p>CMS said it plans to use a single average sales price (ASP) payment limit for biosimilars that are assigned to a specific healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS) code &ndash; often referred to as J codes for drugs.</p><p>"In general, this means that products that rely on a common reference product's biologics license application will be grouped into the same payment calculation," <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Group-Biosimilars-need-unique-CMS-reimbursement-codes-359392" target="_new">CMS said in a July 15</a><i>Federal Register</i> notice, which was posted online a few days earlier for public inspection.</p><p>The CMS rule is expected to largely affect biosimilars of Amgen Inc.'s Epogen (epoetin alfa), Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Neupogen (filgrastim) &ndash; the latter of which was the reference for the very first US approval of a biosimilar, Sandoz Inc.'s <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), which won the FDA's blessing on March 6.</p><p>After CMS had proposed the rule, several House and Senate lawmakers had called on the agency to reverse course on its biosimilars J code proposal &ndash; insisting it was going against Congress' wishes &ndash; pointing out the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> specifically states the calculation for reimbursing biosimilars should be made separately, such that each biosimilar would have its own unique payment rate and unique HCPCS code.</p><p>"This language reflects congressional intent to encourage a vibrant biosimilars market and we urge you to enact a final payment rule that provides each biosimilar with a unique code," the lawmakers, who were led by Representatives Anna Eshoo (Democrat-California) and Joe Barton (Republican-Texas), declared in a letter to acting CMS chief Andrew Slavitt.</p><p>They pointed out that biosimilars are large, complex molecules grown in living systems, such as microorganisms, plants or animal cells, and are not the same as small molecule generic drugs.</p><p>"We have heard concerns from patient and physician groups, pharmacy organizations, biosimilar manufacturers and other stakeholder organizations that reimbursement for biosimilar drugs may be important for tracking usage of these drugs for purposes of patient safety and research, medical innovation and increasing patient access to biosimilar treatments," a group of 20 senators said in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Senators-Ask-CMS-To-Pause-Biosimilar-Payment-Rule-360881" target="_new">Oct. 8 letter</a> to Andy Slavitt, the current acting administrator of CMS.</p><p>The Biosimilars Council, a division of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), said it was disappointed by CMS' decision to finalize the biosimilars payment rule.</p><p>"It is unfortunate that CMS chose to ignore the strong reservations expressed by experts from all corners of the supply chain, leading biosimilar manufacturers and others urging the agency to provide non-interchangeable biosimilars with their own independent billing codes and payment calculations," said Chip Davis, president and CEO of GPhA. "This final rule is likely to discourage investment in biosimilar therapies, making it harder for patients to access these new more affordable products in the United States." </p><p>"There is no scientific evidence that suggests it would be appropriate to blend all biosimilar products into a single payment calculation, independent of the reference product," said Bert Liang, CEO of Pfenex Inc. and chairman of the Biosimilars Council. "While we appreciate CMS' recognition that it would be premature to issue a rule regarding reimbursement for future interchangeable biosimilars, placing all non-interchangeable products in a single code independent of the reference product is still misguided. Non-interchangeable products are solely compared to the reference product, and not one another, making this arrangement highly unusual."</p><p>The Biosimilars Forum, which consists of a mixed bag of traditionally brand-name and generic firms &ndash; Allergan Inc., Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Coherus BioSciences, EMD Serono, Hospira Inc., Merck & Co., Pfizer Inc., Samsung, Sandoz Inc. and Teva &ndash; also objected to the CMS rule, arguing that each biosimilar of the same reference product should have its own unique Medicare claims code and payment amount.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last week said it was concerned that the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-Letter-Word-FDAs-BiosimilarsBiologics-Distinction-360142" target="_new">FDA's draft guidance and rule on biosimilar naming</a>, which calls for a random four-letter suffix to be added to the nonproprietary name of each biological product, may hinder competition and recommended the agency consider alternatives.</p><p>The purpose of the FDA's naming convention, the FTC said, is to improve pharmacovigilance and minimize possible inadvertent substitution of biological products that the agency has not determined to be interchangeable.</p><p>But the FTC said that, building on its "extensive experience" in evaluating health care competition and studying competitive issues affecting biologics, it found that the FDA's naming convention, which the commission insisted departed from the drug agency's tradition, "may cause physicians to believe mistakenly that the products necessarily have clinically meaningful differences, potentially resulting in reduced price competition in biologic drug markets."</p><p>The FTC also said the FDA's naming proposal may create unnecessary costs and conflicts with efforts toward global naming harmonization.</p><p>The FTC called on the FDA to reconsider its proposal and suggested alternatives, which the commission said would have less impact on competition that could achieve the drug agency's purpose to avoid inadvertent substitution and improve the reporting of adverse events involving biologics. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
