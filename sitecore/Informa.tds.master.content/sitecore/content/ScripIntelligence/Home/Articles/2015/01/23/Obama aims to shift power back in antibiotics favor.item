<p>President Barack Obama plans to ask Congress for $1.2bn to help battle the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) &ndash; calling on lawmakers to double the nation's current investment.</p><p>Highlighted in the president's proposal is a plan to create an AMR clinical trial network aimed at rapidly testing new medicines against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which will be run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), backed by $100m in new funding.</p><p>President Obama also wants $100m in new funds for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of new antibiotic therapies and diagnostics.</p><p>"Despite the urgent need for new antibacterial drugs, the pipeline of antibiotics in development is inadequate, and commercial interest in antibiotic development remains limited," the White House said in releasing some of the early details of Mr Obama's fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, which he first hinted at during his 20 January State of the Union address (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Overall, the president is seeking more than $650m in spending dollars for the NIH and BARDA dedicated to finding AMR solutions.</p><p>"From our perspective, antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health crises facing the world today," Dr Robin Robinson, BARDA director, told <i>Scrip</i>. "With our expertise, experience and public-private partnership models in development of broad spectrum antimicrobials and diagnostics, BARDA is uniquely positioned to support these collaborative efforts and to deliver new antibiotics and rapid diagnostics for antimicrobial-resistant biothreats and public health pathogens."</p><p>"Federally funded basic research and partnerships with industry have played a crucial role in advancing the discovery and development of novel therapies and diagnostics targeting bacterial pathogens," the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Any strategy to tackle AMR should "leverage powerful modern technologies, in addition to new mechanism antibiotics, including vaccines, novel focused-spectrum monoclonal antibodies, innovative treatments, devices and prevention options coupled with point-of-care diagnostics," BIO said. </p><p>AMR infections sicken about two million Americans each year, killing about 23,000 annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Treating the "super" bugs costs the US about $20bn each year in direct healthcare spending, with the nation losing another $35bn in productivity due to hospitalizations and sick days related to AMR infections &ndash; posing an economic threat to America, the White House said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-Antibiotic-resistance-emptying-the-medicine-cabinet-346608" target="_new">17 September 2013</a>).</p><p>The White House said the president's FY 2016 budget, which the administration is expected to release in full on 2 February, would directly support activities aimed at advancing the discovery and development of new antibiotics, non-traditional therapeutics and vaccines by investing in basic and applied research; provide researchers with scientific support services, such as specimens, sequence data and regulatory guidance; and foster public-private partnerships that reduce the risks, uncertainty and obstacles faced by companies developing new antibiotics.</p><p>The funding is intended to stand up President Obama's five-year multi-pronged strategy for attacking AMR, which he laid out this past September and directed federal agencies under an executive order to implement (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Obama's strategy was issued on the same day his President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology unveiled a report on AMR &ndash; the details of which were first disclosed at a meeting in July 2014 &ndash; in which the panel noted that federal spending to combat the crisis has been limited, with only about $450m in direct funding in FY 2014, or about $1.40 per American (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Staying-ahead-of-tricky-resistant-bugs-PCAST-outlines-path-352852" target="_new">14 July 2014</a>).</p><p>In his budget proposal, President Obama also wants lawmakers to provide $47m for the FDA, which held a joint two-day workshop with the NIH last summer focused on solving problems around AMR (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-antibiotics-pathways-rapid-Dx-dominate-NIH-FDA-forum-353124" target="_new">31 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Partnerships-key-for-antibiotics-future-NIH-FDA-forum-353146" target="_new">01 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer told <i>Scrip</i> the FDA "does not comment on budget proposals," but the White House said those funds will be used to support the evaluation of new antibacterials, with some of the dollars going towards the agency's stewardship efforts in animal agriculture.</p><p>Mr Obama also is proposing to nearly quadruple the US Department of Agriculture's funding to $77m for its antibiotic research and surveillance.</p><p>The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense also would receive increases in their spending levels, to $85m and $75m, respectively, to address AMR-related issues in the hospitals and other healthcare facilities run by those agencies.</p><p>For the CDC, the president is calling for more than $280m to support the agency's activities related to antibiotic stewardship, outbreak surveillance, antibiotic use and resistance monitoring and R&D related to combating antibiotic resistance.</p><p>When antibiotics don't work because of resistance, "that means people have to turn to a second-line therapy or something they would not like to use, and maybe that's a drug that's less effective or a drug with more side effects," said Dr Arjun Srinivasan, associate director for healthcare-associated infection prevention programs at the CDC. "And in some instances, there's not a second therapy to turn to or if there is, it's one that's ineffective. So some people die." </p><p>Antibiotic resistance has always been sort of an "arms race," Dr Srinivasan told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"The bacteria continually develop resistance, and that means we have to continually develop new drugs to fight that resistance. What happened, though, is that bacteria kept going, but drug development has slowed dramatically. And so that balance of power has shifted very much in favor of the bacteria," Dr Srinivasan declared. </p><p>The president's budget proposal, which Dr Srinivasan said takes a "moon shot" approach, is seeking to put the power back in antibiotics' favor.</p><p>If things aren't turned around, medical advances of the past several decades like organ and bone marrow transplants and chemotherapies &ndash; treatments that weaken the immune system and for which antibiotics are needed to prevent infection &ndash; may be lost, he lamented.</p><p>"We need aggressive action, and we need it fast," Dr Srinivasan insisted. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
