<p>While the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> (HR 6) made it through the House &ndash; where only 77 members of 435 opposed the legislation on 10 July &ndash; getting a companion bill through the Senate, where the effort is moving at a much slower pace, is far from a sure thing.</p><p>Indeed, it may be at least two more months before a Senate draft bill is available, if not longer, in Congress' attempt to overhaul the US biomedical enterprise, with the goal of accelerating the discovery, development and approval processes of new drugs, devices and diagnostics &ndash; an effort that is expected to benefit the biopharmaceutical industry in several significant ways, including bringing products to market sooner and cheaper.</p><p>Even if the Senate is successful in passing a bill this year &ndash; something Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), the lead author of the Cures legislation, seems to think is possible &ndash; the legislation may be an entirely different animal than what came out of the House.</p><p>Plus, the way Senate lawmakers decide to pay for their legislation, dubbed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">Healthier Americans</a>, is bound to differ from the House proposal, which primarily plans to depend on the sale of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">80 million barrels of crude oil</a> from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) &ndash; an emergency fuel storage supply established in 1975 after the 1973-74 oil embargo imposed by the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. </p><p>There's also no guarantee President Barack Obama will sign off on using the SPR, given the White House issued a statement last week <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-Cures-bill-responsibilities-exceed-FDA-resources-359315" target="_new">expressing reservations</a> about such a plan, although no veto was threatened.</p><p>Fiscal conservatives in the Senate also may hold tighter to the nation's purse strings when it comes to proposing new funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA under any companion legislation to the House bill.</p><p>The House's proposed $8.75bn for NIH and $550m for the FDA managed to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">escape a challenge</a> for those dollars to be discretionary rather than mandatory. But the fiscal conservatives may win out in the Senate.</p><p>While the House Energy & Commerce Committee held numerous Capitol Hill hearings, roundtables and traveling "listening sessions" over several months before constructing its bill &ndash; led by Representatives Upton, the chairman of that committee, and Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) &ndash; the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee has held only a handful of hearings in Washington.</p><p>Senators Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee), chairman of the HELP Committee, and Patty Murray (Democrat-Washington), the ranking member, are leading the Senate's effort, which got underway in late <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">January</a> with the release of a report, which said lawmakers must focus on how to enable the FDA to consistently and transparently apply the best science to reviews and policymaking that guides development protocols; eliminate barriers and inefficiencies that increase cost, increase time and distract the drug and device regulatory agency from its core mission; and ensure the cost of development is not a barrier to new medical products.</p><p>In discussing the report, its lead author, Senator Richard Burr (Republican-North Carolina), insisted there needs to be a full review of the FDA's funding, specifically, user fees, before the next round of negotiations begin on the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, which will expire next in 2017.</p><p>In April, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, pleaded with Senators "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">don't break what is working</a>," but instead, "improve on the current system."</p><p>She also worried that her agency would be left with more unfunded mandates, which she said would divert attention from the FDA's drug and device review processes, causing performance to suffer &ndash; something the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-Cures-bill-responsibilities-exceed-FDA-resources-359315" target="_new">White House echoed</a> last week about the Cures bill.</p><p>While NIH leaders have been ecstatic over the $8.75bn in Cures &ndash; which actually was trimmed down from <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn initially proposed</a> &ndash; the FDA told <i>Scrip</i> it would need <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">about double</a> what the House put in its bill to implement the provisions.</p><p>Senators Alexander and Murray have kept mum on whether they will match the Cures bill on funding.</p><p>In structuring their legislation, the HELP leaders formed working groups to work out the issues.</p><p>Senator Alexander has changed the timelines on the Senate bill a few times &ndash; first declaring he didn't expect draft legislation before the end of the year and later saying hoped to have it out after Congress returns from its August recess, possibly in September, with plans for additional hearings. </p><p>Even then, the draft Senate legislation is likely to go through several revisions, much like the path the House bill took, which even went through <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">more changes</a> after it left the E&C Committee on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">21 May</a>.</p><p>There were several groups that lobbied hard to get the House Cures bill passed &ndash; including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization.</p><p>But not everyone in the biomedical community was on board &ndash; including former FDA Commissioner Dr David Kessler, now a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who charged that the Cures legislation "could substantially <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lawmakers-Cures-bill-wont-sacrifice-US-drug-safety-358983" target="_new">lower the standards for approval</a> of many medical products, potentially placing patients at unnecessary risk of injury or death." </p><p>In an 11 June <i>New York Times</i> op-ed, Dr Kessler and his co-authors said the Cures legislation would weaken the FDA's regulatory processes by allowing consideration of drug approvals based on clinical experience, "replacing scientific data from large numbers of patients in well-designed and controlled clinical trials."</p><p>The Times op-ed authors also raised concerns that the legislation would "mandate the use of biomarkers" to approve a wider variety of drugs, "far beyond just those for serious and life-threatening conditions."</p><p>Drs Jerry Avorn and Aaron Kesselheim of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and Harvard Medical School echoed those concerns in a 25 June <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> commentary.</p><p>It's unclear now whose lobbying efforts will win the day in the Senate.</p><p>But even if the Senate can get its bill across the finish line &ndash; whether this year or next &ndash; it must still be reconciled with the House Cures legislation before President Obama decides to put his signature on it. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">'Cures' adopted;
