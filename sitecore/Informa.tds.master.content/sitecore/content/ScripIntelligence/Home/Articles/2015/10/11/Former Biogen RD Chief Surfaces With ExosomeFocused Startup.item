<p>Douglas Williams turned heads in July when Biogen revealed that its executive vice president leading research and development was leaving to found a biotechnology startup, and now Williams has emerged from the fundraising process as the president and CEO of Codiak BioSciences with venture capital to develop exosomes-based therapeutics and diagnostics.</p><p>Codiak has a handful of employees &ndash; including a CEO with experience at both early-stage and big league biotechs firms &ndash; with plans to add 20 to 30 more during the next year to fill newly-leased lab space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company also has intellectual property licensed from research institutes in Texas and Sweden as well as commitments for more than $80m in Series A and B venture capital, which will help the company take its first therapeutic candidate for pancreatic cancer into the clinic in 2016 and test a pancreatic cancer diagnostic tool. </p><p>"I had a great time at Biogen. It was a wonderful <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Biogen-loses-its-RandD-chief-to-a-small-biotech-359399" target="_new">four years that I was there</a>. We rebuilt the pipeline and there are some great opportunities there," Williams told <i>Scrip</i>, noting that, "For me, personally, I have spent more time in small companies. I enjoy that. When you're a CEO of a small company like this, you are focused on the science, bringing in the right people for the science, and bringing things forward as quickly as possible."</p><p>Prior to Biogen, Williams was CEO of ZymoGenetics <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-to-acquire-ZymoGenetics-for-885-million-302421" target="_new">when it was acquired</a> by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. for $885m in 2010. Other previous biotech leadership roles include chief scientific officer and executive vice president of R&D at Seattle Genetics Inc., senior vice president and Washington site leader at Amgen Inc., and various positions with Immunex Corp.</p><p>"For me, [Codiak] is my first time being employee no. 1. I've never started a company from the beginning and this is a great opportunity in a great area of biology that I think has great prospects," Williams said.</p><p><b>Enlisting Exosome Leaders</b></p><p>Williams described exosomes as vesicles shed by every cell in the body that act as a "FedEx delivery system" for genomic DNA, various RNA species, proteins and lipids. Exosomes travel through the bloodstream or other bodily fluids, make contact with other cells, and dump their contents into the cell's cytoplasm, he explained, and when they deliver messenger RNA into another cell, it changes biology of the recipient cell. </p><p>"We're planning to use exosomes as a drug platform. We'll be producing exosomes, loading them with a variety of payloads to treat diseases, and delivering them to recipients," Williams said.</p><p>Codiak's co-founders are Raghu Kalluri, professor and chairman of the Department of Cancer Biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and Eric Lander, president and founding director of the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, and a professor at both universities. </p><p>Codiak licensed technology developed in Kalluri's lab, where he and his colleagues demonstrated that exosomes derived from normal cells can act as potent cells and travel throughout the body. Lander will contribute his expertise in molecular and computational analysis of the genome to explore the possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications of exosomes.</p><p>Codiak also has rights to IP acquired by Flagship Ventures, one of the startup's venture capital investors, based on the research of Jan Lotvall, a professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and chairman of the university's Krefting Research Centre. </p><p>Lotvall, an advisor to Codiak, published a key paper describing cell-to-cell transfer of nucleic acids via exosomes, which was the basis of IP held by VentureLabs Newco VL27, a Flagship startup that has merged with Codiak.</p><p>The startup recently closed on the first portion of its Series A and B funding, though the initial venture capital allocation was not disclosed. The Series A and B rounds were led by Flagship and ARCH Venture Partners with participation from Fidelity Management and Research Company, the Alaska Permanent Fund and Alexandria Venture Investments. </p><p>ARCH managing director Steven Gillis, Codiak's chairman was the founding CEO of Immunex and recruited Williams to that company more than 25 years ago. Gillis expects the Codiak to become "a dominant force in the field of exosome biology."</p><p><b>First Exosome Therapy In Man</b></p><p>Codiak has preclinical data in mouse models of pancreatic cancer and hopes to reproduce the results in humans with pancreatic cancer in a study that may begin enrolling patients at MD Anderson in 2016. The company's first set of exosomes are designed to deliver a toxic payload to pancreatic cancer cells and change the biology of the tumor's cells. </p><p>"I wasn't looking specifically to get back in to oncology. It just happens that the data led first into pancreatic cancer," Williams said. </p><p>The company also will test a diagnostic that can detect a protein expressed only by exosomes associated with pancreatic cancer to screen patients for the best treatment based on their cancer's mutation.</p><p>Codiak's venture capital commitments gives the company "sufficient capital to move the technology along to get to value inflection points on both the diagnostic and therapeutic side," Williams said. </p><p>He noted that the technology could be used much more broadly in cancer and it could extended beyond oncology to neurodegenerative diseases, regeneration and repair, graft-versus-host disease, immunization and vaccination, based on preclinical data reported in the exosomes field. </p><p>"This is a technology that could go in many different directions. This is not just a specific cancer play in one or two organs. It could cut across all therapeutic areas eventually," Williams said.</p><p><p><p><p>
