<p>IP commercialization may be all the rage for company creation in the UK, but it remains comparatively unknown in the US. The CEOs of two Boston-based groups using that business approach &ndash; Allied Minds PLC and PureTech Health PLC &ndash; spoke to <i>Scrip</i>'<i>s</i> sister publication <i>Start-Up</i> about their firms' strategies for creating and developing life science businesses using the model.</p><p>The London Stock Exchange lists about half a dozen corporations in the business of what's known as "intellectual property commercialization." These are firms that tap promising discoveries, often spun out of academic research centres, and then provide most of the financing to seed independent subsidiary companies to develop the technology into growth businesses that the parent corporation owns wholly or in conjunction with outside institutional investors.</p><p>Intellectual Property Commercialization remains little practiced in the US, unlike the UK, where the paucity of available early-stage venture capital funding led to the alternative model for business origination and where it's now become a hot business model. Since the beginning of 2014, three firms using the model raised close to $500m in IPOs on the LSE. </p><p>With its London listing earlier this year in which it generated $198m PureTech joined the ranks of previous IP Commercialization IPOs, such as Allied Minds, which raised $181m in a 2014 listing, BTG PLC, which garnered $47m through its 1995 IPO, Imperial Innovations Group PLC ($247m, 2006), IP Group PLC ($154m, 2003) and Mercia Technologies PLC ($108m, 2014). </p><p>The more rooted UK IP commercialization industry grew out of the relative weakness of the venture capital community there to support life sciences and technology start-ups. </p><p>US VC funds have long profited from building stand-alone businesses around inventions coming out of American laboratories. </p><p>Christopher Silva, Allied Minds' founder and CEO, said that without an "established venture capital community in the UK, IP commercialization came in as an alternative funding source" for biotech and other high-risk company origination. </p><p>But Silva said the large and growing portfolios of innovative subsidiary companies that Allied Minds and PureTech offer should help change that mind-set within the US investment community.</p><p>"Because of our company structure," explained Silva, "we are not under pressure to exit if a subsidiary is very profitable. Venture capital has to exit no matter how successful a company may be. We are looking for long-term sustainable businesses that Warren Buffett will want to buy," Silva explained.</p><p>"There could be 10 Allied Minds and 10 PureTechs," he said in an interview, "and we'd still have more opportunities than we could handle. It&rsquo;s a nascent sector that could grow a lot."</p><p>Although institutional funds have heavily capitalized Allied Minds, PureTech and other IP commercialization firms, equity investors have also demonstrated plenty of support for them as well; in its first year after going public, Allied Minds was the best performing stock in the UK. Although it has fallen from its highs, the firm continues to trade at around 250% of its IPO and has a market cap of nearly $1.5bn.</p><p>Much of that valuation revolves around the potential Allied Minds has through its partnership arrangements with 34 major US research universities and 34 more federal research centres, and the 22 companies Allied Minds holds &ndash; assets that UK-based investors and analysts appreciate. </p><p>Numis Securities, which is bullish on the group, said in a June 1 note that "US Universities and federal research labs spend over $170bn per annum on research, and Allied Minds has access into a quarter of this market with limited competition. Allied Minds expects to see more than 3,000 ideas during 2015 and to create 5-10 new subsidiaries, adding to its base of 22 entities."</p><p>Meanwhile, PureTech founder and CEO Daphne Zohar has overseen the Boston-based IP commercializer's finance raising of around $300m, including its IPO on the London Stock Exchange. Under her guidance, PureTech has rapidly built a portfolio of innovative emerging firms to take on problems as diverse as oral large-molecule drug delivery, weight loss, hair replacement and treatments for cognitive disorders, pursuing sometimes unexpected therapies to solve them. Zohar chose to take her firm public in London this past June, raising $198m on top of more than $100m PureTech brought in earlier in the year from institutional investors. "London has analysts who cover the sector and investors who are big believers in it," she explained in an interview. </p><p>Analysts at Peel Hunt seemed to confirm that comment in a note saying PureTech's strategic approach "is cross-disciplinary and well networked, sourcing technology globally through a board comprising several 'living legends', a talented internal team and network of advisers. This allows it to home in on promising, valuable IP early, well ahead of the crowd." </p><p>Unlike Allied Minds with its academic and federal relationships for sourcing IP, PureTech Health generates business ideas internally through a more than 50-member team of biotechnology and health care industry experts &ndash; among them Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz, PhD, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and co-founder of Epizyme Inc., who chairs the PureTech scientific advisory board; Chris Viehbacher, most recently CEO of Sanofi and now head of the $2bn Gurnet Point investment fund and also chair of the board of PureTech's immunology subsidiary Vedanta Biosciences; John LaMattina, PhD, who retired as head of Pfizer worldwide R&D and now serves on the boards of several of PureTech's companies; and PureTech co-founder Robert Langer, ScD, the renowned biomedical engineer, MIT professor and entrepreneur behind scores of biotechs.</p><p>"The most important asset outside of our portfolio holdings and pipeline companies is the team and the board as well as our advisory network," Zohar said. </p><p>"Every time we form a company, we start with a wish list of the leading people in the world. And they start the company with us. We actually form the company without knowing which project, which technology we're going to be developing, because we're solving a problem in an unbiased way. That group of over 50 co-founding, leading advisors and experts are like a brain trust for PureTech," Zohar said.</p><p>"Some people could think we're a publicly traded venture fund, and there are elements of our model that are reminiscent of venture, but we're really more of a next-generation biopharma company. We have a pipeline of 12 programs, and five of those are post human proof-of-concept. Several of them are about two to three years away from seeking FDA approval for their first products. So think about us as a health care or biotech company that is focused on the translation of novel academic ideas and applying those ideas and technologies to solve major problems. Instead of business units focused on each of these problems, we have independent companies that we own on average about 75% of. This enables us to grow and scale these programs and attract independent management," Zohar said.</p><p>"We're very similar to a health care company in that we have a pipeline of programs and several of them are not far from potential launch and revenues. The investors that are investing in PureTech are taking a longer-term perspective, similar to health care investors generally. I don't think anybody is investing in PureTech because they think that we're going to start generating product revenue this year or even next. But the idea is that we're creating value. PureTech's companies represent multibillion-dollar opportunities," she said. "As the parent company that owns on average 75% of these companies, plus royalties in some cases, PureTech is going to grow as these operating companies move forward and grow and flourish. So that's the value proposition for our investors. And in many ways it's very similar to a biopharma, but more entrepreneurial," Zohar added.</p><p>(This story was adapted for <i>Scrip </i>by Sten Stovall from a longer piece in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/Start-Up" target="_new">Start-up</a> written by contributor Marc Wortman.)</p><p>
