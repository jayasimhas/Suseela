<p>Having been among the first to adopt a distinct naming convention for biosimilars, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has now put its policy on hold while the World Health Organization thrashes out its own guidelines for the naming of biologic and biosimilar products.</p><p>The move adds yet another dose of uncertainty to the global biosimilars mix, as the WHO weighs up responses to its consultation on a "biological qualifier" and stakeholders await US FDA recommendations on naming and interchangeability following the recent Oncologic Drugs Advisory Panel (ODAC) decision to endorse Sandoz' biosimilar filgrastim.</p><p>In the midst of the nomenclature confusion, the generics industry has been fighting off efforts by some big originator companies to have biosimilars carry a distinguishable INN (international non-proprietary name), while EU legislators have generally sided with the view that there is no need for such a distinction. </p><p>Australia first announced its decision to adopt a specific naming convention for biosimilar substances in July 2013, when it said that the Australian Biological Name (ABN) for a biosimilar should be composed of the ABN of the reference product together with a biosimilar identifier consisting of the prefix <i>sim(a)</i> and a three-letter code issued by the WHO's International Non-Proprietary Name (INN) Committee. It gave the example of the monoclonal antibody infliximab, where this approach would yield the name infliximab simfam, for instance, which would be used in full in all labeling. </p><p>The aim, the TGA said, was to allow prescribers to identify the reference product and distinguish clearly between biosimilars, as well as to help in pharmacovigilance activities. The generics industry, though, was not pleased, insisting that biosimilars should have the same INN as the reference drug.</p><p>Now the TGA says that "following recent international developments in the area of biosimilar naming, the TGA will not be continuing with the previously proposed naming convention for biosimilars while a review of the policy is undertaken". </p><p>These developments include the WHO's consultation on a draft policy on a voluntary scheme for a "biological qualifier" &ndash; a four-letter code &ndash; that could be applied to all biological products but would not be part of the INN. The consultation ended on 19 September 2014, and the WHO is now digesting the responses.</p><p>This proposal "has superseded the previous INN position on which the TGA policy was based", the Australian agency said, and means that its biosimilar naming convention cannot be implemented. </p><p>In the meantime, the TGA says that biosimilars should use the ABN "without a specific biosimilar identifier suffix", so, for example, a biosimilar to the reference product Neupogen "would be named 'TRADENAME' filgrastim". Some manufacturers have taken this approach in the EU, where biosimilars with invented (fantasy) names have been approved alongside those using the INN plus the company name.</p><h2>No sign of US guidance</h2><p>In the US, it's still not clear when the FDA might be ready to release any recommendations on biosimilar naming. On 7 January, amid the excitement over the biosimilar filgrastim review, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) called on the agency to "release final guidance on processes and scientific criteria for the approval of biosimilars, outline its approach to naming and labeling, and clarify its conditions for determining a biosimilar to be interchangeable with its reference biological."</p><p>Jim Greenwood, BIO's president and CEO, said that while the association welcomed the discussion on the scientific approach to reviewing biosimilar applications, "we believe the appropriate way to develop policy on such a significant new approval pathway is through published guidance documents with the opportunity for public comment, rather than through single-application advisory committee meetings.</p><p>The generics industry said that the advisory panel's decision to OK Sandoz' filgrastim was welcome but that more needed to be done to ensure biosimilars get proper access to the market. "Among the next steps is the guidance on biosimilar naming and interchangeability," said Ralph Neas, president and CEO of the generics industry association the GPhA. </p><p>Any departure from the currently accepted INN system "could disrupt experts' ability to track and dispense these medicines, risking provider confusion and elevating the likelihood for mistakes", the association said. "GPhA and more than 30 health organizations agree that it is critical to preserve the system already proven to be safe and effective in Europe and other markets."</p>
