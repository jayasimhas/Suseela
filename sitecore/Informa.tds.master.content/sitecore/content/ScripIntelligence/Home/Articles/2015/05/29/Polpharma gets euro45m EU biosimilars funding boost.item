<p>In an attempt to address unmet medical need in Europe in the areas of Crohn's disease, cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, the European Investment Bank is lending Polish drug manufacturer Polpharma &euro;45m for its biosimilars R&D. </p><p>This is the first EIB operation in Poland and comes under the banner of "InnovFin &ndash; EU Finance for Innovators," a new range of tailored financial instruments for research and innovation, with financial backing from the European Union under Horizon 2020. </p><p>Hannes Teissl, a member of Polpharma's management board, told <i>Scrip</i> the company would use the money "for development works as well as optimization of production and expensive clinical trials." However, he noted that "more than 50% of eligible cost is financed from Polpharma's pocket. But the element of external financing enables us to achieve better return on investment into R&D." </p><p>Polpharma intends to repay the loan within seven years. </p><p>The company said its work in biosimilars attracted InnovFin because its activities are "riskier and harder to access than traditional investments." The company highlighted that a single biosimilar drug can take seven to nine years to develop at 30-50 times the cost of a generic product.</p><p>Mr Teissl said: "Biologics offer state of the art treatments with higher efficiency and lower side effects, and biosimilars offer exactly these molecules at a much more affordable price. After an in-depth scientific and commercial due diligence EIB concluded that the significant market demand combined with the capabilities and verified reputation of Polpharma as a trustworthy partner make this investment an attractive one."</p><p>L�szl� Baranyay, EIB vice-president responsible for lending in Poland, said in a statement that "Projects such as this strengthen the competitiveness and boost the innovative capacity of European health-related industries and businesses." He added that Polpharma is a "role model" for "fast-growing, innovation and expanding companies in Poland."</p><p>The EIB is the long-term lending institution of the European Union and is owned by the EU Member States. It makes long-term finance available for investment in order to contribute towards EU policy goals. Over the past five years the EIB has provided around &euro;10bn for healthcare investment.</p><p>Polpharma currently has 12 products listed in its R&D pipeline. They are in the areas of diabetes, cardiovascular anticoagulants, men's health and irritable bowel syndrome. </p><p>Europe has been regarded as a leader in the use of biosimilar products, and its regulatory framework for such products &ndash; which was designed in 2003 and put into action in 2006 &ndash; has developed more swiftly than those in regions like the US. Other countries that have put in place biosimilar guidances have relied heavily on the EU experience. </p><p>According to the GaBI (Generics and Biosimilars Initiative), Omnitrope (somatropin) was the first product approved in the EU as a biosimilar, in 2006. And as of February this year the European Medicines Agency has approved for use in the EU 21 biosimilars within the product classes of human growth hormone, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoesis stimulating agent, insulin and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)inhibitor,. </p>
