<p><b>The Heads of Medicines Agencies congratulates the EMA on a successful 20 years in the European medicines agencies regulatory network (EMRN) and, says Klaus Cichutek, the national competent authorities are ready to support the EMA by further providing the agency with their experts for the evaluation of medicines. Together, he says, the EMA and the EMRN are ready to meet future challenges.</b></p><p>The European Medicines Agency has come a long way since it was established 20 years ago. It is part of the European medicines agencies regulatory network (EMRN), which is based on a network of national medicines regulatory authorities (national competent authorities or NCAs) for both human and veterinary medicines in the European Union and European Economic Area united in the EMA and in the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA). </p><p>The NCAs provide their scientific and medical experts to the EMA for the evaluation of medicines in the agency's scientific committees, working parties and expert groups. Therefore, the EMA assembles under one umbrella the competences of Europe in regulating medicines. In the centralised system, the EMA provides a single point of regulatory access to the medicines market in all member states of the EU and the EEA.</p><p>The centralised system is complemented by a decentralised system carried out by the NCAs for medicines authorised nationally or through the decentralised and mutual recognition procedure. NCAs conduct post-marketing surveillance in their territories, authorise clinical trials, provide national scientific advice and support innovation as well as conduct inspections. For the past 20 years, the EMRN and the EMA as part of this have been great examples of effective European collaboration.</p><h2>Achievements</h2><p>What have we achieved together with the EMA? A single European system for marketing authorisation and pharmacovigilance has been established. It starts with a single European scientific advice, provided by the EMA with view to ensuring the pivotal clinical trial(s) necessary for marketing authorisation are conducted. There are special incentives for small and medium-size enterprises. Advanced therapy medicinal products are dealt with by a specialised committee. Pharmacovigilance and risk management measures are assessed and taken centrally, with public explanations in European member states given by NCAs. Many more achievements have been made.</p><h2>Still Missing</h2><p>What is still missing is a productive collaboration between regulatory and health technology assessment bodies, to generate a single access to the medicines market. In addition, efforts to reduce the administrative burden for applicants and to streamline the marketing authorisation process with a view to future challenges should be made.</p><p>After 20 years of successfully regulating medicines in Europe and building up the EMA, the HMA looks forward to sustaining the capability and capacity of the network to protect patients and public health and to its continued support of EMA as one of its European focus points. The network is ready to further support the development and rapid access to innovative medicines and to meet future challenges.</p><p>The EMA is ready for this, being well established and having access to excellent experts in Europe.</p><p><b><i>Klaus Cichutek</i></b><i> is chair of the management group of the Heads of Medicines Agencies and president of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, the German Federal Institute for Vaccines and Biomedicines</i>.</p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
