<p>The EU's CHMP has given Alexion the marketing go-ahead for two new enzyme replacement therapies for rare genetic diseases: Kanuma (sebelipase alfa) for the treatment of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-d); and Strensiq (asfotase alfa), the first therapy for the bone disease hypophosphatasia (HPP) that started in childhood.</p><p>Final approvals are expected in the third quarter, after which Alexion will begin the country-by-country reimbursement processes. There are no current therapies approved for the treatment of HPP or LAL-d.</p><p>Kanuma (originally filed by Synageva BioPharma before its acquisition) is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) which will be available as 2mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients of all ages with LAL deficiency.</p><p>The product replaces the activity of the missing enzyme resulting in reduced liver fat content and reduced levels of blood transaminases, LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL and triglycerides. In addition, there was a significant benefit in terms of survival (67%) in the infant form of the disease (Wolman disease) beyond 12 months.</p><p>The most serious adverse reactions experienced by 3% of patients in clinical trials were signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms included chest discomfort, conjunctival injection, dyspnea, generalised and itchy rash, hyperemia, mild eyelid edema, rhinorrhea, severe respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachypnea and urticaria.</p><p>The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for Kanuma for LAL-d presenting in infants and accepted the Kanuma BLA for priority review &ndash; the PDUFA date is set for 8 September. An NDA has also been filed in Japan. </p><h2>Strensiq</h2><p>The CHMP recommend granting of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for Strensiq to treat the bone manifestations of paediatric-onset HPP. The product is a human recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase-Fc-deca-aspartate fusion protein and will be available as 40mg/ml and 100mg/ml solutions for injection. </p><p>HPP is a genetic, chronic and progressive ultra-rare metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization that can lead to deformity of bones and other skeletal abnormalities, as well as systemic complications such as profound muscle weakness, seizure, and respiratory failure leading to premature death, Alexion says.</p><p>The enzyme replacement therapy intended to supplement tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase activity, and is thought to exert its beneficial effects by promoting mineralisation of the skeleton in patients with paediatric-onset HPP.</p><p>Strensiq was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the EU on 3 December 2008. </p><p>The CHMP said the benefit of Strensiq is an improvement in skeletal structure, as demonstrated by x-ray appearance of joints, by histological appearance of bone biopsy material and by apparent catch-up height-gain seen in some patients. The most common side effects are injection site reactions and injection-associated adverse reactions of mostly non-serious character and mild to moderate intensity.</p><p>Alexion completed its rolling NDA for asfotase alfa at the end of last year, and granted it a breakthrough therapy designation in 2013. The company has also filed the product for Japanese approval. </p><p>
