<p>The Australian government's plans for bringing down off-patent drug prices by removing originator brands from the price calculations have not gone down well with the pharmaceutical industry, which claims the move could jeopardize the supply of certain medicines.</p><p>As part of a package of measures passed in June this year, originator brands are to be removed from the calculation of the weighted average disclosed price of drugs funded under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) that have been on the multisource product formulary (F2) for three years or more. </p><p>The removals, which will kick in from 1 October 2016, are expected to result in significant falls in weighted average prices for the medicines affected. In May this year, health minister Sussan Ley said the move could "save some consumers up to 50% off the price of medicines and taxpayers Aus$2bn over five years".</p><p>The government has just <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australia-gearing-up-for-more-price-cuts-this-year-and-next-359547" target="_new">put out for consultation</a> a table of the originator brands it has identified, with comments invited by 7 August. </p><p>But for the industry body Medicines Australia, the move goes beyond the aims of the price disclosure system, whereby the government uses information provided by companies on sales of their products to progressively reduce the prices of PBS drugs and free up money to pay for newer products.</p><p>Tim James, CEO of Medicines Australia, said that the policy as it stands ensures that each product is "inherently sustainable over its intellectual property life cycle and beyond and affords the government the opportunity to subsidize new medicines to patients".</p><p>Removing certain brands from the calculations "artificially suppresses price disclosure calculations" and is "contrary to the intent and design of the policy," Mr James told <i>Scrip</i>. "PBS subsidies will fall below weighted average market prices and as a consequence, supply of some medicines may be at risk." Medicines Australia is working with the government and other stakeholders to limit these consequences, he added.</p>
