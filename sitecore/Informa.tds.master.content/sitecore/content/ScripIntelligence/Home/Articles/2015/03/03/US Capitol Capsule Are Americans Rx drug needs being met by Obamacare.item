<p>Even though prescription drugs are required to be covered by private healthcare insurance offered through the online marketplaces, or "exchanges," created under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), enrollees in those plans in general are paying more in copayments, coinsurance and deductibles for their medicines than Americans who are covered by employer-sponsored plans, researchers reported last week. </p><p>Evidence has shown that higher out-of-pocket expenses leads to adverse health outcomes, like poor medication adherence, and increased use of non-drug services, such as inpatient hospital stays, the investigators said in a report published last week in the health policy journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p>While the ACA, also known as Obamacare, has expanded coverage to millions of Americans, its long-term survival and impact depends not only on how well the exchanges provide access to health insurance, but also on the quality of that coverage, said Dr Christine Buttorff, an associate policy researcher at the Arlington, Virginia-based nonprofit RAND, and her co-author colleagues from the University of North Carolina and Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>An additional concern is whether the coverage for prescription drugs, which is required as part of the ACA's 10 essential health benefits, is as good as or better than what is available in employer-sponsored plans, "especially if more employers decide to drop coverage in future years in favor of allowing employees to enroll in marketplace plans," the researchers declared in their report, which examined data from 27 federally run marketplaces and seven federal-state partnership exchanges (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-scores-victory-in-ACA-health-exchange-proposed-rules-337408" target="_new">20 November 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-IOM-focus-on-affordable-essential-benefits-expected-to-stir-debate-on-drug-prices-322128" target="_new">10 October 2011</a>).</p><p>While the exchange plans generally had lower premiums in 2014 than healthcare insurance offered by employers, the ACA policies provided less generous drug coverage, the authors said in their report, which was funded by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).</p><p>But they also noted that for some low-income Americans eligible for the federal cost-sharing subsidies, the exchange plans may be more comparable to employer-based coverage. </p><p>Healthcare insurance in the US varies with the types of plans offered, such as the tightly run health maintenance organization plans versus preferred provider organization policies, whose premiums are generally higher, but they cover more benefits. </p><p>The ACA plans also are set up in different tiers: bronze, silver, gold and platinum, which reflect actuarial values of 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%, respectively, meaning enrollees would be responsible for 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of their medical costs for all covered benefits. </p><p>Although enrollees in ACA bronze plans pay the least in insurance premiums, they get fewer services and pay more for their medical costs, whereas platinum plan enrollees pay the most for their premiums, but get more services covered and pay less in medical costs. </p><p>The ACA offers two types of subsidies aimed at reducing the amount of money Americans enrolled through the exchanges pay: premium tax credits, which are intended to lower the premiums, and cost-sharing subsidies, which are designed to minimize the out-of-pocket costs of going to the doctor or having a hospital stay. </p><p>It was the premium tax credits that were being argued over at the Supreme Court on 4 March about whether Congress intended for those subsidies to be available to all Americans who qualify or only those who enrolled in exchanges established by the states (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">4 March 2015</a>).</p><p>While the premium tax credits can be applied toward any "metal" level of coverage, the cost-sharing subsidies can only be applied toward silver plans. </p><p>The cost-sharing subsidies also are available only to the lowest-income exchange enrollees who meet all of the other criteria for receiving the premium tax credit. </p><p>Americans with incomes of 100% to 250% of the federal poverty level can qualify for a silver-tier plan with the reduced cost sharing subsidy, essentially making it closer to a more generous gold or platinum plan.</p><p>About 65% of the nearly seven million Americans who enrolled in ACA plans in 2014 selected a silver plan. </p><p>In the <i>Health Affairs</i> article, the researchers noted there was a wide variation in the out-of-pocket costs Americans enrolled in the ACA exchange healthcare plans paid in 2014 for their prescription medicines &ndash; not only across the metal tiers but also within those tiers across plan types. </p><p>Some plans use copays, which are set amounts, like $10, $20 or $30 per prescription, while others use coinsurance, which is a percentage of a drug's cost.</p><p>The copays varied considerably across the types of drugs, such as generic, brand name or specialty. </p><p>Because of the high coinsurance and copays, enrollees in the bronze ACA plans had considerably stronger incentives to use generics and preferred brand-name drugs, versus Americans enrolled in the platinum plans or in the employer-sponsored coverage, the researchers said. </p><p>The percentage of plans using coinsurance for the specialty drugs was over 60% for the silver plans and over 50% for the gold plans, they pointed out.</p><p>To control costs, employers are increasingly using high-deductible plans, which are often paired with a health reimbursement account or health savings account, thereby shifting more of the utilization decisions to the consumers, the researchers said. </p><p>But, they said, "There is concern that these plans reduce the use of preventive or other necessary medical care."</p><p>In contrast, separate drug deductibles can be associated with more generous drug coverage if the copays after the deductible are low, the investigators said.</p><p>But only small percentages of either employer-based or exchange plans used separate drug deductibles in 2014, they said. </p><p>With the significant variations in copays, coinsurance and deductibles, the researchers concluded the results of their study highlighted how important it is for Americans to examine the ACA healthcare insurance plans and to carefully select the one that fits best with their prescription drug needs. </p><p>To help newly insured Americans get the most out of their prescription drug coverage, the authors of the <i>Health Affairs</i> report suggested policies and programs are needed to assist those consumers in matching their medicine needs with a plan's benefit design. </p><p>"Consumers need easy-to-understand, readily available resources to help them compare costs and the coverage of medicines so they can choose the plan that works best for them and their family," PhRMA said in a 6 March blog posted on the lobbying group's website. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>NIH, DC to test use of Gilead's Harvoni</b></p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is partnering with the District of Columbia Health Department to test whether Gilead Sciences&rsquo; recently approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) combination treatment Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) can successfully be used in a community-based setting.</p><p>It used to be that HCV treatment involved long-term use of oral and injectable medications, some of which had unpleasant adverse effects, including flu-like symptoms and depression. </p><p>Because of the complexity of those regimens, HCV treatment largely has been provided by specialist physicians, such as infectious disease doctors and hepatologists. </p><p>But HCV drugs have been revolutionized in the past two years, with the entrance to the US market of combination oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies, which have yielded high cure rates, although the long-term effects of the medicines remain uncertain, the NIH said.</p><p>Until recently, however, the use of the medications has been limited to clinical trial settings, where they have typically been administered by highly specialized care teams in tertiary care hospitals.</p><p>Therefore, successful use of the drugs by primary care doctors, nurse practitioners or physician assistants is largely unknown, the NIH said.</p><p>So the agency and the DC health department plan to conduct the first large-scale, community-based longitudinal study of a DAA-based treatment for chronic of HCV using Harvoni.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the study, known as ASCEND, will help determine whether DAA medications are similarly effective when administered in an urban community-based setting. </p><p>ASCEND plans to enroll about 600 Washington clinic patients with HCV infections or HCV and HIV co-infections. </p><p>In the study, 350 participants will continue treatment with their current specialist and 250 participants will be assigned to a primary care physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, the NIH said.</p><p>All study participants will take a daily dose of Harvoni.</p><p>The study participants will be monitored over a 10-year period for short-term and long-term treatment outcomes, including viral response to the drug and evidence of liver damage. </p><p>The researchers aim to determine whether the type of healthcare provider administering DAA therapy influences its outcome.</p><p>The ASCEND study is expected to be completed in 2025.</p><p><b>HPV vaccine discoverer to lead NCI after Varmus departure</b></p><p>With the exit at the end of this month from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Dr Harold Varmus, who is stepping down as director after five years to open a research laboratory at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and serve as an adviser to its dean, Dr Douglas Lowy, the agency's deputy director, will now take the reins as acting chief.</p><p>Dr Lowy, along with Dr John Schiller, deputy laboratory chief and head of the NCI's Neoplastic Disease Section, discovered virus-like particles and related technologies that led to the generation of effective vaccines that specifically targeted the human papillomavirus (HPV) and its related cancers. </p><p>The pair of researchers in 1992 discovered that a single papillomavirus protein, known as L1, could self-assemble into non-infectious VLPs that closely resembled the outer surface of the actual virus and were highly capable of producing an antibody response that inactivated the corresponding virus. </p><p>They also discovered that the L1s of the major cancer-associated HPVs behaved similarly, provided that the L1 genes were derived from virus producing lesions, according to the NCI.</p><p>Drs Lowy and Schiller also developed widely employed tests for measuring HPV infection-inhibiting antibodies and conducted the first controlled clinical trial of an HPV VLP vaccine. </p><p>They are listed as the inventors on the government-owned patents covering those discoveries, which are licensed to Merck and GlaxoSmithKline for their HPV vaccines.</p><p>This past November, Drs Lowy and Schiller were awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Barack Obama at a White House ceremony (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/White-House-honors-biotech-pioneer-Art-Levinson-355183" target="_new">21 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The two NCI doctors also were honored in September 2013 by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America as recipients of the group's Research & Hope Awards (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Collaborations-of-hope-PhRMA-honors-the-vaccine-enterprise-346507" target="_new">11 September 2013</a>). </p><p>Dr Varmus, a co-recipient of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes, also is the former director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) &ndash; running the agency from 1993-1999 under President Bill Clinton.</p><p>But the NIH's current chief, Dr Francis Collins, called Dr Varmus back in July 2010 to oversee the NCI.</p><p>Dr Varmus' "breadth and depth of expertise in biomedical research is unparalleled, and he's been a tremendous colleague to me and invaluable to the agency," Dr Collins said. </p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
