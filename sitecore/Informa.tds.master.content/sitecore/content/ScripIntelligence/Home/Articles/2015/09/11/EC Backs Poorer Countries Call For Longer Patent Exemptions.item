<p>The European Commission has become the latest body to back calls for an extension to the provision exempting poorer countries from the patenting requirements of the World Trade Organization's intellectual property rules for medicines. </p><p>Under a proposal tabled earlier this year by Bangladesh, the current waiver for the world's least developed countries (LDCs), which is set to expire in January 2016, would be extended indefinitely, meaning that countries could continue to import or produce generic drugs, regardless of the patent status of the reference drug, until they were no longer considered an LDC. </p><p>Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said that although patents stimulate innovation in developed and emerging economies, "intellectual property rules should be a non-issue when the world's poorest are in need of treatment. This exemption will give the least developed countries the necessary legal certainty to procure or to produce generic medicines."</p><p>But while the commission's backing will be welcomed by generics firms and medicines access campaigners, others are not so keen, and there are still some hurdles to jump before the proposal can be agreed. </p><p>The proposal must next gain the support of the Council of the EU (member state ministers), whose decision will determine the position that the commission takes on behalf of the EU in the WTO's TRIPS (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) Council. </p><p>Moreover, the proposal is likely to face opposition from some WTO member countries, such as the US, on the grounds that the LDCs already have a general TRIPS waiver until July 2021 that runs alongside the specific exemption for pharmaceuticals. The TRIPS Council is due to take a decision on the LDCs' request at its Oct. 15-16 meeting. </p><p>The question of ensuring medicines access in the poorest countries beyond the current temporary waivers came to the fore in February this year when Bangladesh put forward a proposal for an indefinite extension to the exemption that was discussed at the June 9-10, 2015 TRIPS Council meeting. </p><p>The proposal, outlined in a communication from the council, said that the economies of the LDCs were extremely vulnerable, with large segments of their population living in poverty and high burdens of infectious and non-infectious diseases. It said these countries were disproportionately exposed to the health risks associated with poverty and that low income levels meant they struggled to provide their population with prevention, treatment and care. "Patent protection contributes to high costs, placing many critical treatments outside the reach of LDCs," it declared.</p><p>At present the LDCs benefit from two exemptions: a specific waiver for pharmaceuticals, which has already been extended by ten years and is due to expire in 2016, and an exemption from the general TRIPS intellectual property provisions, which expires in 2021. </p><p>However, the LDCs say that while the exemptions have facilitated access to affordable medicines in their countries, they continue to face serious health challenges from communicable and non-communicable diseases. "In addition to the socio-economic and financial constraints, LDCs also lack adequate technological base and local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. These special needs and circumstances of LDCs, and the vulnerability of LDCs, confirm the need for a renewed transition period for as long as these constraints remain." In other words, they want to retain the pharmaceutical exemption indefinitely &ndash; that is, until such time as their economies and healthcare systems have developed to a point where they are no longer considered to be an LDC.</p><p>The LDCs can count on the backing of several international organizations, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AID (UNAIDS), which in a joint statement in May this year said there was an "urgent and compelling case" for taking all possible measures to protect the health of people in LDCs. </p><p>In June, a group of NGOs called on WTO members to "unconditionally accord the LDC Group an extension of the transition period with respect to pharmaceutical products and waivers," saying the exemption had so far been "an effective WTO mechanism for improving access to medicines in LDCs."</p><p>In adding its support on Sep. 10, the commission said an indefinite extension to the exemption would "give legal certainty for long-term supply as well as enhance local production of much-needed medicines". It said it would complement the commission's funded development programs for the supply of essential medicines in developing countries and "reinforces the coherence of the EU approach on development policy."</p><p>Commissioner Malmström declared: "I am confident that the Council will support this approach, and that the EU will take the lead in the WTO in this field."</p><p>Just how far that lead will stretch remains to be seen, though: some WTO members have questioned the need for another pharmaceutical exemption from 2016 in view of the fact that LDCs already benefit from the general exemption from TRIPS compliance until July 1, 2021. </p><p>The originator pharmaceutical industry is taking a similar line. Earlier this year the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Associations (IFPMA) said that it "firmly supports the efforts of governments and civil society to increase access to medicines in developing countries, particularly LDCs," but ensuring the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicines was "complex, and must be viewed within the overall context of universal health coverage. </p><p>The federation said that while it continued to support the 2013 decision to extend the general TRIPS exemption until 2021, and that in future LDCs might need certain additional flexibility to implement TRIPS, "additional waivers or extensions do not appear to be necessary at this stage, as the current waiver is in force until 2021." The IFPMA had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.</p><p>In their joint letter, the NGOs said they were "concerned that the WTO Secretariat and some developed country WTO members are questioning the need for a pharmaceutical exemption in view of TRIPS Council decision IP/C/64 which exempts LDCs from general TRIPS compliance till 1 July 2021." </p><p>They claimed there were valid arguments to justify a further extension of the pharmaceutical exemption. The 2013 extension, they said, was "a mere eight years" and disregarded the LDCs' original request for an unconditional extension linked to graduation status (i.e., for as long as a country remained a LDC). They pointed out that the public health crisis in LDCs was a long-term challenge that would last at least as long as these countries remained LDCs. </p><p>"The challenges in health care cannot be resolved in the remaining six-year duration of the general extension. Requiring LDCs to rely on this short duration also creates an unpredictable environment for suppliers and procurers of affordable generic medicines," they said. "Such uncertainty for generics manufacturers, which already hesitate to register and market in LDCs, could affect the prompt availability of affordable medicines in LDCs."</p>
