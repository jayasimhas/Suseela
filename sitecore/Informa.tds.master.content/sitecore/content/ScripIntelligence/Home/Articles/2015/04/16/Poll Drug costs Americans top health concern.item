<p>The high costs of prescription drugs to treat HIV, hepatitis, mental illness and cancer are Americans' chief healthcare concern, with 76% of the public calling for Congress and President Barack Obama to put at the top of their to-do lists ensuring expensive medicines for chronic conditions are affordable for those who need the therapies. </p><p>The findings come from a new poll conducted by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>The survey also found that 60% of Americans think the US government should take action to lower the prices of prescription medicines &ndash; making it a top priority.</p><p>High drug prices have been at the center of an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Analysts-drug-price-advice-Define-yourself-before-opponents-do-350829" target="_new">ongoing debate</a> in Washington since the uproar erupted on Capitol Hill last year over the $1,000-per-pill price &ndash; $84,000 for a 12-week course &ndash; for Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C virus (HCV) medicine Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), which was approved in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-wins-OK-for-Sovaldi-but-1000-a-day-price-criticized-348611" target="_new">December 2013</a>.</p><p>Gilead reported more than $10.3bn in 2014 sales for Sovaldi. </p><p>The company's follow-up combination medicine Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir), priced at $1,125 per pill after its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">October 2014</a> approval, also quickly drew fire.</p><p>An estimated three million or more people in the US have HCV, and with government programs like Medicaid, the Veterans Administration and the US prison system footing a large percentage of the bill for drugs to treat the disease, the ultimate costs to US taxpayers to cover Sovaldi and Harvoni could be staggering &ndash; not simply because of the prices but because of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-the-volume-stupid-350860" target="_new">volume of patients</a> on the drugs.</p><p>More than 160,000 patients started on new HCV drugs last year, many of them on Sovaldi or Harvoni, according to IMS Health, which reported that spending for prescription drugs rose 13.1% in 2014, reaching $373.9bn &ndash; the largest growth rate since 2001.</p><p>IMS also had reported spending on specialty medicines increased $54bn over the past five years, contributing 73% of overall medicine spending growth in that period. </p><p>Private health insurers also have been pushing back against high-cost drugs, with Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of the insurance lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans, arguing companies like Gilead have been asking for a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Innovation-without-high-drug-prices-A-difficult-conversation-351991" target="_new">blank check</a>" when pricing their drugs. </p><p>Payers, however, have made proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors their new target for trying to force lower prices before the medicines even hit the US market.</p><p>Indeed, in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">February</a>, four executives at CVS warned the costs to the US healthcare system of using PCSK9s to treat high cholesterol could reach $200bn annually.</p><p>Even if the medicines were limited in the US to just the familial hypercholesterolemia and severe hypercholesteremia populations &ndash; or about 1.6 million people &ndash; at a cost of $10,000 per patient, that's $16bn annually, they wrote in a 17 February article published in the public policy journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p>The Kaiser poll also showed that fewer than one in five Americans said they've seen any information comparing the quality or prices for hospitals, doctors or health insurers in the past 12 months, and fewer than one in 10 report using that type of information.</p><p>The survey also revealed that for the first time since November 2012, more Americans viewed the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> in a positive light &ndash; 43%, versus 42% who had an unfavorable opinion.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
