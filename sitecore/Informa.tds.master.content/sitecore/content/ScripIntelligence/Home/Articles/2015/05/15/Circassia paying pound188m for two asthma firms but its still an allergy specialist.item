<p> Circassia is acquiring two asthma product developers for more than &pound;188m but this doesn't mean the company is dropping its allergy focus. </p> <p> UK firm Circassia &ndash; whose lead product is Cat-SPIRE, a prescription medicine for cat allergies &ndash; is acquiring Swedish listed asthma device maker Aerocrine for up to SEK1.78bn (approximately &pound;88.3m) and privately held specialty pharma Prosonix for up to &pound;100m. </p> <p> Steve Harris, CEO of Circassia, told <i>Scrip</i> the combination of the current business and these two new units would make a &quot;wonderful allergy-asthma specialist company.&quot; </p> <p> He said, &quot;Allergy leads to asthma, so these companies will sit nicely together. We have always talked about the possibility of looking at asthma and allergy together.&quot; </p> <p> While boosting its asthma pipeline might make some wonder about the potential of Circassia as a takeover target itself, the company's CEO said this wasn't the motivation for the deals. &quot;We're looking to build a successful business; I have no idea about us being acquired. That would be up to shareholders,&quot; he said. </p> <p> Aerocrine is a medical technology company which markets &quot;versatile, easy-to-use exhaled nitric oxide (NO) monitoring devices for research and clinical applications.&quot; Prosonix has a pipeline of asthma and COPD drugs in varying stages of development. </p> <p> The bulk of Prosonix's products are generics but it is also developing what it calls a &quot;super-generic&quot; in COPD, called PSX1002 (glycopyrronium bromide). This a formulation developed using Prosonix's particle engineering technology of the active ingredient in Novartis's long-acting muscarinic antagonist dry powder inhaler product Seebri Breezhaler. And the company has one novel program in its pipeline, PSX2000, which is a series of multi-component particle-based dual and triple combinations. </p> <p> Circassia's rationale for the two acquisitions is the addition of Aerocrine's established sales force and commercial infrastructure, which is already targeting allergy and asthma specialists, and the cash benefits of Prosonix's near-term asthma products. Mr Harris said Circassia was already preparing for the eventual launch of its cat allergy product, and Aerocrine's infrastructure would enhance this activity and allow for &quot;the best possible launch&quot; of the product. </p> <p> Cat-SPIRE is currently being tested in a Phase III trial and Circassia hopes it will be granted approval in the US by the end of 2017. Some have been critical of the prospects for a prescription cat allergy product, when over-the-counter options are so widely available. However, Mr Harris said, &quot;The feedback we have is that allergists are looking forward to having this option. Cat allergy has a big impact on peoples' lives and the doctors we have spoken to say patients will seek this type of treatment.&quot; </p> <p> On the back of these acquisitions Circassia has set a target of achieving eight product launches by 2021 &ndash; an ambitious target for a company that currently has no products on the market. But Circassia's CEO said these goals for the next six years did not set the bar too high. Mr Harris said that a number of these products would be generics from Prosonix's pipeline and that launching a generic is &quot;not like doing a full blown product launch.&quot; </p> <p> Other than Cat-SPIRE, Circassia's own pipeline includes: ToleroMune-Grass and ToleroMune-Dust Mite for the treatment of allergic rhinitis; PAP-1 for psoriasis; and Ragweed-SPIRE, which uses the same technology as its cat allergy therapy. However, Ragweed-SPIRE has not seen the same success so far in clinical testing as the company's lead product. </p> <p> In December 2015, a Phase IIb trial of the allergy candidate <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Dont-tell-hope-no-one-asks-355653">failed to meet its primary endpoint</a>. However, Mr Harris said the data from the Phase IIb study was still positive and a 600-patient Phase II/III trial is planned for the compound next year. </p> <p> Circassia will fund both of its asthma company acquisitions through a placement of new ordinary shares &ndash; it is aiming to raise &pound;275m through the issue of shares of &pound;2.88 each. </p> <p> <b>Related stories</b> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Dont-tell-hope-no-one-asks-355653">Stockwatch: Don't tell, hope no-one asks</a> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Circassia-puts-money-where-mouth-is-IPO-floats-at-top-price-350624">Circassia puts money where mouth is; IPO floats at top price</a> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Jog-on-kitties-Circassia-publishes-cat-allergy-vaccine-data-ahead-of-Phase-III-335498">Jog on, kitties: Circassia publishes cat allergy vaccine data ahead of Phase III</a> </p>
