<p>With the 2014-15 flu vaccine turning out to be a dud against the predominant virus circulating in the US, A(H3N2), the use of antivirals is critical against the disease, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned on 9 January.</p><p>But, said CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden, antivirals are being underused against the flu this season and US patients are paying the price &ndash; some with their lives.</p><p>"Antiviral treatment can mean the difference between a milder illness and a stay in the hospital or intensive care unit, or even death," Dr Frieden said during an afternoon media briefing with reporters. If more people with flu-like symptoms, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma, renal disease or diabetes, got treated with antivirals, "we could prevent potentially tens of thousands of hospitalizations and possibly thousands of deaths," he declared.</p><p>The CDC had starting urging doctors in early December to make better use of antivirals after disclosing for the first time to the broader public the 2014-15 vaccine was not a good match against H3N2, which Dr Frieden said was a &ldquo;nastier&rdquo; virus than the other strains circulating in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/H3N2-flu-drift-alarm-too-late-for-vaccine-355430" target="_new">05 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-warns-severe-flu-season-urges-Tamiflu-Relenza-use-355433" target="_new">05 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-shot-less-effective-this-season-355412" target="_new">4 December 2014</a>).</p><p>There are three flu antivirals approved in the US: Roche's and Genentech's Tamiflu (oseltamivir), GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza (zanamivir) and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals' newly approved drug Rapivab (peramivir).</p><p>The drugs can reduce symptoms, shorten the duration of illness and prevent serious complications, Dr Frieden explained.</p><p>"They're the only medicines that can specifically treat influenza illness, and in the context of an H3N2 predominant season with a less effective vaccine, treatment with anti-flu drugs is even more important than usual," he said. "CDC scientists have looked very carefully at the use of influenza drugs in the clinical setting, and the conclusion is clear, they work."</p><p>But "they aren't being used nearly enough," Dr Frieden said, adding that doctors are failing to prescribe the medicines.</p><p>In fact, he said, one recent study showed that fewer than one in five high-risk outpatients who "clearly should have gotten treatment with antivirals actually did."</p><p>Part of the problem, Dr Frieden said, is prescribers are not aware of the CDC's guidance on use of antivirals.</p><p>He said another problem is some doctors hold the misconception antivirals don't work.</p><p>Consumers also may be unaware flu antivirals are available in the US, Dr Frieden added. </p><p>Doctors also fail to prescribe antivirals within the proper two-day window, therefore leaving the patient without the full benefit of the drugs, he said.</p><p>Dr Frieden urged prescribers not to wait for positive flu tests before prescribing Tamiflu or other antivirals.</p><p>In fact, he said, doing so may delay treatment.</p><p>Dr Frieden insisted doctors should not be worried about the risk of resistance in prescribing antivirals for the flu &ndash; arguing the situation is very different from the inappropriate prescribing that sometimes goes on with antibiotics, which leads to resistance.</p><p>"We have not seen the widespread emergence of resistance to Tamiflu," Dr Frieden said. "So unlike the situation where we're very concerned and we want to actually have better stewardship and conserve the antibiotics used for bacterial disease and we're working to reduce resistance, for the flu season we want to see more antivirals used."</p><p>The greater risk, he said, is progressive illness, hospitalization and death from the flu. </p><p><b>H3N2 drift</b></p><p>Dr Frieden acknowledged it will be a few weeks before the CDC knows for certain the overall effectiveness of this season's flu vaccine against the strains circulating.</p><p>Even though the 2013-14 influenza vaccine turned out to have a 61% overall efficacy against the strains circulating in the US last season, the CDC had declared that rate "solid" in February 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-Flu-vaccines-providing-solid-protection-but-young-adults-hit-hard-350167" target="_new">21 February 2014</a>).</p><p>But at the 9 January briefing, Dr Frieden said a 60% overall efficacy range is &ldquo;not what we would like,&rdquo; especially since vaccines against other diseases typically fall into the 90% range.</p><p>The CDC's most recent influenza viral characterization data indicated that 31.6% of the influenza H3N2 viruses collected and analyzed in the US since 1 October 2014 were antigenically "like" the 2014-15 vaccine H3N2 component, or A/Texas/50/2012. But 68.4% were antigenically different, or drifted, from the H3N2 vaccine virus. </p><p>Among viruses that showed reduced titers with antiserum raised against A/Texas/50/2012, most were antigenically similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 &ndash; the H3N2 virus selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. </p><p>The A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 strain is related to, but antigenically and genetically distinguishable, from the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. </p><p>The CDC admitted the A/Switzerland-like H3N2 viruses were first detected in the US in March 2014 &ndash; shortly after the strains were selected for the 2014-15 vaccine &ndash; and began to increase through the spring and summer.</p><p>Advisers to the FDA are expected to meet on 4 March to discuss which strains should be selected for the 2015-16 vaccine for the US.</p><p>The epidemiology will guide what strains are ultimately selected, Dr Frieden said. </p><p>"We would expect if this variant strain of H3N2 continues, that will be in next year's vaccine," he said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
