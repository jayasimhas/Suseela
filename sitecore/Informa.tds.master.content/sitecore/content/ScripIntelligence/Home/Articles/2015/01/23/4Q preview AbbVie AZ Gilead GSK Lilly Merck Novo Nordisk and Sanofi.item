<p> The full year reporting season is in full swing, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Amgen, Novartis and Roche, among others, having reported a mixed set of numbers this week. </p> <p> Meanwhile, here is an advance look at what we can expect from some of the big names in pharma that are set to report their 2014 and fourth quarter results over the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; </p> <p> <b>All companies' pharma sales 2006-2014</b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/E7F70363CAF946F7AE9FF681D72CDE9C.ashx"> </p> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Company </b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Analyst consensus expectations for 4Q</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>What to watch for</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> AbbVie </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Q4 2014 EPS estimate: $0.85 versus Q4 2013: $0.70 </p> <p> Full-year 2014 revenue estimate: $19.9bn<b> (</b>$5.37bn in Q4) versus full-year 2013: $18.8bn ($5.1bn in Q4 2013) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> AbbVie released its financial guidance for 2015 back on 8 January, highlighting to analysts an expected c30% rise in earnings for this year, likely based on positive sentiment surrounding reimbursement for the newer hepatitis C therapies. </p> <p> Growth in 2015 will be driven by sales from Viekira (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir) in HCV and its blockbuster Humira (adalimumab) for arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, but this will be offset by generic competition for a number of products, including AndroGel (testosterone gel) and the company's cholesterol products. Overall, investors deemed the guidance conservative and sent AbbVie's shares downwards by as much as 2.7%. </p> <p> At the Q4 results, analysts at Credit Suisse say they are looking forward to management's commentary on the Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) launch in the US &quot;amid emerging concerns on significant discounting being needed to obtain favorable formulary positions&quot;. A number of product-related catalysts are expected during the year, most notably the BCl-2 inhibitor ABT-199, which is set to change the treatment landscape in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as for its next-generation HCV program, elotuzumab for multiple myeloma and its JAK-1 program. </p> <p> The company is due to report results on 30 January. </p> <p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AbbVie_st_248854a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/F46F84351FAB4796884E759835E01F6E.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AbbVie_st_248854a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AbbVie_sa_248855a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/EA948FAF96B44C689E15B0F39B85E0E3.ashx"></a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> AstraZeneca </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Q4 2014 EPS estimate: &pound;0.84 versus Q4 2013: &pound;1.23 </p> <p> FY 2014 revenue estimate: &pound;26.28bn (&pound;6.85bn in Q4) versus FY 2013: &pound;25.71bn (&pound;6.84bn in Q4 2013) </p> <p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> When AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot joined AstraZeneca in October 2012, analysts had written off the company as one in decline, with anticipated revenues of $20bn by 2020.

The company reported earlier this month that Brilinta plus aspirin performed better than placebo plus aspirin in the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Brilinta-data-buoys-AstraZeneca-stock-356142" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 14 January 2015</a>). The data could be used to justify Brilinta therapy beyond the approved one-year treatment period. </p> <p> Leerink analysts said that following a discussion with &quot;leading cardiologists,&quot; they were doubling their peak (estimated in 2022) Brilinta forecasts to $3bn in anticipation of both &quot;an expected increase in new-to-brand Brilinta prescriptions and an increased duration of therapy for existing patients.&quot; </p> <p> Meanwhile, Ranbaxy's woes in the US over manufacturing compliance led to AstraZeneca raising its 2014 sales guidance for the second time in two quarters in November (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-continues-to-cash-in-on-worsening-Ranbaxy-woes-354898" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 November 2014</a>). </p> <p> This week the FDA finally approved the first generic version of Nexium, not from Ranbaxy, but from Teva's Ivax Pharmaceuticals (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-continues-to-cash-in-on-worsening-Ranbaxy-woes-354898" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> The company is due to report the results on 5 February 2015 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AZ_stock_248856a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/C1B93EFE1DD44128BF4287832B5FA41C.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AZ_stock_248856a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AZ_sales_248857a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/BA5FCAC347A4471E91C161AA7E2D6B8D.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_AZ_sales_248857a.PNG"> </a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Gilead Sciences </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Full-year 2014 revenue consensus estimate: $24.3bn versus $11.2bn in 2013 </p> <p> Q4 2014 EPS consensus: $2.20 versus $0.55 in Q413 </p> <p> Full-year 2014 EPS consensus: $7.90 versus $2.04 in 2013 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Hepatitis C remains the main focus for Gilead investors, especially the first few months of sales for Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) and the single-pill regimen's impact on Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) sales.

Will the company expand its hepatitis C empire or focus on assets that could protect its HIV franchise from reduced sales as certain products lose patent protection? Or will Gilead continue to look for partnerships and acquisitions that diversify its business, like the recently announced purchase of Phenex Pharmaceuticals worth up to $470m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-buying-another-NASH-program-for-up-to-470m-355961" target="_new">7 January 2015</a>)? </p> <p> Gilead is scheduled to report 2014 earnings on 3 February. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Gilead_st_248858a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/5257B2465B4B4F52BBEA3D3F0ABCCF27.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Gilead_st_248858a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Gilead_sa_248859a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/EC60F0F771074E8F80C75231C8C5583B.ashx"></a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> GlaxoSmithKline </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Q4 2014 EPS estimate: &pound;26.18 versus Q4 2013: &pound;30.10 </p> <p> FY 2014 revenue estimate: &pound;23.14bn (&pound;6.22bn in Q4) versus FY 2013: &pound;26.51bn (&pound;6.91bn in Q4 2013) </p> <p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Analysts are not overly excited about GlaxoSmithKline ahead of its 2014 fourth quarter and annual results presentation as the performance of GSK's US respiratory portfolio continues to disappoint. </p> <p> Leerink analysts say that given the &quot;lack of a material shift in promotional strategy or a significant change in the trajectory of Anoro and/or Breo's uptake thus far,&quot; it is reducing its forecasts to demonstrate a &quot;lack of conviction in GSK's ability to successfully accelerate its respiratory portfolio in the US.&quot; A successful commercial execution on the respiratory franchise remains the main fundamental driver for GSK in 2015, &quot;yet we see few signs of change in strategy or performance.&quot; </p> <p> However, GSK's new vaccine portfolio and the consumer joint venture with Novartis, as well as ViiV's valuation as a standalone business, are all seen as positives for GSK's stock. </p> <p> The company is due to report the results on 4 February 2015. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_GSK_stock_248860a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/12011B9B3EC74C66A3DBDCDB5FF47AB4.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_GSK_stock_248860a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_GSK_sales_248861a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/DD5D430ADD6A432383B85CE86BDDAFB8.ashx"></a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Lilly </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4Q 2014 non-GAAP EPS: $0.73 versus $0.74 in 4Q 2013 </p> <p> Full-year 2014 non-GAAP EPS: $2.78 versus $4.15 Full year 2013 </p> <p> Full-year revenue estimate: $19.68bn versus $23.11bn in 2013 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Lilly has already taken the sting out of its earnings announcement by pre-announcing expectations for 2015 earlier this month (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-slips-on-outlook-355986" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 January 2015</a>).

Merck did not provide any guidance ahead of its 4 February financial report for 2014 revenue and EPS or projected 2015 sales and earnings. </p> <p> Like its peers, Merck also is likely to lean on its recent approvals as well as its research and development pipeline for good news about its growth plans. The fourth quarter of 2014 will be the first full quarter of sales for the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in the treatment of advanced melanoma, which was approved in September in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">4 September 2014</a>).

Merck is dropping the approved hepatitis C drug Victrelis (boceprevir) from its commercial product lineup in light of increased competition from newer, more effective therapies developed by Gilead Sciences, AbbVie and Johnson &amp; Johnson (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-dares-stay-in-hepatitis-C-as-another-drug-dies-356307" target="_new">22 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> Another likely hot topic for investors as Merck reports its 2014 earnings is the company's integration of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, an antibiotic and acute care drug developer acquired for $9.5bn, including the assumption of debt (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mercks-9.5bn-Cubist-buy-overshadowed-by-court-decision-355511" target="_new">9 December 2014</a>). </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Merck_sto_248864a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/2935059E11D74E39829607657B15D40D.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Merck_sto_248864a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Merck_sal_248865a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/D465D946C4A44DB7ADDE3C7ABD5BF464.ashx"></a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Novo Nordisk </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Q4 EPS estimate: DKK2.46 versus Q4 2013: 2.27 </p> <p> FY 2014 revenue estimate: DKK88.0bn (DKK24.0bn in Q4) versus FY 2013 DKK83.6bn (DKK27.1bn in Q4 2013) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Scrip data recently highlighted an interesting observation. Novo Nordisk's reliable quarterly growth successes have come at a cost. US sales have grown year-on-year between 2008 and 2013, but the value of the discounts and rebates that Novo Nordisk's has provided to secure those sales have increased proportionately more (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Scrip-100-Novo-Nordisks-US-sales-growth-comes-at-a-price-356409" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> As Novo Nordisk stated in its 2013 annual report, &quot;Competitive pressures are growing in the managed healthcare industry, driving both consolidation through mergers and acquisitions and increasingly tough rebate negotiations with pharmaceutical companies.&quot; </p> <p> Novo Nordisk's aggressive pricing strategies have paid off. &quot;Despite such pressures and increasing competition from other pharmaceutical companies, Novo Nordisk maintains a competitive presence on the US market.&quot; And that is the bottom line when it comes to Novo Nordisk. </p> <p> The company is also gearing up for the launch of liraglutide as an obesity treatment, where it will be known as Saxenda (it is sold as Victoza for diabetes). It intends to commence launch of Saxenda in the first half of 2015 in the US with an expected salesforce of 500 reps.

Part of the reason Mr Viehbacher was ousted was the worrying recent performance of Sanofi's diabetes business in the US, where pricing pressures are acute and the company's blockbuster Lantus (insulin glargine) is struggling to hold onto as broad a patient base as possible in the face of current competition from Novo Nordisk's Levemir (insulin detemir) and impending threats, possibly from 2016, from Novo Nordisk's Tresiba (insulin degludec) and eventually Lilly/Boehringer Inghelheim's biosimilar Lantus (pending the outcome of a patent dispute with Sanofi). Analysts will scrutinize how well the company has managed to hang onto its Lantus basal insulin franchise &ndash; and how much profit margin it has had to concede to do so &ndash; in advance of the launch of the longer-acting Toujeo. They will be weighing up the plausibility of Sanofi's claim in October that the launch of Toujeo as well as that of Afrezza (the inhaled insulin partnered with Mannkind) and growth in emerging markets will enable it to keep its all-important diabetes portfolio from declining in 2015. </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Sanofi_st_248868a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/E00CAC46964C4A64A69404171EC438E8.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Sanofi_st_248868a.PNG"> </a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/preview_2_Sanofi_sa_248869a.PNG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/3D54AC2E4D8B46BD8B9F8D12E40E433E.ashx"></a> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <i>* Source: stock data from Yahoo Finance; sales data from Scrip Intelligence/ Scrip100</i> </p>
