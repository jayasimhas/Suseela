<p>Raptor Pharmaceuticals fell 37.5% on Sept. 14 to $7.52 per share after the Novato, California-based company revealed that RP103, a delayed-release version of its approved cystinosis drug <i>Procysbi</i> (cysteamine bitartrate) failed in a Phase IIb pediatric non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) clinical trial.</p><p>Raptor was hit hard by negative results for a study conducted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), because investors are watching closely any drug with potential to treat NASH &ndash; a disease that may affect millions of people based on high and rising obesity rates. Despite the setback, Raptor will continue to develop RP103 in rare indications, including Huntington's disease and mitochondrial diseases. </p><p>RP103 did not meet the primary endpoint compared with placebo of improving symptoms in children with biopsy-confirmed NASH in the 169-patient Phase IIb CyNCh trial run by the NIDDK (p=0.34). Investigators were looking for two-point or greater improvements in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS) as well as findings of no worsening of liver fibrosis.</p><p>The data will be submitted for presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference from Nov. 13 to 17 in San Francisco. </p><p>Raptor's president and CEO Julie Anne Smith said in a statement that the company will not pursue further development of RP103 in NASH, since the Phase IIb results replicated serological improvements seen in Phase IIa, but did not translate into a measurable effect on NASH histology for children. </p><p>Sagient Research noted in a Sept. 14 BioMedTracker report that RP103's predecessor Procysbi is believed to act by increasing intracellular cysteine levels, which allows cells to produce more of the potent intracellular antioxidant glutathione. However, Sagient's analysis said, "As this was a subtle approach based on increased antioxidant activity and downstream reduction of inflammation, the expectations for this indication were cautiously optimistic, but unfortunately this did not pan out in histological assessment."</p><p>Raptor is one of several companies that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-The-Intercept-Effect-new-IPOs-and-a-slew-of-financings-349272" target="_new">stood to benefit</a> from investor interest in NASH following the January 2014 announcement of positive results from a mid-stage NIDDK study of obeticholic acid (OCA), which sent Intercept Pharmaceuticals soaring. Intercept's stock more than tripled and eventually rose above $400 per share based on OCA's ability to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Intercept-skyrockets-281-on-NASH-results-349223" target="_new">effectively treat</a> the obesity-related fatty liver disease. But even Intercept isn't immune from doubts, considering its stock has since fallen to $193.85.</p><p>And as Raptor renews its focus on non-NASH programs, its stock is trading at nearly half of its value compared with when the Intercept data were announced.</p><p>"[The RP103 NASH study] clarifies our near-term priorities, which are to maximize the reach of Procysbi in nephropathic cystinosis, further the development of RP103 in Huntington's and mitochondrial diseases, prepare for Quinsair's launch and initiate at least one trial in nontuberculous mycobacteria or bronchiectasis," Smith said. "We remain wholly devoted to developing and commercializing transformational treatments for people living with rare diseases."</p><p>Raptor acquired <i>Quinsair</i> (inhaled levofloxacin; formerly Aeroquin) for lung infections related to cystic fibrosis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Circle-Of-Life-Raptor-Buys-Quinsair-After-Its-Return-To-Original-Developer-360072" target="_new">from Tripex Pharmaceuticals in August</a> with plans to commercialize the product in Europe and Canada, where the drug is approved. The company also will discuss a path to US FDA approval with the regulator and pursue new indications for Quinsair.</p><p>Smith previously told <i>Scrip</i> that Raptor also is evaluating its preclinical assets and looking to add more compounds to its portfolio via <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Interviews-with-future-Raptor-CEO-Smith-Epirus-CEO-Munshi-Clinical-updates-from-Alkermes-BioLineRx-Targacept-352951" target="_new">acquisitions and licensing deals</a>.</p><p><p><p><p>
