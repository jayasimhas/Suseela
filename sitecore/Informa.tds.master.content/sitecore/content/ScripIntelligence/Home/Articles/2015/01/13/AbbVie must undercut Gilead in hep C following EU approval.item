<p>AbbVie has won European approval for its hepatitis C regimen, Viekirax (ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir) and Exviera (dasabuvir), but the company is under pressure to undercut competitor Gilead on pricing if it is to gain market share.</p><p>The European Commission has approved Viekirax and Exviera, two brands used as one regimen, to treat hepatitis C patients with genotype 1, including those with compensated liver cirrhosis, HIV-1 co-infection, patients on opioid substitution therapy, and liver transplant recipients. In addition, Viekirax in combination with ribavirin has been approved to treat genotype 4 patients. The decision was expected following a positive CHMP recommendation in November ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pricing-key-after-EU-blesses-AbbVie-hep-C-breakthroughs-355202" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 14 November 2014).</p><p>While AbbVie is rightly celebrating the news, the company faces an uphill battle to gain traction alongside Gilead's dominant products Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir). The clinical differences between the products are small with comparable cure rates seen for Viekirax/Exviera and Harvoni, but Harvoni carries some minor advantages. Harvoni's dosing schedule is once-daily, compared to AbbVie's regimen which is twice-daily. This means that AbbVie's best shot at differentiation is through pricing.</p><p>Dr Stefan Zeuzem, professor of medicine and chief of the department of medicine at JW Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany, confirmed that pricing will be a key consideration for physicians. &quot;If you have a treatment available which is 20-30% cheaper but has the same side-effect profile, the same duration and the same efficacy, why should you prescribe the more expensive one?&quot; he commented.</p><p>This is a lesson the company already seems to have taken to heart in the US, where AbbVie undercut the price of Harvoni by around $10,000 ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 20 December 2014). The company has also shown a willingness to engage in innovative pricing strategies, signing a unique deal with major US payer Express Scripts ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 23 December 2014).</p><p>Similar tactics could be necessary in Europe, though AbbVie was unwilling to comment on its pricing strategy prior to negotiations in each country. Datamonitor analyst Michael Haydock is expecting AbbVie to try and undercut Gilead in Europe as it has in the US. &quot;Cost per cure is the most important thing to payers, so if AbbVie significantly undercuts Harvoni then I think payers will be happy to recommend it as a preferred first-line option despite its minor disadvantages,&quot; he said.</p><p>He added: &quot;The problem for AbbVie is that Gilead seems to be willing to match whatever discounts are being offered, as shown by the fact that several US payers (CVS Caremark, Anthem, Humana, Harvard Pilgrim Care) have decided to exclusively reimburse Harvoni even after Viekira Pak's launch.&quot;</p><p>As such, AbbVie may need to be more imaginative in its pricing offers. Janssen has made an effort to claw back some market share for Olysio (simeprevir) in England and Scotland by offering a pay-for-performance scheme ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-combats-Harvoni-competition-with-UK-Olysio-pay-if-you-clear-scheme-354505" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 15 October 2014). AbbVie would not comment directly on its openness to this sort of approach, but said it would work with local governments to make its product available to patients as quickly as possible, &quot;irrespective of the burden of disease or the economic situation.&quot;</p><h2>Room for all</h2><p>Despite the challenges, there is certainly room for AbbVie's regimen, and new players to come. For physicians, the situation is win-win. Not only do they now have access to a number of treatment options, each with exceptional cure rates, the drugs are also subject to market forces which will drive down prices. Dr Zeuzem said Viekirax/Exviera was an important addition to the treatment landscape, adding that he welcomed as many new products as possible.</p><p>&quot;We appreciate competition,&quot; he said. &quot;We have very costly regimens, and each competitor entering the field allows healthcare systems to negotiate in a way you cannot do if you deal with a monopoly.&quot;</p><p>Specialists, he said, will likely want to balance their prescriptions across companies and brands, and with experience will find specific advantages to each one. Right now, he added, AbbVie's regimen probably has an edge when it comes to liver cirrhosis given that the company has large datasets showing the product's efficacy in these patients.</p><h2>Will they pay?</h2><p>One problem companies have faced so far is that despite health technology appraisal institutes deeming the new wave of hepatitis C drugs cost-effective, prescribers and healthcare systems have still been reticent about picking up the bill. Since the drugs are so expensive, the initial outlay appears to be daunting for payers who won't see the savings for several years, and have not budgeted for this healthcare revolution in the treatment of hepatitis C.</p><p>But Dr Zeuzem thinks this is nonsense, and will change. &quot;Sooner or later every healthcare system will realize that it is in their best interest from a cost perspective to treat patients,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise, the long-term consequences are tremendous increases in liver cirrhosis, and complications including liver transplants &ndash; very costly situations.&quot;</p>
