<p><p>There have been plenty of casualties due to the consolidation and reorganization of the big pharmas as they try to concentrate on just a few therapeutic areas. This has meant the loss of jobs and plenty of compounds cut. Yet, in a bit of a Cinderella story, AstraZeneca has chosen to spin out its antibiotics unit to create a new biotech with the compounds. </p><p>Entasis Therapeutics, which was unveiled on 01 July, will encapsulate many of AstraZeneca's early-stage anti-infectives, but will not include some of the later-stage small molecules candidates or MedImmune's pipeline of biologic anti-infectives. Development will continue in-house at the pharma for CAZ-AVI (ceftazidime-avibactam), its Phase III cephalosporin/next generation non-beta lactam beta lactamase inhibitor in development for a range of Gram negative infections. </p><p>"What we have at Entasis is quite different," said the biotech's CEO Dr Manos Perros, who was the previous head of Infection and Site Head at the Boston R&D hub for AstraZeneca. "There is a quite a gap from what stayed at AstraZeneca." </p><p>The biotech spin out was not the first plan for the unit, but after the British pharma failed to find a buyer, AstraZeneca decided to play the role of backer. The British pharma announced in March that it would create the spin out and invest $40m in Series A financing. </p><p>Entasis has no further commitment to the big pharma, but Dr Perros noted in an interview that the team could have access to some of AstraZeneca's knowledge and expertise if needed. "Our intent is to seek other investors outside of AstraZeneca," he added. </p><p>Entasis also announced the appointment of Michael E. Fitzgerald previously of Link Medicine as Chief Financial Officer and Chris White of AMAG Pharmaceuticals as Chief Business Officer. Dr Perros' team also includes Dr John Mueller, VP, Program Management & Early Development, who previously served as Senior Project Director, Infection Innovative Medicines & Early Development at AstraZeneca; and Dr Ruben Tommasi as Chief Scientific Officer, who previously served as Executive Director, Infection Chemistry at AstraZeneca.</p><p>For now, Entasis will be moving its development programs forward. Unlike many other early biotechs, the company already has an asset in Phase II, as well as a preclinical candidate nearing IND and a discovery platform. </p><p>ETX0914, formerly AZD0914, is in Phase II for the treatment of gonorrhea and Entasis awaiting proof-of-concept results. The drug already has the FDA's Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and fast track status. The two regulatory perks give the drug a leg up in development and were meant to give companies incentives to develop antibiotics. </p><p>
