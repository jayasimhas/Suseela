<p>The FDA has changed the way it wants to receive proposed changes to risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) &ndash; risk management plans imposed to ensure a drug's benefits outweigh their risks &ndash; and has issued a new guidance document to help manufactures figure it all out. </p><p>In the new guidance, <i>Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies: Modifications and Revisions</i>, regulators have laid out their definitions for submitting "modifications" versus "revisions" and the distinctions between the two.</p><p>The document also outlines how the FDA plans to review and act on any proposed REMS changes under the agency's new standards, which were required to be established by the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> (FDASIA) &ndash; a law <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">signed in July 2012</a> by President Barack Obama and was the same legislation that updated the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> for the fifth round.</p><p>Before FDASIA, there were no categories of changes. Any proposed change to an approved REMS was considered a modification and was required to be submitted as a prior approval supplement, explained Megan Moncur, regulatory health policy analyst at the FDA's Division of Risk Management. </p><p>The FDA's new 2015 guidance has established multiple types of changes and categories: revisions; minor modifications; major modifications; and modifications due to safety labeling changes, Ms Moncur said during a 6 April <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/SmallBusinessAssistance/ucm441222.htm" target="_new">webinar</a>.</p><p>The FDA also now has set multiple submission types intended to align with the different REMS change types.</p><p>"Not surprisingly, there are multiple timeframes for the FDA to take action that align with the different submissions," Ms Moncur said. </p><p>Under FDASIA, the FDA no longer needs safety information to require a REMS modification, she said.</p><p>The law specifies the FDA may require a REMS modification when regulators determine such action is needed to ensure the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks or to minimize the burden on the healthcare delivery system of complying with the REMS.</p><p>While manufacturers were required to include an assessment with the proposed modification submission before FDASIA, that is no longer the case, Ms Moncur said. </p><p>Firms, however, must show there is adequate rationale &ndash; meaning companies must have appropriate information to support proposed changes, such as reasons why they are necessary, the potential effect on the targeted serious risks or patient access to the drug.</p><p>Ms Moncur emphasized that adequate rational is not required for changes considered revisions.</p><p><b>Revisions</b></p><p>REMS revisions are changes that have no effect on REMS risk message or requirement, such as editorial tweaks corrections, typographical errors and changes in the company's name or address and certain alterations to the medication guides, Ms Moncur said.</p><p>In the guidance, the FDA has listed 10 changes that are considered revisions. If the change is not listed in that list, it is considered a modification, noted Kristen Everett, senior program manager at the FDA's Office of New Drugs.</p><p><b>Modifications</b></p><p>Modifications are those changes considered to have an effect on the REMS risk message and requirements.</p><p>Ms Everett said companies can submit minor REMS modifications &ndash; those considered to have a nominal effect on the REMS risk message and requirements &ndash; under a so-called changes-being-effected (CBE)-30 supplement, which is a narrow exception to the general rule that labeling changes require the FDA's approval before implementation.</p><p>She said the FDA will review and act on a CBE-30 supplement for minor REMS modifications within 60 days of receipt. Those changes can be implemented within 30 days of the FDA receipt, but Ms Everett emphasized they are not final until the agency approves them.</p><p>She noted that if the proposed REMS changes do not meet the criteria for minor modifications, the FDA would inform the manufacturer within 30 days.</p><p>Major modifications or those that are done due to safety labeling changes are those that have substantial effects on the REMS risk message and requirements, Ms Everett said.</p><p>Those submissions should include the REMS history and detailed description of the changes, she added. </p><p>For modifications initiated by the manufacturer, the submissions also must include an adequate rationale to support the modifications; redlined and clean versions of the REMS document and appended materials in "Word" format; and an updated supporting document, if appropriate.</p><p>The FDA will review major REMS modifications within 180 days of receipt, Ms Everett said. She stressed that those changes may not be implemented until approved. </p><p>Changes for modifications due to safety labeling may be submitted before or after those alterations have been approved or ordered, Ms Everett said.</p><p>But she said the proposed REMS modifications should be submitted in a separate supplement than the labeling changes.</p><p>Ms Everett said application holders should identify a proposed REMS modification submission with the applicable wording in bold capital letters on the top of the first page of the submission. </p><p>She said the FDA's review and action on "conforming" modifications due to safety labeling changes will be done within 60 days, but for those not considered conforming, the agency will take up to 180 days.</p><p>Ms Everett said the timeframe for the FDA's review in those types of modifications would not begin until the labeling changes have been approved or ordered and regulators have received the modifications that align with the labeling changes.</p><p>In addition, she said, the changes may not be implemented until the agency approves them.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
