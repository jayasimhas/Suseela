<p>No innovative pharma company selling into the reimbursed market anywhere in the world can hope any more to escape scrutiny of the cost and the value of their medicines.</p><p>States and other actors continue to worry away at the established rules of play in various areas. </p><p>European countries like France are trying to force the hand of Roche and make it collaborate in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/therapysector/Roche-v-ANSM-the-French-Avastin-stand-off-359147" target="_new">use of off-label Avastin</a> to treat wet AMD rather than the more expensive approved therapy Lucentis from its partner Novartis, while Gilead Sciences' HCV products Sovaldi and Harvoni have been targeted by various international attempts on their patent estate as payers and activists seeks alternatives to stumping up for these highly effective medicines (the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/China-rejects-secondary-Gilead-Sovaldi-patent-359061" target="_new">latest development was in China</a>). </p><p>The discomfort for pharma just got a little more acute with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Benefit-vs-cost-ASCO-unveils-cancer-drug-value-tool-359071" target="_new">the release of a prototype cancer drug value assessment tool</a> from the American Society of Clinical Oncology). Although the draft assessment framework represents only an initial step with a very limited focus on a small number of specific treatment settings, it is nonetheless highly symbolic as a product of the snowballing concern in the US oncology community about thorny questions of cost and value that until fairly recently were far more vexed in Europe than in the US. </p><p>In some cases (Avastin and Alimta regimens versus prior standard of care in metastatic lung cancer, for example, where Avastin is 65 times and Alimta 11 times more costly) it throws a stark light on the price gulf between the standard of care and the treatment under evaluation. The small or non-existent "Net Health Benefit" score of the two drugs in the assessment turns the heat up higher still under the manufacturers.</p><p>The price/value spotlight has also tempered slightly the enthusiasm for the PCSK-9 inhibitors, which are expected to cost around $10,000 per patient per year (potentially for many years).</p><p>As yet, though, it doesn't appear to be a major concern for the bullish buyers of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-shows-CAR-T-confidence-with-1bn-Juno-investment-359176" target="_new">biotech stock</a>, and soaring values are notable for instance among companies developing investigative CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell therapies, which involve harvesting T-cells from individual patients' blood, genetically engineering them and enabling them to multiply before re-infusing them into patients. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dendreon-seeks-Chapter-11-bankruptcy-as-620m-debt-looms-354946" target="_new">Provenge</a>, anyone?</p>
