<p>Roche will pay $105m up front and up to $475m in milestone fees to acquire Adheron Therapeutics in a deal that may help expand the Swiss big pharma portfolio in the company's key therapeutic areas outside of oncology.</p><p>Berkeley, California-based Adheron, which built a technology platform to disrupt cell adhesion in various diseases, has completed Phase I testing in healthy volunteers for a monoclonal antibody called SDP051 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and fibrosis &ndash; two growth areas for Roche. The acquisition will boost the pharma company's immunology and respiratory portfolios and grow its fibrosis focus, which was broadened by the $8.3bn purchase of InterMune in 2014. </p><p>Michael Brenner founded Adheron in 2006 as Synovex Corp. based on his research at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The company developed SDP051 based on Brenner's discovery of Cadherin-11, a protein that acts as an adhesive between cells. The cell surface protein contributes to joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and it contributes to fibrotic pathology.</p><p>Synovex became Adheron two years ago with the appointment of CEO Hari Kumar and chairman Robert Baltera Jr. and with funding from HealthCare Ventures, Partners Innovation Fund and three pharma-backed venture capital firms: MedImmune Ventures, Amgen Ventures and GlaxoSmithKline's SR One. </p><p>Abzena Plc in Cambridge, England noted on Oct. 9 after Adheron announced its acquisition by Roche that Abzena fully humanized Adheron's first monoclonal antibody. SDP051 is one of 10 clinical-stage humanized antibodies being developed by Abzena's biopharma partners and three of those companies have been acquired.</p><p>Adheron's deal with Roche brings Kumar's career full circle, since he began working in biotech as a researcher at Roche. After three years with Eisai and another stint at Roche, Kumar served as chief business officer at Amira Pharmaceuticals alongside Amira CEO Baltera before the biotech firm was sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amira-asset-DP2-blockers-spun-out-not-part-of-BMS-325-million-buyout-321018" target="_new">for up to $475m in 2011</a>. </p><p>BMS acquired Amira's therapies for fibrosis while candidates for inflammatory disease were spun out into a new company called Panmira Pharmaceuticals, where <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Hari-Kumar-appointed-CEO-of-Panmira-322790" target="_new">Kumar was the CEO</a> before joining Adheron.</p><p>Looking to the future, Kumar said that Adheron is "proud to move our promising investigational medicine to the next level and into a new home at Roche," which he described as a company with "vast experience in researching and developing next-generation medicines."</p><p>SDP051 builds on Roche's existing immunology and respiratory platforms anchored by <i>Actemra</i> (tocilizumab) for rheumatoid arthritis, <i>Rituxan</i> (rituximab) for RA and other indications, <i>Xolair</i> (omalizumab) for chronic idiopathic urticaria and allergic asthma, and <i>Pulmozyme</i> (dornase alfa) for cystic fibrosis. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-to-boost-sparse-respiratory-portfolio-with-8.3bn-InterMune-buy-353527" target="_new">InterMune acquisition added the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</a> therapy <i>Esbriet</i> (pirfenidone) to Roche's fibrosis portfolio. </p><p>While Roche is and most likely will continue to be a dominant oncology player &ndash; 64% of its first half 2015 pharma revenue came from cancer drugs while 16% came from immunology assets &ndash; the company continues to diversify and push into new areas. </p><p>Roche recently revealed positive Phase III results for ocrelizumab in the treatment of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roches-Ocrelizumab-On-Course-As-First-Drug-For-Primary-Progressive-MS-360707" target="_new">primary progressive multiple sclerosis</a>, a segment of MS patients in which pharma has had little luck developing effective therapies thus far.</p><p><p><p><p>
