<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) on 4 June shuttered the facility on its main campus that makes investigational medicines used for trials conducted by the agency's Clinical Center &ndash; considered the premier research hospital in the US &ndash; after the FDA discovered potentially deadly fungus in vials of products, unsanitary conditions and other violations.</p><p>The NIH said six patients were potentially exposed to the contaminated products. They currently are being monitored for signs of infections.</p><p>The shutdown of the NIH's manufacturing center, known as the Pharmaceutical Development Section (PDS), could impact 46 studies and make 250 patients wait for medicines. The agency said it was working to secure alternative sources of products for those patients.</p><p>[<b>Update:</b> NIH late on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NIH-contamination-probed-non-sterile-work-to-continue-358775" target="_new">7 June</a> said only its sterile manufacturing would be affected by the shutdown and non-sterile work would continue.]</p><p>NIH Director Dr Francis called the situation "distressing and unacceptable."</p><p>"The fact that patients may have been put in harm's way because of a failure to follow standard operating procedures," he said, was "deeply troubling." </p><p>Dr Collins said he personally was overseeing the steps to remedy the situation, which he said was being done "as swiftly as possible."</p><p>The FDA sent inspectors to the NIH facility after an anonymous complaint was made to the regulatory agency.</p><p>The inspectors turned up a series of deficiencies, which the FDA said will require a number of corrective actions.</p><p>Specifically, the FDA found spore-forming organisms, such as <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Aspergillus midulans</i>, in two vials of albumin human serum at the PDS, according to a report from the drug regulatory agency.</p><p>The albumin was used for the administration of interleukin in experimental studies, the NIH said.</p><p>Vials made from the same batch were administered to six patients, although it is unknown whether those or other vials were contaminated, the agency said. </p><p>So far, none of the six patients have shown any signs of infection, the NIH said.</p><p>The FDA's inspectors also discovered <i>Bacillus</i> species and Hyaline septate mold at the NIH PDS facility and insects in lighting bays in the clean room area.</p><p>They also uncovered flaws in the PDS center's air handling system and operational failures, including inadequate quality control, insufficient employee training and lack of compliance with standard operating procedures. </p><p>In addition, the FDA's inspectors identified deficiencies "of lesser significance" at the Clinical Center's pharmacy, the NIH acknowledged. </p><p>Representative Frank Pallone (Democrat-New Jersey), ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he was "deeply troubled" by the fungal contamination at the NIH facility.</p><p>"This episode raises concerns about whether proper protocols are in place to guarantee patient safety," he said.</p><p>The NIH said it was convening an external group of experts in microbiology and sterile manufacturing practices to conduct a thorough review, including an assessment of all standard operating procedures, policies, staffing and training, to make recommendations to the NIH director on what corrective actions are needed.</p><p>The NIH pledged to provide the FDA with an interim corrective action plan by 19 June.</p><p>The discovery of the fungal contamination and poor conditions at the NIH comes nearly a year after Dr Collins ordered a comprehensive search of all its laboratory spaces after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Smallpox-discovery-triggers-FBI-probe-NIH-lab-search-352714" target="_new">vials containing smallpox</a> were found tucked away in an unsecured freezer on the agency's campus. </p><p>A few months later, the agency turned up <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ricin-other-unsecured-pathogens-found-at-NIH-FDA-353742" target="_new">other deadly pathogens</a>, including the highly lethal agent ricin, hidden away in their laboratories and improperly stored.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
