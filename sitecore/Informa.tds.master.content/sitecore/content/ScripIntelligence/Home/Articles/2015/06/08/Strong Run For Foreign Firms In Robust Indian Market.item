<p>The Indian pharmaceutical market has reported double-digit growth for the ninth month on the trot, with multinational firms edging ahead with 13.8% growth in July compared with 12.6% by Indian firms.</p><p>Though India firms continue to dominate the domestic market overall, multinational firms such as AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim, continued their strong run with growth of 36.1% and 84% respectively, albeit on smaller bases, in July, data from AIOCD AWACS, the market research agency that tracks retail sales, indicated. </p><p>The Indian market grew by 12.9% in July and was valued at INR83.28bn ($1.3bn). For the 12-months to July 2015, the Indian market stood at INR912.30bn (+14.5%).</p><p>Hari Natarajan, vice-president of business intelligence (India and global audit) at AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS, told <i>Scrip</i> that the Indian pharma market would probably grow at double digits this year, maybe with monthly variations, but assuming no major policy changes including an expansion of drugs under price control. In addition, the "acute portfolio" is also dependent on factors such as the monsoon.</p><p>He also explained that both volume and price increases had contributed to the overall growth of multinational firms at 14.6% as per moving annual total (MAT) data for July 2015.</p><p>Among the top 10 firms in India, Lupin grew by 25.1% followed by Sun (21.8%) and Pfizer (17.2%), while in the 11-20 rank bracket, the local firm Intas had the highest growth of 32.6% followed by Glenmark at 30.9%. GlaxoSmithKline appeared to be the only firm in top 10 list to record a marginal decline in growth in July. </p><p>MSD India, with 30.6% growth, led the chart within the 21-30 rank bracket, followed by Wockhardt at 30.2% and Novartis at 14.1%. Among the 51-60 ranked firms, in addition to Boehringer's strong performance, Eli Lilly grew 32.3%.</p><h2>Brands</h2><p>In terms of therapy areas, nine segments outstripped the Indian pharmaceutical market growth. The gastrointestinals market grew at 16.2%, while the derma and urology segments grew by 19.4% and 18.6% respectively. In the chronic segment, the anti-diabetic market surged 25.4%, with cardiovascular at 17.1%.</p><p>Novo Nordisk's insulin brand, Mixtard, stayed on top as the leading brand on the Indian market in July, followed by Wockhardt's Spasmoproxyvon Plus (dicyclomine+paracetamol + tramadol) and USV's Glycomet-GP (glimepiride+metformin).</p><p>Mixtard grew at 37.4%, Glycomet-GP at 18.4% while MSD India's Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride) recorded a massive 93.4% growth, the data said. </p><p>Significantly, the data also lists AstraZeneca's Brilinta (ticagrelor), which has been on the Indian market since 2012, as among the few products that have moved up ranks fastest into the top 300 brands in India for the month of July 2015. </p><p>AstraZeneca did not respond to specific queries from <i>Scrip</i> on the strong monthly performance but said that its growth strategy underlies in its purpose of pushing the boundaries of science to deliver life changing medicines. </p><p>"In line with our global strategy we continue to focus on our key growth areas which include Brilinta and diabetes," it said.</p><p>AstraZeneca Pharma India had earlier entered into a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-unveils-second-brand-play-in-India-358707" target="_new">distribution services agreement</a> with Sun Pharma, for a new brand of ticagrelor (to be sold as Axcer) for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). </p><p>Sun is also MSD India's co-marketing partner for Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet as part of efforts to improve access in India. Sun markets the products as Istavel and Istamet.</p>
