<p>It's been a big week for biotech, with the annual show-and-tell that is the JP Morgan healthcare conference. West Coast editor Mandy Jackson provided <i>Scrip</i> with on-the-ground coverage of the week's major events, which you can read via the links at the end of this article. Meanwhile, here is a quick digest of the week's other news that may have slipped past you amid the San Francisco frenzy. </p><p><b>GlaxoSmithKline </b>and <b>Adimab</b> have expanded their collaboration. Adimab is to build a unique custom library for GSK to generating bispecific antibody leads. The companies will use the library to discover antibodies against multiple targets and generate bispecific antibodies against combinations of those targets. </p><p>Adimab will also transfer the novel library to GSK for its internal use in the discovery of bispecifics. GSK will have the right to develop and commercialize therapeutic candidates generated from the library. </p><p>The news expands on Adimab's first platform technology transfer and license agreement with GSK, which was signed around 18 months ago (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Adimab-turns-profit-on-deals-with-GSK-Biogen-345321" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 July 2013</a>).</p><p>"GSK has an interest in rapidly assessing biology from bispecific molecules with various target combinations, and the Adimab platform fully provides us with the quality and speed we need," said Neil Brewis, head of biopharmaceutical research at GSK. </p><p><b>Takeda Pharmaceutical</b> has expanded its collaboration with <b>Mersana Therapeutics</b>. Mersana has a biodegradable polymer system known as Fleximer. A drug can be linked to Fleximer, which is then linked to an antibody to create an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). </p><p>Under the original deal, signed last April (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Takeda-strengthens-cancer-focus-with-Mersana-ADC-deal-351146" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 April 2014</a>), the companies have been conducting preclinical, proof-of-concept studies for several Fleximer-ADCs against an undisclosed oncology target under a research license to the Fleximer technology. Takeda has already exercised an option to license commercial rights for the first drug candidate developed under this collaboration, which was announced in October 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Xencor-regains-rights-from-Amgen-plus-three-other-deals-354746" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 30 October 2014</a>).</p><p>The companies have now expanded their alliance to include additional oncology-relevant targets. Mersana could receive additional upfront and milestone payments potentially of more than $300m under the expanded collaboration. "The expansion of our collaboration with Mersana is a testament to the importance of partnership in innovating new treatments for cancer," said Dr Christopher Claiborne, head of the oncology drug discovery unit at Takeda. </p><p><b>Retrophin</b> and privately held <b>Asklepion Pharmaceuticals</b> have signed a deal. The former has acquired the exclusive right to purchase full rights to Asklepion's cholic acid treatment for bile acid synthesis defects, if it secures US FDA approval. Under the agreement, Retrophin will pay Asklepion an upfront payment of $5m and up to $73m in milestones based on the US approval and net sales, plus royalties. Retrophin has secured a line of credit from current lenders to cover necessary payments.</p><p>"We are very pleased with this agreement, which has the potential to significantly accelerate Retrophin's growth in 2015 and beyond," said Stephen Aselage, CEO of Retrophin. </p><p>Cholic acid is under review by the FDA, and is currently approved in Europe for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis. </p><p>Retrophin had a rollercoaster ride in 2014, culminating in the unexpected firing of its former CEO Martin Shkreli three months ago (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Two-key-fires-at-Retrophin-NewLink-three-deals-and-three-financings-354298" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 October 2014</a>). Mr Shkreli negotiated deals for a number of new commercial-stage assets last year while Retrophin's rare disease programs remained stalled in preclinical development (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-revives-inhaled-oxytocin-for-schizophrenia-autism-348755" target="_new">13 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Retrophin-takes-on-Questcor-with-ACTH-analog-files-for-IPO-348904" target="_new">19 December 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-to-spend-63m-on-Manchester-350044" target="_new">14 February</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-secures-more-cash-buys-potential-100m-drug-352080" target="_new">30 May</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-bids-for-Australian-rare-skin-disease-firm-353069" target="_new">28 July 2014</a>).</p><p>Synthetic biology-focused <b>Intrexon</b> and its oncology partner <b>Ziopharm Oncology</b> both climbed sharply following news of their entry into the hot field of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy via a $100m licensing deal with <b>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</b>.</p><p>Under the agreement, Ziopharm and Intrexon will be granted rights for the development and marketing of cancer-targeting technologies from MD Anderson. The deal also includes an exclusive sublicensing agreement through MD Anderson for IP developed at the University of Minnesota. </p><p>The two companies are paying $50m each, payable as shares of each company's common stock. In addition, MD Anderson will also receive an annual $15-20m in research funding over the next three years.</p><p>The licensed technologies have come from the laboratory of Dr Laurence Cooper at MD Anderson and Dr Perry Hackett at Minnesota. The Cooper and Hackett laboratories have been working on the design and clinical investigation of CAR-T therapies using a non-viral gene integration platform, known as "Sleeping Beauty".</p><p><b>AstraZeneca's MedImmune</b> has entered a licensing agreement with privately held biotech <b>Omnis Pharmaceuticals</b> focused on the development of oncolytic viruses. MedImmune will combine candidates from its immunotherapy portfolio with Omnis' lead investigational oncolytic virus program, a genetically engineered strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The program is currently being studied in a Phase I trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers that have metastasized to the liver.</p><p>Under the agreement, MedImmune has the license to develop and commercialize Omnis's lead program. Development of the virus will be accelerated to speed up progress of the combination studies with MedImmune's molecules, it said. Financial details have not been disclosed.</p><p><b>UniQure</b>, developer of the first approved gene therapy Glybera, is to collaborate with a fellow Dutch company called <b>Treeway</b> to develop a gene therapy treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, of "ice bucket" fame).</p><p>Under the agreement, UniQure has granted Treeway an exclusive license to its relevant AAV5 viral vector and GDNF (Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor) intellectual property. Treeway is responsible for the preclinical and clinical development of the ALS gene therapy treatment. UniQure will provide Treeway with its manufacturing capabilities. Treeway and UniQure will jointly commercialize any resulting ALS gene therapy. Financial details have not been disclosed.</p><p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-paying-5.2bn-for-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-356071" target="_new">Shire paying $5.2bn for rare disease specialist NPS</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Acquisitions-remain-priority-for-Shire-after-NPS-356131" target="_new">Acquisitions remain priority for Shire after NPS</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-to-take-majority-stake-in-Foundation-Medicine-356082" target="_new">Pharma trial needs drive Roche's $1.2bn Foundation Medicine deal</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Roche-in-dealmaking-mode-for-antibiotics-diagnostics-356103" target="_new">Roche in dealmaking mode for antibiotics, diagnostics</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogen-Idec-buys-analgesic-developer-Convergence-for-200m-356088" target="_new">Biogen Idec buys analgesic developer Convergence for $200m+</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Gilead-addresses-hepatitis-C-drug-payer-deals-356133" target="_new">Gilead addresses hepatitis C drug payer deals</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Enanta-CEO-on-exciting-Viekira-launch-RandD-pipeline-356151" target="_new">Enanta CEO on 'exciting' Viekira launch, R&D pipeline</a></p><p>
