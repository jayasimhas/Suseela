<p>Indian drug firms may face fewer regulatory hurdles in FY16, in light ofstrengthened quality and control processes. Double digit export growth is likely, led by fully operational US FDA sites on restored regulatory approvals, according to a report by Fitch group company, India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra).</p><p>Consolidation is another ongoing industry theme, with Ind-Ra also highlighting potential survival issues for smaller Indian manufacturing firms in its FY16 Credit Outlook report.</p><p>Ind-Ra noted how in 2014, import alerts against Indian firms declined to eight from 21 in 2013 due to quality measures implemented by firms. </p><p>Indian firms such as Wockhardt and Ipca, among others, have been under the lens after the US FDA issued import alerts at their facilities. Most firms have, however, emphasized a slew of efforts underway to improve compliance at their sites. </p><p>Ind-Ra's optimism is perhaps also significant in the backdrop of a recent EY (formerly Ernst & Young) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/EY-India-data-integrity-survey-flags-gaps-missing-processes-358747%5d" target="_new">survey</a> around data integrity compliance issues in the Indian pharmaceutical sector that threw up some potentially worrisome findings, including an absence of quality processes and procedures at some firms and work pressure and manpower shortages. The universe of firms covered by Ind-Ra and EY, though, may not be identical. </p><p>Ind-Ra also expects exports to grow at 10-12% in FY16, a shade lower than the 14% growth seen in FY14. Exports are expected to go up from INR910bn ($14.3bn) in FY14 to INR1.1 trillion by FYE16. </p><p>The US is likely to stay the top export market for the Indian industry. About 27% of India's pharmaceutical exports were to the US in FY14 and Ind-Ra expects this position to be maintained in FY16. </p><p>Large Indian firms, which hold maximum product registrations and approvals by regulators in the developed markets, are expected to account for bulk of the export growth in FY16. </p><p>"In 2014, the top 23 Indian pharmaceutical companies accounted for 17 of the total 22 ANDA approvals received by Indian manufacturers in the US," the report noted. Indian manufacturers accounted for 24% of the total ANDA approvals in 2014 (2013: 33%), lagging US firms which dominated with 42% (43%). </p><p>Some Indian firms have in the recent past, however, expressed concern over current stretched approval timelines in the US. In a presentation to investors on 13 May, Lupin noted that the median ANDA <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupins-CEO-on-the-specialty-asset-hunt-in-the-US-358438%5d" target="_new">approval timelines</a> had risen to 42 months in 2014, from an estimated 32 months in 2013. ANDA approvals of five frontline Indian firms declined to 76 in 2014 from more than 100 in the previous year, data presented by Lupin said, though analysts cautioned there may have been more than one reason for the apparent slowdown. </p><h2>Sell-out</h2><p>Ind-Ra also expects top Indian pharmaceutical manufacturers to return around 20% EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] margins in FY16 backed by product introductions. Smaller firms under strain, though, may look at exit options.</p><p>In the first half of FY15, the profitability of Ind-Ra's sample of 23 large companies dipped to 20.1% (1HFY14: 20.6%). </p><p>"Commercialisation of more products and forthcoming patent expiries are likely to support growth at similar profitability levels. Getting sales exclusivities can also boost profitability temporarily," the report noted. </p><p>Credit metrics of large firms will continue to strengthen in FY16 as growth prospects are on track. Free cash flow is expected to be "positive", despite capital expenditure cycle revival, due to an improvement in revenue, it said.</p><p>Smaller companies, though, may find the going tough. These firms, Ind-Ra noted, have historically struggled on both the growth and profitability fronts. </p><p>"The situation is likely to persist in FY16 with increasing incentive for them to sell out. This will drive further consolidation in the market. Smaller manufacturing outfits will continue to face profitability stress as large manufacturers push them (primarily pharmaceutical intermediates manufacturers) for cost reduction and longer credit periods." </p><p>Thirty-one of Ind-Ra's sample of 70 small companies reported EBITDA losses in FY14 (FY13: 26).</p><p>On industry consolidation, Ind-Ra believes FY16 could see foreign firms acquiring Indian companies should the government relax foreign direct investment (FDI) norms for brownfield investments. India currently mandates that all <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Mixed-reactions-to-dilution-of-Indian-brownfield-FDI-non-compete-rider-349178%5d" target="_new">brownfield investment</a> proposals be routed via the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) for approval, though it continues to permit 100% FDI via the automatic approval route for green field investments in the pharma sector. </p><p>Both Indian and foreign firms will continue to acquire manufacturing facilities carrying approvals from high-growth markets such as the US, Germany and the UK, the report added.</p>
