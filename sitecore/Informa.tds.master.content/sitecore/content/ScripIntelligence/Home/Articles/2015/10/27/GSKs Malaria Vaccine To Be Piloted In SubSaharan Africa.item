<p>GlaxoSmithKline's malaria vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S), is to be administered to young children in a limited number of African countries as part of a pilot scheme that could lead to wider deployment of the vaccine in three to five years, provided its safety and efficacy are shown to be acceptable.</p><p>The decision follows a joint recommendation by the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), which "agreed that pilot implementations should be the next step with this vaccine," said Professor Fred Blinka, acting chair of the MPAC.</p><p>The SAGE/MPAC recommendation came after the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-Mosquirix-vaccine-clears-EU-hurdle-but-is-no-complete-answer-to-malaria-359609" target="_new">positive opinion</a> on Mosquirix under Article 58, a procedure whereby a CHMP recommendation can be used by non-EU countries to inform their own approval decisions. </p><p>The WHO said that there were currently no licensed vaccines for malaria or any other human parasite, and that full licensure of Mosquirix would depend on the timing of approval submissions by GSK to individual African regulators. If approved it would become "the first-ever licensed vaccine against a parasitic disease in humans."</p><p>Mosquirix, which was developed by GKS in partnership with the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) with backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is only partly effective against the <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasite, the most prevalent cause of malaria in Africa (it offers no protection against <i>P vivax</i>, which is predominant in many non-African countries). </p><p>Moreover, vaccination requires four doses &ndash; three primary doses and a booster after 18 months &ndash; and its efficacy depends on the age at which children receive the first dose, and decreases over time. </p><p>But the vaccine is 5-10 years ahead of anything else in the field, so its use in the African pilot scheme is to be welcomed &ndash; even though it will be assessed only as a complement to the current core package of preventive, diagnostic and treatment measures.</p><h2>Need For A Pilot</h2><p>The WHO noted that while the CHMP opinion was positive on Mosquirix from a regulatory standpoint, it did not take account of contextual elements such as the feasibility of use of the vaccine in Africa, its value in relation to other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the vaccine in different settings. </p><p>"The question about how the malaria vaccine may best be delivered still need to be answered," said Professor Jon Abramson, chair of SAGE. "After detailed assessment of all the evidence we recommended that this question is best addressed by having 3-5 large pilot implementation projects." </p><p>The projects will be run in distinct settings in sub-Saharan Africa with moderate to high transmission of malaria. The committees "strongly recommended" that the WHO co-ordinate the pilots, the organization noted.</p><p>Mosquirix will be given to children aged 5-17 months before wider scale-up is considered, in order to provide information on the vaccine&rsquo;s protective effect when administered outside a clinical trial, as well as the feasibility of administering four doses of Mosquirix in routine vaccination programmes. The pilots will also seek to provide information on the impact of the vaccine on child mortality, and on its safety in view of the higher number of cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria reported in the clinical trial. </p><p>SAGE/MPAC did not recommend the use of the malaria vaccine in the 6&ndash;12 week age group in view of the limited and short-term efficacy shown in this population.</p><p>Once the pilots are complete, the WHO said it would decide whether to add Mosquirix as a complementary tool to the core package of existing malaria interventions, such as mosquito vector control using insecticidal bed-nets, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, seasonal malaria chemoprevention, intermittent preventive treatment for infants and during pregnancy, prompt diagnostic testing, and treatment of confirmed cases with effective antimalarial medication. </p><p>The committees also recommended the development of communications materials for the pilots to promote continuing use of existing malaria control tools in settings where the vaccine will be piloted. "It will be essential that existing malaria prevention measures are not adversely affected by any pilots, as the vaccine does not replace the need for bed-nets or anti-malarial medicines," the WHO said.</p><p>"Furthermore, parents and care-givers will need to understand that vaccinated children could still experience malaria and, therefore, those with malaria symptoms will still need to be tested for malaria and receive prompt treatment if tested positive for malaria."</p>
