<p>Theravance BioPharma senior vice president of development and operations Frank Pasqualone says the <i>Vibativ</i> (telavancin) relaunch "has gone just about as well as expected" and it has been helped by the company's growing collection of data for the intravenous antibiotic.</p><p>South San Francisco-based Theravance Biopharma presented data from multiple <i>in vitro</i> studies that showed Vibativ was superior to competing drugs against Gram-positive bacteria during the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) and International Congress of Chemotherapy and Infection (ICC) joint meeting co-hosted by the American Society for Microbiology and the International Society of Chemotherapy from Sept 17 to 21 in San Diego. <i>Scrip</i> interviewed Pasqualone on Sept. 17 before the first full day of the ICAAC/ICC conference.</p><p>Vibativ is approved in the US to treat hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) strains. The antibiotic is approved in the EU to treat nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by MRSA. </p><p>However, the drug's sales were put on hold for a few years due to manufacturing problems. It was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ECCMID-2014-New-data-back-Theravances-Vibativ-re-launch-351772" target="_new">relaunched in 2013</a>.</p><p><b>Slow Sales Push Gains Momentum</b></p><p>Vibativ marketer Theravance Biopharma is the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/5-questions-for-Theravance-CEO-Rick-Winningham-351822" target="_new">research-focused biotechnology spin-out from Theravance</a> (now Theravance Royalty Management). Theravance Biopharma slowly ramped up its sales team for the antibiotic in 2014 with a small number of representatives in certain US territories followed by an expansion into additional territories with a focus on the acute care market. The Vibativ sales team is expected to have 50 representatives by the end of the third quarter of 2015.</p><p>The company recognized $4.4bn in US Vibativ sales in 2014 and $3.4bn in the first half of 2015 &ndash; an 88.5% increase from the first half of last year. In the second quarter of 2015 alone, Theravance Biopharma recognized $7.1m in Vibativ-related revenue, including $5m in milestone and royalty payments from ex-US partners.</p><p>The company has Vibativ partners for Europe, Canada, the Middle East, North Africa, Israel, Russia and China. SciClone Pharmaceuticals agreed to pay $6m in upfront and regulatory milestone fees plus undisclosed commercial royalties in May for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strategic-alignment-behind-Asian-Vibativ-deal-358638" target="_new">the rights to Vibativ in China</a>. </p><p>"We wanted to start low and go slow with a very small commercial organization in 2013 and in the second quarter of 2014 we liked what we saw, so I went back to the board and got permission to expand the sales and [medical science liaison (MSL)] force; then we did the same thing in the second quarter of 2015," Pasqualone said. </p><p>Education is a big part of the Vibativ sales push, because despite the widespread concern about antibiotic resistance, it still isn't easy to get doctors and payers in the US to prescribe and approve the use of new drugs when many patients still respond to generic antibiotics. But when doctors see how Vibativ works, especially in preclinical and clinical studies against other drugs, they're more likely to begin prescribing the brand-name antibiotic.</p><p>"One of the things that we did right is that we're teaching physicians where to use this drug and where not to use the drug. In our competitive space, vancomycin is still the king," Pasqualone said. "In the spirit of antibiotic stewardship and health care cost containment, doctors should use [vancomycin] first, but we talk to doctors about the two uses in which we're approved."</p><p>Theravance Biopharma has learned from its own market research and from talking to its customers that doctors don't go a week without treating a patient who needs an antibiotic other than vancomycin. </p><p>"The drug has performed really well in tough and refractory patients. That's what's given doctors the confidence to use it," Pasqualone said. "We try to encourage people that when you have a tough case you should give it a try."</p><p><b>Overcoming Hurdles To Drive Sales</b></p><p>One of the biggest challenges for Vibativ sales representatives and MSLs is overcoming physician concerns that the drug will not be able to kill resistant bacteria, because it is a derivative of vancomycin. </p><p>That's why Theravance Biopharma continues to conduct <i>in vitro</i> studies, such as the data presented at the ICAAC/ICC meeting that show Vibativ's potency and greater efficacy against Gram-positive pathogens versus vancomycin as well as Merck & Co.'s <i>Cubicin</i> (daptomycin), Pfizer Inc.'s <i>Zyvox</i> (linezolid), Sanofi's <i>Targocid</i> (teicoplanin) and Allergan's <i>Teflaro</i> (ceftaroline).</p><p>"The drug maintains its potency even after a bug has been exposed to vancomycin," Pasqualone noted. </p><p>He said health care payers are receptive to data that demonstrates Vibativ's activity against resistant bacteria. </p><p>"When vancomycin has already been tried and the patient has really not turned the corner, payers are much less likely to put up barriers to payment around Vibativ. There have been some issues that we've had to deal with, but there have been no denials of payment, because the vast majority have [been treated with] vancomycin first," Pasqualone said.</p><p>Theravance Biopharma is working on some economic analyses to demonstrate the value of Vibativ in reducing health care costs for severely ill people. For instance, ventilator-assisted pneumonia patients may be taken off their ventilators faster and get out of the hospital sooner. </p><p>The company also is looking to expand the Vibativ label and initiated a 250-patient Phase III clinical trial earlier this year for the treatment of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> bacteremia. The 1,000-patient TOUR observational use registry study also began in February to track the antibiotic's use by doctors. The TOUR data will be used to inform physicians about Vibativ's safety and efficacy in real world settings.</p><p><p><p><p>
