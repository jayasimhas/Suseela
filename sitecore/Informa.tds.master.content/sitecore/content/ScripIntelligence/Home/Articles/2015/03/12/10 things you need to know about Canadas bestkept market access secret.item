<p> Some of you will be familiar with it, many of you may not even have heard of it, but the pharmaceutical industry needs to know about it; we're talking about Canada's pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA). Currently run with no formal office or resources, by people who have taken it on as extra work on top of their usual day job, the pCPA has still managed to become a formidable market access force in Canada since its inception in 2010. Its decisions are make or break for pharmaceutical companies targeting the market, and changes on the horizon mean its importance is set to increase. </p> <p> Canada itself is set to be an increasingly important market. It is currently comparable in size to the UK, and has consistently ranked in the top 10 global markets for pharmaceutical spending according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. By 2016, it is estimated that Canada will outrank the UK, Spain and Australia. </p> <p> So if you are not yet up to speed on what the pCPA is and what it does, now is the time to brush up. <i>Scrip </i>has answered 10 of the key questions. </p> <p> <b>1. What is the pCPA?</b> </p> <p> The pCPA is a pricing negotiation body for brand name drugs and generics comprised of all of Canada's provincial public drug plans (excluding Quebec). It sits alongside Canada's health technology appraisal bodies (the Common Drug Review (CDR) and the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR)), and negotiates a price for drugs with manufacturers based on the drug's success at HTA level. </p> <p> It was created in 2010 as a way for all of Canada's provinces to pool their negotiating power and thereby improve overall market access in the country. Previously, certain territories such as Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta outstripped smaller territories such as Prince Edward Island in terms of resources, meaning market access across Canada could be patchy. </p> <p> By 2013, the system was working so well from the point of view of the provinces that they committed to reviewing and negotiating every product which was assessed by the national HTA bodies. This includes all new products, new combinations, and new indications. </p> <p> <b>2. How does it work?</b> </p> <p> Once a drug has been through HTA assessment, it is usually reviewed by the pCPA within a month. The pCPA first decides whether or not it is going to negotiate &ndash; depending on the HTA outcome, the alliance sometimes decides it is not worth negotiating at all, and sometimes negotiations are still left to individual provinces. </p> <p> The alliance will then decide via a teleconference which province is going to lead the negotiation. The lead province gets in touch with the pharma company, and between them they try to thrash out a price. Once the price is agreed, a letter of intent is signed, and the rest of the provinces make a final decision on whether or not to fund the drug. The provinces are not bound to provide the drug following the negotiation process. </p> <p> At present, there is no timeline for the negotiations. Arvind Mani, director of market access and policy research at PDCI Market Access, a Canadian consultancy firm, told <i>Scrip </i>that it can take weeks, or it can sometimes stretch on for years. The better a pharma company performs in the HTA assessment, the more straightforward negotiations are. </p> <p> All rebates agreed via the pCPA are kept confidential. </p> <p> <b>3. Why is it important?</b> </p> <p> Incredibly for such a young and informal body, Mr Mani describes the pCPA as &quot;the most important step in obtaining public funding for branded prescription drugs&quot;. This is especially true for manufacturers who make drugs aimed at anyone over 65, those who are covered by Canada's public drugs plan. </p> <p> Bluntly, Mr Mani says: &quot;If the pCPA essentially says, 'No, we're not going to negotiate with you, and none of the provinces are going to negotiate with you,' then public coverage for that drug product is no longer possible.&quot; </p> <p> <b>4. What changes are being made?</b> </p> <p> In the spring of 2015, Canada plans to create a permanent office, or secretariat, to support and formalize the pCPA. There is not much clarity yet on what the secretariat will look like, but the aim is to provide some resources and performance monitoring to &quot;strengthen the pCPA's ability to achieve their objectives&quot;. These objectives are: </p> <ul> <li>to increase access to drug treatment options; </li> <li>to achieve lower drug costs and consistent pricing; and </li> <li>to improve consistency of coverage criteria across Canada. </li> </ul> <p> The secretariat's functions will include standardizing the templates of the pCPA process, multi-channel communications, administrative support, and tracking performance metrics. Canada is also keen that the office should provide more consistency in negotiations across jurisdictions, and more transparency about the process. </p> <p> These plans take on board suggestions from multiple stakeholders, including the pharma industry, whose views were captured in a report conducted by IBM on behalf of the pCPA. </p> <p> <b>5. What are the benefits/risks to pharma?</b> </p> <p> One benefit of the system for manufacturers is that pricing negotiations in Canada have been simplified. Whereas before, the company would have to carry out separate negotiations for each individual province, now it is all done in one go (although following the negotiation there is still some wrangling left to do over which provinces will uphold the letter of intent). </p> <p> However, industry raised several concerns in the IBM report about the process as it currently stands, which may or may not be resolved by the new changes. These include: </p> <ul> <li><u>No obligation for provinces to accept negotiated deal:</u> Manufacturers surveyed about the pCPA indicated that they feel if a province participates in negotiations, it should then list the drug in good faith. However, the provinces themselves argue that this is not possible because each province has its own financial constraints and its own set of priorities. Mr Mani said this situation is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. </li> <li><u>Lack of transparency:</u> Industry feels there is little clarity on how the process works at present &ndash; what the timelines are, what specific criteria are evaluated, how a positive or negative decision is reached. </li> <li><u>Lack of consistency:</u> Industry also worries that the process is not consistent depending on which province leads negotiations. Respondents said they were not convinced that a positive experience with one province could be replicated with another. </li> <li><u>No mechanism for pharma to challenge the system:</u> At present, pharma has little or no way of raising objections to the process, or appealing outcomes. This could be set to change as the pCPA's resources are enhanced. </li> </ul> <p> The report noted: &quot;Overall from the manufacturer's perspective, it has been a negative experience. However much of the negativity revolves around the growing pains of a new process initiated with little stakeholder input.&quot; It is hoped that the pCPA will take the secretariat's creation as an opportunity to address some of the issues and improve the relationship with pharma. </p> <p> <b>6. What can pharma do to ensure success?</b> </p> <p> The first important step for pharma is to secure a positive HTA outcome. Those who receive one of the top two recommendations from the CDR (&quot;List&quot; and &quot;List in a similar manner&quot;) have a much quicker, easier negotiating process with the pCPA than those whose clinical and cost-effectiveness is in doubt. Those who get the worst HTA outcome (&quot;Do not list&quot;) are unlikely to be allowed to negotiate at all. </p> <p> In a report produced by Mr Mani on behalf of PDCI, he noted that one of the most important things a manufacturer can do is put forward a representative who really understands the Canadian system. His advice is that, &quot;The pCPA believes that it is essential that company representation has a solid understanding of the reimbursement landscape and what it is that the pCPA is looking for. Ideally, company representatives should be open and honest in their dialogue and at the same time, be neutral, flexible, and listen to what it is that jurisdictions need in the negotiation process.&quot; </p> <p> Proposals need to be clear, concise, and straightforward to implement. The pCPA is not necessarily just looking for a straight rebate, but if more innovative pricing strategies are suggested companies need to ensure that they are practicable. </p> <p> And companies should not quibble with the pCPA about any points they were unhappy with from the HTA process. As far as the pCPA is concerned, that part of the system has been concluded, and its job is to negotiate on the terms laid out by the HTA. When companies try to revisit points of contention, Mr Mani said &quot;significant challenges&quot; occur. </p> <p> <b>7. What help is available?</b> </p> <p> Though there is currently a lack of formal guidelines, and the pCPA's website is not very informative, Mr Mani said that, &quot;The pCPA, to their credit, will meet with them [manufacturers] and walk them through the process and try to help them out as much as possible.&quot; </p> <p> Prior even to HTA assessment, the pCPA is willing to communicate with companies that have either never before negotiated with them, or who have a breakthrough or orphan drug which is set to change the treatment landscape. </p> <p> <b>8. How does it compare with other global systems?</b> </p> <p> For anyone who is more familiar with Germany's AMNOG system, this is probably one of the closest global comparisons. In the German system, IQWiG (Germany's HTA body) reviews a drug giving it a rating of additional benefit; this is then either confirmed or changed by the G-BA (which has the final say in the early benefit assessment). Once a rating is confirmed, the manufacturer then negotiates a price with the GKV-Spitzenverband, the body which represents Germany's statutory health insurers. In theory, as in Canada, the better your IQWiG/G-BA outcome, the better price you can negotiate. </p> <p> Similarly in Canada, the CDR or the pCODR assesses a drug and gives it an HTA outcome ranging from &quot;List&quot; to &quot;Do not list.&quot; The company then negotiates a price with the pCPA which will be better depending on how positive the HTA outcome was. </p> <p> However, Germany's system, though newer, has more established rules and guidelines. It also imposes a mandatory 7% rebate before negotiations have even begun, and it allows for the eventuality that an agreement may not be reached. In that case, products going through the German system end up in an arbitration process, where the company is given a price. Several companies have withdrawn products in Germany as a result of this system, but in Canada there is no such mechanism; either negotiations will continue to drag on, or the product will simply be refused market access. </p> <p> <b>9. Who's been through the pCPA process successfully?</b> </p> <p> As of January 2015, 53 negotiations had been successfully concluded. Some of the first products to go through the pCPA included: Boehringer Ingelheim's blood thinner Pradaxa (dabigatran), Bristol-Myers Squibb's melanoma drug Yervoy (ipilimumab), Alexion's orphan drug product Soliris (eculizumab), and Novartis's COPD drug Onbrez (indacaterol). </p> <p> Some of the most recent products to go through the system successfully, all reviewed this January, include: Bayer's Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension, AstraZeneca's Onglyza (saxagliptin) for diabetes, Celgene's Pomalyst (pomalidomide) for multiple myeloma, and GlaxoSmithKline's antiviral Valtrex (valacyclovir). </p> <p> <b>10. Who are the pCPA losers?</b> </p> <p> So far, there are two drugs for which negotiations have been initiated but were ultimately unsuccessful, both for type 2 diabetes: AstraZeneca's Byetta (exenatide) and Novo Nordisk's Victoza (liraglutide). All the pCPA's documents say is that the negotiations were closed because agreements could not be reached. </p> <p> Meanwhile, there have been 25 drugs so far for which no negotiation has been conducted (see image below). On these products, the pCPA says: &quot;The majority of products for which the pCPA and the provinces and territories do not pursue negotiations have received negative recommendations from [HTA assessments] due to clinical concerns, such as uncertainty regarding the clinical benefit of the drug product. If new information becomes available to address the concerns raised by pCPA and the applicable national review committee, the pCPA may reconsider their decision.&quot; </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/Drugs_with_no_negot_249263a.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/B3D12962277D463CA0462C96F3F71C30.ashx"> </a> </p> <p> <i>Source: pCPA</i> </p>
