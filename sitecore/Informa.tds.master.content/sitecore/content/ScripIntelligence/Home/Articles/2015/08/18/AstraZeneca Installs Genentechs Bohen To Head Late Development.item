<p>Immersed in a wide-ranging R&D overhaul, AstraZeneca PLC has moved quickly to fill a key gap in its senior management team by appointing Sean Bohen its new executive vice president of global medicines development and chief medical officer, replacing Briggs Morrison who vacated the post in June to join a biotech. </p><p>Currently senior vice president of early development at Roche's biotech unit Genentech Inc., Bohen will move to the British pure pharma on September 15 to steer its late stage development for both small and large molecules, as well as patient safety programmes. AstraZeneca hopes to tap Bohen's expertise and insights gleaned at Genentech where he oversaw preclinical and clinical development programmes across all therapy areas, including oncology, respiratory and autoimmune diseases.</p><p>"Sean is a tremendous scientist and an accomplished drug developer. His impressive expertise in key areas of our exciting pipeline, including oncology and immunology, will further strengthen and accelerate the delivery of new medicines for patients. His extensive diagnostics experience will also reinforce our efforts in precision medicine," AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot said in a statement.</p><p>AstraZeneca has an ambitious agenda to become a leader in oncology. Last Autumn Soriot declared oncology to be a new "growth platform" &ndash; the company's sixth in addition to the five laid out in March 2013: those being the blood thinner Brilinta (ticagrelor), diabetes, respiratory, emerging markets and Japan. That set an ambitious agenda for the UK drug maker to turn its broad cancer research into a successful commercial franchise, a task which Bohen will now have a large role in. </p><p>In March 2013 AstraZeneca unveiled a massive R&D overhaul as a cornerstone of Soriot's plan to rejuvenate the group, which has struggled to bring innovative, high-growth new drugs to market to offset lost sales of key products to generic competition. That R&D revamp followed a senior management shakeup in January 2013 when Soriot created three management roles to oversee R&D in place of the one formerly held by R&D President Martin Mackay. Bahija Jallal of biologics unit MedImmune LLC was at that time appointed to oversee discovery and early-stage development in large molecules, while Menelas Pangalos was made head of discovery research and early-stage development in small molecules, and Briggs Morrison was charged with overseeing late-stage development for both small and large molecules, a role Sean Bohen now assumes.</p><p>Soriot's strategy will see AstraZeneca raise its investment in oncology R&D and reallocate money away from other therapeutic areas to cover the increased spend. In 2015, AstraZeneca has said it expects to allocate some 45% of the R&D spend to oncology versus 30% in 2013. It aims to reduce spend in other areas. Notably, it plans to reduce spend in respiratory/inflammatory disease by 10% to 20% of R&D spend in 2015. It will only allocate 5% of spend each to neurology and infective disease, areas that are considered a lower priority.</p><p>In June Briggs Morrison, until then chief medical officer and EVP for R&D at AstraZeneca, announced he would become CEO of privately held oncology company Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc., which has one advanced anticancer drug in the pipeline. Morrison had moved to AstraZeneca in early 2012 from Pfizer Inc. where he had been SVP of clinical development.</p><p>
