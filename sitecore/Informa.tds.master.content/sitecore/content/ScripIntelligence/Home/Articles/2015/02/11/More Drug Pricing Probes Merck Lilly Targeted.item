<p>Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly and Co. are the latest drug makers to reveal their pricing practices have caught the attention of federal prosecutors &ndash; both disclosing in recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has got the companies in its sights.</p><p>Merck disclosed late on Nov. 5 it had received a civil investigative demand from federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania, who requested information about the firm's contracting and pricing of its asthma drug Dulera (mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate dihydrate) inhalation aerosol with certain pharmacy benefit managers and Medicare Part D plans. </p><p>Merck said it was cooperating with the investigation.</p><p>Tucked inside Lilly's most recent 10-Q filing with the SEC was the revelation the company had been advised by the same Justice Department office in Pennsylvania about how the firm handled certain distribution service agreements with wholesalers when calculating and reporting average manufacturer prices in connection with the Medicaid drug rebate program. </p><p>Lilly said it was voluntarily responding to prosecutors' request.</p><p>Merck's and Lilly's disclosures came in the midst of the firestorm over the pricing practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, who also are under investigation.</p><p>Valeant <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">disclosed late on Oct. 14</a> it had received subpoenas from the US attorney offices in Boston and New York seeking information about the firm's pricing decisions.</p><p>The federal investigators are examining the sharp increases in the prices of drugs like Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside), which jumped from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel (isoprenaline), which rocketed from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, after the company purshed them from Marathon Pharmaceuticals Inc. in February.</p><p>Prosecutors also are taking a look at information Valeant provided to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at the company's patient assistance programs.</p><p>Valeant said most of the materials requested by the subpoenas are related to documents with its patient assistance programs and financial support provided by the company for patients.</p><p>Turing also is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">under investigation</a> by New York's attorney general for possible antitrust violations related to the nearly 5,500% increase of the company's toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine).</p><p>Valeant and Turing have been at the heart of the criticism coming from patient advocacy groups, physicians and lawmakers over rising drug prices &ndash; especially for older medicines.</p><p>Last week, a group of Democrats formed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">new task force</a> focused on combating the "skyrocketing" costs of medicines and Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), chair of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the ranking member, opened a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">bipartisan investigation</a> into Valeant, Turing, Retrophin Inc. and Rodelis Therapeutics Inc. &ndash; who all had significantly increased the prices of certain medicines in recent months &ndash; and revealed plans for a hearing on the matter in December. </p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) have distanced themselves from Valeant and Turing and have insisted that any conversations about cost needs to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Payers-Choice-Death-Is-Cheap-Drugs-Add-Costs-361324" target="_new">focus on value</a>.</p><p>But, Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is leading the Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force, told <i>Scrip</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">last week</a> that neither PhRMA nor BIO had approached him about having discussions with lawmakers about cost versus value.</p><p>Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell is convening a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hashing-Out-Rising-Drug-Costs-An-Invitation-Only-Event-361363" target="_new">Nov. 20 invitation-only forum</a> to hash out the challenges and complexities involved in reducing the costs of medicines and ensuring access, while driving innovation, strengthening incentives and promoting competition of new drugs. </p><p>Burwell also wants to hear about innovative strategies for incorporating value- and outcomes-based models into purchasing programs in the public and private sectors.</p><p>Rising drug prices also has become a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Prices-Now-A-Bipartisan-Campaign-Prop-361127" target="_new">bipartisan prop</a> for politicians vying for the White House &ndash; with two of those candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declaring they were proud to count the biopharmaceutical industry among their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Clinton-Sanders-Proud-Pharmas-An-Enemy-361031" target="_new">greatest enemies</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
