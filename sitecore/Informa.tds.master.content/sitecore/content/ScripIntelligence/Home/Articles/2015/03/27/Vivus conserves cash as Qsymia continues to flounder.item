<p><p>Obesity drug developer Vivus irked investors with an "Operational Update" that announced the company was looking for ways to cut costs and could be a sign that the little biotech can't handle the competition from larger pharmas. </p><p>The announcement, made after the market close on 30 March, was primarily regarding Vivus' obesity drug Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate), which was the first of a new wave of weightloss drugs to hit the market a few years ago. The company had $299m in cash and equivalents on hand as of 31 December. The company burned through about $43m during the year. According to the announcement, Vivus intends to cut the sales force pushing the drug to 100 reps from 150. </p><p>"We believe that reducing the salesforce's size from the obesity-space-low number of 150 to 100 will only make things even more difficult for Qsymia. We understand, of course, that the company is attempting to preserve capital," wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis in a 01 April note to investors. </p><p>The biotech already had the smallest sales force of the bunch. Competitors Orexigen and Arena both have Japanese pharmas backing their drugs, Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion) and Belviq (lorcaserin), respectively. Arena and its partner Eisai, which is handling all commercialization, recently announced that they were pulling back to 450 reps from a previous count of 600 after sales of Belviq continued to disappoint. Meanwhile, Orexigen <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orexigen-rises-as-Contrave-launches-in-tough-obesity-market-354959" target="_new">launched Contrave</a> in the third quarter of last year with the backing of Takeda Pharmaceuticals' 900 rep-strong sales force. </p><p>"However, and despite having a positive view of the drug's clinical profile, we believe that obesity is an area where 'size matters', in terms of commercial support," added Simeonidis.</p><h2>Going digital</h2><p>Vivus is using the funds it is saving from the sales force cut to put more effort behind consumer-facing digital media, while competitors have been pouring dollars into direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns including magazines and television. </p><p>"We are currently refining our commercial footprint in order to maintain proper deployment against the most important healthcare providers and payors within the anti-obesity market," said Vivus CEO Seth Fischer in the operational update statement. "Digital media, including search engine optimization and other Web-based patient outreach, will continue to be enhanced and will remain a priority going forward. We are continuing to identify efficient ways to build awareness for Qsymia as the market develops for FDA-approved treatments for the disease of obesity."</p><p>For Vivus, the first-to-market advantage was anything but &ndash; the company has struggled to educate physicians that obesity is a disease and not a lifestyle choice and has run up against an unenthusiastic reimbursement landscape. Sales of Qsymia have been disappointing at best &ndash; the drug only reached sales of $45.3m for the full year 2014 &ndash; analysts once believed the obesity drug market could command billions. </p><h2>Post-marketing woes</h2><p>Adding to Vivus' cash problems is the post-marketing cardiovascular outcomes study that the FDA required the company to conduct to rule out any possibility of cardiovascular issues. Vivus said in its statement that it is talking to the FDA and EU regulatory authorities about any potential cost-savings measures that can be taken in regard to the planned AQCLAIM study.</p><p>"We find it unlikely that either agency would allow the company to not stick to the original plan of conducting ACQLAIM as agreed (FDA), or to apply for approval without the interim data from ACQLAIM (EMA). We believe that the company's rationale that the drug has already been on the market for 2+ years without any safety issues will have a hard time gaining significant traction," wrote Simeonidis. </p><p>The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Again-CHMP-fails-to-recognize-importance-of-obesity-drug-awaits-CV-outcomes-trial-340239" target="_new">CHMP rejected</a> Vivus' application for approval in Europe multiple times noting that long-term cardiovascular safety data would be required. </p><p><p><p>
