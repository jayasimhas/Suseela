<p>Allergan will have four migraine therapies in its portfolio after licensing two oral CGRP antagonists for treatment and prevention of the debilitating headaches from Merck & Co, joining a field crowded with injectable CGRP-targeting biologics.</p><p>The companies made sure to note in a 7 July joint announcement that MK-1602 and MK-8031 belong to a different chemical series than Merck's previous oral CGRP antagonist <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Telcagepant-failure-is-a-headache-for-Merck-and-perhaps-Pfizer-but-a-break-for-others-319266" target="_new">telcagepant</a> (MK-0974), which failed due to liver toxicities. Allergan will be solely responsible for upcoming Phase II and III studies that show that MK-1602 and MK-8031 are safer than telcagepant and reasonably effective compared with biologics that target CGRP.</p><p>Allergan will pay Merck $250m up front, but $125m is due upon the licensing deal's approval under US antitrust laws and the second half is due in April 2016. The agreement gives Merck undisclosed development and commercial milestone fees plus tiered, double-digit royalties on product sales. Development, manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities lie 100% in Allergan's hands.</p><p>Merck has not revealed Phase II results for MK-1602 in the acute treatment of migraine headaches despite completion of an 834-patient clinical trial in 2012, but end-of-Phase II discussions with the US FDA are under way and a Phase III trial is expected to begin in 2016. That timelines and Allergan's interest in MK-1602 suggests that the closely-held Phase II results were positive.</p><p>A Phase II study for MK-8031 in migraine prevention &ndash; the focus of late-stage clinical programs for CGRP-targeting biologics &ndash; also is expected to begin in 2016. </p><p><b>Allergan's outlook</b></p><p>Allergan executive vice president of global brands research and development David Nicholson said in the company's joint statement with Merck that the oral CGRP antagonist program "builds on our existing strength in neurosciences and helps position Allergan as a potential leader in the acute treatment of migraine and prevention of migraine for millions of patients."</p><p>One of the many approved therapeutic indications for Allergan's Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) is for the prevention of migraines and the company is pursuing FDA approval for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110" target="_new">Semprana</a> (dihydroergotamine; formerly Levadex) after three <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Rejection-approval-and-2-moves-to-PhIII-change-Allergan-conversation-352592" target="_new">prior rejections</a>. </p><p>If Semprana eventually wins approval, the drug will enter a market dominated by triptans that rose to prominence in the 1990s. In fact, the majority of migraine drugs in development are either CGRP antagonists or triptans reformulated with alternative means of delivery, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database.</p><p>ISI Evercore senior analyst Umer Raffat <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-Lilly-and-Amgen-join-battle-for-new-8bn-migraine-prevention-market-359088" target="_new">estimated recently</a> that the market for CGRP antagonist biologics from Amgen, Teva, Eli Lilly and Alder Pharmaceuticals is as large as 14m US patients, which could generate up to $10bn in annual sales.</p><p>MK-1602 and MK-8031 are the only oral CGRP antagonists in clinical development. Heptares, which was recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/400m-Heptares-acquisition-to-drive-Soseis-RandD-356884" target="_new">acquired by Sosei</a>, has a small molecule CGRP antagonist in preclinical development for migraine treatment and prevention, but it will be an intranasal drug.</p><p>Merck's second-generation oral CGRP antagonists could generate more than $2bn in sales if they are successful in the clinic, Mr Raffat said on 7 July following the Allergan-Merck deal announcement, but he noted that while MK-1602 and MK-8031 are different chemically from telcagepant the three drugs have similar structures. </p><p>The biopharma stock analyst questioned why Merck would give up on MK-1602 and MK-8031 if they are truly different from telcagepant and have the potential to be blockbusters. </p><p>Merck Research Laboratories senior vice president of business development and licensing Iain Dukes said in the company's statement with Allergan that "Merck will be able to continue to further focus our research and development resources on priority therapeutic areas," which are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and endocrinology, neurosciences, oncology, respiratory and immunology, and infectious diseases. Merck's neuroscience research includes Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, pain, schizophrenia and depression.</p><p>Merck gained 0.8% to close at $57.99 per share after the company revealed its agreement with Allergan, whose stock closed 0.1% higher at $307 on 7 July.</p><p>The CGRP antagonist deal was the second transaction that Allergan announced in two days. The company is buying dry eye device maker <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beyond-Restasis-Allergan-buys-Oculeve-dry-eye-device-359267" target="_new">Oculeve</a> for $125m up front. </p><p><i>[Ed: A correction was made to this story on 8 July 2015. Previously it said: "Heptares, which was recently acquired by Sosei, has a small molecule CGRP antagonist in preclinical development for migraine treatment and prevention, but it will be an inhaled drug." This has been corrected to say "intranasal."</i></p><p><p><p>
