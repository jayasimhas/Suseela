<p>The World Health Organization's "unprecedented" decision not to put Novartis's Lucentis on its Essential Medicines List (EML) for wet AMD, while retaining an unlicensed drug (Roche's Avastin) on the list, sends out a "very unfortunate signal" to industry and regulators, says Richard Bergström, director general of the European industry federation EFPIA. </p><p>The EML helps countries &ndash; especially developing ones &ndash; to decide which products they should purchase to address their priority health needs and develop their own national lists of essential drugs. </p><p>It has just been updated to include a number of new, expensive drugs &ndash; a break from standard practice, which is to list older and therefore much cheaper drugs, mostly off-patent generics.</p><p>But <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/sign-off-after-five-NICE-gives-final-nod-to-GSKs-Revolade-Otsukas-Abilify-and-Bayers-Eylea-345219" target="_new">Lucentis was not among the new additions</a>. Apparently dismissing concerns about the fact that the much cheaper Avastin is not licensed for this use, the WHO said it rejected the inclusion of Lucentis on the basis of the safety, efficacy and price difference between the two drugs, "not on the basis of approved indications within national jurisdictions or availability of licensed alternatives".</p><p>In doing so, the WHO will, albeit indirectly, be offering support to the positions taken by France and Italy, which have both passed laws allowing the off-label use of cheaper medicines where licensed alternatives are available. </p><p>Novartis said that this was "the only case where the WHO supports an unlicensed medicine appearing on the EML and rejects a licensed alternative, which sets a very concerning precedent". </p><p>Mr Bergström agreed, saying he was very concerned about the decision and the message it sent to companies and to national regulatory bodies. "Everyone turns to the WHO for leadership, and even if technically speaking they don't approve medicines, they have the pre-qualification program, they have people who work on this who often are former regulators," he told <i>Scrip</i>. "They have a tremendously important role, so that's why it is very disappointing that the WHO should take such an unprecedented step and say they are going to recommend products that have not been approved for this use."</p><p>He said that while he couldn't take an official position on what goes onto the EML, he was "disturbed because Avastin should not be on that list". It would have been different, he said, if a regulatory body somewhere in the world had approved Avastin for AMD. "I understand that the WHO doesn't have to wait for something to be approved everywhere in the world, even if that is what they have been doing". </p><p>Typically, Mr Bergström said, products on the EML have been off-patent medicines, but with the burden of diseases like cancer and diabetes in developing countries now reaching levels seen in the west, the EML is going to see more listings of newer, more expensive drugs for such conditions over the next few years. </p><p>He took issue with the apparent use by the WHO of off-label use as a cost containment tool. The organization "needs to think more strategically about how they are going to relate to pricing and affordability", he said. "Countries investing in healthcare need the right mechanism for managing drug budgets, including added value, and how they should be used, and we have a lot of experience in the EU, for example with health technology assessments. This is what countries around the world are thinking about, this is where you need to address the affordability question, not through the EML."</p><h2>Action brewing against French law</h2><p>As for national attitudes to the off-label use of cheaper medicines where more expensive therapies are available, Mr Bergström said that EFPIA, together with the national industry body Leem, was considering filing a complaint with the commission about the French off-label law that was passed last year. </p><p>As with the Italian legislation, against which EFPIA has already brought a complaint, the French legislation allows a product to be used for an unapproved indication where a licensed drug is available, in order to keep health insurance costs down. </p><p>In March this year, the French regulatory agency ANSM <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/French-revolution-committee-OKs-off-label-Avastin-for-AMD-357480" target="_new">announced</a> that its benefit-risk committee had recommended that Avastin should be used for wet AMD under a "temporary use recommendation" (RTU), on the grounds that it was non-inferior to Lucentis in terms of efficacy and showed "no significant difference" as regards systemic adverse effects.</p><p>Mr Bergström said EFPIA had attempted to submit comments on the French law before it was enacted, under the procedure whereby national governments must inform the commission of new legislation being adopted, but this had not worked. </p><p>"There is a time window when other parties can submit observations and we did this towards the end of the deadline, but the commission had already told France that it had no objections to the law, so we were not happy about that. We tried to intercept the law before adoption but that didn't work, so we will consider with our French association [Leem] whether to launch a complaint," he said.</p>
