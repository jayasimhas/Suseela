<p>Sanofi has been having a particularly good week. And on 25 February, it got even better, with the FDA approving the firm's newest diabetes drug, Toujeo (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 300U/mL), which is intended to be a much more concentrated follow-up to its once-daily long-acting basal insulin Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 100 U/mL), which is on the verge of losing patent protection. </p><p>The news was likely another punch in the gut to rival Lilly, which only two days earlier disclosed it was delaying the US and European submissions for the firm's basal insulin peglispro until after 2016 because of liver concerns &ndash; an action that had some analysts predicting the drug's demise was imminent (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Liver-concerns-hang-up-Lilly-basal-insulin-peglispro-356899" target="_new">24 February 2014</a>).</p><p>Lilly also has been trying to bring its own version of Lantus to the US market, but a patent infringement suit filed by Sanofi put a damper on the Indianapolis, Indiana firm's plans. </p><p>The success of Toujeo will be critical for Sanofi, which revealed on 19 February it had stolen away Bayer Healthcare's CEO Olivier Brandicourt to be the French company's new chief, replacing Chris Viehbacher, who was dumped by the firm's board this past October (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-reveals-Brandicourts-pay-deal-356920" target="_new">24 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-official-Bayers-Brandicourt-is-Sanofis-new-CEO-356855" target="_new">20 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Brandicourt-to-abandon-Bayer-for-Sanofi-356797" target="_new">17 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-board-ousts-Viehbacher-354729" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Toujeo, which is expected to launch in April, is labeled as a long-acting human insulin analogue to be used once daily &ndash; at the same time each day &ndash; to improve glycemic control in adults with types 1 or 2 diabetes. </p><p>Like Lantus, Toujeo is administered as a disposable prefilled pen, called SoloSTAR.</p><p>The company has not yet revealed the US price for Toujeo &ndash; something a spokeswoman said would be disclosed at the launch. </p><p>But analysts have predicted the price would be similar to what Sanofi charges for Lantus &ndash; a drug that was approved in the US in 2000 and had over $7bn in sales last year &ndash; since the company plans to get as many patients as possible to switch to Toujeo. </p><p>"Sanofi is proud of its long heritage in diabetes and insulin therapies, including Lantus, which has supported patients in the management of their diabetes for more than a decade," declared Dr Pierre Chancel, senior vice president of global diabetes at the firm.</p><p>Prior to the approval, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the chances of Toujeo gaining the FDA's nod at 92%, which 3% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Toujeo's approval was based on the results from Sanofi's EDITION clinical program, which was comprised of a series of international Phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of the drug in more than 3,500 adults "from broad and diverse diabetes populations," the company said, noting patients had type 1 and type 2 disease.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
