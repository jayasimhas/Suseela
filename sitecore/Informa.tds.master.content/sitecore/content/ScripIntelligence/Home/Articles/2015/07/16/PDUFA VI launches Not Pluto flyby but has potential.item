<p>While the launch of the sixth round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA), which officially got underway on 15 July, was far less dramatic than the Pluto flyby, the process ahead for the FDA and the biopharmaceutical industry, nonetheless, has the potential to boost scientific innovation and speed new therapies and cures to the market &ndash; helping to make life better for those down on Earth, declared Dr Stephen Ostroff, acting commissioner of the FDA.</p><p>Indeed, since its creation by Congress in 1992, PDUFA has been a "great facilitator in the ability to bring products of scientific innovation in biopharmaceuticals to market to be able to improve the health of people throughout the country and indeed, throughout the world, in a stable, predictable and increasingly efficient manner," through the same type of strategic vision, meticulous planning and great performance as the Pluto flyby, Dr Ostroff insisted.</p><p>During the 23 years PDUFA has been in existence, clinical development and approval times have dramatically decreased, "even as the complexity of the drugs and their associated data that require review have increased quite dramatically," he said.</p><p>Over that 23-year-period, more than 1,500 new therapeutic options have been brought to patients, Dr Ostroff pointed out.</p><p>PDUFA gives the FDA the authority to collect user fees from drug manufacturers over a five-year period, with the intent to provide additional revenues to the agency so it can hire more staff, improve systems and establish a better managed human drug review process, in exchange for meeting certain performance goals.</p><p>"FDA continues to meet or exceed nearly all of our review performance goals that are central to the PDUFA process and outcome deliverables," Dr Ostroff said, adding that first-cycle approval rates for new molecular entities and novel biologics "have been steadily trending upward towards historic levels."</p><p>He noted that in 2014 alone, there were 41 novel drugs approved, 17 of which were for rare diseases &ndash; "the highest annual total ever."</p><p>Dr Ostroff said that 73% of all novel products and 93% of those with priority review designations were approved in their first cycles during PDUFA V, which expires in September 2017.</p><p>The FDA now has 30 measurable reviewing procedural goals and many additional commitments to other activities, including guidance documents, public meetings and staffing enhancements, Dr Ostroff said.</p><p>"This is an example of what gets measured, gets done," he said.</p><p>Under PDUFA VI, Dr Ostroff said the FDA hopes to build on its previous success on its shared goals with industry and patient groups.</p><p>"At the same time, we should also examine whether aspects of the program can be scaled back, whether they can be modified or whether they can be discontinued to be able to better focus on those that are the most value-added," he said.</p><p>"As we start the discussions around PDUFA VI, we can achieve great things," Dr Ostroff said. "And just like the journey to Pluto, now that we've gotten to the furthest planet &ndash; and yes to me, Pluto is a planet &ndash; with PDUFA it's time to build on our success and aim for the stars."</p><p>The 15 July meeting &ndash; which the FDA was required by law to hold before it started PDUFA VI negotiations with the biopharmaceutical industry &ndash; was the "jumping off point" for that process, he said.</p><p><b>Input</b></p><p>At the nearly daylong meeting, the FDA heard the perspectives from patient and consumer advocates, healthcare professionals, scientific and academic experts and biopharmaceutical industry groups about what their assessments were of the overall performance of PDUFA V so far; what new features should regulators consider adding to the user program to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug review process; and what current features should be reduced or discontinued.</p><p>While there was broad agreement from the stakeholders that PDUFA V has been successful, they also said there was room for improvement in the next round.</p><p>Kay Holcombe, senior vice president for science policy at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said that while enhancing the FDA's expertise related to use of patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers as surrogate endpoints, innovative clinical trial designs and pharmacogenomic data would have long-term positive impacts, "the inability to achieve this enhancement is concerning."</p><p>Therefore, she said, as the PDUFA VI process moves forward, the FDA and stakeholders "need to work together to define the causes, understand them clearly and try to address them."</p><p>Dr Sascha Haverfield, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), noted that under PDUFA V, the FDA agreed to hold at least 20 so-called patient-focused drug development meetings &ndash; 14 of which have been convened.</p><p>But, Dr Haverfield said, "additional clarity is needed on how to translate patient preference information into tangible outcomes to inform clinical research and the regulatory review and decision-making processes" &ndash; something PhRMA and other stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, like the Milken Institute and its FasterCures, said they hoped will be solved in PDUFA VI.</p><p>Dr Jeff Allen, executive director of the advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research, tools for communicating with patients should be examined under PDUFA VI.</p><p>"This could include assessing how product labeling could be enhanced to improve patient use and understanding, as well as external information about drugs, such as exploring how information hubs, such as clinicaltrials.gov, could be an improved tool for patient-oriented information," Dr Allen said. </p><p>While the FDA is working with lawmakers on the legislation to reauthorize PDUFA for the sixth time, Stacie Maass, senior vice president of pharmacy practice and government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association, said her organization is hoping there will be more work done to refine the processes to prevent and manage drug shortages &ndash; noting that while the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i>, which included the PDUFA V reauthorization, included early notification requirements, expedited inspections and manufacturing site reviews, those measures didn't entirely alleviate the problem.</p><p>And while the 2012 legislation included measures to improve the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program, Ms Maass said educational resources for clinicians and patients also are needed on drugs that don't require REMS. </p><p>Dr Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts, also recommended the FDA have a specific postmarket monitoring program for targeted drugs and said Congress needs to ensure the agency has the sufficient scientific expertise and resources to conduct such reviews.</p><p>He also urged the FDA and industry under PDUFA VI to pursue new ways to speed the clinical trial process. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
