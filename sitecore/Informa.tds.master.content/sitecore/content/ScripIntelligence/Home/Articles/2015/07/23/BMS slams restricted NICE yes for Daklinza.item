<p>New draft guidance from NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England, recommends Bristol-Myers Squibb's HCV pill Daklinza (daclatasvir), but only for just over half of patients eligible for treatment. The company has slammed the institute's decision, claiming that it leaves genotype 3 patients with few treatment options.</p><p>The guidance says the drug should only be used in patients with genotypes 1 and 4 without cirrhosis. Patients must have been previously treated or be intolerant to or ineligible to receive interferon treatment. </p><p>According to BMS, 45% of HCV patients in England have genotype 3, which is linked to faster disease progression and is more difficult to treat with oral regimens than other genotypes. The company said the restrictions meant that many patients would be "denied a chance of a cure." It added that Scottish and Welsh HTA bodies, the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group, recommended the drug with fewer restrictions. In both Scotland and Wales, it is available for patients with significant fibrosis (METAVIR score ? F3) or compensated cirrhosis, including genotype 3 patients.</p><p>NICE said that BMS's estimates of sustained virological response rates used in its modelling were "highly uncertain." This was because rates were based on individual trial groups with no formal comparisons between different technologies and the uncertainty carried across into the firm's cost-effectiveness estimates. The Appraisal Committee therefore concluded that the drug would not be cost-effective for treating genotype 3 patients. </p><p>Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, said NICE's recommendations were not in the best interests of patients, particularly those with genotype 3. "This is a difficult-to-treat subtype, with little other treatment options available, especially for those who have already undergone extensive treatment previously. Those who are living with serious liver damage need rapid, tolerable and effective treatment to prevent further progression of their disease. It is imperative that NICE reviews its stance on this regimen to avoid endangering very unwell people who are in real need of support."</p><p>
