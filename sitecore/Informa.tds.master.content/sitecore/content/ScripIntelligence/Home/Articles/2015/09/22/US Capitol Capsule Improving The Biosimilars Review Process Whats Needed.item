<p>As the FDA gets ready to embark on the reauthorization process for the next round of the <i>Biosimilar User Fee Act </i>(BsUFA), which permits the agency to collect user fees from industry to aid in the reviews of biosimilars applications, known as 351(k)s, it wants to hear stakeholders' thoughts at a Dec. 18 public meeting on how well regulators are completing their program goals so far and what should be retained, changed or discontinued to improve performance.</p><p>An interim analysis of the first two-and-a-half years of the first round of BsUFA, which found the FDA spent $65.9m on biosimilars-related work during that period, may shed some light on the agency's ability to handle the workload and costs associated with the reviews of 351(k)s, although the report only examines five applications &ndash; a number that is expected to substantially increase in the next few years.</p><p>Indeed, at a Sept. 17 Senate subcommittee <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Woodcock-FDA-Focused-On-Biosimilars-Science-Before-Policy-360510" target="_new">hearing</a>, Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, pointed out that as of July 31, there were 57 "proposed" biosimilars referenced on 16 different innovator biologics enrolled in the agency's Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program, which was created as a part of BsUFA to provide a mechanism and structure for collecting the development-phase user fees.</p><p>And, Woodcock said, there were "27 other groups that have come and talked to us about developing individual products," but have not yet joined the BPD program.</p><p>Eastern Research Group, Inc. (ERG) of Lexington, Mass., which conducted the independent analysis &ndash; a requirement of the 2012 BsUFA legislation &ndash; noted it originally was contracted to estimate the volume and full cost associated with the FDA's reviews of 351(k)s through the end of fiscal year 2014. </p><p>But because the agency had received only two biosimilars applications by that date, the scope of the analysis was expanded to add the first half of FY 2015, in which three more 351(k)s were received by the FDA. </p><p>Only one of those applications &ndash;Novartis unit Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), which was referenced on Amgen's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) &ndash; has been approved so far.</p><p>So it's likely companies have been poring over the <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2015/125553Orig1s000TOC.cfm" target="_new">documents</a> posted on the FDA's website about the Zarxio review for any insights and lessons learned they may offer firms seeking their own approvals, although one application is not much to go on.</p><p>The 351(k) applications that are known to be pending at the FDA are for biosimilars of pegfilgrastim from Apotex, referenced on Amgen's Neulasta; epoetin alfa from Hospira, referenced on Amgen's Epogen; and infliximab from Celltrion, referenced on Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen's Remicade.</p><p>While the BsUFA program is similar in many ways to the one under the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, which is in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senate-chance-to-improve-Cures-but-dont-expect-soon-359643" target="_new">early stages of negotiations</a> for its sixth round, there are differences.</p><p>Specifically, because biosimilars market in the U.S. is still a budding industry, companies engaged in pursuing the FDA's approval are required to pay fees for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Are-FDA-pre-filing-user-fees-in-pharmas-future-359518" target="_new">products in the development phase</a> to generate revenue to support the agency's review work during that stage and enable firms to have meetings with regulators early on in the development process. </p><p>Among the activities on which the FDA is permitted to spend the biosimilar user fees are application and supplement reviews, action letters, facility inspections, monitoring research, postmarketing safety activities and developing and using adverse-event data-collection systems and improved analytical tools. </p><p>While the FDA did not receive any 351(k)s or supplements in FY 2013, the ERG found that the agency devoted "considerable resources" and effort in reviewing submissions for biosimilars in development, meeting with companies to discuss their development programs and developing other "non-application" review portions of the program, such as guidance documents and training staff.</p><p>In fact, ERG said, of the $65.9m the FDA spent in the first 2.5 fiscal years, $23.6m of that was used in FY 2013, with $21.4m expended in FY 2014 and $20.9m used up in the first two quarters of FY 2015.</p><p>ERG said $33.6m of the total funds was spent on labor, while $19.6m went towards operating costs, with the remainder used for "centrally managed account costs."</p><p>In breaking down the costs in hours and full-time equivalents (FTEs), ERG said the FDA's biosimilars review program required 210.8 FTEs over the first 2.5 fiscal years &ndash; 34% of which was incurred in the first two months of FY 2015 alone.</p><p>The analysis found that the largest category of work for the FDA has been in performing the investigational new drug application (IND) and pre-IND work for the biosimilars, including the BPD meetings &ndash; 55.8 FTEs and 89,276.53 hours.</p><p>The FDA reported it had 32 meeting requests in FY 2013, which grew to 54 in FY 2014 &ndash; a 69% increase.</p><p>In the first two quarters of FY 2015, there were 27 meeting requests.</p><p>The number of scheduled meetings also increased 57% during the second year of the biosimilar program, from 30 to 47. </p><p>There were 35 scheduled meetings in the first two quarters of FY 2015.</p><p>At the Sept. 17 hearing, Woodcock noted in testimony that as biosimilar development programs mature, "the type of interaction with FDA is changing" &ndash; with companies shifting now to requesting more of the BPD "Type 2" meetings, where they can discuss a specific issue, like a proposed study design or endpoints, and ask questions where regulators can provide targeted advice.</p><p>The Type 2 meetings can include substantive review of summary data, but do not include review of full study reports. </p><p>ERG reported that biosimilars policy work ranked second behind IND and pre-IND activities at the FDA, with 23.7 FTEs and 37,906.1 hours.</p><p>Science and research work was the third largest category, with 21 FTEs and 33,592.33 hours.</p><p>Because the FDA had only been performing 351(k) reviews since the middle of FY 2014, ERG noted that process only accounted for 12.8 FTEs.</p><p>The FDA is required under BsUFA to publish a final report on workload volume and costs by September of 2016, which ERG said will expand on and update the interim analysis and fill in the gaps in the initial evaluation's estimates, including data on the time spent on clinical inspections, which the company said was "lacking," and postmarketing work, which was not available, given Zarxio only entered the market on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">Sept. 3</a>.</p><p>Regulators said the Dec. 18 meeting, in which attendees are required to <a href="https://fdapublicmeeting-bsufa.eventbrite.com" target="_new">register by Nov. 18</a>, likely will include presentations by the FDA and a series of panels representing different stakeholder groups. </p><p>The agency said there also will be an opportunity at the meeting for other stakeholders to provide public comments, which the FDA said should focus on process enhancements and funding, but not on policy issues, since the latter are "beyond the scope" of the BsUFA reauthorization discussions.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's likely issues like pending guidances, such as interchangeability, will be raised at the meeting by stakeholders if the documents are not yet out by the time the meeting rolls around.</p><p>But at the Sept. 17 Senate hearing, the FDA's Woodcock made it clear the agency was more focused on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Woodcock-FDA-Focused-On-Biosimilars-Science-Before-Policy-360510" target="_new">getting the science right</a> before dealing with policy matters, such as completing guidances.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Odds-On-Favorite-Ubl-Confirmed-As-Next-PhRMA-CEO-360696" target="_new">Odds-On-Favorite Ubl Confirmed As Next PhRMA CEO</a></p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America late on Sept. 25 confirmed what had been widely speculated about in Washington and among industry insiders that AdvaMed CEO Stephen Ubl would be taking the reins as the next chief of the drug lobbying group.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">Turing's Shkreli Caves To Pressure;

vu all over again on Wall Street on Sept. 21 when biotech stocks took a beating after a powerful Washington politician vowed to take action to control prescription drug prices &ndash; a whipping reminiscent of March 2014 after three Democratic lawmakers set off a frenzy by suggesting they may pursue a similar path when they called on Gilead Sciences to explain its $1,000-per-pill price for its hepatitis C virus medicine Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Covering-Its-Bases-In-Hospira-Biosimilars-Suit-360602" target="_new">Amgen Covering Its Bases In Hospira Biosimilars Suit</a></p><p>Seeking to obtain more clarity on the interpretation of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i>, Amgen Inc. has filed another lawsuit involving a biosimilar of one of its products &ndash;
