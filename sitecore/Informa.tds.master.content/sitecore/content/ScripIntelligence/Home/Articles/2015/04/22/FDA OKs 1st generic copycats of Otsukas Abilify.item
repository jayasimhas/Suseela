<p>Otsuka was unsuccessful in preventing the FDA from approving generic versions of the company's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder drug Abilify (aripiprazole). </p><p>The agency gave the go-ahead on 28 April to Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Hetero Labs, Teva and Torrent Pharmaceuticals to market generic aripiprazole in multiple strengths and dosage forms.</p><p>Otsuka had gone to court to try to block the FDA from permitting generic firms to sell copycat versions of Abilify &ndash; filing a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Maryland.</p><p>Otsuka has been arguing Abilify is protected by the orphan drug designation it won for the Tourette's disorder indication in pediatric patients, and therefore, the FDA could not approve an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a generic version of the atypical antipsychotic until that exclusivity period had expired. </p><p>FDA, however, told the firm's lawyers in a 28 April letter the agency had rejected that argument because provisions in the law "specifically affirm that ANDA applicants may carve out from proposed labeling patent or exclusivity-protected conditions of use and obtain approval for the remaining non-protected conditions of use."</p><p>The FDA said the generic aripiprazole versions are approved to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder only and the labeling will omit all information related to treatment of Tourette's, which coincidentally, was the condition that triggered the legislative efforts in the early 1980s to pursue the <i>Orphan Drug Act</i> more than 30 years ago.</p><p>Abilify previously was marketed in the US by Otsuka&rsquo;s partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb. But in late 2012, BMS handed over the marketing responsibilities to Otsuka.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
