<p>The number of followers for pharma companies on Twitter has increased nearly 300% since 2013 &ndash; but has pharma got any better at communicating on social media?</p><p>According to a recent report published by Ogilvy Healthworld, the pharma companies with the most followers on social media aren't necessarily the ones that are getting the most out of the online channels. </p><p>The report, titled <i>Connecting the dots: Which Pharma Companies are Succeeding in the Social Media Space?</i>, found that only a small group of pharma companies are engaging with consumers, healthcare professionals and media consistently on all of their networks in a way that encourages followers to contribute to the conversation.</p><p>The data for the report were gathered by monitoring 10 of the most popular networks for 14 pharma companies across six categories: social presence, social network, community size, activity, engagement and virality.</p><p>Broken down, the study found that six of the 14 firms are using Pinterest, which is up 200% from 2013; six of the companies are on Flickr, up 100% from 2013; four are using Vine, which no company had been doing in 2013; and five companies are on Instagram, also new from 2013. Between them the 14 firms sent 473 pharma tweets a week, up 530% from 2013. </p><p>At the top of the table is Boehringer Ingelheim, which <a href="http://ogilvy.co.uk/agencies/ogilvy-healthworld" target="_new">Ogilvy</a> found to be the best at connecting all the dots on social media, with content that is "relevant and meaningful and effectively engages [the target] audience."</p><p>Second place went to Bayer Healthcare, followed by Novartis, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co, Abbott, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, Novo Nordisk and in 10th place Pfizer. </p><p>Interestingly, in 2013 GSK placed at the top of the rankings followed by Boehringer which came in second. But while Boehringer has massively increased its social media performance, according to Ogilvy's scoring, GSK has remained at the same level. </p><p>Patricia Alves, social media and community manager at Boehringer, commented in the study that social media can help change opinions. She said: "The conversation is there. People are talking about you whether you're active or not. Social media gives you the opportunity to engage in that conversation, to give your position and your statement, and maybe then hopefully change the opinion of one person or two."</p><p>The report also outlined a few simple guides for best practice on social media. It notes that to succeed in driving a two-way conversation pharma needs to be bolder. </p><p>Ogilvy says companies who want to stand out from the crowd should be "brave and prepared to have honest and meaningful conversations about their brands. This involves developing strategies and mapping out potential scenarios with internal stakeholders to respond as quickly as possible to their followers. They should aim to provide content that is relevant to their audience also have a clear set of engagement guidelines to help manage difficult questions."</p><p>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/OgilvyCommonHealth?utm_campaign=profiletracking&utm_medium=sssite&utm_source=ssslideshare" target="_new">report</a> highlighted six key takeaways from the study that pharma can implement in its social media strategy: </p><ol listformat="Numbered"><li>Be brave</li><li>Get personal and interact with followers</li><li>Move fast and make sure you can deal with issues in a timely manner</li><li>Back yourself up and get legal, medical and regulatory teams on board</li><li>Give guidance</li><li>Inform and educate with content that sets you apart</li></ol><p>
