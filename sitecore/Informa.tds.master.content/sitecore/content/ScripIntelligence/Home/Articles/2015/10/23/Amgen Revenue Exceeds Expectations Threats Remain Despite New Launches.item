<p>Amgen Inc. reported $5.7bn in third quarter revenue, exceeding analyst estimates by $400m and beating the year-ago period by 14%, but the growth was fueled by a combination of higher demand, product price increases and built-up inventories without significant contributions from new medicines.</p><p>Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen did not say on Oct. 28 how much revenue was generated by its recently approved PCSK9 inhibitor <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab), but the company indicated some positive progress for the slow launch of its cholesterol-lowering biologic. With few details about new product sales, it's difficult to assess whether novel therapies will generate enough revenue to offset the threat of biosimilars and other competitors for key Amgen products, although the company's revenue forecast doesn't suggest major sales gains in the near term.</p><p>"Although year-over-year unit growth was only 2%, total sales growth during the period was 14%, bolstered by price appreciation and a 5% positive change in inventory," William Blair analyst John Sonnier wrote in an Oct. 28 report. "We view Amgen as being in a transformative stage, as the company takes measures to maintain market share with mature products while simultaneously launching new branded products and expanding into the biosimilars market."</p><p>Amgen raised its revenue guidance for 2015 to a range of $21.4bn to $21.6bn, which represents growth of up to 7.5% compared with 2014 revenue of $20.1bn. But the company's 2016 forecast may say more about the impact of biosimilars and other competition going forward, since next year's revenue is expected to total $21.7b to $22.3bn &ndash; at most a 4.2% gain over 2015's projected sales despite regulatory approvals for six new products or new indications for approved therapies during the past year.</p><p>Indeed, the third quarter may be Amgen's highest-growth quarter of 2015, since chief financial officer David Meline said during the company's earnings conference call that, "Reported growth will moderate as we complete the year, reflecting the expected normalization of relatively high customer inventories as well as the effects of competition on our legacy products."</p><p><b>Mixed Growth Drivers For Marketed Products</b></p><p>The TNF inhibitor <i>Enbrel</i> (etanercept) for arthritis and other indications remained Amgen's top seller with $1.46bn in global sales versus $1.12bn in the third quarter of 2014 &ndash; a 30% gain due to price increases and relatively high inventory levels, which was offset competition from new drugs.</p><p>Sales for the neutropenia therapy <i>Neulasta</i> (pegfilgrastim) increased 6% year-over-year to $1.27bn in the third quarter, also due to price increases and favorable inventory levels. Neulasta Onpro Kit, an on-body injector, took a 19% share of Amgen's long-acting filgrastim sales. </p><p>Neulasta's predecessor <i>Neupogen</i> (filgrastim) experienced its first biosimilar competition toward the end of the third quarter after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">Sandoz launched Zarxio</a> in September, with worldwide sales dropping 5% to $284m in the third quarter. But Anthony Hooper, Amgen's executive vice president of global commercial operations, said during the company's earnings conference call that no other Neupogen biosimilars are expected to hit the market until the second half of 2016.</p><p>Among Amgen's anemia therapies for patients with kidney disease and people who are undergoing chemotherapy, <i>Aranesp</i> (darbepoetin alfa) had $493m in third quarter sales, representing a 4% increase from $474m during the same period in 2014. </p><p>It overtook <i>Epogen</i> (epoetin alfa), for which sales dropped from $518m to $489m, due to competition from Aranesp and Roche's <i>Mircera</i> (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) &ndash; a trend that the company noted during the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Q2-sales-rise-but-growth-depends-on-Repatha-and-beyond-359713" target="_new">second quarter</a> and which will continue as the dialysis provider Fresenius moves more patients to Mircera and as Amgen converts other Epogen customers to Aranesp.</p><p>Beyond Enbrel, the biggest sales gains in Amgen's portfolio came from smaller products, like the multiple myeloma drug <i>Kyprolis</i> (carfilzomib) from which revenue jumped 46% to $137m in the third quarter based on rising demand &ndash; a big spike, but still slightly below than the $141m sum expected by analysts. Sales should gain momentum as the company won a recommendation for EU approval in September and the US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Another-Step-Towards-Myeloma-Market-Dominance-For-Amgens-Kyprolis-360681" target="_new">granted priority review</a> for a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to expand the Kyprolis label based on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Kyprolis-ENDEAVOR-data-signal-a-changing-of-the-guard-for-multiple-myeloma-treatment-358745" target="_new">ENDEAVOR clinical trial</a>.</p><p>Other big sellers in the third quarter were the bone-building therapies <i>Xgeva</i> (denosumab) and <i>Prolia</i> (denosumab). Xgeva gained market share and benefitted from certain large customers building up inventories, increasing sales 19% to $378m, while Prolia sales rose 25% to $320m based on demand for the osteoporosis treatment, which was boosted by direct-to-consumer advertising.</p><p>Also, <i>Sensipar</i>/<i>Mimpara</i> (cinacalcet) for secondary hyperparathyroidism sales jumped 29% to $353m, boosted by a combination of higher demand, prices increases and high inventory levels compared with the prior year's third quarter.</p><p><b>New Products, Indications Make Small Contributions</b></p><p>Kyprolis is among Amgen's six approvals during the past year, since the FDA expanded the drug's label in July based on results from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amgen-wins-broader-use-of-Kyprolis-in-multiple-myeloma-359625" target="_new">ASPIRE clinical trial</a>, but the company also had five new products approved in that time frame.</p><p>Besides Neulasta Onpro and Repatha, which was approved in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">US in August</a> and in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Surprise-as-Amgen-pips-RegeneronSanofi-to-first-PCSK9-inhibitor-approval-359541" target="_new">EU in July</a>, Amgen won FDA approval for <i>Blincyto</i> (blinatumomab) in December for Philadelphia-negative, relapsed or refractory B-precursor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-early-US-win-for-BiTE-antibody-Blincyto-355400" target="_new">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (ALL); for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-1st-US-CV-drug-OK-with-Corlanor-357898" target="_new">heart failure drug</a><i>Corlanor</i> (ivabradine) in April; and the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Imlygic-1st-FDA-Approved-Oncolytic-Virus-Therapy-361265" target="_new">oncolytic virus therapy</a><i>Imlygic</i> (talimogene laherparepvec) for certain melanoma patients on Oct. 27.</p><p>Blincyto, Repatha and Corlanor were included with certain small products in Amgen's "other" category within the company's third quarter earnings. Sales in that category increased 46% to $67m compared with $46m during the same period in 2014.</p><p>Hooper said patients are utilizing the RepathaReady program through which Amgen provides the twice-monthly biologic to appropriate US patients while payers determine how they will reimburse Repatha's costs and for which patients. </p><p>"The response to our launch is extremely encouraging, as the volume of requests to date is a clear indicator of the unmet need and physician belief in the benefits of Repatha," he said.</p><p>However, Hooper also noted that "we expect payers' utilization management criteria, or UM, to remain fairly narrow pending the outcomes data" in the second half of 2016 from an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial.</p><p>Payers have balked at pricing for PCSK9 inhibitors &ndash; Repatha is priced at $14,100 per year &ndash; but Amgen CEO Bob Bradway said during the company's earnings call that, in his view, nothing has changed in terms of pricing pressures for new medicines despite recent public scrutiny of the cost of prescription medicines.</p><p>"It doesn't come as a surprise to us that there are questions about the value of the medicines and the price, and we think the more we can do to help focus on the economic burden of diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and the significant prospect or opportunity that our medicines represent against those, the more appropriate framing for the discussion," Bradway said.</p><p>Amgen and its PCSK9 competitor &ndash; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with partner Sanofi &ndash; negotiated equal status on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-Repatha-Praluent-Deals-What-It-Means-360850" target="_new">national preferred formulary</a> for Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) in the US, for Repatha and <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab). </p><p>Hooper said the company doesn't disclose details from ongoing reimbursement negotiations, but when asked whether the Express Scripts deal set a precedent for agreements with other payers regarding Repatha coverage, he said: "We were delighted that Express Scripts left the option of which drug to use to physicians and patients, and we continue to believe that that's the best place to be in the marketplace. That's our position as we go out to the markets, but we're in the middle of negotiations, so we don't know where we're going to land."</p><p><b>Products In Development Move Toward Late Stage</b></p><p>Repatha and Corlanor are the lead assets in Amgen's growing cardiovascular portfolio, which also includes the Phase II heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil in development with Cytokinetics and the Phase III-ready CETP inhibitor TA-8995 that was acquired in the company's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-acquires-cheaper-oral-alternative-to-Repatha-360484" target="_new">recent Dezima purchase</a>.</p><p>Amgen executive vice president of research and development Sean Harper said during the company's conference call that Amgen was pleased with recent Phase IIb data for omecamtiv mecarbil, despite a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Cytokinetics-heart-drug-misses-goal-in-Phase-II-study-346178" target="_new">prior Phase II flop</a>. However, the company is still reviewing the data with experts and will discuss the mid-stage results with regulators "before we can reach a formal decision about whether to proceed and in what exact format in terms of study designs and that sort of thing."</p><p>The future of TA-8995 is similarly uncertain now that Eli Lilly & Co. has reported a Phase III failure for its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Suffers-From-Lillys-Evacetrapib-Failure-361000" target="_new">CETP inhibitor evacetrapib</a>. Harper noted early in the earnings call that "we have flexibility to gate our R&D investment going forward after a careful review of Lilly's CETP outcomes data when they become available."</p><p>Other, seemingly more certain prospects in Amgen's pipeline include the secondary hyperparathyroidism candidate etelcalcetide (AMG 416). <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-21-27-August-2015-360193" target="_new">US</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-28-August--3-September-2015-360280" target="_new">EU regulatory reviews</a> are ongoing for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-nails-down-regulatory-strategy-with-AMG-416-358668" target="_new">Sensipar follow-on product</a>.</p><p>Also, Amgen expects to report results from the last two Phase III clinical trials for the osteoporosis therapy romosozumab during the first half of 2016 following top-line results for another Phase III trial prior to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Radius-Ready-To-Face-Off-With-Amgen-At-ASBMR-360882" target="_new">American Society of Bone and Mineral Research meeting</a> earlier in October.</p><p>The company also is advancing its biosimilar portfolio with plans to submit applications for marketing approval of ABP 501, a copy of AbbVie's <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) during the fourth quarter of 2015. Phase III data are expected in the second half of 2015 for ABP 215, an <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab) biosimilar, and in the second half of 2016 for ABP 780, a <i>Herceptin</i> (trastuzumab) biosimilar.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
