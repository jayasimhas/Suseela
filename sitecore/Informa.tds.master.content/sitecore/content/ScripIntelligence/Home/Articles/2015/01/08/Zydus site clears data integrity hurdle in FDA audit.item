<p>No data integrity issues appear to have emerged following a recent US FDA audit of Zydus Cadila's Moraiya site in India, though the company has yet to get an all-clear from the regulatory agency following an inspection between 28 August and 5 September last year.</p><p>The agency had issued a Form 483 &ndash; a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system &ndash; following the inspection at the firm's manufacturing facility located at Sarkhej Bavla in Moraiya. Around 13 inspectional observations are speculated to have been made.</p><p>The regulator's concerns broadly revolved around the written records of investigation of a drug complaint that did not include the findings of the investigation and the follow-up, according to some reports in the foreign media. Finer details on these concerns or whether it involved the firm's recall of atenolol &ndash; previously involved in a mix-up in bottles of allergy drug promethazine and more recently recalled following a complaint by a pharmacist who indicated that certain tablets were thicker in appearance &ndash; could not immediately be ascertained.</p><p>Sources at Zydus Cadila told <i>Scrip</i> that the FDA did a complete audit of the facility including an 'extensive data integrity audit, and "no issues were found or identified"with the integrity audit. </p><p>"However, some areas were identified for improvement and we have implemented all of the requested observations and submitted our response and a corrective action detail report. We are currently awaiting a response and acceptance on this report from the FDA," these sources said. </p><p>The US FDA could not immediately be reached for a comment.</p><p>Analysts did not seem unduly concerned, with some underscoring that not all 483s were severe and that many were procedural in nature and could be remediated easily.</p><p>A number of Indian firms including Ranbaxy, Sun Pharma, Ipca and Wockhardt have recently been pulled up by the US FDA following good manufacturing practice (GMP) deviations at their Indian sites, some of them under a cloud over data integrity issues.</p><p>In 2012, the US FDA had cleared Zydus' Moraiya facility after the company successfully resolved issues raised in a warning letter issued by the regulator more than a year before <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cadila-surges-after-US-FDA-clears-Indian-site-332894%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 July 2012)</a>. In June 2011, the FDA had issued a warning letter against Zydus for cGMP deviations at the Moraiya site. The agency had then noted significant violations of GMP regulations for finished pharmaceuticals at the plant and said that the company's response of 10 February 2011 lacked sufficient corrective actions.</p>
