<p>Later this year pharmaceutical firms should find out exact details of the safety features they will have to affix to their prescription drugs in order to comply with EU legislation aimed at preventing falsified medicines entering the legitimate supply chain. </p><p>The European Commission is finalizing a "delegated act" (implementing legislation) describing the composition, format and carrier of the "unique identifier" that will be used to check the authenticity of a pharmaceutical when it enters the supply chain and again when it is dispensed to the patient. The legislation will also describe the specifics of the verification system and a repository containing details of the unique identifiers.</p><p>The delegated act, which is required under the EU falsified medicines Directive (FMD), is based on the outcome of an impact assessment and extensive consultation with a specially constituted member state expert group. It should be adopted by the end of the second quarter of this year and published in the fourth quarter, the commission said. </p><p>The safety feature will consist of the unique identifier and an anti-tamper device as part of the outer packaging. This will have to be affixed to almost all prescription drugs, but will not generally be required for non-prescription medicines (a list of those prescription products that will not have to carry the safety feature, and those non-prescription drugs that will, is to be drawn up).</p><p>Following the impact assessment, which looked at the costs and cost effectiveness of various options, the commission has identified the following options as being the most cost effective, it revealed at last month's meeting of the Pharmaceutical Committee:</p><ul><li>The composition, format and carrier of the unique identifier should be fully harmonised across the EU. The identifier will be placed in a 2D barcode and will contain the product code, a serialization number, a national reimbursement number (where requested by the member state), the batch number and the product's expiry date.</li><li>Medicine authenticity should be guaranteed by an end-to-end verification system supplemented by risk-based verifications by wholesale distributors. Medicines should be systematically verified at pharmacy level before being dispensed to patients, while products at higher risk of falsification (such as returns or medicines not being distributed directly by manufacturers or marketing authorisation holders or wholesalers distributing on their behalf) should also be checked at the wholesaler level.</li><li>A repository containing the unique identifiers should be set up and managed by stakeholders (the "stakeholders' model"). National competent authorities should be able to access and supervise the database. </li></ul><p>The verification system will be run by the European Medicines Verification Organisation (EMVO), a not-for-profit body set up by industry, wholesaler and pharmacy bodies <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EU-stakeholders-set-up-new-body-to-oversee-product-verification-system-356869" target="_new">in February</a>. </p><p>The new system is being built up by a partnership known as the European Stakeholder Model (ESM), which was established in 2011 and comprises associations representing the R&D-based pharma industry (EFPIA), generic/biosimilar companies (EGA), parallel traders (EAEPC), wholesalers (GIRP) and pharmacists (PGEU). </p><p>Described by its stakeholders as "a key tool to combat the emergence of falsified medicines in the EU legitimate supply chain and improve patient safety" as required under the FMD, the EMVO will oversee the European Hub linking national verification systems across Europe.</p><h2>Importation of active substances</h2><p>The FMD also covers a range of other areas, including the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) imported from outside the EU. It says, for example, that compliance with EU GMP rules for active substances equivalent to those of the EU has to be certified by a "written confirmation" accompanying the active substance. Member states can waive the obligation for a written confirmation if the active substance is accompanied by an EU GMP certificate, but they must notify the commission if they plan to do so. </p><p>To date, the following member states have notified the commission of their intention to use this waiver: Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Romania, Malta, France, Latvia, Croatia, Netherlands, Cyprus, Lithuania, Greece and Denmark. </p><p>The requirement for a "written confirmation" can also be waived where the active substance originates from a third country that has been assessed by the commission as having a regulatory framework for active substances equivalent to that of the EU, and has been placed on a list of such countries. Currently, there are four equivalence assessments ongoing: </p><p><b>South Korea</b> applied for a listing in January 2015 but has not yet submitted all the necessary documents. The commission says it will start the assessment once it receives the additional documents requested.</p><p><b>Brazil</b> applied for a listing in April 2013. The commission, in collaboration with inspectors from the UK and Portugal, carried out a second on-site audit of Brazil's system for the control and enforcement of GMP relating to API production in November 2014, but "the outcome of the audit was not fully positive" and the auditors made a number of additional recommendations to the Brazilian authorities. The Commission is now waiting for Brazil's replies before taking a decision on whether to add the country to the list. </p><p><b>Israel</b> re-applied for a listing in September 2014, having initially been denied a listing because of the lack of "de jure" supervision over API sites producing for export only. The commission has carried out a preliminary assessment of the revised Israeli legislation and put several questions to the Israeli authorities, and is now awaiting their replies. </p><p><b>New Zealand</b> applied for a listing in June 2013. The commission completed the desk assessment of the country's regulatory framework for APIs in April 2014, and "the outcome of the assessment was positive". However, in order to finalise the equivalence assessment without an on-site audit, the commission still has to clarify that the existing mutual recognition agreement between New Zealand and the EU includes active substances in its scope. The commission has proposed that the New Zealand authorities proceed with a formal exchange of letters to this regard and is awaiting their feedback. </p><p>In general, the situation regarding the state of play in the top 18 countries exporting APIs to the EU is "under control", the commission says, although "more work is needed" in two countries: Russia and Thailand have informed the commission that they plan to issue written confirmations, but have provide no further information. </p><h2>Notification procedures</h2><p>Some member states have been slapped on the wrist by the commission for failing to honour their obligations under the directive. Member states should have transposed the FMD into national law by 2 January 2013, but Poland still has not done so. The commission opened an infringement procedure against Poland for failing to notify it of laws transposing the directive into national legislation &ndash; the Polish authorities supplied this information on 20 February, and the commission is now looking at whether transposition is complete. </p><p>By 22 July 2013, member states were also supposed to have provided the commission with details of their national systems for the receipt and handling of notifications of suspected falsified medicines, suspected quality defects, recalls and withdrawals from the market as a result of quality concerns. As of 17 March it had received notifications from only 17 EU member states and two EEA states. </p><p>The following countries have been asked to comply with this requirement of the directive: Bulgaria, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.</p><p>
