<p> With a California district court siding with Novartis unit Sandoz last week that it did nothing wrong by not engaging in the disclosure and dispute resolution process laid out by the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA) &ndash; the law that established the abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilars &ndash; the ruling may spur other companies to do the same. </p> <p> Judge Richard Seeborg of US District Court for the Northern District of California on 19 March denied Amgen's motion for a preliminary injunction to forestall Sandoz's market entry of Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) &ndash; the first ever biosimilar to gain approval in the US &ndash; until a disposition on the merits has issued. </p> <p> Zarxio, approved on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">6 March</a>, is referenced on Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim), a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. </p> <p> Judge Seeborg ruled that Sandoz's actions were within the firm's rights. </p> <p> Amgen argued that Sandoz acted unlawfully because it failed to comply with BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures, often called the &ldquo;patent dance,&rdquo; and because the latter firm intended to market its biosimilar immediately on receiving the FDA's approval, rather than waiting until at least 180 days thereafter. </p> <p> But Judge Seeborg said that while Amgen may have preferred that Sandoz share the information voluntarily, BPCIA left that decision up to the biosimilar maker. </p> <p> Sandoz's decision not to follow the disclosure and negotiation procedures &quot;reflects how the statute's overall scheme operates to promote expedient resolution of patent disputes,&quot; the judge declared. </p> <p> But he also pointed out that compliance with the disclosure process affords a biosimilars applicant many benefits, such as previewing which patents the reference product sponsor believes are valid and infringed, assessing related factual and legal support and exercising some control over which patents are litigated and when. </p> <p> An applicant with a high or unknown risk of liability for infringement could benefit considerably from such a process, Judge Seeborg said, noting that a biosimilar maker would be able to undergo the information exchange while protected from litigation by the statute's safe harbor, and if necessary, delay its product launch to protect the investment it made in developing it. </p> <p> But on the other hand, BPCIA lays out a process that could take up to 230 days just to commence patent litigation, he said. </p> <p> &quot;An applicant who values expedience over risk mitigation may believe that the disclosure and negotiation process would introduce needless communications and delay,&quot; Judge Seeborg said. &quot;Such an applicant may have good reason to believe that no unexpired relevant patents relate to its biosimilar, and that it is likely to prevail if challenged with an infringement suit. The applicant may, in such an instance, opt to forego its ability to bring certain types of declaratory actions and receive information about potentially relevant patents from the reference product sponsor, and instead commence litigation immediately.&quot; </p> <p> The judge said that perhaps Sandoz was &quot;confident in its limited exposure to liability and eager to resolve patent disputes,&quot; and so as not to face delays to market entry, the firm opted to invite a suit from Amgen soon after filing the biosimilar application, known as a 351(k), for Zarxio with the FDA. </p> <p> Had the two firms followed BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures, Judge Seeborg noted it would have been unlikely for the present infringement action, which was filed in October 2014, to have even commenced until this month, given the 230-day timeline set up by the law. </p> <p> Therefore, he said, Sandoz &quot;traded in the chance to narrow the scope of potential litigation with Amgen&quot; through the law's steps in exchange for the expediency of an immediate lawsuit. </p> <p> &quot;The BPCIA's plain language and overall statutory scheme support a reading that renders this decision entirely permissible,&quot; Judge Seeborg insisted. </p> <p> Amgen said it plans to take the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. </p> <p> Sandoz has not yet disclosed a date certain for Zarxio's launch. </p> <p> Earlier this month, Johnson &amp; Johnson unit Janssen <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-seeks-to-block-Celltrions-infliximab-biosimilar-357239" target="_new">filed a similar lawsuit</a> at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking to block Celltrion from bringing its infliximab biosimilar, known as CTP13, to the US market. </p> <p><p><p><p><p><p>
