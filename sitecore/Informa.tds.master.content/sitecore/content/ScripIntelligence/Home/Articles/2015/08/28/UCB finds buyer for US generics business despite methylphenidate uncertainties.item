<p>Belgian pharma company UCB S.A. has finally found a buyer for its US generics business Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc., after a deal with private equity firms Advent International and Avista Capital Partners fell through last year. Lannett Company Inc. will pay the Belgian firm $1.23bn in cash plus certain contingent payments.</p><p>The move is the latest in a series of consolidation maneuvers within the generics sector in recent months. The leadership table of generics firms has changed considerably in recent years, and big firms are continuously jockeying for position at the top. The last week of July saw <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. agree a deal to buy Allergan plc's generics business</a> &ndash; the company formerly known as Actavis &ndash; for $40.5bn, while <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hikma-sixth-largest-US-generics-firm-following-Roxane-buy-from-Boehringer-359660" target="_new">Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc agreed to buy Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH's US generics business Roxane Laboratories Inc.</a> for a rather more modest $2.65bn.</p><p>UCB has been keen to offload the generics business to enhance its focus on central nervous system and immunology drugs, and said proceeds from this divestment will be used to reduce its debts and increase strategic investments as well as to further accelerate growth and strengthen its pipeline.</p><p>Kremers sells a range of products; its top three are the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole DR, the ADHD drug methylphenidate XR and the anticholinergic for overactive bladder symptoms oxybutinin XL. It employs around 600 people and has a production site in Seymour, Indiana. </p><p>A <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/UCB-to-pocket-1.5bn-from-generics-business-sale-354935" target="_new">$1.525bn cash deal</a> was agreed with Advent and Avista last November but it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/UCBs-1.5bn-generics-unit-sale-falls-through-355706" target="_new">fell through</a> in December owing to "an unexpected conflict in the timing" and an ongoing "regulatory process." </p><p>The regulatory process in question was a bioequivalence study required by the FDA last November to confirm the therapeutic equivalence of Kremer's generic version of <i>Concerta</i> (methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release). Until the additional data is provided, the agency changed the therapeutic rating for Kremers' methylphenidate product from AB to BX, which means the product is not recommended as automatically substitutable at the pharmacy for the brand-name drug.</p><p>Under the current deal, UCB is eligible for contingent payments from Lannet in the event that Kremers' methylphenidate product has its AB-rating restored. </p><p>UCB <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/UCB-buoyed-by-strong-first-half-lupus-ambitions-undented-despite-PhIII-upset-359731" target="_new">described plans recently</a> to accelerate investment in its early stage portfolio following the continuing sales growth of its three core marketed products, <i>Cimzia</i> (certolizumab pegol), <i>Vimpat</i> (lacosamide) and <i>Neupro</i> (rotigotine). It is also advancing a second potential lupus drug, dapirolizumab pegol &ndash; a CD40L antibody partnered with Biogen, into Phase II trials following disappointing Phase III results with epratuzumab.</p><p>Its two late-stage development programs are brivaracetam for epilepsy (submitted for regulatory review in the US and Europe in January 2015) and romosozumab &ndash; in Phase III trials for the treatment of osteoporosis. On Sep. 1, UCB and partner Amgen said top-line data from the STRUCTURE trial showed that it met its primary endpoint. The 436-patient Phase III teriparatide-controlled study evaluated romosozumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p><p>Further expansion of already launched products is also expected to come from additional indications and/or label expansion.</p><p>Founded in 1942, Lannett develops, manufactures and distributes generic prescription pharmaceutical products throughout the US.</p>
