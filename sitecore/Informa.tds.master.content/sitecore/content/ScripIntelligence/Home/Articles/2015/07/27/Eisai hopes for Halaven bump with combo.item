<p><p>Jumping on the combination bandwagon, Eisai is inking an agreement with Halozyme Therapeutics to test their respective cancer drugs together in women with advanced breast cancer. </p><p>The pair announced their agreement to conduct a Phase Ib/II clinical trial on 31 July. The clinical trial will test Eisai's Halaven (eribulin mesylate) in combination with Halozyme's PEGPH20 (PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase) in patients with first-line HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. </p><p>The companies will jointly share the costs of the study and hope to show an improved overall response rate in patients. PEGPH20 targets hyaluronan, a group of natural sugars that wrap themselves around cancer cells and keep other therapies from attacking the cells, while Halaven is thought to inhibit the growth phase of microtubule and prevent cell division.</p><p>The collaboration is important for both companies. This is the first clinical collaboration agreement for Halozyme and expands the study of its compound into a wider patient population. PEGPH20 is not yet approved.</p><p>For Eisai, this opens new doors for Halaven; the drug is not approved in the first line setting and has struggled to gain acceptance from payers in Europe for its second- and third-line settings. Halaven was initially approved by the FDA in 2010, but Eisai recently submitted applications seeking a new indication of soft tissue sarcoma in the US, Japan and Europe. </p><p>Halaven has been flailing for some time due to poor reimbursement in the EU and slow uptake in the US, compounded by disappointing Phase III results in lung cancer. </p><p><p>
