<p>With the Senate garnering the 60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle on 23 June, President Barack Obama is all but certain to get the trade promotion authority (TPA) he has been seeking to help him seal the deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) &ndash; a pact the US currently is negotiating with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and New Zealand.</p><p>Those nations together make up 40% of the world's economy.</p><p>The Obama administration also is involved in ongoing negotiations for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization have been supporters of both trade pacts.</p><p>The TPA, commonly called fast-track authority, would allow the president to bring any trade deals the US negotiates with foreign nations to go before Congress for an up or down vote, with no ability for lawmakers to amend or filibuster the measure.</p><p>The Senate is now set to vote on the TPA in earnest on 24 June &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-closer-on-trade-but-will-biopharma-get-its-way-358580" target="_new">second time</a> the chamber has done so, having to take the measure through a do-over process after the trade legislative package initially got <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Caution-biopharma-wacky-Washington-wild-ride-ahead-358932" target="_new">stuck at the House</a> in what White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called a "procedural snafu."</p><p>Most Democrats and some Republicans have opposed the TPP, which is why they've been resistant to give President Obama fast track.</p><p>Indeed, 30 Democrats, five Republicans and the two Independents in the Senate logged in "nay" votes on 23 June on the measure to close off debate and advance the TPA forward. </p><p>"The vote today, pushed by multi-national corporations, pharmaceutical companies and Wall Street, will mean a continuation of disastrous trade policies which have cost our country millions of decent-paying jobs," charged Senator Bernie Sanders (Independent-Vermont), who voted against the 23 June measure.</p><p>Senator Sanders, who is running for the White House in 2016, accused the biopharmaceutical industry of supporting the trade deals so drug makers could "charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need."</p><p>"It's a great day for the big-money interests, not a great day for working families," Mr Sanders said.</p><p>But 13 Democrats, led by Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, joined 47 Republicans in backing the measure.</p><p>One of the sticklers for the Senate Democrats was the splitting up of the trade package the chamber <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-closer-on-trade-but-will-biopharma-get-its-way-358580" target="_new">initially passed</a>, particularly the carving off of the trade adjustment assistance (TAA), a provision intended to provide US workers adversely affected by trade deals with job training, career counseling, wage supplements and other support.</p><p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi led a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Caution-biopharma-wacky-Washington-wild-ride-ahead-358932" target="_new">revolt</a> against the bill &ndash; voting against the TAA, which she actually supported, in an attempt to upend the TPA.</p><p>But House Speaker John Boehner (Republican-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader (Republican-Kentucky) banded together with President Obama to finagle a way to separate the TAA from the TPA and re-vote on the measures separately.</p><p>The TPA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Re-worked-strategy-gives-fast-track-new-life-for-now-359038" target="_new">passed the House</a> in a 218-208 vote on 18 June.</p><p>Senator McConnell the Senate's 23 June vote showed the chamber's ability to rally together, although he called it a "long and twisted path" in getting to the TPA on the verge of passing.</p><p>Nonetheless, Senator John Cornyn (Republican-Texas) said the procedural vote was a demonstration the Senate was back on track and working the way it was supposed to be doing.</p><p>"This is a dramatic departure from the old Senate," the Texas Republican insisted.</p><p>But Senator Sherrod Brown (Democrat-Ohio) insisted senators were losing their leverage on the TPP, in which he asserted lawmakers were being "left in the dark," by pushing through the TPA with without a new debate on the matter. </p><p>Senator Tom Carper (Democrat-Delaware) called for assurances that the TAA would still be voted on this week.</p><p>Senator Cornyn tried to appease him by saying the Republican leadership have vowed the TPA and TAA would travel together to Mr Obama's desk for his signature &ndash; something the president has demanded.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
