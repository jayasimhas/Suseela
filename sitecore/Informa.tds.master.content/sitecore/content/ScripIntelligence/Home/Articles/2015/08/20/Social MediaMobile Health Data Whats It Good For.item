<p>Whether its tweets on Twitter, posts on Facebook or vital signs being recorded by wearable fitness trackers and cell phone apps, the data from social media and mobile health devices have been coming fast and furious in recent years &ndash; and abundantly accumulating.</p><p>But what's it good for? </p><p>The FDA and the University of Maryland (UMD) Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science Innovation (CERSI) and Center for Health Information and Decision Systems (CHIDS) are hoping to answer that question, particularly as it pertains to medical product safety.</p><p>The FDA, CERSI and CHIDS have partnered to hold a half-day discussion workshop on Sept. 11 at which they aim to bring together scientists and thought leaders from the medical product industry, academic and regulatory communities to tackle some of the deep-dive questions about how to harness the power of social media and mobile health data to improve regulatory decision-making and ultimately, the overall health of Americans, said Kenyon Crowley, CHIDS's deputy director, who was one of the meeting's planners.</p><p>FDA spokesman Jeff Ventura declined to disclose whether the agency will use the input from the meeting to improve its current <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Communicating-risk-benefit-in-140-characters-FDA-explains-352384" target="_new">draft social media guidances</a> or pending documents it has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Biosimilars-social-media-among-2015-expected-FDA-guidances-355960" target="_new">promised</a> to issue this year or what it anticipated as other deliverables from the workshop, such as whether regulators will use the feedback to set standards for how social media and mobile health data should be used in postmarketing surveillance of drug and device products or in R&D for precision medicine therapies &ndash; the latter area of which the National Institutes of Health also is delving into under President Barack Obama's $215m initiative, launched in January.</p><p>But for "anyone who needs to figure out ways to use data more effectively to facilitate innovation and product safety, this will be the place to be," declared Crowley, pointing out that social media and mobile health data "may have a profound impact on a range of health care industry activities," although it also can be "noisy information" that will take some specialized methods to determine a clear signal.</p><p>At the <a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/centers-excellence/center-health-information-decision-systems/events/m-cersi-workshop" target="_new">workshop</a>, which is taking <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/fda-and-m-cersi-workshop-it-s-big-but-is-it-useful-a-scientific-inquiry-into-how-mobile-health-and-s/event-summary-e97212822d174a7ca36c5ee8a7833ac6.aspx" target="_new">registrations</a> until Sept. 8, presenters, panelists and attendees are expected to ponder the current landscape and debate over what technologies, tools and methods may be needed to use, analyze and make sense of the data and the challenges that may hinder those processes.</p><p>They also will examine issues of trust and influence pertaining to social media data and the roles standards and interoperability should play in mobile health.</p><p>"There's some early research and expectations that these data may be useful to help answer questions about medical products and disease conditions, but we really don't have a very advanced understanding of the science behind it now," Crowley told <i>Scrip</i>. "There's a widespread acknowledgement and appreciation that this is growing and it may offer some benefit, but until the science is better well developed, regulators may have a difficult time using the data."</p><p>The conveners of the workshop want to take a closer look at how researchers may be able to get "good and valid" information out of the "explosion" of social media and mobile health data for health care purposes, he said.</p><p>"We want to talk about some of these emerging ideas in concert with some of the folks who are on the leading edge of this type of work," Crowley said, noting there are some "pockets" of research underway by academicians, entrepreneurs and some companies looking at what insights can be gleaned from the data and searching for signals that might be indicative of real-world outcomes. </p><p>"But it is an emerging field," he said.</p><p>Crowley said he and his colleagues have built in plenty of time during the panel sessions "to have lots of discussions between the audience and the experts."</p><p>"The experts will help provide the landscape, feed the conversation, help those in attendance to understand what is the latest science, latest methods and the latest analytical problems and challenges that need to be overcome in order to make the best use of these data," he explained.</p><p>The ultimate goal of the workshop, Crowley said, is to provide a platform for "interested stakeholders to have a dialogue around the science and the opportunities that are before us and ways to get there and how the content may be used by the FDA or within a broader market."</p><p>The event will be successful, he said, if there is "a robust dialogue about these opportunities and challenges."</p><p>"It will provide fodder for the FDA and the research community to think about what are the next steps that we need rigorous scientific data for if we are going to apply these methods to regulatory decision-making," Crowley said.</p><p>Part of those next steps, he said, will be figuring out how to come up with funding mechanisms to support further activities.</p><p>Crowley acknowledged it's unlikely many of the questions that are expected to be mulled over at the Sept. 11 workshop will be answered at that meeting or even any time soon.</p><p>"The grand vision will take some time, probably several years, but I think we will start to see more and more examples of findings and insight that will prove out the value of these data," he said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
