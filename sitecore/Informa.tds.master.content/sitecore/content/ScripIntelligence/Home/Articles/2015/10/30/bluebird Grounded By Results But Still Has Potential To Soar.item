<p><p>Wall Street darling bluebird bio Inc may be down today, but investors need to stop overreacting and realize that mixed data doesn't spell doom for the company or its treatment. </p><p>The stock took a 22% dive on Nov. 5, losing $19.79 to close at $70.36. This is well off the company's 52-week high of $197.35, but more than four times its IPO price of $17 per share. Like most of the sector, bluebird has been hit by the deflating biotech bubble.</p><p>Incremental releases of positive data from the company has kept the stock overinflated for the last few months, but the latest release &ndash; which had some mixed results &ndash; sent investors running. </p><p>Stop running. </p><p>The mixed results for the company's hemoglobin-making gene therapy LentiGlobin BB305 is far from a disaster &ndash; the drugs works. So far, LentiGlobin has been a functional cure for virtually every beta-thalassemia patient who has been administered the gene therapy. Yet, recent topline results show that a small subset of patients who have the trickiest form of a rare genetic disease are not responding as well to the drug. </p><p>While this may mean LentiGlobin will never be used in this patient population in the US &ndash; as the FDA has higher approvable hurdles than the EMA in this particular disease &ndash; it's not highly limiting to potential sales. </p><p>According to Maxim analysts Jason McCarthy, patients with the rare mutation, dubbed beta-zero/beta-zero, make up one third of 6,000 patients in the US. "With US regulators asking for transfusion independence, maybe LentiGlobin won't be for them. However, beta-thalassemia is a much larger opportunity in Europe where the LentiGlobin path to approval requires transfusion reduction," McCarthy wrote in a Nov. 5 note. </p><p>bluebird released the topline results from a late-stage study that showed LentiGlobin allowed seven of seven patients with the non-beta-zero/beta-zero mutation were transfusion independent after six months, as of July 31. This is a big deal for these patients, who's bodies' have a defective gene that keeps them from making enough hemoglobin to oxygenate their blood. Typically, these patients have to receive monthly blood transfusions in order to survive. So far, LentiGlobin has allowed these patients to be transfusion-free. </p><p>As for the patients who are beta-zero/beta-zero, two of them have only had one transfusion over the last six months, while the other is still dependent on regular transfusions. </p><p>Further data from this study will be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in December where the company should be able to give longer timelines for these patients and shed some clarity on exactly how much benefit there could be in the patients with the beta-zero/beta-zero mutation. </p><p>Investors should keep an ear to the ground at ASH. Not only will there be further clarity regarding the beta-thalassemia patients, but the company will have further information about the use of LentiGlobin in sickle cell disease (SCD). According to McCarthy, this is the market that really matters, as there are more than 100,000 patients with the disease in the US. </p><p><p>
