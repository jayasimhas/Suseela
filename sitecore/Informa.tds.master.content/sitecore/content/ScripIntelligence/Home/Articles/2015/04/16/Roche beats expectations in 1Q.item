<p>Roche has reported better than expected sales for the first quarter of 2015 as the world's biggest cancer drug maker saw key oncology products perform well. </p><p>The potential for negative currency impact had been of concern, as Roche reports in Swiss francs which have risen sharply against the US dollar this year. In the event, group sales grew 3% to CHF11.8bn ($12.4bn), which equated to 5% at constant exchange rates. Sales from the pharmaceutical division were CHF9.3bn, up 3% (4% CER).</p><p>Pharma growth was mainly driven by US sales, which were up 13% to CHF4.4bn (6% CER). European sales dropped by 10% to CHF2.2bn (although this equated to a 1% increase at CER). </p><p>"Despite well flagged headwinds from foreign exchange and minor patent expiries the beat was across the board," noted analysts from Credit Suisse. </p><p>In pharmaceuticals, medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer (Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla) saw strong growth of 23% as the combination of Perjeta and Herceptin in treatment saw good uptake. Avastin also continued to grow strongly (+6%), with increased use in two recently approved indications, ovarian and cervical cancer. MabThera/Rituxan (+5%), used in treatment for blood cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, also made a significant contribution.</p><p>"Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin were 2%, 4% and 7% ahead of expectations," said Credit Suisse analysts. "Importantly, new drugs Perjeta and Esbriet were also ahead by 6% and 83% respectively." </p><p>Esbriet's performance in particular is welcome as it helps Roche to justify the $8.3bn <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-to-boost-sparse-respiratory-portfolio-with-8.3bn-InterMune-buy-353527" target="_new">acquisition of InterMune</a> last year, the main driver of which was the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis drug Esbriet (pirfenidone). </p><p>Despite the strong numbers, Roche merely reiterated its 2015 guidance. It continues to expect sales to grow low- to mid-single digit (at CER). Core EPS is targeted to grow ahead of sales. Roche expects to further increase its dividend in Swiss francs.</p><p>Roche's diagnostics division also contributed to the strong quarter. Sales increased by 2% (6% CER) to $2.5bn for the first three months of 2015. </p><p>There was little to report from Roche's pipeline update.</p>
