<p>Biocon has reported a 15% increase in revenues to INR8.54bn ($134.8m) for the fourth quarter ended March 2015, backed by the strong showing of its IPO-bound research services subsidiary, Syngene, and a 12% growth in its biopharma business. </p><p>Net profits rose sharply to INR2.01bn largely on account of exceptional income accruing to Biocon following the sale of Syngene shares. Last year, the Mauritius-based investment vehicle Silver Leaf Oak picked up 10% in Syngene for INR3.8bn (then $62.4m). Syngene is eyeing a listing by July this year.</p><p>Biocon's India branded formulations business grew by 6% to INR980m during the quarter, even as the top brass reinforced its intent to develop this vertical as a specialty franchise, shedding a significant number of "generalist" brands.</p><p>"We have taken a hit on topline but this has yielded good profitability for this division in terms of contribution to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and profits. Going forward branded formulations will see strong growth with much better focus on specialty products and this will add robustly to profitability as we build the business," Biocon's chairman and managing director, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, said at a post-results press interaction.</p><p>In addition to field force rationalization, Biocon had earlier indicated that it <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biocon-firms-up-plans-to-list-Syngene-licenses-Sovaldi-356330%5d" target="_new">had rationalized</a> about 30% of its products as part of these efforts. </p><p>Biocon currently has around 1,000-plus medical representatives and "that's the number we ideally need," Biocon's top brass said at a subsequent post-results investor call.</p><p>Biocon's specialty thrust currently covers segments such as diabetes, oncology and nephrology and the company continues to evaluate entering newer specialty segments.</p><p>Biocon also expects to enter the insulin disposable device segment in 2015-16, which it said should help further grow its domestic insulin glargine business. </p><p>The Indian market for the disposable devices for insulin and insulin analogues is estimated at about INR3.30bn.</p><p>"The growth of disposable devices is ahead of the market and more and more people prefer that. But we have to take into account the economics, which is important in the Indian context," Biocon's top brass explained at the investor call.</p><p>Biocon also noted that developed markets are "more oriented" towards disposable devices and that the company expects return on investment to be "quite lucrative" when sales commence to such markets.</p><p>Separately, Biocon's Malaysia insulins plant has been commissioned and the firm has initiated steps required to qualify the plant. </p><p>"Once these activities are concluded, we will seek necessary approvals from emerging market regulators before starting commercial supplies. Plant qualification for the developed markets will happen subsequently, in line with the progress of our global clinical trials and filing of marketing authorization applications," Biocon said.</p><h2>Mylan</h2><p>Biocon also indicated that its global trastuzumab and insulin glargine phase III trials continue to "advance significantly" &ndash; both are partnered programs with Mylan.</p><p>Ms Mazumdar-Shaw referred to two additional biosimilar programs advancing in the clinic, adding that by the end of the current financial year, Biocon expects to have five programs including the Indian trial of biosimilar bevacizumab to be in phase III.</p><p>Asked about how well Biocon was buffered, should Teva go through with its acquisition of Mylan, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw told <i>Scrip</i> that she sees no risk to the joint programs.</p><p>"There is continuity for all our Mylan programs even if a deal should or not take place. Teva's own presentation in public domain has attributed huge value to Biocon's biosimilars program," Ms Mazumdar-Shaw said.</p><p>Biocon has also completed the first set of trials in the US with its oral insulin candidate IN-105 and data from the studies is being analyzed. </p><p>The US studies can be classified as P1b/2a studies conducted on about 100 subjects under a US IND. To date, total exposure to IN-105 has been about 400 subjects, the firm said.</p><p>"The data, as it stands, we have not seen something unusual in terms of any new safety signals. We continue to be very excited about the prospects of this asset," Biocon's top brass said in response to an analyst's query.</p><p>Biocon had entered into an <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/BMS-option-pact-injects-new-life-into-Biocons-oral-insulin-337330%5d" target="_new">agreement</a> with Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2012, under which the US multinational holds an exclusive option to further develop and commercialize the Indian firm's prandial oral insulin candidate, pending the outcome of certain clinical trials. </p>
