<p>Earlier this year, the Australian government announced that the prices of single-brand medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) would be cut by 5% on a rolling basis over the next five years, as part of a package of measures designed to ensure patient access to medicines and the sustainability of the PBS. </p><p>Now the government has produced a document explaining exactly how the price cuts will be implemented, including what will be done where a drug affected by a price reduction is a component of a combination therapy. </p><p>It says that the 5% statutory price reduction (SPR) will be applied to the approved ex-manufacturer price (AEMP) of products on the F1 formulary (single-brand patented drugs) after they have been listed on the PBS for at least five years. </p><p>SPRs will apply to all individual forms (items) of a single-source product. For example, where drug X has three listed brands of pharmaceutical items &ndash; powder for injection 350 mg, powder for injection 700 mg, and tablet 250 mg &ndash; each of these items will have its price cut by 5%. </p><p>The cuts will be implemented on SPR "reduction days" each April, starting next year. They will apply automatically and will require no new price agreement between the company and the government. </p><p>If a new item, such as a different strength or formulation of that product, is listed after the reduction day (for example in June 2016), it will have to have a price "consistent with the reduced prices of the existing items."</p><p>Even if any new indications or presentations of a product have been granted since it was originally listed on the PBS, the five-year period will still run from the date of that listing.</p><p>Names of all the affected F1 drugs will be published on the PBS website together with their indicative new prices by mid-December of each year in advance of the reduction day the following April. </p><p>Where a company seeks a PBS listing for a new drug, and the chosen comparator product has had a price reduction, the proposed price for the new drug will take into account the reduced price of the comparator. </p><h2>Combination Products</h2><p>If an F1 drug affected by a price reduction is part of a combination item, a 5% "flow-on" reduction will be applied &ndash; for example, where component drug Z is on the F1 and is a component of combination drug Z + A. The combination itself does not have to have been listed for five years to be affected by the flow-on reduction. </p><p>In such cases, the company will need to agree a new price for the combination that takes account of the 5% fall in the price of the F1 component product. If the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) advises that the combination offers a significant improvement in compliance or a reduction in toxicity compared with alternative products, the government may decide to apply only some or none of the F1 component price reduction. </p><p>Companies with combination products affected by such a reduction will be notified in writing by the department of health advising them of the reduction and the resulting price and asking them to form a new price agreement. </p><p>The statutory 5% price reductions are part of the PBS Access and Sustainability Package <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Australian-medicines-access-package-includes-biosimilar-substitution-price-cuts-358612" target="_new">approved earlier this year</a>, which includes other cost-saving measures such as cuts in generic drug prices, the delisting of certain non-prescription drugs, and the introduction of biosimilar substitution by pharmacists. The package is expected to produce net budget savings of some A$3.7bn ($2.7bn) over five years.</p><p>Further prices cuts are in the offing after the government launched a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australia-gearing-up-for-more-price-cuts-this-year-and-next-359547" target="_new">consultation</a> in July on changes to the price disclosure process that would remove originator brands from the calculation of the average weighted price of PBS-funded drugs that have been on the F2 (multisource) formulary for three or more years.</p><p>The prices of originator drugs on the PBS are already subject to a statutory 16% reduction whenever a bioequivalent or biosimilar version of a product is listed on the PBS. Before Feb. 1, 2011, this reduction was 12.5%.</p>
