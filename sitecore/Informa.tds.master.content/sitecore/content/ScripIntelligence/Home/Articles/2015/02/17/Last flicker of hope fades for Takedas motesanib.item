<p>Takeda's hope that its investigational multi-targeted anticancer motesanib would succeed in Asian non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients where it failed in other populations has been dashed after it missed the primary endpoint in the Phase III MONET-A trial.</p><p>The study has now been halted, Takeda said, adding that it would report the full results once available.</p><p>Motesanib is an oral small-molecule antagonist of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, platelet-driven growth factor receptors and stem cell factor receptor, and is one of a large number of targeted drugs in late-stage development for NSCLC. </p><p>The MONET-A study was the last real chance for the product in NSCLC after it failed in the MONET-1 study in 2011: top-line results showed that motesanib plus paclitaxel/carboplatin as a first-line therapy for non-squamous NSCLC gave no significant improvement in overall survival versus paclitaxel/carboplatin and placebo alone (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AmgenTakedas-0-rated-motesanib-fails-Phase-III-lung-cancer-trial-313319" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 31 March 2011</a>). </p><p>However, positive data from a subgroup of Asian patients in the 1,090-patient trial appeared sufficiently promising to justify the development of the drug this population alone. Studies with other targeted drugs for NSCLC such as AstraZeneca's EGFR inhibitor Iressa (gefitinib), have found a higher incidence of drug-sensitizing activating mutations in Asian patients.</p><p>But Takeda was on its own after its partner Amgen, motesanib's originator, decided to divest all global development, manufacturing and commercialization rights for the product following the MONET-1 failure.</p><p>The MONET-A study randomized treatment-na&iuml;ve Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC patients from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong to treatment with motesanib or placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, and was looking at progression-free survival as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate, and duration of response.</p><p>
