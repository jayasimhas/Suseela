<p>Similar fruits can grow in the most disparate soils. So it would seem when one considers the origins of Keytruda and Opdivo, the twin shining stars in the modern immuno-oncology firmament, owned by Merck and Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb, respectively. </p><p>It is interesting to recall that Merck & Co's immuno-oncology breakthrough actually came from Dutch firm Organon, reaching its current owner after Schering-Plough bought Organon before itself being bought by Merck.</p><p>Keytruda (pembrolizumab)'s chief anti-PD-1 rival Opdivo (nivolumab) wasn't cooked up in-house either: BMS gained the rights when it acquired Medarex in 2009. Opdivo came out of a partnership between Medarex and Japanese firm Ono Pharmaceutical. </p><p>Buying Medarex for $2.4bn looks in hindsight like a very good deal for BMS; the purchase also brought it ipilimumab, which went on to be launched as melanoma treatment Yervoy in 2011. Yervoy booked sales of $1.3bn in 2014. </p><p>Unlike Opdivo, though Keytruda &ndash; for which the R&D team has just won a Research & Hope Award from PhRMA &ndash; was an unexpected fruit of M&A for Merck. </p><p>Organon was a costlier buy: Schering-Plough paid $14bn for it back in 2007. That deal wasn't primarily motivated by pipeline products like Keytruda: the Dutch firm came with a portfolio and pipeline of women's health and CNS products that also ended up bringing Merck a lot of baggage &ndash; such as corifollitropin alfa, an investigational fertility treatment that received a complete response letter last year, or the schizophrenia drug Saphris (asenapine), which Merck ended up selling to Forest Laboratories in 2013. </p><p>From diverse origins, via quite different acquisitions, one of which was motivated by immuno-oncology interests, the other by an interest in the women's health market, these two products ended up racing neck and neck, being launched in close succession for melanoma, and bringing similar glory upon their manufacturers. </p><p>At a time when pharma M&A is particularly hot, and deals are rapidly assessed and critiqued, it pays to remember that Schering-Plough gave nary a mention to the pearl lying hidden in the Organon oyster at the time of the acquisition. Indeed, nor did Merck trumpet its future blockbuster asset when it acquired Schering-Plough for $41bn only six years ago. </p><p>Sometimes it might just be serendipity, sometimes it's a calculated risk that comes off successfully, but it can happen that pharma acquisitions pay off against the odds, or for reasons that weren't anticipated at the time.</p>
