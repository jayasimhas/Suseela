<p>Results of a large international study, which was stopped early because of its positive results, provided solid evidence of what the HIV research community has known for a long time: starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) early provides the best outcomes for patients.</p><p>"The sooner the better," declared Dr Anthony Fauci, director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), whose agency provided $154m of the $166m the US government spent on conducting the trial, known as Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START).</p><p>The study was undertaken to answer the question of whether HIV-infected asymptomatic patients have less risk of developing AIDS or other serious illness if they start taking ARTs sooner rather than later, based on their level of CD4+ T-cell count &ndash; a key measure of immune system health. </p><p>"Since the mid-1990s, combinations of antiretroviral drugs have dramatically improved life expectancy and the quality of life for HIV-infected individuals," Dr Fauci told reporters during a 27 May media briefing, adding that the drugs also have reduced the risk of HIV transmission to uninfected people.</p><p>But, he said, a critical question had remained without a clear answer: When should people with HIV start taking ARTs?</p><p>While evidence has suggested it is of greater benefit to start ART treatment earlier when a person's immune system is healthier, there was no definitive randomized trial data to support that theory, Dr Fauci said.</p><p>At least, not until START, which showed that starting ART early reduced the risk of developing serious illness or death by 53%, versus those whose treatment was deferred. </p><p>There were 41 instances of AIDS, serious non-AIDS events or death among study participants in the early treatment group, versus 86 events in the deferred group, Dr Fauci said, arguing the benefits of immediately starting ART in HIV-infected people as soon as they are diagnosed clearly outweighed the risks. </p><p>The results, Dr Fauci pointed out, were consistent across geographic areas and socioeconomic groups.</p><p>START, which was initiated in April 2009, but didn't get underway properly until March 2011, was conducted at 215 sites in 35 countries around the world and enrolled 4,685 HIV-infected women and men 18 years or older who had CD4+ T-cell counts above 500 cells/mm3, with no symptoms of HIV infection and had never taken ART. </p><p>About 27% of the participants were women and about half were gay men. </p><p>Study participants were randomly assigned to either begin ART immediately or delay starting treatment until either their CD4+ T-cell counts dropped to 350 cells/mm3 or they were diagnosed with an AIDS-defining illness.</p><p>Study clinicians selected the initial ART regimen for each participant from a pre-approved list of drugs based on the treatment guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services. </p><p>If the drug regimen subsequently needed to change during the course of the trial, clinicians could prescribe any licensed antiretroviral medication in accordance with their country&rsquo;s national antiretroviral treatment guidelines.</p><p>NIAID, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, noted study medications came from AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline/ViiV Healthcare, Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen and Merck.</p><p>Dr Fauci said the results of START "are certain to impact medical treatment guidelines going forward.&rdquo;</p><p>Current US guidelines recommend that all asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals take ARTs, regardless of CD4+ cell count.</p><p>"If you're infected, you get treated," Dr Fauci said.</p><p>But the guidelines from the World Health Organization recommend HIV-infected people start ART when CD4+ cell counts fall to 500 cells/mm3 or below.</p><p>"The START study now provides clinical trial data that will support the concept of starting antiretroviral treatment at any CD4 count," Dr Fauci said. "I think this will sway a considerable number of people now to start at any CD4 count."</p><p>He said he would not be surprised if guidelines committees "didn't very seriously look at this and bring it into their calculations of what their recommendations should be."</p><p>Dr Fauci acknowledged that recommending ART for all HIV-infected patients will be costly.</p><p>"If you have to go out and treat everyone who is infected, then we need to be prepared," he said.</p><p>But, Dr Fauci added, "It's another motivating force for getting the resources through various programs" and to get people identified and into treatment.</p><p>He argued, however, "there's no doubt, it's going to be less expensive to treat people early to prevent them from getting events that will cost more money," like AIDS-related cancers and other HIV-related illnesses.</p><p>The START data, Dr Fauci said, will act as a "greater motivating force in implementing programs."</p><p>He said his colleagues in the HIV research community can now "feel good" when they argue for more resources and funding because of START.</p><p>"To have a solid randomized controlled trial at the basis for their argument is going to be very helpful to them," Dr Fauci said.</p><p>While START won't "completely solve implementation gaps," he said it's nonetheless, "always good to have very solid indisputable scientific data as a basis for your policies."</p><p>Dr Fauci noted there were many who said the START trial would be impossible to run.</p><p>But he said he had "no doubt" about how it was going to turn out.</p><p>"We just needed to prove it in a well-controlled way," Dr Fauci said. </p><p>"This is another reason why we should be more aggressive in seeking out voluntary testing, linking to care and putting people on treatment," he said. "It's more scientific evidence to back what we've been saying for a long time now."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
