<p>The official launch of the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence's Office for Market Access (OMA), announced Sept. 13 at NICE's annual meeting in Liverpool, UK, offers companies the possibility of smoother interactions with the health technology assessor, but doesn't radically change the way drugs will assessed or decisions made on whether the products should be used in the National Health Service.</p><p><p>The OMA will give companies "access to a dedicated team at NICE that they can approach for enquiries related to health technology evaluation", NICE said in its announcement. The three-person OMA team will offer tailored support and will identify the "most appropriate journey for their products within NICE". Its work will include helping companies to "get the right evidence, develop a better business case and engage with the right people," the institute said. The setting up of a new OMA was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NICEs-new-Office-for-Market-Access-to-help-companies-secure-reimbursement-358620" target="_new">first outlined earlier this year</a>.</p><p><p>The OMA is expected to become a fee-for-service program, although it has seed funding from the institute to support it at the moment, and will be separate from the NICE's scientific advice program for companies that is already supported by user fees.</p><p><p>"We need to create a visible hub within NICE to ensure that companies are as geared up as possible, as quickly as possible, with what they need to be doing and what they need to be thinking about to enable them to be in the best position for drug access and adoption," said NICE's Carole Longson, in an interview at the middle of the year. Ms Longson will oversee the office.</p><p><p>The ultimate aim of the OMA is to "help improve the rates at which drugs, devices and diagnostics get picked up and adopted by the NHS", the institute said. Longson even believes the new hub could eventually lead to earlier agreements on drug pricing. It will allow companies to explore what effect patient access schemes and other approaches would have on a drug's chance of HTA approval before formal appraisals begin, she noted.</p><p><p>The UK industry was pleased with the new initiative, saying that it promises to be a step forward in getting new medicines to patients earlier. The UK Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said it looked forward to "supporting the OMA and to help shape and develop its portfolio of offerings and services which will bring real added value to stakeholders, enabling NHS patients across the country to get more timely and consistent access to clinically and cost effective innovative new medicines." </p><p><p>The OMA is one of several initiatives designed to improve UK patient access to new therapies, including the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's Early Access to Medicines Scheme, that allows <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-gets-green-light-for-UK-early-access-scheme-358724" target="_new">conditional and adaptive licensing</a> for promising new drugs, and the European Medicines Agency's Medicines Adaptive Pathways to Patients (MAPPs) pilot project.</p><p><p>And it's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Early-advice-making-the-most-of-a-mixed-offering-359204" target="_new">not only in the UK</a> that earlier advice on health technology assessment is being sought in Europe. In Germany, companies find they have to decide between several options laid out in HTA guidelines without knowing which of them are likely to be accepted by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG).</p><p>
