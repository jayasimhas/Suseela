<p>A congressional investigation into the October 2013 breach of data systems run by the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), in which a hacker gained access to 14,000 accounts held by regulated companies, found the agency's lack of security has left drug makers' and other firms' trade secrets and other product information open to theft.</p><p>The probe by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which disclosed the details on Aug. 6 in a new report, also revealed that in the past three years, at least five operating divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the FDA, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, have had their systems hacked into by intruders who used "unsophisticated" means.</p><p>E&C Committee Republican leaders said their staffers uncovered "serious structural flaws" in how the FDA and other HHS agencies handle information security &ndash; leaving them vulnerable to cyber attacks.</p><p>Among the concerns the E&C Committee investigators raised was the fact the FDA's acting chief information security officer (CISO) could not confirm whether the agency's electronic submission gateway (ESG) &ndash; the website used by industry to submit regulatory information &ndash; was encrypted. </p><p>"The protection of the ESG is essential to maintaining the confidence and trust of the regulated companies that are submitting trade secrets and commercial confidential information," the committee staffers said, declaring the system should have been considered a "top priority" by the CISO.</p><p>The E&C's investigation also turned up reports that had never been made public by the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), which said there had been "pervasive and persistent deficiencies" across the information security programs for the US health agencies.</p><p>"Malicious actors are increasingly compromising government systems, publishing sensitive data and using stolen data to commit fraud," the E&C Committee investigators said.</p><p>"What we found is alarming and unacceptable," declared Reps. Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), the committee's chairman, and Tim Murphy (Republican-Pennsylvania), the head of the E&C Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.</p><p>They said the problems at the FDA and other HHS agencies were another example of poor government control of data &ndash; pointing to the recent revelation that at least 22 million US federal workers had their personal information stolen by hackers who broke into the Office of Personnel Management databases, which led to the resignation of that agency's chief.</p><p>The E&C investigators blamed the poor information security at the FDA and the other HHS agencies on the focus on operations by the chief information officer (CIO) and the CISO, rather than on ensuring the systems and information they hold are protected.</p><p>"Too often, security is sacrificed for operations," they said. </p><p>The E&C staffers also noted there had been six CIOs at the FDA since 2008 and the agency was without a permanent IT chief from February 2013 to May 2015 &ndash; something the General Accountability Office said was unusual for a federal agency.</p><p>The <i>Federal Information Security Management Act</i> requires federal agencies to employ CIOs and CISOs.</p><p>With attacks by malicious actors on US government information systems, including the FDA's, on the rise, technologies and web services that are not properly secured are vulnerable to unauthorized manipulation that may compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information or negatively affect the operations of federal agencies, the E&C Committee staffers said.</p><p>"The FDA has the legal obligation to protect companies' trade secrets and confidential commercial information," they said, noting the vulnerability of information collected and maintained by the agency has been a concern for a number of years. </p><p><b>Hack attack</b></p><p>The cyber intruder that hacked into CBER's systems on Oct. 15, 2013 nabbed registered users' first and last names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, usernames and the encrypted "hashed" password for each account.</p><p>When the FDA discovered the breach, it deactivated nearly 9,000 accounts considered inactive and reset the passwords for the remaining 4,820 active accounts. </p><p>Three days later, the FDA contacted the active account holders by e-mail and advised them to change their account password, telling the users the agency had "experienced a technical issue," according to the E&C report.</p><p>But the agency waited 24 days before contacting the inactive account holders, at which time it told those firms, along with the companies considered active users, CBER's systems had been compromised and recommended actions for account holders to take to further protect against fraudulent use of their information.</p><p>After learning about the breach through press reports, the E&C Committee launched a probe on Dec. 9, 2013 and also called for the FDA to obtain a third-party auditor to assess the situation and ensure the adequacy of corrective actions.</p><p>The House committee's investigators discovered the FDA breach was the result of a structured query language (SQL) injection attack. </p><p>SQL is a programming language used to create and maintain databases and is one of the most popular pieces of software employed by organizations.</p><p>An SQL injection attack circumvents the SQL programming language syntax with the intent of bypassing security controls that are supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing restricted data. </p><p>The US Justice Department has linked UK hacker Lauri Love to the FDA incident, as well as hacks into the NIH's and other HHS systems.</p><p>Mr. Love was indicted by grand juries in Virginia, New Jersey and New York in 2012 and 2013, accused of multiple American government hacks, and was arrested in the UK last month. He currently is facing extradition to the US. </p><p>The indictment stated Mr. Love and his conspirators gained unauthorized access to the US government's computers by exploiting a vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion used by the agencies' websites. </p><p>But the E&C Committee investigators argued the FDA had the budget to protect against such an attack &ndash; declaring the $486m designated for information technology uses should have been enough funds to prevent the blunder. </p><p>The committee report noted that one computer security expert characterized the FDA's failure to protect against the SQL injection attack as the equivalent of "leaving the front door open."</p><p>The E&C Committee staffers also complained that the third-party audit of FDA's systems lawmakers had demanded ended up being only a limited assessment because the agency restricted access to its systems by the Department of Homeland Security's US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), which conducted the assessment.</p><p>Nonetheless, the US-CERT team identified four risk areas, two of which were considered "high risk." </p><p>The House committee staffers pointed out it wasn't the first time the FDA denied access to its systems by federal auditors.</p><p>When the OIG came calling to conduct a routine examination, the FDA denied the investigators access to seven web applications &ndash; claiming "business criticality" as the agency's excuse.</p><p>But the E&C staffers said those web applications also were later found to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.</p><p>While the committee investigators said the FDA and the other HHS agencies had each addressed the vulnerabilities that led to the cyber attacks outlined in the report, they failed to implement any major policy or structural reforms.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
