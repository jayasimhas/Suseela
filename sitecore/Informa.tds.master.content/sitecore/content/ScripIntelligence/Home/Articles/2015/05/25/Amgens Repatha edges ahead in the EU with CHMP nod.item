<p>Amgen has nosed ahead in the race to be first to market in the EU with a PCSK9 inhibitor: its offering evolocumab (Repatha) has been granted a positive opinion by the EU's CHMP at its latest meeting this week.</p><p>The committee has recommended its approval for the treatment of adult patients with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia, and adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.</p><p>This puts it ahead of Sanofi/Regeneron's rival PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab), which was filed for US approval in December 2014, and was accepted for review by the EMA in January 2015. </p><p>The two products are also neck and neck in the US, where despite being filed for approval later, Sanofi/Regeneron's product is expected to be approved first thanks to the purchase of a priority review voucher for $67.5m from Biomarin in July 2014, which has reduced its review time from 10 to six months. The FDA is expected to decide on the BLA for Praluent by 24 July, followed shortly by a decision on Amgen's Repatha BLA by 27 August.</p><p>For evolocumab, the CHMP has specifically recommended that Repatha is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia, as an adjunct to diet: </p><ul><li>in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or, </li><li>alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contra-indicated. </li></ul><p>It also recommends Repatha be indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and over with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. Repatha will be available as 140mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled syringe or in pre-filled pen.</p><p>PCSK9 inhibition is a new strategy in cholesterol management and is set to be welcomed by doctors with patients needing greater reductions in their LDL-cholesterol levels. Both monoclonal antibodies can cause steep declines in LDL cholesterol that translate to cardiovascular benefits despite slightly higher adverse event rates, and their relative side-effect profiles are expected to play a part in therapy decisions and so <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">their clinical data have been compared closely</a>. </p><p>The products are expected to gain approval without upfront data from long-term outcomes studies (expected in 2017) after the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-and-Cos-IMPROVE-IT-hits-its-target-355102" target="_new">IMPROVE-IT study of Merck & Co's Vytorin</a> (ezetimibe plus simvastatin) reaffirmed the lower-is-better LDL hypothesis. However, the question of their expected high cost is now high on the agenda. </p><p>Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein that regulates the recycling of LDL-receptors on the surface of liver cells and decreases the ability of the liver to clear LDL from the blood. By binding to PCSK9 evolocumab increases liver levels of LDL receptor thereby reducing serum LDL-cholesterol levels. </p><p>The CHMP said the benefits with Repatha are its ability to reduce the level of serum LDL-cholesterol in patients who are unable to control their cholesterol despite taking maximum tolerated dose of statins or who cannot take statins.</p><p><p>
