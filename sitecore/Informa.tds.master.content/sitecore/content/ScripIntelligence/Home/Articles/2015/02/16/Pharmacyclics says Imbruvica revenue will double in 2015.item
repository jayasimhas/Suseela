<p>Pharmacyclics reported $492m in 2014 revenue from US sales of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and the Sunnyvale, California-based company expects to double its revenue from the cancer drug to $1bn in 2015.</p><p>Pharmacyclics and its partner Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, have four US FDA-approved indications for Imbruvica (ibrutinib) under their belt along with two approved EU indications and the company expects to report data from several additional clinical trials for the drug this year that could support additional approvals. Deutsche Bank analysts forecast $3.75bn in peak Imbruvica sales by 2025 in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but the drug is approved for two other hematological malignancies and dozens of additional blood cancer studies are ongoing.</p><p>Janssen and Pharmacyclics jointly develop and commercialize Imbruvica in the US, but Janssen is solely responsible for ex-US development and marketing. The J&J subsidiary reported $56m in sales outside of the US, bringing total worldwide sales to $548m for 2014 &ndash; the first full year of Imbruvica sales. </p><p>Leerink Swan analyst Howard Liang said in a 19 February research note that the "Imbruvica launch in the US appears to be outpacing the best previous liquid tumor drug launch [Celgene's Revlimid (lenalidomide)] by approximately 40%."</p><p>Pharmacyclics closed up 0.7% on 19 February at $171.34 per share &ndash; a new one-year high &ndash; following its earnings report after the stock market closed on 18 February. The company's market cap is $12.9bn.</p><p>Imbruvica was approved in the US as a second line treatment for mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and CLL in late 2013 and early 2014, but it gained FDA approval for first-line treatment of CLL patients with a deletion in chromosome 17 (17p deletion) in mid-2014 and became the first-ever approved treatment for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) in January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PharmacyclicsJanssen-win-FDA-OK-for-Imbruvica-in-Waldenstroms-356455" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>).</p><p>EU approval of Imbruvica for MCL and CLL in October triggered an $80m milestone payment to Pharmacyclics and the company earned another $20m milestone fee from Janssen in December based on European Medicines Agency (EMA) acceptance of an application for WM (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-17-23-October-2014-354702" target="_new">28 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Pharmacyclics reported $730m in 2014 revenue versus $260m in 2013 due to Imbruvica sales gains this year and milestone payments that the company collected from Janssen throughout 2014. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.80 versus $0.01 in 2013. </p><p>To date, Pharmacyclics has earned $605m in upfront and milestone fees under the Janssen partnership and the company stands to earn another $220m based on development and approval milestones.</p><p>"With the elevation of Imbruvica to Category 1 status within [National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice] guidelines, continued growing demand within our approved indications, and market expansion in support of our new FDA label/fourth indication, we anticipate Imbruvica 2015 US net product revenue of approximately $1bn," Pharmacyclics chairman and CEO Bob Duggan said in the company's year-end earnings report. "Simultaneous with robust commercial expansion in 2015, we will continue to advance our understanding of the use of Imbruvica as a single agent and in combination with other therapies of high drug value."</p><p>The company signed multiple agreements in 2014 to test Imbruvica in combination with cancer immunotherapies and other novel oncology drugs: AstraZeneca's anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody MEDI4736 and two unnamed PI3K inhibitors; the Bristol-Myers Squibb programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab); and Roche's CD20-targeting CLL therapy Gazyva (obinutuzumab) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-strengthens-oncology-with-Definiens-buy-Pharmacyclics-deal-354846" target="_new">4 November</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BMS-Pharmacyclics-Janssen-team-for-Opdivo-Imbruvica-study-354427" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Imbruvica is under evaluation as a single agent and in combination with other cancer therapies in 58 clinical trials, including 13 Phase III trials in hematological malignancies. The company also is investigating the drug's potential use in cancer drug combinations for the treatment of solid tumors, but those studies are in preclinical development.</p><p>Upcoming clinical milestones include:</p><p>*Data during the second half of 2015 from RESONATE 2, a 273-patient Phase III clinical trial testing Imbruvica versus chlorambucil in newly diagnosed elderly patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL);</p><p>*An interim analysis during the first half of 2015 for the Phase III HELIOS trial, which is testing Imbruvica plus rituximab and bendamustine versus rituximab and bendamustine alone in 578 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL;</p><p>*Data during the second half of the year from the Phase III RAY study testing Imbruvica versus temsirolimus in 280 MCL patients who relapsed or were refractory to a rituximab-containing chemotherapy regimen; </p><p>*And results from the Phase II DAWN clinical trial testing Imbruvica in 111 relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients in the second half of 2015.</p><p><p><p><p>
