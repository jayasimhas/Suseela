<p><b>In his latest article on Europe's future Unified Patent Court and unitary patent system, Paul England explains the connections between proceedings in the UPC and the European Patent Office, and how companies can go about using the two procedures at the same time.</b></p><p>When the Unified Patent Court (UPC) comes fully into force, it will operate as part of the wider European patent system, alongside both the existing national courts and the European Patent Office (EPO). </p><p>The EPO is particularly important because it is the forum for opposition and appeal proceedings against patents that it grants. As with the UPC, one decision of the EPO can result in the revocation of patents in multiple countries - and it will affect more countries than the 25 European member states with which the UPC is concerned.</p><p>Must a party choose between these two procedures or can they use both? What effect do EPO opposition and appeal have on an infringement action in the UPC? </p><p>Opposition proceedings against a classical European patent or a unitary patent in the EPO can proceed simultaneously with an action in the UPC. A party may therefore choose whether to start revocation proceedings in one forum or the other. Alternatively, they can do both. However, in certain circumstances, UPC proceedings may be affected by concurrent EPO opposition and appeal proceedings. </p><p>If a party lodges proceedings of any kind in the UPC, it must inform the court if there is an opposition or appeal pending in the EPO concerning the same patent (and the EPO must be informed of the UPC action). It is also necessary to state whether the EPO proceedings have been accelerated. </p><p>The UPC then has discretion as to whether to stay its proceedings if a rapid decision may be expected from the EPO in its proceedings.</p><p>Regarding infringement proceedings specifically, the UPC must stay these if it is of the view that there is a high likelihood that the relevant claims of the patent in the opposition or appeal will be held to be invalid on any ground by the EPO and that this decision may be expected to be given rapidly. However, there is presently no guidance on what is a "rapid decision", the meaning of which can only be clarified by the UPC judges over time. </p><p>However, current estimates are that a first instance decision in the UPC will take about a year, with an appeal expected to take a similar period of time. This is faster than many EPO proceedings and therefore the earlier a UPC action is started, the less likely there is to be a stay as a result of a rapid decision in concurrent EPO proceedings. </p><p>Where a decision is obtained in the UPC before a decision in the EPO relating to the same patent, the possibility arises that the UPC holds the patent valid and infringed, but that it is later revoked in the EPO proceedings. </p><p>Does this leave the party held to infringe in the UPC subject to an injunction and liable to pay damages? To avoid this possibility, orders against the infringer may be made under the condition that the patent is not later held to be wholly or partially invalid by the EPO.</p><p>In summary, parties may use the EPO and the UPC concurrently, but not in isolation from each other.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at law firm Taylor Wessing</i>.</p>
