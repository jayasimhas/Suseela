<p>True to its word, the French health ministry has announced that Roche's anticancer <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab) will be reimbursed for the off-label treatment of wet AMD as of Sept. 1, 2015. In doing so, the ministry is setting a precedent by encouraging the use of a drug for an unapproved indication for purely financial reasons. </p><p>This is a battle that the government has been fighting for some years, and one that it is clearly determined to win. In a statement, it said that since 2012 health minister Marisol Touraine had wanted to tackle a "monopoly situation" that was "particularly expensive for patient and the health insurance system". </p><p>The only other drug approved for AMD at that time was Novartis's much more expensive <i>Lucentis</i> (ranibizumab), although in the meantime Bayer's <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept) has reached the market &ndash; it too with a high price tag.</p><p>Roche has consistently resisted moves to make Avastin available for AMD. A spokesperson said that while the company recognized the budgetary pressures faced by governments, "economic considerations must not undermine the EU regulatory system that protects patients' interests, particularly when several EU approved medicines are available for intravitreal use in wAMD." Such action "brings with it the potential to create multiple standards for medicines in the EU and raises serious questions regarding pharmacovigilance and product liability."</p><p>But the firm's argument has fallen on deaf ears, and it's easy to see why, at least from a health care spending point of view. In a decree published in the Journal Officiel on Aug. 27, the government says that Avastin &ndash; which must be titrated by pharmacists into smaller vials for use in AMD &ndash; will be priced at just &euro;10 ($11.30) for a 0.10 ml syringe of 25 mg/ml solution. By contrast, Lucentis costs &euro;738.69 for a 0.23ml syringe of 10 mg/ml solution, according to the Vidal drugs database. </p><p>The decree states that Roche is obliged to implement a monitoring system for patients given Avastin for AMD, as spelled out in a 40-page treatment protocol included in the "temporary use recommendation" (RTU) issued by the regulatory body, the Agence Nationale de la Sécurité du Médicament et des produits de Santé (ANSM), in June. The monitoring system would include collecting safety and efficacy data and submitting annual reports analysing these data.</p><h2>No Way, Says Roche</h2><p>But Roche is having none of it. It has lodged a complaint against the ANSM's decision to issue the three-year RTU and is now awaiting a response. </p><p>The spokesperson said the company "refuses any liability and responsibility in connection with the RTU," and that any compounding of bevacizumab for use in eye &ndash; "a use not approved in our EU label" &ndash; is not its responsibility.</p><p>While it will continue to fulfill its obligations as the owner of the Avastin marketing authorization, the company does not plan to implement the monitoring program and says that in its opinion it cannot be forced to do so. The ANSM has taken a different view, insisting the company must do so under the Code of Public Health as amended by 2014 legislation.</p><p>Roche said it would continue to make physicians aware of the known risks associated with the use of bevacizumab for ophthalmic uses. "This includes alerting them to the fact that bevacizumab has neither been developed nor manufactured according to the quality standards for drugs to be injected into the eye, and ensuring they are familiar with specific updates from EU health authorities on the use of bevacizumab in the eye." </p><p>The health ministry said that Avastin's use in wet AMD would lead to "significant savings" while ensuring patient safety, and that it would be used for this indication only within hospitals and under "strictly controlled conditions".</p><p>However, it is likely that once clinical experience has been gained in the hospital setting, the government will turn its attention to the community AMD market, where the savings could be much greater given that two thirds of patients with AMD are treated by non-hospital doctors. </p><p>Asked whether the company would now seek marketing authorization for Avastin for wet AMD, Roche's spokesperson said it would not because it strongly believed that developing Avastin for this use "would not offer added medical benefit over the products that are already approved for wet AMD." </p><p>It was "in the best interests of patients to continue to focus our efforts in ophthalmology on discovering and developing new potential medicines for other serious diseases of the eye for which safe and effective therapies are not currently available."</p><h2>Background</h2><p>The background to the stand-off between Roche and the French authorities should be familiar to keen followers of the pharmaceutical scene. Both Roche and Novartis have come under fire for allegedly taking steps to keep Avastin out of the ophthalmic market in order to shore up sales of the much more expensive Lucentis. Roche owns the rights to both products, while Novartis holds the product license for Lucentis and Roche collects royalties on that drug's sales.</p><p>Avastin is already frequently used off-label for AMD in several countries, and moves are under way to make it more widely available. Like France, Italy has passed legislation allowing off-label use of unapproved drugs in cases where authorized alternatives are available, and some AMD patients are understood to have been given Avastin under this law. </p><p>Moreover, earlier this year the World Health Organization decided to keep Avastin on its Essential Medicines List for wet AMD while rejecting an application for Lucentis, and in February some UK clinical commissioning groups called on the government and NHS England to support doctors who want to prescribe Avastin rather than Lucentis.</p><p>In 2014 the two firms were fined by the Italian competition authority for allegedly colluding to protect Lucentis' market position. </p>
