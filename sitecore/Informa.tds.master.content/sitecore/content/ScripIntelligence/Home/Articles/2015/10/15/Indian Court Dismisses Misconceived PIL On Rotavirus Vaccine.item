<p>An Indian court has dismissed a petition seeking complete trial data pertaining to an indigenous oral rotavirus vaccine (Rotavac) developed through a unique public-private partnership, noting that it is "misconceived" and "motivated with private interest". </p><p>The case follows a public interest litigation filed in the Delhi High Court by Dr Jacob Puliyel, a paediatrician with St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi. Puliyel, a member of India's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), had flagged concerns over the allegedly higher risk of intussusception that may potentially be associated with the Indian vaccine.</p><p>He had sought a court direction against further trials of the vaccine until complete data from the earlier trials are made available. Puliyel had sought <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-rotavirus-vaccine-row-show-me-the-data-359617" target="_new">disaggregated data</a> on numbers of ultrasound-diagnosed intussusception among the vaccinated and the controls in the trial site in Vellore (in southern India) so that any potential risk may be calculated meaningfully. </p><p>The Delhi High Court, however, observed that no case of violation of any statutory provision had been made out in the petition and neither had a case been made out to show that disclosure of the segregated data is essential in public interest. </p><p>"We, therefore, find substance in the submission of the learned ASG [Additional Solicitor General, Sanjay Jain] that the petition is misconceived and motivated with private interest," the court said in an order dated Oct. 14.</p><p>The Indian government had earlier strongly defended its position on not sharing the data and the court had in August <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-Court-Reserves-Order-In-Controversial-Rotavirus-Vaccine-Case-360030" target="_new">reserved its order</a> on the case. </p><p>The court order also noted that the petitioner was a member of the NTAGI, the highest technical advisory body in the country on immunization, and that it was also "not in dispute" that the NTAGI, on being satisfied about the vaccine's efficacy and safety, had recommended that it be introduced for the national immunization programme. </p><p>"The counsel appearing for the petitioner could not dispute the fact that the entire segregated data on the clinical trial conducted in all the three centres was available with NTAGI before making its recommendation. That being so, we are unable to understand the purpose for which the petitioner is insisting on public disclosure of the segregated data," the court observed.</p><p>It also noted that the prayer in the petition virtually amounted to questioning the "correctness/authenticity" of the recommendation made by NTAGI to which the Puliyel himself is a member. </p><p>Puliyel, in his the petition, had claimed that he made repeated attempts requesting the then director and the principle investigator at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, Dr Gangadeep Kang, to disclose the data for the Vellore limb of the study but that was "neither provided to him as a member of NTAGI nor was the same disclosed to the public."</p><p>Puliyel and a colleague noted, in a letter to the editor published in the peer reviewed journal <i>Vaccine</i> last year, that a surveillance study for intussusception in a Phase III efficacy trial of Rotavac suggests that there was an excess of 11 cases of intussusception per 10,000 vaccinated. This, he claimed, is nearly 70 times higher than the risk of intussusception with the current, internationally licensed vaccine, RotaTeq. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Dollar-a-dose-rotavirus-vaccine-on-Indian-horizon-343209" target="_new">Rotavac vaccine</a> originated from an attenuated strain of rotavirus that was isolated from an Indian child at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in 1985-86, and the project has involved multiple partners including India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the local firm Bharat Biotech, the US National Institutes of Health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Stanford University School of Medicine, and the non-governmental organization PATH.</p><p>Rotavac's final licensure could be potentially game changing since it is expected to be priced at a fraction of the currently available products from foreign firms. </p>
