<p><p>A $3.5bn acquisition and some near-term, but potentially risky, assets are not likely enough to fix Teva Pharmaceuticals' issues. Yet, the company is optimistic that its acquisition of Auspex Pharmaceuticals could add $2bn in revenues in the next five to seven years and promised it would be the first in a line of deals to come. </p><p>Recent history has been tricky, at best, for Teva; downright awful, at worst. The Israeli company has been fighting tooth and nail against patent infringement to its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) &ndash; <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270" target="_new">with some success</a>, and has been aggressively moving patients to other dosages in hopes of staving off generic competition. Amidst its court drama, the company had a public shake-up at the top when CEO Jeremey Levin left after only two years, causing investor uncertainty and, more recently, the Israeli pharma opted to <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Teva-realignment-sees-oncology-programs-divested-357388" target="_new">move away</a> from its positions in oncology and women's health to focus on CNS and respiratory diseases &ndash; both areas that have their own set of risks. </p><p>Teva <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-swoops-on-Auspex-with-3.2bn-acquisition-357566" target="_new">announced 30 March</a> that it will pay $101 per share for all outstanding shares of CNS-focused Auspex for an enterprise value of $3.2bn and an equity value of $3.5bn. The offer represents a 42.4% premium to Auspex's closing share price of $70.91 on 27 March &ndash; the last trading day before the deal was announced &ndash; and 37.9% to the company's average closing share price over the past 30 days. </p><p>"The acquisition checks other boxes in meeting the business development strategy we have recently outlined reinforcing our strategic direction," said new CEO Erez Vigodman during a sameday conference call. "It is fully aligned with our key priorities for 2015."</p><h2>Auspex's prospects</h2><p>Teva is relying on three indications for Auspex's lead product SD-809 to validate the acquisition and give it a leg up in the CNS space. SD-809 (deutetrabenazine) uses its proprietary chemistry platform to modify existing treatments and make them safer, more efficacious and improve dosing. The drug is a small molecule inhibitor of vesicular monoamine 2 transporter (VMAT2) meant to regulate dopamine levels and is being studied in the treatment of three CNS disease with few options currently. </p><p>Phase III trials in Huntington's chorea last year and a New Drug Application filing with the US FDA is planned by mid-2015 for SD-809. Top-line Phase III results for the drug in tardive dyskinesia are also expected in mid-2015. SD-809 is also in Phase I for Tourette syndrome.</p><p>The biotech also has a preclinical pipeline of 60 identified candidates that could be improved by its technology platform. </p><p>While SD-809 has a decent chance of approval &ndash; BioMedTracker estimates approval probability at 59%, CNS is an incredibly risky space that has troubled big pharma &ndash; beyond efficacy and safety, the pricing and reimbursement environment can be tough. </p><p>"We plan to reevaluate our assumptions for Teva, which could lead to a modest increase in our fair value estimate. Although Auspex is a nice strategic fit with Teva's research and marketing familiarity in CNS, we don't anticipate any change to our narrow moat rating at this time," wrote Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse in a 30 March note to investors. "While this helps make the pipeline slightly lower risk, in our view, we have modest concerns about the ultimate pricing power for some of these products."</p><p>Teva stayed optimistic about the prospects of pricing for the drug, but admitted it would not likely get a premium price in the Huntington's indication. "So while the pricing from a &ndash; an HDE standpoint is in that neighborhood of $80,000 to $85,000, our assumption is that, TD and TS will warrant a price premium approach in that area," said Mike Derkacz, general manager of Teva CNS on the call. </p><p>Beyond Auspex, Vigodman said on the call that Teva would be interested in other deals. He said the company has developed a list of targets that it would like to pursue that are in-line with its priorities and that the company would do what's best for shareholders. Investors seemed unenthused by the transaction or the promise for more &ndash; the company's stock barely budged after the announcement. </p><p>"We said at the end of 2014, we said that BD will play a much bigger role for us in 2015. And basically, you'll start to see us acting against it. We said during 2014, the focus is on solidify the foundation and on other very important measures that were conducted, and we delivered on that fully," said Vigodman. "2015, basically we are directing more resources and attention towards inorganic moves, and we are starting now to deliver on that. That's not the one and only deal for us."</p><p><p><p>
