<p> Latest collected data of patient access in England to recently launched drugs again shows low uptake of such therapies and underscores the need for revamping the way modern medicines are made available to patients in the UK, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. </p> <p> The trade body was responding to the Oct. 1 publication of the so-called Innovation Scorecard published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) which pulls together local data from across the publicly-funded National Health Service to show the regional provision of medicines and technologies approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE. </p> <p> The scorecard, an experimental publication, makes use of data from a range of sources, both from the NHS and the commercial sector. The first Innovation Scorecard was published in January 2013, using data from 2011. The second publication in September 2013 reported data for 2012. The Innovation Scorecard has since been published on a quarterly basis, showing data for additional quarters since October 2013. Its aim is to improve transparency within the NHS of what treatments recommended by NICE are available within the health service in England. </p> <p> The latest compilation covered 83 medicines approved by NICE since January 2011. </p> <p> While reiterating support for the scorecard's aim of increasing transparency of drug usage in England, the ABPI said its underlying message was blurred and &quot;disappointing&quot;. </p> <p> Compared with expected usage, the use of new medicines in the NHS in England is far lower than expected, the ABPI said in a statement. </p> <p> The new data also show there is still wide regional variation between the medicines that patients can access in some parts of England compared with others. For example, in some cases there is a twenty fold difference in the use of some medicines between one area team and another. </p> <p> &quot;It is disappointing that the new data shows that the use of the latest NICE-recommended medicines in the NHS continues to be unacceptably low. There is a particular issue with the use of medicines in the first five years of their launch,&quot; said Alison Clough, Acting CEO of the ABPI. &quot;NHS patients are not being allowed access to treatments which could play a significant transformative role in their care and therefore in the outcomes they achieve,&quot; she added. </p> <p> The ABPI also said the Innovation Scorecard needed to be made much easier to use and interpret if it was ever to become a useful tool. </p> <p> &quot;We're not apportioning blame to the HSCIC, but this Innovation Scorecard is just too complicated and not at all user-friendly and thus of little practical use,&quot; said David Watson, director of pricing and reimbursement at the ABPI. &quot;It's not easily searchable, and in its present form no one is going to bother looking at it because no one can afford to spend days delving down into the data. We can. But it's very complicated,&quot; Watson said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>. </p> <p> The HSCIC in an email noted that there was no central collection of data to directly support the assessment of uptake of NICE recommendations, nor were data on the number of patients treated available for use in compiling its Innovation Scorecard. </p> <p> ABPI's Clough stressed that the Scorecard was a valuable key tool in focusing debate on improving patient access to NICE-recommended medicines in England. </p> <p> &quot;We welcome its publication and industry fully supports the continued development of metrics. We have worked closely with the Department of Health, HSCIC and other stakeholders to develop the Scorecard and understand the limitations of data that currently exists in the system &#8230; We hope that the [UK] government's Accelerated Access Review will address these barriers to patient use and help improve the adoption and diffusion of the newest and most innovative medicines across England,&quot; she concluded. </p>
