<p> <b>David Meeker, CEO of </b>Sanofi <b>company</b> Genzyme<b>, recently found himself hustling back to Genzyme's Kendall Square offices from a nearby meeting to talk to Scrip's editor Eleanor Malone about the challenges and opportunities he has encountered in his varied career. In the first of a two-part series, he discusses his experiences in the company that he joined in 1994, and expounds upon issues faced by the industry as a whole.</b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/FE8B155357E046EFB5E9929474568C2D.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>David Meeker addresses employees at Genzyme's HQ following a torch relay connecting the company's sites near Boston to mark International Rare Diseases Day</i> </p> <p> <b>Eleanor Malone: <i>Genzyme went through some dark times before the Sanofi acquisition with the manufacturing issues that led to shortages of enzyme replacement therapies. What lessons did you draw from those difficulties?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>David Meeker: </b>You are absolutely correct; they were incredibly painful, dark moments. We failed to deliver on the implicit promise of ensuring that patients can access the medicines that they need. I think we learned many lessons. On a very tactical level we learned about the lead time that it takes to bring biologic manufacturing up &ndash; we realised too late that we were not going to be at an adequate capacity and by the time we started to build, even though it was several years ahead of when we ran out of medicine, we still came up short. </p> <p> <p> And there were some very important learnings about managing complexity. As you become more complex you need to evolve as an organization. Genzyme was moving from one product to multiple products and we had an increasingly complex situation within which we were manufacturing those products. </p> <p> <p> Third was the importance of not losing your focus and your values during the dark periods, and that was something I think we did do well. This organization was stressed, but there was never a moment when people weren't working as hard as they could to get it right for the patient, given the limitations we had. We were short of product so we had to focus on how to manage the distribution of that product in a way which was most equitable. Not losing your focus in terms of values, I think that was a key lesson from that period. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>Another troubled patch was more recently when Chris Viehbacher was suddenly removed as CEO of Sanofi. How did that affect you and your business?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>Chris was the driving force behind the acquisition of Genzyme, so Genzyme was obviously extremely important to him personally as well as being a critical acquisition for Sanofi as a whole. He was a true champion of Genzyme and from the beginning was sensitive to the challenges of integration. </p> <p> <p> Many acquisitions destroy value, and a lot of the destruction happens when people leave: you have the products but you lose the know-how and the critical talent that was creating that value. But Chris was highly sensitive and protective of Genzyme and as a result Genzyme flourished under his leadership. Fortunately, when he left we had reached a point where we had relative stability within Sanofi and therefore his championship was less important. </p> <p> <p> The chairman of the board, Serge Weinberg, was equally supportive and so the transition from Chris to Serge was again relatively seamless. </p> <p> <p> We're quite early with a new CEO now [Olivier Brandicourt] but I know that he's appreciative of what's been accomplished in Genzyme and while we're still working through the larger strategic questions for the future within Sanofi, some of the importance of Genzyme in the bigger picture is clear. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What are the key challenges facing you at the moment in Genzyme?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>In common with the industry as a whole we are challenged by the enormous pressure on healthcare systems and the cost of care. To innovate and bring value has always been the goal of this industry, but the emphasis on creating value is greater than it ever has been in the past. Also, new technologies call for new business models. Gene therapy, for example, an area where Genzyme has a significant focus: if you can provide the therapy in one shot without the need for repeated treatment, how do you think about a business model in that context? </p> <p> <p> Internally, it's a highly competitive environment for talent and all companies are challenged to maintain and retain and develop the talent that's required to be successful in this industry. In addition, we're five years down the line [since being acquired by Sanofi] and we're a strong example of a successful integration with a larger company, but it's an active process. You are never completely done: we continue to work to establish ourselves and find the right balance between the Genzyme presence and the larger Sanofi presence. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>Can you tell us more about that transition from an independent Genzyme to being part of a larger company?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>For me it was a new experience, although there were a number of employees who had been through M&amp;A settings before. In many ways it went about as well as it could have. There are obviously some significant changes that occur, particularly as you merge cultures, and the biggest difference was just the size difference. Genzyme at the time of the merger was 10,000 employees, but we joined a company that was 110,000 employees, and there are just things about size and scale that you need to adapt to. But all considered it's been an outstanding success. Genzyme is thriving today within Sanofi and our performance is as good as it's ever been. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What personal qualities did you bring to bear to make that transition a positive one for yourself and for your people?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> I spent the first half of my life working as a pulmonary critical care physician. That shaped my views about healthcare and what a company should do to create value. What has anchored Genzyme historically has been that we are in the business of making people better. From our early days we've never lost the focus on the patient, which is the true measure of whether you're successful in the healthcare industry: can you make an individual better in a way that the industry and the healthcare system can afford? The first thing I did was to make sure we did not lose that focus and I have championed that from day one. </p> <p> <p> Secondly, I believe in listening and working to find a path forward. This is not about having to do it &quot;my way&quot; or Genzyme's way historically, but recognizing the need to think about Genzyme in a new context. What does Genzyme look like within a Sanofi context, what does Genzyme look like in 2020? Independently of whether you are part of a larger organization, you have to ask yourself how does any successful organization evolve and remain relevant, and to do that well I think you have to be highly sensitive and perceptive with good listening skills. I believe I brought those qualities. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What are the biggest changes you expect to see in the industry over the next 20 years?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>One change is already happening but I think it will continue to accelerate. We're moving from the large pharmaceutical, industrial approach, one of volume, to much more personalized therapies or precision medicine. It's being driven by biology. Value-creating marketing will become less and less important in the sense that you cannot market your way to a billion dollar drug - the only way you will be able to create sustainable value is by creating drugs that are better than what's out there already and that truly make a difference in an individual disease. </p> <p> <p> That shift will see greater and greater emphasis on the R&amp;D side, but it won't necessarily be that you need to have it all internally. In fact, successful R&amp;D organizations will be ones that are most agile and able to interact, intersect with the external world in a broad network of academic labs or other small biotechs. To be good at it you will need to have strong internal R&amp;D - you can't just have a group of individuals who look externally - I think you generally need to have state of the art R&amp;D internally but with a very strong external focus and connection. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>And tell us one myth about the industry that you would like to set straight.</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>I think that society does not fully appreciate the value and the level of humanity that resides within our industry. Like everybody, we're not perfect and not everybody perhaps represents us as well as we could, but this is an industry of people who genuinely want to make things better, to make a contribution, and it has the tools to do so. </p> <p> We do not have a good reputation and although much of that is self-imposed or deserved, I think that it is not well understood that the value that this industry can bring in its potential to solve some of the great healthcare challenges of our time is higher than ever. </p> <p> <p> <i>The second part of this interview, to be published next week, will focus on Dr Meeker's formative experiences, his career and other matters close to his heart.</i> </p>
