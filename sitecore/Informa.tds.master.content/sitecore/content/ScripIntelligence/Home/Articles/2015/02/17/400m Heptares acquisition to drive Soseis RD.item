<p>Sosei is to pay up to $400m to acquire the UK structure-based drug design specialist Heptares Therapeutics in a move that the Japanese firm hopes will bring fresh fuel to its R&D engine, complementing its existing nanotech and peptide technologies. It will pay $180m in cash up front and up to $220m contingent on pipeline milestones and future deals bringing in revenues.</p><p>Sosei will allow Heptares to run under its current management as an autonomous subsidiary. Co-founder and CEO Dr Malcolm Weir will remain CEO of Heptares and also become chief R&D officer in the enlarged group, with responsibility for worldwide R&D outside Japan.</p><p>Heptares brings its StaR precision drug design platform technology, which it has applied primarily to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), membrane proteins found in every cell in the body which are crucial to communication between cells and which are the site of action of about 40% of currently marketed drugs. Heptares has a pipeline of products across a range of neuroscience, metabolic and orphan disease areas, with the most advanced being a muscarinic M<subscript>1</subscript> agonist in Phase Ib for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and other conditions.</p><p>Heptares also has a number of revenue-bearing partnerships with pharma companies including Cubist Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Merck & Co), Takeda, AstraZeneca, MorphoSys and Novartis.</p><p>Sosei has been seeking strategic opportunities that will take it beyond the secured milestone and revenue stream derived from the COPD products Ultibro Breezhaler and Seebri Breezhaler marketed by its partner Novartis. </p><p>Its chairman and CEO Shinichi Tamura described the occasion of the deal as "an historic day for Sosei" and said Heptares would "contribute to a sustainable stream of new products for the group." Sosei is aiming to become a "significant global biopharmaceutical company arising from Japan" and sees Heptares as providing both a platform and a pipeline to help realize that goal, as well as an experienced team that will help identify and assess future internal and external opportunities.</p><p>Heptares was founded in 2007 based on the work of founding scientists Richard Henderson and Christopher Tate at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, with investment from MVM Life Science Partners. Additional venture funding was then supplied by MVM, Clarus Ventures, Novartis Venture Fund, Takeda Ventures and the Stanley Family Foundation. It has raised around $60m from the capital markets and secured funds of around $30m from partners.</p><p>A spokesperson said the deal secured significant investment for Heptares' technology and pipeline and would retain the company's identity and culture while providing access to Sosei's broader group capabilities and resources.</p><h2>Combined Portfolio (selected)</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Originator</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Product/ /program</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Indication</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sosei (licensee Novartis)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Seebri Breezhaler (glycopyrronium bromide)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>approved in EU/Japan; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartis-boosts-US-respiratory-portfolio-with-two-COPD-filings-356032" target="_new">NDA submitted in US</a></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>COPD</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sosei (licensee Novartis)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ultibro Breezhaler (glycopyrronium bromide/indacaterol maleate)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>approved in EU/Japan; NDA submitted in US</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>COPD</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sosei holds Japanese rights</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SO-1105 (miconazole Lauriad)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ph III in Japan [approved in 24 EU countries, US and South Korea]</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>oropharyngeal candidiasis</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>M<subscript>1</subscript> agonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ph Ib</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's/schizophrenia/others</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>A<subscript>2A</subscript> agonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>IND open</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ADHD</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>M<subscript>4</subscript> agonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>psychosis in schizophrenia/Alzheimer's/others</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>M<subscript>1</subscript>M<subscript>4</subscript> dual agonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>cognitive impairment and psychosis in schizophrenia/Alzheimer's/others</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CGRP antagonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>migraine</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GLP-1 agonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>diabetes</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GLP-1 antagonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>congenital hyperinsulinism</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Heptares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Orexin OX<subscript>1</subscript> antagonist</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>addiction</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sosei</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>APP13002</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>infectious eye diseases</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sosei</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>APP13007</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>inflammatory eye diseases</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>In the fiscal third quarter ended 31 December 2014 Sosei reported revenue of &yen;951m ($8m) arising from its Seebri and Ultibro royalties, with net income totalling &yen;262m. </p><p>The company acquired two novel peptide platform technologies (for low-cost, high-efficiency peptide manufacturing and for peptide modification) through the acquisition of Jitsubo in December 2014. </p><p>Separately, its two preclinical eye disease programs are based on its Activus Pure Nano-particle Technology (APNT) that enables the pulverization of poorly soluble compounds to nano-sized crystal particles.
