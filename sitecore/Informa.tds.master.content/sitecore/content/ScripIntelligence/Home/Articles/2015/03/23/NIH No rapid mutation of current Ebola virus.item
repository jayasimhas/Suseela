<p>Researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on 26 March said data showed the Ebola virus currently circulating in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone does not appear to be rapidly mutating, and therefore, is not any more virulent or transmissible than those in previous outbreaks of the disease.</p><p>The results of the NIH study, which were published in the journal Science, help put to rest fears the experimental Ebola drugs and vaccines currently in development may be ineffective against the disease and diagnostic tests useless, as some scientists had earlier asserted. </p><p>The NIH researchers, however, acknowledged that more studies are needed to confirm their data.</p><p>Last fall, another team of scientists who tested samples from about 80 patients in Sierra Leone said they had identified more than 300 genetic changes in the current Ebola virus &ndash; suggesting it was mutating twice as fast as previously observed.</p><p>But Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), insisted the Ebola virus appears to be stable and "does not appear to be mutating more rapidly than viruses in previous Ebola outbreaks," which he said is "reassuring." </p><p>He said the agency was eager to gain additional information to validate the findings by its researchers, "because understanding and tracking Ebola virus evolution are critical to ensuring that our scientific and public health response keeps pace."</p><p>The NIH study relied on samples of Ebola from cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone, in addition to two case clusters in Mali obtained from the International Center for Excellence in Research located in Bamako. </p><p>The Mali case clusters originated from people who became infected in Guinea and traveled to Mali, where they were diagnosed, the NIH said.</p><p>The NIH's scientists, who evaluated the data at the NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana, said their data showed the Ebola virus was not mutating at a rate beyond what was expected and therefore, it was unlikely the types of genetic changes thus far observed would impair diagnostic measures or affect the efficacy of candidate <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-vaccines-safe-but-quandary-for-Liberia-efficacy-enrollment-357521" target="_new">vaccines</a> or potential virus-specific <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapps-moment-of-truth-efficacy-trial-starts-356995" target="_new">treatments</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
