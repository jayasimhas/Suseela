<p>Representative Bobby Rush (Democrat-Illinois) said it best: it was a "lovefest" at the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 21 May during the markup session for the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> (HR 6), with the $13bn bill easily being adopted in a unanimous vote.</p><p>Indeed, it was praise all around, with no pushback from any E&C member on moving the bill &ndash; intended to accelerate the discovery, development and approval processes for biomedical products &ndash; to the full House for consideration.</p><p>Even the handful of amendments that were offered up during the early morning session were quickly withdrawn &ndash; all but the so-called "manager's amendment" from Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the E&C, which contained the eagerly awaited details of how the lawmakers planned to cover the costs of the Cures bill.</p><p>The manager's amendment was agreed to by a voice vote.</p><p>Highly anticipated in that package was the funding for the FDA, which told <i>Scrip</i> on 19 May it would need <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">$1bn to cover the costs</a> of implementing the measures in Cures.</p><p>But Mr Upton's manager's amendment proposed only about half of that amount &ndash; calling for $110m per year over five years, from fiscal years 2016 through 2020, or $550m, under what he called the "Cures Innovation Fund."</p><p>So unless Congress can find a way to come up with more offsets or new cash, the FDA likely will be left with some unfunded mandates &ndash; an outcome Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, pleaded with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">House</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">Senate</a> lawmakers last month at separate hearings not to let happen.</p><p>Included in the manager's amendment, however, was a measure to exempt biopharmaceutical user fees paid to the FDA from the sequester &ndash; the across-the-board spending cuts put in place under the <i>Budget Control Act of 2011</i>.</p><p>Ensuring the FDA user fees no longer face the threat of sequester "has been a bipartisan idea from the get-go," Representative Upton said.</p><p>"FDA user fees were never intended, I think, to be part of the sequester, and they were," he said, calling that glitch in the law an "obstacle to advancing innovation."</p><p>The E&C lawmakers, however, did not use the Cures bill to exempt the annual discretionary spending included in the annual budgets of the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from sequestration.</p><p>Earlier, lawmakers had included in the Cures bill a measure to create an NIH Innovation Fund, providing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn over five years</a>.</p><p>Added into the Cures bill through the manager's amendment was a provision that would enable the FDA to expedite its hiring process by using so-called direct hiring authority &ndash; something Dr Woodcock has been begging to gain.</p><p><b>The offsets</b></p><p>A fight over paying for the Cures bill through certain offsets &ndash; spending cuts and revenue increases &ndash; postponed the vote on the legislation by the E&C Committee by one day. But by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Offsets-deal-reached-to-fund-FDA-NIH-Cures-bill-358528" target="_new">late night on 20 May</a>, Mr Upton announced Democrats and Republicans had made a deal.</p><p>While the official estimate of the total cost of the Cures bill has not yet come down from the Congressional Budget Office, which provides nonpartisan analyses to the House and Senate for budgetary purposes, Representative Upton insisted the offsets would fully cover the expenses of implementing the legislation.</p><p>The E&C committee has proposed to cover a big chunk of the costs through requiring the Department of Energy to sell 8 million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve over eight years, from 2018 through 2025, which is estimated to bring in $5.2bn &ndash; an idea praised by Representative Ed Whitfield (Republican-Kentucky) as "looking outside of the box" for ways to cover the Cures bill.</p><p>A more controversial offset, which would change the timing of reinsurance payments to Medicare Part D drug plans, however, quickly drew fire &ndash; mostly from the insurance industry.</p><p>"We believe it would be a serious mistake for Congress to take budget savings from the private Medicare delivery system to increase federal spending in other areas," said America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) CEO Karen Ignagni, who revealed on 21 May she actually was leaving the lobbying group to be the new chief at New York insurer EmblemHealth. </p><p>The insurance industry&rsquo;s opposition to using the timing change for the reinsurance payments, said Sung Hee Choe, director at the Washington-based analysis and consulting firm Avalere Health, came as little surprise to her, since "that's essentially money out of their pockets."</p><p>Ms Choe noted the idea to squeeze the funds from the Medicare Part D plans came from a recommendation made in April 2013 by the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG).</p><p>Currently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) makes advance capitated payments, or prepayments, to Part D prescription drug plans for each enrollee at the beginning of each month. </p><p>The Part D plans may invest those Medicare funds in interest-bearing instruments until the money is needed to pay for drug costs and administrative services. </p><p>The law currently does not limit the ability of Part D plans to retain as additional revenue the investment income earned on federal funds. </p><p>Part D plans must submit annual bid proposals containing their anticipated revenue requirements for providing drug coverage under each of their plans for the upcoming year. </p><p>OIG said CMS paid 706 Part D plans about $45bn in prepayments in calendar year 2009. </p><p>But an analysis by the HHS watchdog revealed that Part D plans held Medicare funds for about 20 days and earned investment income of an estimated $5.3m million, while the Part D trust fund lost out on a potential investment income of $111.2m. </p><p>The OIG recommended Congress pursue legislation to adjust the timing of Medicare&rsquo;s prepayments to Part D plans to account for the time that the plans invest Medicare funds before paying pharmacy claims. It also advised CMS to develop and implement regulations that would require Part D plans to reduce their revenue requirements in their bid proposals to account for anticipated investment income. </p><p>CMS, however, disagreed with the OIG &ndash; contending that implementing either of the recommendations would cause Part D plans to increase their bid proposals to recoup the investment income they would lose, which would result in a decrease in most or all of the estimated cost savings.</p><p>But the E&C lawmakers apparently liked the OIG&rsquo;s analysis &ndash; estimating that limiting the ability of Part D plans to retain investment income earned on Medicare funds over the next five years could bring in as much as $7bn.</p><p>But AHIP's Ms Ignagni argued Congress was taking the wrong approach.</p><p>"Taking funds from the component of Medicare that is driving innovation for beneficiaries would contradict our shared goal of improving patient care and health outcomes for individuals with serious medical conditions," she asserted. </p><p>Avalere's Ms Choe pointed out that in the end, AHIP may not need to worry, since the Senate, which is going at a much slower pace, may reject the E&C Committee's offset proposals.</p><p>Among the other offsets included in the Cures bill passed by the E&C Committee was a plan to limit Medicaid reimbursement to states for durable medical equipment to Medicare rates, which could provide close to $3bn to go towards paying down the Cures costs. </p><p>The lawmakers also took aim at facilities that use film x-ray technology &ndash; declaring they would limit Medicare payments for using those outdated processes. Doing so could bring in more than $200m, while also pushing facilities to modernize their imaging services to digital. </p><p><b>Offered and withdrawn</b></p><p>A few lawmakers at the 21 May markup session offered up amendments, for which they never intended to be voted on, but put on the table to make a point &ndash; declaring they will pursue the measures at another time.</p><p>One of those came from Representative Jan Schakowsky (Democrat-Illinois), who wanted to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers seeking FDA approval to disclose their research and development costs and identify any NIH funding used to offset their R&D expenses. The amendment also called for HHS to make that information publicly available.</p><p>"This would allow us to understand how much each drug costs to deliver," Representative Schakowsky declared. "We keep hearing that drug companies need to be incentivized to produce more drugs, but I'm not convinced. The cost of production of a particular drug is hidden from view, and we are just left with estimates based on researchers getting protected information from drug companies on the average costs of drugs."</p><p>That is no longer good enough, she said, if drug companies are going to make the case they need more exclusivity protection. </p><p>&ldquo;We need to have the data to prove that,&rdquo; the Illinois lawmaker argued.</p><p>Congresswoman Schakowsky cited Gilead Sciences' $1,000-per-pill hepatitis C virus medicine Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) as an example &ndash; the drug that has become lawmakers' favorite punching bag over high drug prices.</p><p>"With the considerable investment we are making in research and the significant amount we are spending for consumers to have access to the cures and treatments they produce, we should have more information on the cost of production," Representative Schakowsky demanded.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
