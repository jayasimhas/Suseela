<p>A day after US officials said they were putting the finishing touches on preparations to launch a Phase II/III trial testing two experimental Ebola vaccines in Liberia, GlaxoSmithKline, which co-developed one of those products, shipped 300 vials of its chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 (ChAd3) candidate to study sites in the West African country.</p><p>GSK has been working with its partner, the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID), to accelerate development of the vaccine in response to the current Ebola epidemic, in which about 22,000 people have become infected, with nearly 8,700 dying from the disease. </p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, NIAID director, told reporters on 22 January the Phase II/III efficacy study is expected to start in a "couple of weeks," after the FDA gives its go-ahead and Liberian officials sign off on the plan (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-Ebola-vaccines-set-for-testing-in-Liberia-356313" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The ChAd3 vaccine has been undergoing Phase I safety testing since this past September in five trials in the UK, US, Switzerland and Mali involving about 200 healthy volunteers. </p><p>Initial data from the trials have demonstrated the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile, including in a West African population, and across the different doses evaluated. </p><p>Results from the first of the Phase I study were published in November 2014. The results from the remaining safety studies will be published in the coming months, GSK said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-NIH-declare-Ebola-vaccine-safety-test-a-success-355287" target="_new">27 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-A-test-of-character-355379" target="_new">3 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Fauci-Ebola-must-be-a-shake-the-cage-moment-355474" target="_new">8 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Based on the early results, NIAID and GSK have selected the dose for the Phase II/III trial, which also will test an experimental Ebola vaccine being developed by NewLink Genetics and its partners Merck and the Canadian government.</p><p>Dr Fauci said the three-arm randomized placebo-controlled trial will enroll about 27,000 healthcare workers in Liberia and those at high risk for contracting the virus, although GSK put the enrollment at 30,000.</p><p>While shipping the vaccine is a "major achievement" and the Phase I data are "encouraging," Dr Moncef Slaoui, chairman of global vaccines at GSK, reminded that the vaccine is still in development and any potential future use in mass vaccination campaigns will depend on whether the World Health Organization, regulators and other stakeholders are satisfied the product provides protection against Ebola without causing significant adverse effects and how quickly large quantities of it can be made.</p><p>GSK acquired the rights to the vaccine through its 2013 acquisition of biotechnology firm Okairos, which was the initial partner with NIAID on developing the vaccine.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
