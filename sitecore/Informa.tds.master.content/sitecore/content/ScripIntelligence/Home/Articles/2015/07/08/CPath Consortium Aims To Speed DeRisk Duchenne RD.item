<p>While some firms in recent years have found great success with rare disease medicines &ndash; with orphan drugs turning out to be the new blockbusters in return on investment &ndash; it's nonetheless, generally been a rough road for those products getting to the marketplace, given the difficulty in enrolling patients and proving efficacy in small populations.</p><p>But the nonprofit the Critical Path Institute (C-Path) is trying to make research and development easier for rare disease companies and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers through establishing consortia aimed at developing tools and methodologies, with the ultimate goals of de-risking the clinical trial and regulatory processes and accelerating the path to the market.</p><p>An <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Consortia-tide-rising-Does-it-float-your-boat-352571" target="_new">analysis</a> of 369 international public-private biomedical research consortia from the Washington-based nonprofit FasterCures, part of the Milken Institute, found there's been a steady climb in recent years in the number of those types of partnerships in North America, Europe and Asia &ndash; fast becoming a permanent component of the R&D process.</p><p>C-Path, an independent, non-profit established in 2005 and operated under public and private funds, including from the FDA, foundations, like Bill & Melinda Gates, and for-profit membership fees, has created 11 consortia over the past decade.</p><p>The latest is focused on the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) R&D community. </p><p>The organization has partnered with the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, which has committed to providing almost $1m to back the Duchenne Regulatory Sciences Consortium (D-RSC). </p><p>Dr. Martha Brumfield, president and CEO of C-Path, acknowledged the D-RSC's formation comes too late to help the frontrunners in the DMD space &ndash; BioMarin Pharmaceutical's drisapersen and Sarepta Therapeutics' eteplirsen.</p><p>But the C-Path is hoping to change the R&D and regulatory landscapes for the investigational drugs that come after drisapersen and eteplirsen, whose data could potentially benefit all in the DMD space, Dr. Brumfield told <i>Scrip</i> &ndash; although BioMarin has yet to join the D-RSC and Sarepta was still finalizing its agreement to be a member.</p><p>BioMarin is expecting a decision from the FDA by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-fates-converge-for-BioMarins-drisapersen-Sareptas-eteplirsen-359173" target="_new">Dec. 27 on drisapersen</a>, while Sarepta is awaiting word from the FDA on whether the company's new drug application (NDA for eteplirsen was actually accepted by the US agency.</p><p>No formal announcement has been made on an FDA advisory panel for the drisapersen and eteplirsen NDAs, but Sarepta said during its earning's call last week it anticipated the agency's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee to review its application, if accepted, in late November, per the tentative calendar showing that panel plans to meet over two days that month. </p><p><b>Concept</b></p><p>The idea behind the D-RSC, whose membership currently includes PTC Therapeutics, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Brenda Wong from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, is for its participants to provide data from completed clinical trials, patient registries and natural history studies under a precompetitive partnership that will be aggregated, analyzed by the consortium members and used to build a quantitative disease progression model, which will be used by DMD drug developers in the future, she explained. </p><p>"Fortunately, there are a number of companies that are investing in the space," Dr. Brumfield said. "And we want to do everything we can to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to stay in this space."</p><p>Along with their data, the D-RSC members are expected to provide their expertise, experience and time, she said. </p><p>"Typically, there is a lot of in-kind contribution that comes from the members of our precompetitive consortia," Dr Brumfield added.</p><p>The D-RSC has a "very detailed development plan for exactly what we are going to do" &ndash; from allocating resources to setting the timeframe for expected deliverables, she said.</p><p>Right now, C-Path is focused on getting regulators in the US, Europe, Canada and Japan on the same page.</p><p>"If the new tools, progression models or biomarkers are not accepted by regulators, the pharmaceutical industry will be reluctant to use it," Dr. Brumfield said. "We are always striving towards the tool or methodology that will be fully embraced by drug development and regulatory."</p><p>Who gets access to the data from the DMD consortium is up to its members, she said, noting each of the C-Path consortia have their own governance systems, with access ranging from anyone to only the consortium members.</p><p>In one case, the data are only made available to the C-Path's staff, Dr. Brumfield said. </p><p>But once the quantitative disease progression models are developed, that information will be publicly accessible, she said.</p><p>"We are adamant in our work that any tool or methodology we develop must be made publicly available," Dr. Brumfield said. "That's part of our mission. That's the spirit in which we work."</p><p>If the D-RSC is successful, she said, it could enable DMD drug development to happen faster, with less risk and at a lower cost.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
