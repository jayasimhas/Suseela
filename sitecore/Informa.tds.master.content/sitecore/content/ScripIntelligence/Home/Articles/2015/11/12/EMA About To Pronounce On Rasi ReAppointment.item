<p>The European Medicines Agency says it expects to make an announcement on the re-appointment of Guido Rasi as its executive director "early next week", and that a press release will be issued on Monday. </p><p>Rasi had to step down from the post at the end of 2014, but following a recruitment procedure earlier this year, the management board nominated him to take up the reins of the agency once again. A total of 36 people applied for the job, but it is not known how many were shortlisted.</p><p>As part of the appointment process, Rasi appeared before the European Parliament's committee on the environment, public health and food safety (ENVI) on Oct. 13. He read out a prepared statement on the challenges facing the agency, above all the sustainability of healthcare systems, the medicines regulatory network, and R&D. </p><p>He then answered questions from MEPs on issues such as clinical trial data transparency, access to medicines, and adaptive pathways. He said it was one thing to maximize the amount of trial data into the public domain, but another to ensure the data were used "wisely". He also wanted the parliament to ensure the agency had the resources to pursue further collaboration with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies.</p><p>As for the adaptive pathways pilot, he took issue with the perception that speeding up access to innovative drugs brought additional risks, pointing out that this approach focused on a specific high-risk patient population in which the benefit to risk ratio would be more favorable.</p><p>Assuming MEPs were satisfied with his answers &ndash; and there was no indication that they weren't &ndash; Rasi's appointment will be confirmed by the EMA management board, and he will sign a contract and take up his official duties. </p><p>Rasi relinquished his post as executive director in November 2014, three years into his five-year tenure, after Emil Hristov, a former head of the Bulgarian medicines agency, said the procedure used to select him was compromised by conflicts of interest involving candidates and members of the pre-selection panel. The EU's civil service tribunal upheld Hristov's complaint, and annulled the appointment, although the EMA and the European Commission appealed and the EMA stressed that the grounds for the tribunal's decision were purely procedural.</p>
