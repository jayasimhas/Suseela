<p><p>Roche's Genentech has inked its second partnership in as many days to test its PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in combination with another oncologic. </p><p>With combination therapies thought to be the answer to the cancer puzzle, all of the major pharmas who are dipping their toes into immuno-oncology are inking collaborations to test their respective checkpoint inhibitors with as many other agents as possible. </p><p>Genentech's most recent collaboration will test its PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab with Immune Design's CMB305 in a Phase II trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. </p><p>CMB305 is what the company dubs a "prime boost" immunotherapy, combining two agents the company has tested individually. </p><p>"The combination of CMB305, which is designed to generate and expand tumor-specific CD8 T cells, with atezolizumab, which is designed to remove the tumor-induced blockade, makes profound sense from a mechanistic perspective," said Immune Design CEO Carlos Paya. </p><p>The deal comes a day after Genentech <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Why-Clovis-Is-Piggybacking-Genentech-In-Lung-Cancer-359917" target="_new">signed a similar deal</a> with Clovis Oncology to test atezolizumab with the biotech's EGFR inhibitor rociletinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The trial, sponsored by Clovis, will begin enrolling patients before the end of the year and will test the safety and tolerability of the combination, as well as its level of activity.</p><p>Genentech isn't the only one making deals; Immune Design signed another deal with Merck & Co earlier this week to test two of its agents separately with the big pharma's already marketed PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and melanoma. </p><p>No financial details of any of the collaborations were disclosed. </p><p><p>
