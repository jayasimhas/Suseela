<p>Data presented at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) annual congress in Rome support the early use of UCB's anti-TNF drug Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) in certain rheumatoid arthritis patients who have not yet been treated with methotrexate or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</p><p>The results of the study, C-EARLY, formed the basis for a regulatory filing with the European Medicines Agency to extend Cimzia's indication in the EU. It is approved for moderate-to-severe RA in adult patients who fail to respond adequately to DMARDs including methotrexate. UCB is now seeking an extension to include the use of Cimzia in combination with methotrexate for adult patients with severe active and progressive RA not previously treated with methotrexate or other DMARDs.</p><h2>Study details</h2><p>C-EARLY was designed to test the efficacy and safety of Cimzia in combination with optimized methotrexate (MTX) to treat DMARD-naive adult patients with early, active RA. The Phase III multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial enrolled 879 patients with early active RA (<1 year="" since="" diagnosis,="" fulfilling="" the="" 2010="" acr/eular="" classification="" criteria)="" with="" at="" least="" moderate="" disease="" activity.="" 660="" patients="" were="" randomized="" to="" the="" cimzia="" arm="" and="" 219="" to="" the="" placebo=""></1></p><p>Methotrexate therapy was initiated with 10mg weekly, and increased to 25mg after 6-8 weeks, if well tolerated. At least 15mg weekly of methotrexate had to be taken to remain in the study.</p><p>Patients on Cimzia+MTX were compared with those on placebo+MTX, with the full analysis set including 655 patients in the Cimzia arm and 213 in the MTX arm; the radiographic analysis set consisted of 528 patients on Cimzia and 163 on placebo. </p><p>After 52 weeks, patients on Cimzia+optimized MTX had greater sustained remission (the primary endpoint), greater rates of sustained low disease activity (the key secondary endpoint), and greater inhibition of structural damage.</p><p>Other secondary results presented at EULAR showed patients had greater improvements at one year in pain, disease activity, fatigue and health-related quality of life, improved workplace and household productivity, and reduced need for assistance compared with patients receiving placebo+MTX.</p><p><table><h2>Key results from C-EARLY</h2><tbody><tr><td><p>Endpoint</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Cimzia arm</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Placebo arm</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>sustained remission (p<></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>28.9%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>15.0%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>sustained low disease activity (p<></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>43.8%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>28.6%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>inhibition of structural damage (change from baseline in van der Heijde modified total Sharp score; p<></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>0.2</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>1.9</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>patient-reported outcomes (p<0.001 for="" health="" assessment="" questionnaire="" disability="" index=""></0.001></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-1.0</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-0.8</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>household productivity (p<0.01 for="" household="" work="" days="" missed="" per=""></0.01></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>3.0</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>1.9</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>A second phase of the study will continue for a year to evaluate the potential for reducing Cimzia maintenance dosing frequency or withdrawing it in patients who achieve sustained low disease activity in the first year of the study.</p>
