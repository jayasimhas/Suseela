<p>UCB is teaming up with Neuropore Therapies to develop early stage Parkinson's diseases therapies. </p><p>The worldwide collaborative agreement to develop and commercialize Neuropore's Parkinson's candidates will focus initially on preclinical asset NPT200-11. Neuropore's small-molecule targeting pathogenic alpha-synuclein is expected to enter clinical Phase I in 2015.</p><p>Neuropore will receive $20m upfront from UCB, but will be eligible for up to $460m in milestone payments, in addition to royalties on net sales.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, UCB will gain the exclusive license to develop and commercialize NPT200-11 in all indications. UCB and Neuropore will work together to complete non-clinical studies, and a first Phase I trial. UCB will lead all further clinical development, regulatory activities and commercialization.</p><p>UCB, which markets off-patent Parkinson's therapy Neupro (rotigotine), has a couple of preclinical assets already in its pipeline targeting the neurological condition: D2 PAM and UCB1016330. </p><p>Neuropore's CEO Dieter Meier said in a statement: "We anticipate that this partnership will contribute to Neuropore's further growth to become a leader in discovering and developing innovative nervous system therapies."</p><p>He added: "UCB's commitment and expertise in this field offers the best opportunity to collaboratively develop orally available small molecules to treat diseases that affect large patient populations and possibly certain orphan diseases."</p>
