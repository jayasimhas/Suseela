<p>Merck KGaA is hoping to climb the pharma ranks in the next few years through the development of its pipeline and the overall makeover of the business. Comments by the chair of the firm's executive board, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley, during the firm's annual financial results conference, highlight the importance of immune oncology in its healthcare business growth hopes.</p><p>"We were absolutely at the lower end" of the medium-sized pharma rankings, Dr Kley said. "But one part of our plan for transformation was that we wanted to stick to pharma. To do so we had to increase R&D," he said. </p><p>The company said 2015 will see it spend more on research and development than in 2014 or 2013. </p><p>"The proof of the cake is in the eating so let's wait and see as the immune-oncology pipeline grows," Dr Kley said. The company, which has partnered with Pfizer in this area, expects to produce data on some of its immune-oncology program at ASCO in June. </p><p>However, Dr Kley added that "approvals are the only proof that we made it." He said his optimism is growing for the company's success in this space. </p><h2>Fit for 2018?</h2><p>Merck is in the middle of a "transformation" period. The firm initiated the two-step "Fit for 2018" transformation and growth program in 2011. 2018 will mark the company's 350th anniversary. </p><p>While the company maintained focus on organizational and personnel changes in the first phase of the program (completed in 2013), it embarked on the second phase with a renewed emphasis on growth in 2014. As a result Merck is condensing its businesses into three core units: Healthcare, which will combine pharma and consumer health; Life Science; and Performance Materials. </p><p>Dr Kley said 2014 had seen the company strengthen all three of these units through acquisitions or collaborations. Last year it closed the acquisition of materials firm AZ Electronic Materials, started the process of buying Sigma-Aldrich to strengthen its life science business, and struck a strategic alliance with Pfizer for the co-development of immune-oncology therapies. </p><p>"These developments are the result of our long-term transformation," Dr Kley said in the company's full year results statement. "Merck is transforming into a highly specialized, global technology company." </p><p>Dr Kley did not specifically address any further M&A plans for 2015, but he joked that Merck's collaboration with Pfizer would remain just a mutually beneficial partnership. "Pfizer is too big to be acquired by us," he jested. "Similarly we cannot be taken over by Pfizer. This is just a great match of similar interests. Beyond that we don't have any other plans."</p><h2>2014 results</h2><p>Though 2014 was a year of respectable growth across all of Merck KGaA's business units, the company is anticipating a flat year to come as generic competition increases for blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Rebif (interferon beta-1a) and R&D costs mount as the company pushes forward with big plans for its transformation. </p><p>Still, the firm's annual conference in Frankfurt started on a keen note: "The sun is shining on Merck actually and figuratively," said Dr Kley. </p><p>In 2014, total group revenues were up 3.7% to &euro;11.4bn, while sales grew 5.5% to &euro;11.3bn. Foreign exchange effects lowered sales by -1.8%, the company said. </p><p>Merck Serono saw sales of &euro;5.8bn in 2014, up 1.7% from the previous year. The highest absolute sales increase came from the company's fertility franchise. </p><p>Heavily impacting Merck Serono in 2014 though was a sharp fall in royalty and license income, the total of which was down by 48% to &euro;192m in 2014 (&euro;372m in 2013). As such, Merck is remaining cautious on its expectations for the coming year, forecasting little or no improvement in earnings for 2015. </p><p>This year will also see tough competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Rebif continue in the US and Europe. With an organic sales decline of only 0.2% in 2014, Rebif is stable but the pressure is mounting. Nevertheless, "we have managed to defend Rebif better than many expected," Dr Kley said. </p><p><p>Merck KGaA boasted organic growth from all four of its divisions in 2014 &ndash; Merck Serono (pharma), Merck Millipore (life sciences), Consumer Health and Performance Materials &ndash; and spent a large proportion of its 3 March full-year read-out touting its active year of M&A and ability to control debt. </p><p>Merck acquired materials company AZ last year for &euro;1.9bn, but its net financial debt rose only &euro;252m to &euro;559m in 2014 (&euro;307m in 2013). This debt management "shows that Merck is well-prepared for the acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich," the company said. Merck agreed to buy the life science and technology firm in the third quarter of 2014 for $17bn, representing a price of $140.00 a share. The transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2015, remains subject to anti-trust regulations and other closing conditions. Merck's CEO refrained from commenting on the topic at the company's annual press conference, other than to say all was on track. </p><p>
