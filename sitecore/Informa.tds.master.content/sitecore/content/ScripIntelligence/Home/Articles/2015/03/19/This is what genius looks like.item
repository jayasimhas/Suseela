<p> Budding scientists, some as young as five years old, invaded the White House on 23 March, bringing with them their very atypical science fair projects, with some involving novel ways to discover and develop drugs and diagnostics. </p> <p> National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr Francis Collins told <i>Scrip</i> he couldn't help but be impressed by the many life sciences projects at President Barack Obama's annual White House Science Fair. </p> <p> Dr Collins was quick to point to the research being done by Anvita Gupta, in which the 17-year-old Arizonan had combined artificial intelligence techniques with 3D visualization and biomimicry to systematically discover which pharmaceutical agents might inhibit the interactions of so-called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) with other proteins in an effort to autonomously find drug leads for diseases like cancer, tuberculosis and Ebola. </p> <p> IDPs make up 70% of all cancer proteins and are mutated in tuberculosis and Ebola, Ms Gupta explained. </p> <p> &quot;These proteins change shape constantly, and when they are mutated, they lead to a lot of different diseases,&quot; she told <i>Scrip</i>. &quot;They are really hard to target because finding a drug for them is like finding a key for a lock that keep son changing.&quot; </p> <p> Ms Gupta said she's been working to find drugs that mimic the disordered protein that does the binding, &quot;and in that way, you can trick the other proteins in the cell into binding with the drug rather than the disordered protein.&quot; </p> <p> Ms Gupta said that when she applied her approach, she was able to find four natural tuberculosis inhibitors, which she said have been tested in the lab, &quot;and they've been shown to work against the bacteria.&quot; </p> <p> The high school senior, who said she became interested in drug discovery when she was 15, also found 12 new Ebola antivirals, which Ms Gupta said are in the open source for anyone to test. </p> <p> <p> <img border="0" src="-/media/75E206E1DDF94C658EAB28DD519E2624.ashx"></p> <p> <i>Teenage scientist Anvita Gupta describes her drug discovery project at the 2015 White House Science Fair to Google executive chairman Dr Eric Schmidt, White House Office of Science &amp; Technology&rsquo;s Tom Kalil and the Biotechnology Institute&rsquo;s Lawrence Mahan </i><br> <i>Photo by Donna Young</i> </p> <p> Ms Gupta, who won a Third Place Medal of Distinction for Global Good at the 2015 Intel Science Talent Search, said she's been working with scientists from Harvard Medical School on her project and collaborating with labs in China and San Diego to get her compounds tested. </p> <p> While at the White House Science Fair, Ms Gupta's project also drew the interest of Google executive chairman Dr Eric Schmidt, who spent several minutes quizzing the young scientist about her drug discoveries. </p> <p> President Obama noted that Ms Gupta's work in developing an algorithm with the potential to speed up pathways to discovering how to match drugs to diseases is consistent with his <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457">precision medicine</a> initiative he announced in January. </p> <p> Dr Collins pointed out that the data Ms Gupta was using was open and freely available to researchers, &quot;much of it funded by the NIH.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;It's a wonderful demonstration of how crucial it is that data are all accessible to anybody with a good idea,&quot; he said. </p> <p> Dr Collins said he also was &quot;inspired&quot; by the work being done by 19-year-old Stanford University freshman Natalie Ng, who developed two micro-RNA-based prognostic models that can predict metastasis in breast cancer. </p> <p> Ms Ng said she became interested in computational biology when she was a sophomore in high school, which she discovered just happened to be the same school attended by the White House's new chief data scientist, Dr DJ Patil. </p> <p> &quot;I've really enjoyed biology research, because I think it's applicable to the everyday world,&quot; said Ms Ng, who won the 2013 International BioGENEius Challenge. </p> <p> Dr Collins also praised young researcher Ruchi Pandya, an 18-year-old high school senior from California, who developed a one-square centimeter carbon nanofiber electrode-based biosensor, which is intended to quickly alert a person they potentially are having a heart attack. </p> <p> <b>Science funding needed</b> </p> <p> President Obama used his <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teens-cancer-flu-treatment-discoveries-catch-industry-attention-352013">annual science fair</a> &ndash; the fifth one he has held at the White House &ndash; to highlight the need for more funding for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. </p> <p> He revealed that he secured a commitment from the private sector for $240m in STEM education funding. </p> <p> &quot;It's not enough for us to just lift up young people and say, 'Great job, way to go,'&quot; President Obama said. &quot;You also have to have labs to go to, and you've got to be able to support yourself while you're doing this amazing research. And that involves us as a society making the kind of investments that are going to be necessary for us to continue to innovate for many, many years to come.&quot; </p> <p> Bill Nye, known to TV viewers as &quot;The Science Guy,&quot; said Congress has been stingy when it comes to science funding &ndash; declaring not enough is being done to support basic research. </p> <p> &quot;There are many things Congress wants to invest in, but basic research is very important. It always needs more than it's getting,&quot; Mr Nye told <i>Scrip</i>. </p> <p> He praised President Obama for consistently holding the annual science fair. </p> <p> &quot;The most important thing about this is that it exists,&quot; Mr Nye said. </p> <p><p><p>
