<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) temporarily suspended new patient enrollment in a Phase III clinical trial for Amgen's Blincyto (blinatumomab) in the treatment of children and younger adults with relapsed B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) due to funding issues on 3 March. </p><p>Blincyto, Amgen's bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) targeting CD19, won accelerated US FDA approval in December for adults with Philadelphia-negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-early-US-win-for-BiTE-antibody-Blincyto-355400" target="_new">3 December 2014</a>). NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, expects to get its Phase III trial back on track soon with funding from industry to support administration of the monoclonal antibody outside of the clinic.</p><p>"The study has a number of additional costs associated with the research, including funding administration of investigational drug through home health care support. The decision to suspend enrollment on the trial relates to delays surrounding the finalization of a mechanism to administer industry-supported funds for this trial," said Malcom Smith, NCI associate branch chief for pediatric oncology in the institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, in a statement given to <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Patients currently enrolled in the clinical trial will continue treatment with combinations of several established therapies with or without stem cell transplants and with or without Blincyto while enrollment is suspended. The trial began in December and is expected to enroll 598 individuals between the ages of 1 and 30. </p><p>"The funding situation is anticipated to be resolved expeditiously, which will allow the study will be able to reopen," Dr Smith said.</p><p><p><p><p>
