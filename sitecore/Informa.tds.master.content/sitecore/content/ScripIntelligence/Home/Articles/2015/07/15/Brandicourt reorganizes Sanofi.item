<p>Sanofi's new CEO Olivier Brandicourt has wasted little time in stamping his mark on the French pharma giant. Bayer Healthcare's former chief, who took up the top job at Sanofi in April this year after the shock ousting of Christopher Viehbacher last October, has revealed plans to reorganize Sanofi's business operations with the creation of five global business units.</p><p>The news follows a series of recent moves by big pharma companies to address declining pipeline productivity, patent expiries and pricing pressures by the reorganizing of product portfolios. </p><p>"Sanofi's restructuring is the latest in a trend that has seen larger firms evaluate and explore their portfolios to streamline and focus on high-performing assets," Ali Al-Bazergan, senior analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare tells <i>Scrip</i>. "The simplified structure will aid capital allocation as the company will look towards future launches and strengthening deals across its diversified divisions."</p><p>Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Its-a-wrap-GSK-and-Novartis-megadeal-completes-357034" target="_new">three-part asset swap</a> deal is possibly the most high profile example of this trend, but Bayer's decision to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bayer-to-shed-Material-Science-unit-via-IPO-354017" target="_new">float its Material Science unit</a> and purchase Merck & Co's consumer care business, AstraZeneca's acquisition of Bristol-Myers Squibb's share of their diabetes alliance, and Pfizer's various reshaping initiatives over the past 18 months all fall under the heading of portfolio reorganization.</p><p>Sanofi's five new global business units are: General Medicines & Emerging Markets, Specialty Care, Diabetes & Cardiovascular, Sanofi Pasteur and Merial. This new structure will be implemented beginning in January 2016.</p><p>"The new organization simplifies and focuses Sanofi to optimize growth," said Dr Brandicourt, reinforcing that the change was a "necessary step" for growth. </p><p>The General Medicines & Emerging Markets Global Business Unit will be led by Peter Guenter and will consist of Sanofi's established products, generics, consumer healthcare, and all pharmaceutical businesses in emerging markets. Mr Guenter is currently executive vice-president of global commercial operations at Sanofi.</p><p>The Specialty Care Global Business Unit, to be called Sanofi Genzyme, will be led by David Meeker and will consist of Sanofi's medicines in rare diseases, multiple sclerosis, oncology and immunology, including the two investigational biologics, sarilumab and dupilumab. This suggests that Dr Meeker, the current CEO of Genzyme, will be widening his remit. <i>Scrip</i> recently published a two-part interview with Dr Meeker where he discussed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Executive-profile-Genzymes-CEO-on-dark-times-transition-and-the-long-view-358939" target="_new">his experiences at Sanofi</a> since the acquisition of Genzyme in 2011, and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Executive-profile-the-life-and-career-of-Genzyme-CEO-David-Meeker-359062" target="_new">his life prior to joining Genzyme</a> in 1994.</p><p>The Diabetes & Cardiovascular Global Business Unit will be led by Pascale Witz and will consist of Sanofi's diabetes care medicines as well as cardiovascular, which includes Praluent (alirocumab), which is currently under review by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Ms Witz is currently executive vice-president of global divisions and strategic development at Sanofi.</p><p>Sanofi Pasteur and Merial are both Global Business Units and will continue to manage their current portfolios of vaccines and animal health products. Olivier Charmeil will continue to lead Sanofi Pasteur and Carsten Hellmann will continue to lead Merial.</p><p>Similar to R&D and Industrial Affairs, all functions will be globalized to "better serve" the business units.</p><p>The composition of the executive committee remains unchanged. The leadership roles announced today are effective from 1 January 2016.</p><p>Mr Viehbacher's ignominious departure was blamed on the poor performance of its US diabetes franchise, weak oversight of local management and poor communication with Sanofi's board of directors. The move took &euro;18bn off Sanofi's market cap almost overnight. For Mr Brandicourt's sake, let's hope that with such a short timeframe between taking up the reins at Sanofi and announcing the reorganization, Mr Brandicourt has imparted his plans adequately to Sanofi chairman Serge Weinberg and the rest of Sanofi's board.</p>
