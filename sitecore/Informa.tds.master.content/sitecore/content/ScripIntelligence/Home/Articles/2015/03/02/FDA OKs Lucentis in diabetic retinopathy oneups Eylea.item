<p>The FDA has granted Roche unit Genentech the go-ahead to market Lucentis (ranibizumab injection) as a treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).</p><p>Lucentis is the first ocular medicine approved in the US for the condition, which affects about eight million Americans. It is the most common diabetic eye disease and the leading cause of new cases of blindness in working-age Americans. </p><p>The longer a person has diabetes, especially if it is poorly controlled, the higher their risk for developing diabetic retinopathy &ndash; with the eye condition eventually affecting nearly all diabetes patients.</p><p>Diabetic retinopathy is caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. In its early stages, patients often show no signs of symptoms. But if left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can lead to blindness. </p><p>Lucentis, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, is administered by a physician as an injection into the eye once a month. It is intended to be used along with appropriate interventions to control blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol.</p><p>Lucentis already is approved for three other indications: Wet age-related macular degeneration; macular edema following retinal vein occlusion; and diabetic macular edema, which is a common complication associated with diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>A competitor to Lucentis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Eylea (aflibercept), a fully human fusion protein, consisting of VEGF receptors 1 and 2, is approved for the same three indications.</p><p>But with the new approval, Lucentis has just one-upped Eylea.</p><p>The FDA in October 2014 had granted a priority review for Genentech's supplemental new drug application (sBLA) for Lucentis in the diabetic retinopathy in DME indication, which was submitted in August 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Genentechs-Lucentis-snags-priority-review-in-diabetic-retinopathy-354370" target="_new">9 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/RocheGenentech-eye-US-diabetic-retinopathy-market-for-Lucentis-353318" target="_new">8 August 2014</a>).</p><p>The drug also won the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation in the indication, which came late in Lucentis' development (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Genentechs-Lucentis-dubbed-breakthrough-in-diabetic-retinopathy-355701" target="_new">17 December 2014</a>).</p><p>The sBLA for Lucentis was based on Genentech's Phase III RISE and RIDE clinical trials, two identically-designed, parallel, double-masked, sham treatment-controlled studies involving 759 patients with diabetic retinopathy and DME at baseline who were randomized into three groups to receive monthly treatment with 0.3mg or 0.5mg of Lucentis or a sham injection. </p><p>The safety and efficacy of Lucentis in diabetic retinopathy was assessed over three years in patients with baseline diabetic retinopathy severity scores ranging from 10 to 75 in the study eye on the ETDRS diabetic retinopathy severity scale. </p><p>At 24 months, a higher proportion of patients had observed a three-step improvement or better of their disease compared to sham, as determined by color fundus photography.</p><p>In the third year of the studies, patients from the control group had the option to cross over to receive monthly treatment with 0.5mg of Lucentis.</p><p>Patients in the trial originally randomized to 0.3mg or 0.5mg Lucentis continued to receive the same dose, and all study participants were followed for 12 additional months.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
