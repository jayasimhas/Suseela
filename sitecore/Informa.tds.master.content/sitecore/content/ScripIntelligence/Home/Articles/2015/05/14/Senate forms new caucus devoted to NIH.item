<p>A group of Democratic and Republican senators on 19 May came together to form a new caucus focused solely on ensuring the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is able to fully meet its mission of supporting US biomedical research.</p><p>The new Senate NIH Caucus is being led by Senators Dick Durbin (Democrat-Illinois) and Lindsey Graham (Republican-South Carolina).</p><p>&ldquo;We have a job to do. That job is to come together in a bipartisan basis and do what Americans expect us to do . . . to find a way to fund this agency," said Senator Durbin. </p><p>The purpose of the caucus, Senator Graham said, is to "shine a light" on what NIH does and inform the American taxpayer that "this is a great return on investment," which he called "enormous."</p><p>The caucus, Senator Graham said, will "band together to stop these insane budget cuts" to the NIH.</p><p>"It would be incredibly dumb to stop all the research that the federal government helps jump start," the South Carolina Republican said. "The private sector and the public partnership under the NIH banner has been a great success story. This is where it all comes together."</p><p>The NIH, he said, has "one hell of a story to tell."</p><p>While there are a number of caucuses in the Senate, said Senator Jerry Moran (Republican-Kansas), "this can be one that is very valuable."</p><p>"This needs to be something more than symbolic support for resources, dollars for NIH. It needs to be a group of senators who work together with other senators to accomplish the goal," Senator Moran said. </p><p>NIH Director Dr Francis Collins said the new caucus has given the agency "such a sense of encouragement at a time when biomedical research has never been more exciting as it is right now, and yet the stress on the system in many people's memory has not been as difficult as it is right now &ndash; the strange paradox that we live in the middle of."</p><p>Dr Collins told the lawmakers he welcomes any chance to visit Capitol Hill to tell the NIH's "compelling story."</p><p>"I can't remember having a meeting with a member of Congress that I didn't feel good about it," the NIH chief said. </p><p>"NIH has so much to offer, so many promises, so much excitement and it's a great story. We just need to be sure that story can move forward at the pace that it really deserves to," he said. "But it is going to take resources, it is going to take commitment, and that's why I'm really delighted that this caucus is now coming to be."</p><p>Dr Collins said he hopes the "encouraging words" he's heard from lawmakers "can get translated into some action so that this amazing engine of discovery &ndash; the National Institutes of hope and Health &ndash; can really be unleashed."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
