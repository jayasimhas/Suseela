<p>Brace yourself for more action in India's highly competitive dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor market. Be it the vildagliptin versus sitagliptin tug-of-war or teneligliptin's price war cry or then second brand successes, there appears to be more in store in the space.</p><p>Market data for DPP-4 inhibitors in India reveals an interesting trend &ndash; the narrowing gap between vildagliptin and sitagliptin as a whole &ndash; though some experts claim that "representation issues" in data captured in some Indian states may be giving the former an edge.</p><p>First, the broad trend. The vildagliptin market was valued at about INR1.46bn ($22.9m) as against INR930m for sitagliptin as per MAT (moving annual total) data from IMS' secondary sales audit for June 2011. By June 2013, however, IMS (MAT) figures put the vildagliptin market at INR3.65bn, with the sitagliptin market at INR2.50bn and this, industry experts say, has further narrowed to around INR5.41bn (vildagliptin) and INR5.04bn (sitagliptin) in April (MAT) 2015.</p><p>In terms of percentages, sources suggest that MAT data from IMS' total sales audit (TSA) in May 2013 shows that vildagliptin accounted for about 52% of the DPP-4 inhibitor segment against 36% by sitagliptin. By May 2014, vildagiptin was down to 47% of the market as against 38% of sitagliptin as per IMS (MAT) data. May 2015 data now suggests that vildagliptin continues to have leadership position with a 44% share, but with sitagliptin close behind at 42%. </p><p>Industry experts also referred to how in May 2015, Novartis's Galvus (vildagliptin) apparently "beat" Merck & Co's Januvia (sitagliptin) in India restoring its lead surrendered back in October 2013.</p><p>MSD India, however, told <i>Scrip</i> that the "Januvia family" is the leading DPP-4 inhibitor brand with a brand share of 24.3% and a brand growth of 23% as per IMS (MAT) May 2015 data. </p><p>Some experts, however, told <i>Scrip</i> that the market dynamics changed significantly after the entry of Glenmark's cut-price generic version of Januvia and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride) in 2013. For all of 2012-13, the innovator product's growth rates appeared muted with flat sales on a month to month basis, but post launch by Glenmark, the former's sales too picked up sharply, the expert claimed. </p><p>It would probably be interesting to see where the DPP-4 inhibitor market heads here on, given that Glenmark's sitagliptin version will be off the market.</p><p>India's Supreme Court earlier <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-court-blocks-Glenmarks-cut-price-Januvia-expedites-patent-case-358443%5d" target="_new">blocked</a> any fresh manufacture by Glenmark of its cut-price version of Merck & Co's diabetes therapies Januvia and Janumet. The court, however, permitted existing stock of Glenmark's generic versions Zita and Zitamet, to be sold in the market which, the court order noted, "can take care of the current demand in the market for five to six months ie, September-November, 2015." </p><p>Last year, AstraZeneca had also <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-hauls-Glenmark-to-Indian-court-over-saxagliptin-351036%5d" target="_new">moved the Delhi High Court</a> against Glenmark over intellectual property rights issues concerning Onglyza (saxagliptin) in India. </p><h2>Linagliptin</h2><p>Significantly, other molecules too have made some gains. The indications are that linagliptin's market share in the DPP-4 inhibitor market has moved up from around 4% as per IMS (MAT) TSA data in May 2013 to 8% in May 2014. It has held steady at 8% in May 2015.</p><p>And the family-owned German multinational Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) may just be considering adding a new prong to build on its strong run in the segment.</p><p>BI is mulling the feasibility of a co-marketing alliance for Trajenta (linagliptin) and Trajenta Duo (linagliptin/metformin) - typically involving the launch of a second brand via a local partner - seemingly encouraged by the gains made by peers Novartis for Galvus and MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside of the US and Canada) for Januvia via similar arrangements in India. </p><p>"There is success seen by co-marketing with at least with one player by both Novartis and MSD. It is something we are looking at very closely," Boehringer Ingelheim India's managing director, Sharad Tyagi, told <i>Scrip</i> in a recent interaction. </p><p>Trajenta is currently ranked number three with a market share of 17% among the mono DPP-4 inhibitor brands as per IMS MAT data for April 2015, while Trajenta Duo, launched just last year, has a share of 2.2% as among fixed dose combination brands.</p><p>The BI India boss, though, indicated that decisions around co-marketing were always a "bit tricky" since you also have your own brand to build. </p><p>"The question is about having a brand share versus a molecule share. Lot of those things are being discussed at very senior levels in the organization," Mr Tyagi explained.</p><p>Novartis has a co-marketing arrangement with the Mumbai-based USV, which markets vildagliptin as Jalra and Jalra-M (vildagliptin/metformin), while Sun Pharma co-markets sitagliptin as Istavel and the sitagliptin +metformin combination under the brand name Istamet under its alliance with MSD.</p><p>The second-brand approach, some experts say, has been useful, opening up opportunities to go deeper into smaller towns and cities in India and also target the general physician with the newer molecules.</p><p>Last month AstraZeneca unveiled a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-unveils-second-brand-play-in-India-358707" target="_new">second-brand plan</a> with Dr Reddy's Laboratories for saxagliptin and its combination with metformin. </p><p>An earlier IMS white paper <i>Launch excellence in the diabetes market- Lessons from history</i> noted that in pharmerging markets, the importance of local knowledge means that "going it alone" may not be an effective strategy. </p><p>It referred to the "different approaches and outcomes" for Novartis and Merck in India via their co-marketing efforts and how local branding of the vildagliptin products as Jalra and Jalra-Met and a large sales force led to fast market penetration. </p><p>"In contrast, Merck did not capitalize on its first to-market position, but waited until after Novartis launched Galvus to increase its sales force. Eventually, three years after launching Januvia and more than two years after the Novartis/USV agreement, Merck partnered with Sun Pharma. This was too late to unseat Novartis's products, however," the IMS paper noted.</p><p>In 2011, Novartis's family of products had garnered 56% of the Indian DPP-IV market, compared with 34% for Merck&rsquo;s family of products, it said. Novartis was also reported to have partnerships with Emcure and Piramal (now Abbott) for vildagliptin in India. </p><p>Novartis, though, has a series of ongoing cases against a clutch of Indian firms concerning vildagliptin. Last year Novartis had been granted a "permanent injunction" <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Early-win-Novartis-wards-off-Indian-Galvus-contender-353387%5d" target="_new">order</a> prohibiting the Indian firm, Bajaj Healthcare, from commercializing its generic version of vildagliptin while its compound patent is in force. </p><h2>Teneligliptin</h2><p>Opinion, however, appears divided on the potential impact of the recent <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-pioneers-Mitsubishis-teneligliptin-in-India-358948%5d" target="_new">launch</a> of Glenmark's teneligliptin, a cut-price version of Mitsubishi Tanabe's Tenelia, via a dual-brand approach on the Indian DPP-4 inhibitor market. </p><p>Some industry experts claimed that with Glenmark's teneligliptin priced at INR19.90 ($0.31) per tablet, which is said to lower the daily cost of treatment for a diabetes patient by around 60% as compared to other gliptins, the heat is bound to be on the other players. </p><p>"It won't be easy for Big Pharma to compete at such price levels," an expert said.</p><p>An industry pundit, though, told <i>Scrip</i> that teneligliptin's pricing is unlikely to have a huge impact, given that Novartis's Galvus 50mg has been available at around similar price levels in India. The usual recommended dose of Galvus is 50mg twice daily (100mg daily dose) for monotherapy, though this could vary for combination therapy.</p><p>"I'm not sure if the pricing bit brings anything special to the market. What if a player that has a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor decides to slash the price of the former? The teneligliptin pricing story is unlikely to fly," the expert declared.</p><p>More teneligliptin versions are expected to follow suit in India, while the Indian firm, Intas, is also known to be developing anagliptin in type 2 diabetes.</p>
