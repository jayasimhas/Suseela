<p>Eli Lilly will try to overturn the German Court of Appeal's ruling that its vitamin regimen patent for Alimta (pemetrexed) will not be infringed when Actavis launches a dipotassium salt form of pemetrexed after the cancer drug's compound patent expires in Germany in December.</p><p>The appellate court ruling, which reversed an April 2014 decision from the Regional Court of Dusseldorf, was announced on 6 March &ndash; three days before a hearing scheduled for 9 March in the company's appeal of a UK High Court decision in May. That court said Lilly's vitamin regimen patent, which expires in 2021, would not be infringed by the launch of Actavis's alternative version of Alimta in the UK, France, Italy and Spain (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lilly-loses-UK-Alimta-patent-case-appeal-planned-351860" target="_new">16 May 2014</a>).</p><p>Lilly had better luck in the US where the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana upheld the company's vitamin regimen patent, which expires in 2022 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-wins-Alimta-patent-dispute-with-vitamin-argument-350987" target="_new">1 April 2014</a>). The US compound patent expires in 2017 for Alimta, a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that is approved to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mesothelioma. </p><p>Alimta generated $2.8bn in sales last year, making it Lilly's top-selling product after the company lost patent protection for Cymbalta (duloxetine) for which sales fell 68% from $5.1bn in 2013 to $1.6bn in 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-EARNINGS-Is-2015-Lillys-turning-point-356476" target="_new">31 January 2015</a>). Lilly reported $1.23bn in US Alimta sales last year and $1.56bn in ex-US sales for the lung cancer drug.</p><p>Lilly's EU vitamin regimen patent was upheld by the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office (EPO), but an appeal is pending before the EPO's Technical Board of Appeal. </p><p>"Although Alimta's compound patent remains in force and is expected to provide exclusivity in Germany through December 2015, we continue to believe that Alimta's vitamin regimen patent would be infringed by the entry of generic pemetrexed products, including alternative salt forms, in Europe prior to June 2021. We will seek permission to appeal this ruling to the German Supreme Court," Lilly general counsel Michael Harrington said in a statement.</p><p>The company's stock closed down 3.1% at $68.41 per share on 6 March. Lilly shares are trading in the middle of the company's $56.81 to $75.10 one-year range. Lilly's market cap is $72.6bn.</p><p><p><p><p>
