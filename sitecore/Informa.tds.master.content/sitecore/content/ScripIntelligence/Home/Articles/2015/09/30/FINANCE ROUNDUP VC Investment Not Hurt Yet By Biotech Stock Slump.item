<p>Neon Therapeutics launched its immunotherapy platform with $55m in Series A venture capital, exceeding recent investments in several other private therapeutics companies, including a diabetes drug developer on its fifth round of funding.</p><p>Neon's focus on the hot cancer immunotherapy field rose to the top in a recent spate of VC fundraising announcements, but Elcelyx Therapeutics disclosed a still impressive $40m Series E round to fund its Phase IIb clinical trial for metformin delayed-release (metformin DR). And with venture capital still pouring into private biotechnology companies despite a slump in biotech stocks, Fidelity Biosciences sharpened its focus on early-stage funding for innovative companies.</p><p>Fidelity Biosciences and Devonshire Investors' technology venture capital group joined together to become F-Prime Capital, providing a single name for the venture capital funds of FMR LLC, the parent company of Fidelity investments, the firms announced jointly on Oct. 5. </p><p>The consolidation of VC teams is meant to "clarify our mission as a venture capital investor in private companies apart from Fidelity Investments' mutual fund business," F-Prime managing partner Stephen Knight said in a statement regarding the combined VC venture's launch.</p><p>The F-Prime Capital teams have invested in more than 89 technology and life science companies during the past 15 years and "will carry on our mission of partnering with leading entrepreneurs and top academics to build great companies," Knight said.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Will-VC-Be-Last-Man-Standing-If-Biotech-Bubble-Bursts-360716" target="_new">Venture capital investment seems to be unscathed</a>, so far, by the recent decline in biotech stocks that's been fueled by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">concerns about drug pricing</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/TPP-Missed-Opportunity-Or-Unprecedented-Assault-360838" target="_new">international intellectual property</a> and other industry issues, all of which contributed to a 3.77% drop in the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) on Oct. 6 versus a 0.69% decline in the broader Nasdaq index.</p><p>It's probably too early in the biotech stock slump for VC firms to begin holding off on drug development investments &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Despite-Headwinds-US-IPOs-Show-Few-Signs-Of-Slowing-In-Q3-360806" target="_new">not even biotech IPOs have been hit yet</a> by the NBI's continued decline &ndash; but quarterly venture capital data will be important numbers to watch during the next few quarters, especially since biotech VC investment reached <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-VC-deals-have-best-ever-quarter-2.3bn-359519" target="_new">a new high during the second quarter of 2015</a>. </p><p>The table below describes Neon's Series A funding round as well as other recent VC and private equity biotech investments.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Investors</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Use Of Proceeds</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Neon Therapeutics;</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Clal Biotechnology Industries, Access Industries and Third Rock Ventures backed a $55m Series A venture capital round to establish Neon, which is developing therapeutic vaccines and T cell therapies that recognize and attack cancer via targeting proteins known as neoantigens, which result from mutations that occur during tumor growth.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Neon's interim CEO Cary Pfeffer said the company will "develop therapies that are complimentary to current immunomodulatory therapies and may significantly enhance the specificity and potency of existing approaches."
