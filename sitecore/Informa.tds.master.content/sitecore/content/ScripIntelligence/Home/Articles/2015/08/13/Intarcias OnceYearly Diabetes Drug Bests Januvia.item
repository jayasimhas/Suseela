<p>Will positive Phase III results for ITCA 650 versus Merck & Co.'s <i>Januvia</i> (sitagliptin) allow Intarcia Therapeutics to convince payers that its once- or twice-yearly diabetes medicine should be a first choice therapy for patients who fail to control their glucose with metformin?</p><p>ITCA 650 nearly doubled the glucose reduction and tripled the weight loss experienced by patients with type 2 diabetes compared with diabetics who received Januvia in the first head-to-head study for Boston-based Intarcia's product candidate, which delivers the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide through an under-the-skin osmotic pump. Following approval of ITCA 650, potentially in 2017, Intarcia chairman, president and CEO Kurt Graves said the company hopes these and other data will turn payers into the product's biggest fans.</p><p><b>Payers Paying Attention</b></p><p>"Typically, injectable medicines aren't used after metformin failure; they're used third or fourth line. We've come up with a therapy that's a completely different option early in the disease," Graves told <i>Scrip</i>. "We're not going to replace metformin &ndash; which is always first, because it's oral and generic &ndash; but metformin doesn't work alone in the majority of people. With an injection-free, once-a-year GLP-1 agonist, we have a new proposition that doctors will be interested to use earlier after metformin failure."</p><p>In Intarcia's discussions with payers, the company has heard that if diabetes isn't the most expensive disease for payers in terms of health care costs, it's at least among the top two. And when 70% to 80% of patients stop adhering to diabetes drug regimens within the first year of obtaining prescriptions for new medicines, non-compliance leads to bigger, more expensive diabetes-related health concerns.</p><p>That's why Intarcia is in the middle of planning a four-arm, head-to-head clinical trial that tests both the efficacy of ITCA 650 and the product's ability to help patients adhere to treatment regimen versus three other types of diabetes drugs. The company hasn't announced the timing for its two-year trial testing ITCA 650 versus a DPP-4 inhibitor, a sulfonylurea and an SGLT2 inhibitor, but the results of FREEDOM-2 will inform the study's design.</p><p>"If we continue to show head-to-head superiority, we hope we can get payers to be some of our biggest advocates," Graves said.</p><p><b>FREEDOM-2 Results</b></p><p>Intarcia reported top-line results from placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Phase-III-diabetes-data-give-Intarcia-and-doctors-patients-options-354273" target="_new">FREEDOM-1 and FREEDOM-1 HBL in October</a> and revealed detailed results in June at the 75th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA).</p><p>And after disclosing top-line data on Aug. 19 from the Phase III FREEDOM-2 trial versus Januvia, the company is ready to submit applications for regulatory approvals during the first half of 2016. Data from the 4,000-patient cardiovascular outcomes study FREEDOM-CVO are expected in time for the filings. Intarcia will submit detailed results from FREEDOM-2 for publication in medical journals and presentation at diabetes conferences. </p><p>The Phase III trial enrolled 535 adults with HbA1c glucose levels between 7.5% and 10.5% who also were taking metformin during the course of the 52-week study. Patients were given 60mcg of ITCA 650 per day by a pump under their skin plus an oral placebo or they received 100mg of once-daily oral Januvia and an implanted pump filled with a placebo.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c at week 52, which was -1.5% in ITCA 650 arm of the study and -0.8% for patients treated with Januvia (p<0.001). in="" terms="" of="" secondary="" endpoints,="" weight="" loss="" during="" that="" time="" was="" -4kg="" with="" itca="" 650="" and="" -1.3kg="" with="" januvia=""></0.001).><0.001).></0.001).></p><p>Sagient Research's Aug. 19 BioMedTracker analysis of the top-line FREEDOM-2 data noted that the 0.7% reduction in HbA1c relative to Januvia was in line with the difference between Januvia and other GLP-1 agonists in previous studies: -0.6% for Novo Nordisk's once-daily <i>Victoza</i> (liraglutide) injection and -0.7% for Eli Lilly & Co.'s once-weekly <i>Trulicity</i> (dulaglutide). The 2.7kg weight loss difference in FREEDOM-2 was a slight improvement over the 2.4kg difference in weight loss between Victoza and Januvia. </p><p><b>Secondary Endpoints </b></p><p>In terms of other secondary endpoints in FREEDOM-2, a significant number of ITCA 650 patients versus people treated with Januvia achieved a greater than 0.5% HbA1c reduction as well as weight loss of at least 2kg. The difference between ITCA 650 and Januvia also was significant with regard to patients who achieved ADA-recommended HbA1c levels of less than 7%. ITCA 650 was superior to Januvia on both endpoints.</p><p>Overall and gastrointestinal adverse events were described as similar to results seen in prior Phase III studies with treatment discontinuations due to nausea in the low single digits. There were no major hypoglycemia incidents and minor hypoglycemia rates were in the low single digits in both arms of the study. Placement and removal of ITCA 650 was well tolerated with minor infections at the placement site observed in less than 1% of patients.</p><p>FREEDOM-2 investigator Robert R. Henry, chief of endocrinology and metabolism for the Veteran's Administration and a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, described ITCA 650 as "a viable alternative to regular life-long injections" that could improve patient compliance to diabetes therapy regimens, "which has been a long-standing, unresolved problem and a major contributing cause of poor glycemic control over time."</p><p><b>Preparing For Launch</b></p><p>Intarcia has enough cash either on hand or expected from its ex-US partner Servier and existing investors to fund the company's operations through potential US FDA approval and early commercialization of ITCA 650. Intarcia has raised more than $1bn in private capital during the past five years and received $171m up front in November under its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intarcia-boosts-private-cash-with-1bn-plus-Servier-deal-355035" target="_new">$1bn-plus agreement with Servier</a>.</p><p>Following the $410m in private equity and debt that Intarcia raised in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Intarcia-on-cloud-nine-after-210m-private-funding-for-once-yearly-exenatide-implant-337286" target="_new">2012</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/200m-gets-private-Intarcia-to-diabetes-finish-line-350989" target="_new">2014</a>, the company closed a royalty financing agreement with multiple investors in April that raised $225m initially and grew to $300m when the deal was expanded in June. The investors are entitled to a 2% royalty on ITCA 650 sales, but they have an option to convert their royalty interest into shares of Intarcia.</p><p>The company will consider a range of private and potentially public options for raising capital soon after ITCA 650's commercial launch, Graves said.</p><p><p><p><p>
