<p>Head of Cipla's India operations Sameer Goel has resigned barely a year after joining the company.</p><p>After roping in a senior leadership team from global corporations over the last two years, India's leading drug maker Cipla has seen its first high profile executive exit. Mr Goel, who was brought in to lead Cipla's India operations from  GlaxoSmithKline's South Africa business <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-Consumers-Goel-to-lead-Ciplas-India-business-Biocon-marketing-chief-departs-349066" target="_new">in January 2014</a>, has quit the organization.</p><p>Cipla confirmed the development to <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> noting Mr Goel left the company citing personal reasons.</p><p>"Whilst he was with the company he played an important role in building the leadership team in the business and Cipla is grateful for his contribution to the India business," the company said, but did not disclose who will succeed Mr Goel post his departure.</p><h2>Big Setback?</h2><p>Mr Goel was seen as one of the senior team members mandated to steer the Indian drug maker, which has had aggressive growth rates, as part of an overall makeover exercise to catch up with local generic peers like Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Lupin. </p><p>When he joined Cipla in January 2014, Cipla managing director and CEO Subhanu Saxena said, "This appointment signals the continuation of Cipla's strategy of strengthening the highly experienced senior management team and to show our strong determination to increase the market share in India."</p><p>Before joining Cipla, Mr Goel had served at GSK for 26 years and was located at its Johannesburg office managing the Sub-Saharan Africa business in 44 markets and a portfolio worth $0.4bn.</p><p>Although the exact reasons for Mr Goel's exit in a short span of a little over a year could not be ascertained, sources said the top executive may have encountered issues related to adjusting to Indian market conditions.</p><p>Cipla is competing in India to be in the top bracket of Indian and multinational companies, which has been acknowledged as a challenging task by experts. According to the latest February report from market research agency AIOCD PharmaTrac, Cipla was ranked number three behind Abbott and Sun Pharma with a market share of 5.29% and growth rate of 24%, calculated on the basis of moving annual turnover.</p><p>But as local biggies Sun Pharmaceutical and Ranbaxy Laboratories have integrated into a single entity, Cipla will face increasing pressure to perform.</p><p>At the time of joining Cipla, Mr Goel had made apparent his ambitions for a long term association with his new employer. He had said, "My first interaction with the Cipla management has been quite a memorable experience that has given me reassurance and a sense of comfort. It will be a great privilege and honor for me to be a part of the Cipla team and I look forward to an exciting journey that lies ahead of us."</p><p>Meanwhile, Murali Neelakantan, global general counsel at Cipla, has also reportedly left the organization recently.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/5/cipla-india-head-sameer-goel-quits?elsca1=pan&elsca2=newsltr" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p>
