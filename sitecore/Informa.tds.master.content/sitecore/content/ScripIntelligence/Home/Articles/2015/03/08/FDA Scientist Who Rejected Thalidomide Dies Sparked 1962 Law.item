<p>The former FDA scientist who refused to approve thalidomide as a sedative in 1960 &ndash; an outcome that likely prevented US babies from being born with the same types of birth defects later linked to the drug in children in Europe, Africa, Canada and other parts of the world &ndash; has died.</p><p>Dr. Frances O. Kelsey, who was 101 when she passed away on Aug. 7, rejected the application from drug maker Richardson Merrill for thalidomide after raising concerns about the compound's safety and insisted more data were needed before the FDA could let the product enter the US market.</p><p>Physicians in Europe, Canada and Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s had prescribed the drug to treat insomnia, anxiety and morning sickness in pregnant women.</p><p>But in 1961, reports started to surface connecting thalidomide to severe birth defects, such as missing or "flipper-like" arms and legs, the FDA said on its website.</p><p>According to the March of Dimes, thalidomide was linked to severe birth defects in more than 10,000 babies.</p><p>Dr. Kelsey's persistence and grit, the FDA said, helped breathe new life into legislation that sought to require manufacturers for the first time to provide evidence through adequate and well-controlled trials their drugs were safe and effective.</p><p>Those measures were put in place when the legislation, known as the <i>Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the 1938 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</i>, was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-drug-efficacy-law-revolutionized-FDA-but-came-with-growing-pains-335664" target="_new">enacted in October 1962</a>.</p><p>The bill also gave the FDA 180 days to evaluate new drug applications and the authority to require an affirmative decision before the medicine could be marketed. </p><p>Under <i>Kefauver-Harris</i>, drug makers also were required for the first time to maintain records of adverse events associated with their products and promptly report them to the FDA.</p><p>Dr. Kelsey was awarded the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service &ndash; the highest civilian honor for US federal workers &ndash; by President John F. Kennedy for standing strong against pressure to approve thalidomide and inspiring the 1962 law.</p><p>The FDA in 2010 named an award after her &ndash; the Dr. Frances O. Kelsey Award for Excellence and Courage in Protecting Public Health &ndash; bestowing the first one on its namesake.</p><p>Even though thalidomide became the world's most notorious drug &ndash; banned worldwide &ndash; Celgene was able to revive the medicine as a treatment for erythema nodosum leprosum, a complication of leprosy resulting in painful skin lesions, and market the product under the brand-name Thalomid in the US beginning in 1998 under a tightly restricted distribution program.</p><p>Thalomid also is approved in the US in combination with dexamethasone to treat patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
