<p>Hospira and Pfenex have agreed to co-develop PF582, a biosimilar for Lucentis (ranibizumab) &ndash; a blockbuster treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other ophthalmic indications &ndash; less than a week after Pfizer said it would buy Hospira for $17bn.</p><p>Lake Forrest, Illinois-based Hospira's generic injectable medicines business will add immediate value to Pfizer's portfolio when the acquisition closes in the second half of 2015, but the company also is one of the most active biosimilar developers in the world with a growing portfolio (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wheres-the-value-in-Pfizers-17bn-Hospira-buy-356578" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 February 2015</a>). With PF582, Hospira will add a biosimilar for a product that generated $4.1bn in 2014 sales for Roche and Novartis.</p><p><b>Added value for Pfenex</b></p><p>Hospira will pay San Diego-based Pfenex $51m up front and up to $291m in milestone fees plus tiered, double-digit royalties to co-develop Pfenex's lead product candidate and its only biosimilar in clinical testing. The company already is running a Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial to assess safety and tolerability of PF582 and determine whether it is biosimilar to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor Lucentis. </p><p>Pfenex and Hospira will share Phase III trial costs, although Pfenex's expenses related to the study will be capped at $20m and $10m of that will be deferred until commercialization of PF582. Hospira will be responsible for manufacturing and marketing of the biosimilar.</p><p>"We view the coming year as extremely formative for Pfenex, with the potential for clinical data from multiple products and additional corporate and government collaborations, which could infuse additional non-dilutive capital into the company as well as material increases in the level of awareness of the biosimilar commercial opportunity," William Blair analyst John Sonnier wrote in a 10 February report.</p><p>Pfenex, which went public at $6 per share in July, closed up 15.9% versus the prior day on 10 February (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/TABLE-Four-IPOs-launch-in-tough-market-five-in-queue-353057" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 26 July 2014</a>). The company's stock spiked to $9.88 following the Hospira deal announcement, but settled at $8 per share. </p><p>Pfenex said its agreement with Hospira allows for additional product collaborations, but no details were provided. Pfenex has six biosimilars in preclinical development and PF688, a biosimilar for UCB's arthritis and Crohn's disease treatment Cimzia (certolizumab pegol), is the only one left without a development partner. </p><p>Hospira has biosimilars for two arthritis blockbusters in development in partnership with Celltrion, but neither is a copy of Cimzia. One of them, a biosimilar for Remicade (infliximab), is approved and has been launched in the EU. </p><p>"We are excited to be entering this collaboration with Pfenex for its biosimilar candidate to Lucentis, which we expect will expand Hospira's biosimilars pipeline to include a new therapeutic area," Hospira chief scientific officer Sumant Ramachandra said in a statement. "We look forward to working closely with the Pfenex team to offer patients, physicians and healthcare systems a more affordable treatment option for retinal diseases."</p><p><b>AMD opportunity</b></p><p>Pressure is building in both the EU and in the US in relation to biologics approved to treat AMD and other severe ophthalmology indications (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AMD-drug-reimbursement-pressure-rising-in-US-353461" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 20 August 2014</a>).</p><p>At the same time, competition for what may become restricted dollars (or Euros) for AMD treatments is building. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals reported $1.74bn in 2014 US sales for its VEGF inhibitor Eylea (aflibercept), which beat Roche's $1.7bn in US Lucentis sales for the first time (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Regenerons-Eylea-overtakes-Lucentis-with-2014-US-sales-356689" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 11 February 2015</a>). However, Novartis's $2.4bn in ex-US sales for Lucentis in 2014 outpaced Bayer Healthcare's $1bn in Eylea sales outside of the US.</p><p>A biosimilar Lucentis could eat into the sales of the Roche and Novartis biologic as well as Regeneron's and Bayer's revenue from Eylea, and Pfenex believes that it has the most advanced Lucentis biosimilar in development. Enrollment in the Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial for PF582 is complete and a Phase III trial is expected to begin in 2016.</p><p>Russia, India, Argentina, parts of Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe are not limited by patents for Lucentis and $65m worth of the biologic was sold in those regions in 2013, according to IMS Health data. Patents expire in the second quarter of 2018 in Canada, Mexico, China, South Africa and a few other markets that generated a combined $471m in Lucentis sales in 2013.</p><p>However, Lucentis patents don't expire until the second quarter of 2020 in the US and Australia, which were responsible for $2bn in 2013 sales. EU patents expire in January 2022, putting $1.7bn in sales (as of 2013) at risk.</p>
