<p>The same short-seller that smacked Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. last month with a report exposing the firm's relationship with specialty pharmacies used only a tweet on Nov. 9 to whack its next victim, hedge-fund favorite Mallinckrodt PLC, whose shares plummeted 26%, before closing at $58.01, down $11.88, or 17% &ndash; demonstrating again the power of social media on stock prices.</p><p>In its Nov. 9 tweet, Citron Research, run by Andrew Left, called Mallinckrodt a "far worse offender" of the reimbursement system than Valeant.</p><p>Citron pointed to Mallinckrodt's prices &ndash; insisting the firm has significantly more downside than Valeant, which it said "can't live in a vacuum."</p><p>It's unclear what dirt, if any, Citron may have on Mallinckrodt, but it said there was "more to follow," although it didn't say when.</p><p>A spokesperson for Mallinckrodt told <i>Scrip</i> the company "generally does not respond to market speculation." </p><p>"That said, we are fully confident in our business model and remain focused on executing on our long-term growth strategy," the spokesperson said.</p><p>Like Valeant and other specialty pharmas, such as Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, Mallinckrodt is known for buying older drugs and raising their prices, as it did with HP Acthar Gel (repository corticotropin injection), which it obtained when it acquired Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. in August 2014.</p><p>Acthar, an adrenocorticotropic hormone analogue, was initially approved in the US in 1952.</p><p>The drug is indicated as monotherapy to treat infantile spasms in infants and children under 2 years and for exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults. Acthar also is approved for other disorders and diseases, such as rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic states, ophthalmic, respiratory and edematous state, according to the drug's labeling.</p><p>But it was Questcor that had initially raised the wholesale acquisition cost of Acthar significantly long before Mallinckrodt was even in the picture &ndash; spiking it in 2007 from about $2,000 per vial to about $23,000.</p><p>The drug reportedly now costs about $35,000 per vial.</p><p>While Citron has yet to reveal what it may have uncovered about Mallinckrodt that sparked the Nov. 9 tweet, its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">Oct. 21 report</a>, in which it accused Valeant of conspiring with specialty pharmacies to create "phantom accounts, sent shares of the drug company spiraling down 40%, with other firms in the sector, like Allergan PLC and Horizon Pharma PLC, also feeling the pain that day.</p><p>Citron questioned whether Valeant was the pharmaceutical version of Enron Corp. &ndash; the scandal-ridden company that became emblematic of corporate fraud and corruption and was what triggered the financial reforms under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</p><p>The Citron report triggered BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. analyst Alex Arfaei to ask "What else is out there that we don't know" about Valeant, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-Else-Dont-We-Know-May-Spread-Beyond-Valeant-361194" target="_new">further panicked investors</a>, who drove shares of the company down another 20% on Oct. 22. </p><p>After days of providing few answers to a lot of unanswered questions, Valeant on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">Oct. 26 finally explained</a> the details about its relationship with Philidor Rx Services, which it has since broken ties with.</p><p>Valeant plans another follow-up call on Nov. 10.</p><p>The Canadian firm already is being investigated for its price increases by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">federal prosecutors</a> in Massachusetts and New York and by lawmakers on Capitol Hill &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah Cummings</a> in one probe and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Claire McCaskill</a> (D-MO) in another.</p><p>But Valeant is not alone.</p><p>Most recently, Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly and Co. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-Drug-Pricing-Probes-Merck-Lilly-Targeted-361421" target="_new">revealed</a> they, too, are under investigation for their pricing practices, as is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">Turing</a>.</p><p>It was a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">tweet on Sept. 21</a> by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accusing Turing of price gouging after it raised the cost of its toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim (pyrimethamine) by about 5,500% that sent shock waves through Wall Street &ndash; with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index immediately dropping more than 2.5%, plunging further to 5.4%, before closing down 4.5%.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
