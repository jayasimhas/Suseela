<p>Christopher Viehbacher, ex-CEO of Sanofi, has been appointed as the managing partner of Waypoint Capital's US-based fund, Gurnet Point Capital. Waypoint is the investment vehicle of the Bertarelli family, former owners of Serono, which was sold to Merck KGaA of Germany in 2007 in a deal worth around &euro;10bn. Waypoint's chairman is Ernesto Bertarelli, the former CEO of Serono. </p><p>Founded in 2013 by Waypoint and Fereydoun Firouz (the former head of Merck Serono US), GPC has an initial allocation of US$2bn of capital to invest. The fund will support established healthcare and life science businesses "to accelerate growth and achieve their long-term vision," said GPC in a statement. </p><p>Mr Viehbacher has been tasked with growing the existing GPC team, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He joins from 1 July 2015. Mr Firouz is leaving GPC, having been appointed chairman and CEO designate of Ares Allergy, Waypoint's new global group of operating companies in the allergy immunotherapy sector.</p><p>"From the moment I first met Ernesto to discuss his vision for GPC, I knew we shared an outlook for an approach to investment that combines capital with know-how, and takes a global approach to seeking the best and most exciting opportunities," said Mr Viehbacher. "Science is progressing at an accelerating pace and the next few years will see a number of more transformative treatments, devices and technologies coming to market. I know Gurnet Point Capital will be at the heart of bringing those to patients, and I look forward to working with Ernesto and his team to make this happen."</p>
