<p><p>AstraZeneca's biologics arm MedImmune has tapped closely-watched biotech Juno Therapeutics, which has been creating buzz with its immune-activating cancer therapy, for a combination trial in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. </p><p>The pair announced 23 April that they will test a combination of one of Juno's CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell candidates and MedImmune's programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in a Phase I trial that is meant to test the combos safety, tolerability and efficacy. </p><p>The companies will co-fund the study, which is expected to begin later this year. The pair have said they will also test the MedImmune drug with another of Juno's CAR-T therapies. Financial details of the collaboration were not disclosed. </p><p>"We believe combination strategies such as this will help us better understand the full potential of our engineered T cell platform in both hematological and solid tumor settings," said Dr Mark W. Frohlich, executive VP of R&D at Juno.</p><p>The collaboration was the first tie-up for Juno, which has been holding on to its tech tightly since its <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-Update-Juno-has-biggest-2014-offering-as-investors-chase-CAR-T-stocks-355776" target="_new">$265m IPO last year</a>. Yet, combination therapies have become the norm with immuno-oncologics. Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb have been leading the charge with the first two approved PD-1 inhibitors. Both companies have been collecting partnerships as they try to find the combinations that will prove most effective. </p><p><p><p>
