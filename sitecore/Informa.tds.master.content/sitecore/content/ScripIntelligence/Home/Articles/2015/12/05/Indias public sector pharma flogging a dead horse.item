<p>Stop wasting public funds; privatize or perish; and the government has no business being in business, especially if the business is badly run. These appear to be common refrains of some experts on India's struggling public sector pharmaceutical firms &ndash; the bulk of which are sick.</p><p>First, their current status: Of the five functional public sector undertakings (PSUs) under India's department of pharmaceuticals, just one, Karnataka Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals, is profit-making, while Rajasthan Drugs and Pharmaceuticals reported losses for the first time in 2013-14. Three other firms &ndash; Hindustan Antibiotics, Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals &ndash; are sick and have been referred to India's Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). In addition two PSUs, Bengal Immunity and Smith Stanistreet Pharmaceuticals, have been shut.</p><p>Hindustan Antibiotics is still bleeding and a second rehabilitation plan envisages among other actions a sale of some portion of surplus land. In the case of Bengal Chemicals, a revival package was cleared by the Government in 2006 and about INR2.07bn ($32.4m) has been released as the "cash infusion" component. Things appear to be on the mend at the PSU with production, sales and gross margin during the last nine months of 2014-15 exceeding production and sales during the previous two financial years, details in a parliamentary panel's report presented to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, on 20 April, indicated.</p><p>Indian Drugs, which turned sick in 1992, was on course to be wound up after efforts to privatize the firm failed. However, the BIFR's winding up order was set aside and the matter remanded back for action for rehabilitation of the firm. A revised draft rehabilitation scheme, which is "self-financing" in nature, has since been submitted in January this year for the government's consideration.</p><p>The parliamentary panel, however, said that it was "unhappy" with the "slow pace" of progress to revive the sick PSUs in spite of their repeated recommendations in this regard. </p><p>"The committee once again reiterate its recommendation that the Department [of pharmaceuticals] should make vigorous efforts in coordination with all concerned to expedite the revival of the sick PSUs in time bound manner," the 31-member parliamentary standing committee on chemicals and fertilizers chaired by Anandrao Adsul said in its report. The panel also wants the revival of closed or sick PSUs be expedited to create bulk drugs capacity in India, making the country self-reliant.</p><h2>shut or privatize?</h2><p>But some experts have questioned the very rationale behind repeated efforts to revive sick PSUs &ndash; it's futile to throw more good money after bad is what they seem to suggest. </p><p>Dr Ajit Dangi, president and CEO of Danssen Consulting and a former director general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, which represents leading multinational firms, said that with over 10,000 pharmaceutical manufacturing units in India with spare production capacity, there is "no need" for the government to revive the sick pharma PSUs and get into manufacturing. </p><p>"As such India is the third largest manufacturer of quality medicines at affordable prices in volume terms in the world and availability is not an issue. The Drug Prices Control Order and intense competition have also kept medicine prices in check," Dr Dangi, a former president and executive director of Johnson &Johnson India, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He had tough words on why PSUs have failed to make the cut in the fragmented Indian market: "Incompetence, political interference, leadership having no or limited domain knowledge and lack of sales and marketing proficiency."</p><p>Dr Dangi believes models such as public private partnerships are short term measures and have "limited scope" in reviving these sick units. </p><p>"India's private sector is fully capable of producing good quality medicines at affordable prices and has earned the distinction of being the 'Pharmacy of the World.' There is no need to flog the dead horse and sick units should be closed down to stop wasting public money," he declared.</p><p>Others underscored that India has the lowest drug prices in the world, with the market catered to by private enterprises and since drug prices rose "nowhere to the level that the government expected them to rise to", investment in PSUs simply didn&rsquo;t make sense. </p><p>"Either due to this or the overall gross negligence of the government, the PSUs dwindled. But, nobody missed those companies," an expert with a foreign firm told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>He, though, does not believe that the PSUs are "dead", but rather that they have been rendered "dormant" by an "indifferent" government. </p><p>"The answer is to privatize these firms. With available infrastructure in the form of ready-to-make factories, private players will find it very attractive to infuse cash to upgrade them and begin manufacturing. All the government has to do is to get out of the business that it has no business being in, in the first place," he said.</p><p>Among the "good" infrastructure which can be upgraded and "taken advantage of" cited by the expert are Indian Drugs' two R&D sites and Bengal Chemicals' wide range of offerings including industrial chemicals, bulk drugs, hospital and surgical equipment, serums and vaccines.</p><p>"This infrastructure can be utilized well through upgradation and compliance with global regulatory norms. Of course, there is little incentive for the government to do this and it is best that these plants be privatized. Indian entrepreneurs or even multinationals looking to set up manufacturing facilities in India will gladly lap up these assets if put on sale," he added.</p><h2>China dependence</h2><p>But what about the China angle and India's growing dependence on its Asian neighbour for bulk drugs? </p><p>Dr Dangi is categorical that this cannot be resolved by reviving sick PSUs and getting into manufacturing but needs to be addressed by effective policy changes.</p><p>India is considering a specific <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-considers-bulks-policy-amid-Chinese-dependency-concerns-352652%5d" target="_new">bulk drugs policy</a> as part of efforts to revive domestic interest in the segment and mitigate any potential risk to the country's "medicine security" from the high dependence on Chinese raw materials by local firms. The Parliamentary panel noted that a committee mandated with studying the issue of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of critical importance and working out a package of interventions/concession required to build domestic production capabilities, had reportedly submitted its report.</p><p>The expert with the foreign firm, though, terms India's reliance on China for cheap bulk drugs as purely a "governmental mishap" and a "great example" of how two different parts of the same body fail to work in tandem. </p><p>He referred to how instead of ramping up local manufacturing capabilities to tackle the alleged "dumping" of cheap bulks from China, the government raised duties on the imports, which did nothing but drive up prices of the resultant finished products. A better option, he says, would have been to simplify the "bureaucratic maze" required to build more factories thus improving the supply required to meet burgeoning demand and "compensate the ease" by doing away with subsidies such as tax holidays and special economic zones. </p><p>"Despite the roll-back of these popular measures, private players might have readily invested capital to start factories. It would have been profitable for them to do so if they did not have to wait endlessly for 'babus' [a reference to bureaucrats] to give them licenses or pay bribes and the produce of the factory could generate cash," he added.</p><p>The Parliamentary panel has urged that the revival of closed/sick PSUs be expedited to create bulk drugs capacity in India, making the country self-reliant.</p>
