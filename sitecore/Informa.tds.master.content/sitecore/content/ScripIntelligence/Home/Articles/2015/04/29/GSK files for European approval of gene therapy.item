<p>GlaxoSmithKline has filed for approval to market a gene therapy in Europe. GSK2696273, developed with Italian scientists from Fondazione Telethon (Telethon) and Ospedale San Raffaele (OSR), is for the treatment of the ultra-rare disease adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (ADA-SCID) in patients for whom a suitable bone marrow donor cannot be found.</p><p>An estimated 14 children in Europe are born each year with ADA-SCID. A faulty gene inherited from both parents stops production of adenosine deaminase (ADA), which is particularly important for the formation of lymphocytes and a functioning immune system. Children born with ADA-SCID have an impaired ability to fight off everyday infections resulting in severe and life-threatening illness. They rarely survive beyond 1-2 years unless immune function is restored. </p><p>The European marketing application is based on results from 18 children treated with GSK2696273, 12 of who were enrolled in a pivotal clinical trial conducted at San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET). The first child was treated over 13 years ago and all patients are still alive. However, three of the 18 patients required either long term (>3 month) enzyme replacement therapy or follow up bone marrow transplant. No significant tolerability events considered related to the gene therapy or leukemic events have been reported to date. Plans to publish data supporting the regulatory filing in a scientific peer-reviewed journal are in progress.</p><p>GSK started working with Telethon and OSR in 2010. Since in-licensing the ADA-SCID gene therapy development program, GSK &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MolMed-and-GSK-sign-gene-therapy-deal-357416" target="_new">working with the biotechnology company MolMed</a> &ndash; has optimized, characterized and validated both the vector and cell manufacturing methods. GSK also led regulatory plans, with support from TIGET investigators, to develop the marketing application by following standards described in the European Union for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products. If approved, the gene therapy will first be made available at OSR in Milan, Italy with GSK as the marketing authorization holder.</p><p>While ADA-SCID is the lead program under the GSK/OSR/Telethon collaboration, under the terms of the agreement, GSK has exclusive options to develop six further applications of <i>ex vivo</i> stem cell therapy, using the gene transfer technology developed by TIGET scientists. GSK has already exercised its option to develop two further programs in rare diseases called metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), which are both currently in clinical trials.</p><p>Gene therapy continues to enjoy mixed press, with the field littered with many failures and the occasional baby step forward. </p><p>Celladon's stock sank last week on news that its Phase III-stage gene therapy to treat heart failure failed to meet primary and secondary endpoints.</p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celladons-CUPID-wont-kill-gene-therapy-358080" target="_new">Celladon's CUPID won't kill gene therapy</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-UniQures-guile-and-the-dubious-promise-of-gene-therapy-357864" target="_new">Stockwatch: UniQure's guile and the dubious promise of gene therapy</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/PROFILE-Paula-Salmikangas-chair-of-the-EMAs-Advanced-Therapies-Committee-on-handicrafts-berry-picking-and-the-first-gene-therapy-357589" target="_new">PROFILE: Paula Salmikangas, chair of the EMA's Advanced Therapies Committee, on handicrafts, berry-picking and the first gene therapy</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Genzyme-commits-100m-upfront-for-Voyagers-gene-therapy-expertise-in-CNS-356709" target="_new">Genzyme commits $100m upfront for Voyager's gene therapy expertise in CNS</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Biogens-Danos-on-why-now-is-gene-therapys-time-356610" target="_new">INTERVIEW: Biogen's Danos on why now is gene therapy's time</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-will-make-waves-in-gene-therapy-says-head-of-biomedical-research-356515" target="_new">Novartis will make waves in gene therapy, says head of biomedical research</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Spark-to-IPO-to-fund-first-US-gene-therapy-approval-355927" target="_new">Spark to IPO to fund 'first US gene therapy approval'</a></p><p>
