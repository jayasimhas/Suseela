<p>IPO-bound Syngene, the research services arm of India's Biocon, expects to evolve into a contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) organisation with commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>With several client programmes moving up the development phase, Syngene believes it has gained the necessary process knowledge and experience for these molecules. </p><p>"We believe this would typically make us a partner of choice to manufacture developmental batches and large-scale commercial supplies of these molecules if and when they are commercialised," Syngene said its draft prospectus for its initial public offering. </p><p>Biocon said that on 22 April Syngene filed a draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for a proposed public issue of equity shares through the 100% book building method. </p><p>Syngene, which currently makes developmental batches of small and large molecules to support clinical trials for clients, has recently entered into a long-term contract with an existing client for commercial manufacture of a novel small molecule active pharmaceuticals ingredient (API), currently in late-stage development. </p><p>In addition to a greenfield commercial-scale facility to manufacture novel small molecules for innovator companies in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and other industrial sectors is coming up in Mangaluru, Syngene has also expanded its current small-molecule facilities in Bengaluru to meet the interim requirements of clients. </p><p>For the nine months ended December 2014, Syngene serviced 195 clients ranging from start-ups to multinational firms, including seven of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies by sales for 2014, details in the draft prospectus said. Syngene also has multidisciplinary partnerships, each with a dedicated research centre, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Abbott and Baxter. </p><h2>IPO details</h2><p>Biocon expects to sell up to 22 million equity shares through the Syngene IPO, including a reservation of two million shares for subscription by Biocon's shareholders.</p><p>It expects to raise around INR6bn ($95.4m) via the offer, agency reports said. </p><p>"The listing is about monetizing Biocon's stake in Syngene and to give Syngene a life of its own," Biocon's chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw was reported as saying. </p><p>A listing around July is likely subject to regulatory approvals.</p><p>For the nine months ended December 2014, Syngene reported revenues INR6.17bn and restated profits of INR1.19bn.</p><p>Some analysts were reported as saying that Syngene's return ratios were superior to those of China's WuXi PharmaTech.</p><p>Last year, the Mauritius-based investment vehicle Silver Leaf Oak <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Silver-Leaf-picks-up-10-in-IPO-bound-Syngene-354043%5d" target="_new">picked up 10%</a> in Syngene for INR3.8bn (then $62.4m), valuing the IPO-bound Syngene at INR38bn. </p><p>The Silver Leaf deal came close on the heels of <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biocon-buys-back-GE-holding-in-IPO-bound-Syngene-353801%5d" target="_new">Biocon buying back</a> 7.69% in Syngene from a subsidiary of GE Capital for about INR2.15bn. </p>
