<p>Two frontline Indian firms, Cipla and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, have announced top level management appointments, with the former drawing from the latter's talent pool.</p><p>The Mumbai-based Cipla said on Sept. 2 that it had roped in Umang Vohra as its global chief financial and strategy officer and Prabir Jha as global chief people officer effective Oct. 1, 2015.</p><p>Vohra was previously with Dr Reddy's Laboratories as head of the North America business, while Jha, who has had stints as chief human resources officer in Dr Reddy's and Tata Motors, was mostly recently with Reliance Industries. </p><p>In addition to the finance role in Cipla, Vohra will be responsible for strategy, portfolio, business development, mergers and acquisitions and business technology. Vohra was seen as instrumental in driving growth of Dr Reddy's North American business, which constitutes almost half the Hyderabad-based firm's revenues, through business development partnerships, acquisitions as well as growing the oncology health system business.</p><p>Jha will, in addition to providing leadership to the human resources function globally at Cipla, lead the corporate communications and administration functions. </p><p>Late last month, Dr Reddy's said that Alok Sonig, executive vice president and head India generics, will replace Vohra while MV Ramana, executive vice president (emerging markets), will hold additional charge as executive vice president and head branded markets (India and emerging countries).</p><p>Earlier, another local firm, Aurobindo Pharma, appointed senior ex-Ranbaxy executive, Sanjeev Dani, as chief operating officer and head formulations of the company effective July 9. Dani's appointment came after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Musical-chairs-as-Novartis-UK-exec-becomes-Cipla-CEO-Glenmark-COO-moves-to-Aurobindo-337476" target="_new">Arvind Vasudeva</a>, Aurobindo's CEO (formulations) since 2012, resigned effective June 30, 2015. </p><h2>Cipla US </h2><p>Significantly, Vohra's appointment comes at a time when Cipla is believed to be keen to scale up its US business, amid some speculation that the firm may be eyeing an acquisition there.</p><p>Cipla, which has launched its first set of own label products in the US including amlodipine, meloxicam and valaciclovir, had at the time of its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Generic-Nexium-Lifts-Cipla-In-Q1-Amid-Respiratory-Build-Up-359964" target="_new">first quarter results</a> announcement in August maintained that its US "go-live" plans have been on track as per plan. </p><p>Speculation is now rife that Indian peer Hetero Drugs may be exploring the option of roping in a strategic partner for its US business, with Cipla rumoured to be among those in the fray. Hetero, however, told <i>Scrip</i> that it does not comment "either on strategic partner discussions or market speculations."</p><p>Cipla's managing director and global CEO <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-Chief-Dont-Dilute-Indias-Patent-Laws-360155%5d" target="_new">Subhanu Saxena</a> recently underscored that Cipla expects more than 70% of its growth to be via the organic route and that the firm was not compelled to do any mega deals. "When we look at investments, we ask ourselves: Are we the better owner of an asset and can we add value? And if it meets our stringent criteria, only then we will consider investment," Saxena said at a press interaction following the firm's annual general meeting recently. Cipla has, over the recent past, been speculated to be eyeing UCB's Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals. </p>
