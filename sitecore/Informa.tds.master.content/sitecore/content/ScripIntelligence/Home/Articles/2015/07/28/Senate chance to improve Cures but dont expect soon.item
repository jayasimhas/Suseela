<p>Legislation the House adopted earlier this month &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; was a good start towards modernizing the US medical product development system, but the Senate needs to include other measures in its bill aimed at keeping the nation competitive and protecting innovation from overly burdensome regulations, the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC), a Washington think tank, said in a new report.</p><p>For instance, BPC urged the Senate to take up a provision giving the FDA the authority to create a new class of drugs known as "dormant therapies" &ndash; agents with insufficient patent protection that do not contain active ingredients already approved in the US.</p><p>The House had considered a similar measure for its bill, offered up by Representative Leonard Lance (Republican-New Jersey), dubbed the <i>MODDERN Cures Act</i>, but lawmakers left the provision out of the legislation that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">adopted</a> by the chamber on 10 July in a 344-77 vote.</p><p>BPC said the Senate legislation is another chance to take up the measure.</p><p>While Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), lead author of the Cures bill, has been insisting for weeks a Senate companion bill would be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Cures-aint-law-yet-Senate-concurrence-may-be-tricky-359391" target="_new">ready before Congress' August recess</a> &ndash; or September at the latest &ndash; Senator Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee), chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, told reporters on 27 July a bill from his chamber is unlikely to be unveiled until at least November, if not December.</p><p>Nonetheless, Senator Alexander said he anticipated some form of the legislation to be adopted by the Senate early next year, which would then need to go to conference with the House bill.</p><p>To help clarify what would be needed in the Senate legislation &ndash; Healthier Americans &ndash; Senators Alexander and Patty Murray (Democrat-Washington), ranking member on the HELP Committee, asked for some input from BPC, which already had launched an initiative in March aimed at developing "viable" policy options intended to reduce the time and cost associated with the discovery, development and delivery of safe and effective drugs and devices.</p><p>The <a href="http://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BPC-Advaning-Medical-Innovation.pdf" target="_new">report</a> BPC issued on 27 July, <i>Advancing Medical Innovation for a Healthier America</i>, was part of that effort, explained Senator Frist, a senior fellow at the think tank and a physician by training.</p><p>Most of BPC's recommendations are nothing lawmakers haven't already heard on Capitol Hill, either during hearings convened by the House while it was developing the Cures bill or by the Senate.</p><p>Indeed, BPC even released a table outlining what from its recommendations either matched the Cures legislation or failed to make it in that bill &ndash; urging the Senate to take up about 50 measures not included in the House legislation.</p><p>Among the provisions BPC said the Senate needs in its bill was a requirement for drug makers to share data on the safety and efficacy for off-label uses with researchers, regulators and insurers for the purpose of rapidly validating emerging uses of established therapies. </p><p>The group said the Senate also should require the FDA to issue rules that clarify how manufacturers can disseminate "truthful, non-misleading" scientific information about a drug or device not included in approved product labeling and create a safe harbor for companies to be able to distribute information on off-label uses of medicines &ndash; measures that earlier were considered by the House, but failed to make it into the final bill.</p><p>Senator Frist insisted one thing that was lacking in the Cures bill that could be included in the Senate's legislation was a provision to push the FDA towards greater commitment and stepping up its actions related to harmonization of international standards, including those related to manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The FDA and the US Trade Representative should be required to report annually on the progress of those efforts, BPC urged.</p><p>BPC said the Senate's bill also should direct the FDA to develop a framework that would provide an approach and regulatory requirements for incorporating data from "pragmatic" randomized studies of broader populations "where care is provided under more typical settings" &ndash; engaging experts and stakeholders through a collaborative public process.</p><p>"By passing effective FDA modernization, everybody will be a beneficiary," Senator Frist said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
