<p><p>With both Esbriet and Ofev gaining approval on the same day, Roche's Genentech and Boehringer Ingelheim have been working to differentiate their respective drugs in the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis market. Recent spates of data released at the American Thoracic Society annual meeting in Denver could help expand the patient populations for the two therapies. </p><p>Both Roche's Esbriet (pirfenidone) and Boehringer's Ofev (nintedanib) were <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Boehringers-Ofev-Roches-Esbriet-win-same-day-IPF-approvals-354509" target="_new">approved by FDA</a> on 15 October and the companies have said the drugs are off to a strong start (Roche reported Esbriet sales of $93m for the first quarter; BI didn't disclose sales of Ofev). BioMedTracker analysts believe Esbriet could reach peak annual sales of $2bn and Ofev could hit $1.4bn. </p><p>Yet, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an orphan indication that is hard to diagnose. Currently, 30,000 patients get diagnosed annually in the US, but many of them are living with the lung disease for upwards of two years before doctors recognize the disease due non-specific symptoms that appear similar to other lung diseases like COPD. </p><p>"About 100,000 patients live with IPF in the US. We think that's grossly underestimated because we don't really have a good feel for the prevalence of the disease," said Dr Ben Kramer, Genentech VP of Immunology and Infectious Diseases. "I think now that there are treatments available, that number will increase substantially."</p><p>Another issue for these drugs is disease severity. Due to a lack of treatment options and a host of side effects from treatments that weren't effective in slowing progression of IPF, physicians have been reticent to prescribe anything to patients in advanced stages of the disease or to allow patients to continue on treatment for long periods of time. </p><p>"We need to change the old approach to care with IPF. Some physicians would wait and watch to see if a patient declined or not, and we understand from this data that this was probably a missed opportunity. On the other hand, once patient had progressed, physicians thought it was too late to give any therapy," noted Dr Kramer. </p><h2>Esbriet at ATS</h2><p>Roche submitted almost a dozen abstracts to the ATS meeting in Denver this year and presented three oral presentations, including data on Esbriet in patients whose condition declined 10% over the first six months of treatment. </p><p>The study looked at pooled data from two Phase III trials of Esbriet and noted that fewer patients on the drug declined during the first six months than those on placebo (5.5% compared with 10.9%, respectively). Of those patients that declined, data showed that those patients taking Esbriet were less likely to decline further over the subsequent six months and that continued treatment could be beneficial. Esbriet reduced the risk of mortality by 48% at Week 52 compared with placebo. One of the patients in the Esbriet group experienced a decline during the subsequent six months, while 15 patients in the placebo group experienced a decline &ndash; ten of the patients on placebo died. </p><p>Another pooled analysis showed that patients on Esbriet were less likely to show more than a 10% decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) if they were treated earlier, although that difference was not statistically significant. </p><p>"Even in mild disease, Esbriet does reduce mortality," said Dr Kramer. "We do think this is going to be very thought-provoking for the pulmonology community and that practices may change now that there are approved therapies."</p><h2>Ofev at ATS</h2><p>BI presented data from the extension period of its Phase II TOMORROW study, which followed patients on Ofev for up to 76 weeks. Of the 428 patients who were in the study, 316 patients completed the first 52 weeks and 286 patients continued on treatment after the initial period. </p><p>Patients stayed on Ofev for a mean time of 14.2 months compared with 16.8 months for the comparator. During both periods of the trial, patients had a lower change from baseline of FVC in the Ofev group than those on the comparator. At the end of the 76 weeks, Ofev patients declined 3.1% compared to a decline of 6.3%. The study concluded that Ofev slowed disease progression. </p><p>Another abstracted presented at ATS showed that Ofev slowed disease progression by significantly reducing the rate of decline in FVC. </p><p>In patients with baseline FVC >90% predicted, the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was -91.5 mL/year with Ofev and -224.6 mL/year with placebo, while in patients with baseline FVC ?90% predicted, it was -121.5 mL/year with Ofev and -223.6 mL/year with placebo.</p><p>"The data we can provide, the more confidence physicians will have in treating patients. This is a condition with significant unmet need," said Dr Danny McBryan, BI's VP of clinical development and medical affairs, respiratory.</p><p><p>
