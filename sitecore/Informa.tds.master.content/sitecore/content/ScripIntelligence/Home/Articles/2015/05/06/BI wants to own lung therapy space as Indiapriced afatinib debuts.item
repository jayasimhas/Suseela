<p>"We want to own the lung cancer therapy space," is how Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) India's managing director Sharad Tyagi refers to the family-owned German multinational's ambitions in the segment with the introduction of its first oncology product, afatinib, on the domestic market. </p><p>The EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer treatment, afatinib (Giotrif/Gilotrif internationally), has been launched at a fraction of international prices - 13.8% of the US price &ndash; in India. It will likely come with a unique financing option for patients who may still be unable to afford it - a la drip payment approach already being tested in segments such as hepatitis C. </p><p>"The best access model is to have a market-based pricing. We have taken a very realistic and aggressive stance on the retail price itself, instead of going with the norm of a high retail price and then having an aggressive market access program," Mr Tyagi told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview.</p><p>Access programs for those in the "most unaffordable category" were also being put in place.</p><p>Asked why BI did not perhaps consider a tiered pricing approach for afatinib, the BI India boss said that such pricing is difficult because of the "cross movement" and tends to become a "huge administrative exercise."</p><p>"A lower maximum retail price works best because patients and doctors can see what they are getting." </p><p>Afatinib is being marketed as Xovoltib in India, a branding plan that is expected to block any effort at parallel trade.</p><p>An India-specific pricing approach, though, isn't unusual among multinational firms in general or BI in particular. The German multinational had in 2012 introduced Trajenta at INR42.70 (then $0.77) per day, around one third of the corresponding price in the US. Similarly, Pradaxa , (dabigatran etexilate) is available at 16% of the US price in India.</p><p>BI India is also evaluating financing models for its oncology as well as other critical care products. </p><p>"It takes a bit of time. One of the things with financing schemes is that you need to have partners who are willing to finance and partners on the evaluation on who should be getting the finance. It's very early days because we have to partner with the hospitals, financing companies but that's something that we will definitely be doing. Definitely by first quarter next year," Mr Tyagi said.</p><p>He noted how the financing approach is more of a "cash flow influencing model" since not everyone may have the ability to pay the drug cost over a shorter span of time.</p><p>"It's like any equal monthly instalment (EMI)-based asset acquiring that people do. In this case rather than asset, the asset is the human life. If you make it easier for people to able to finance the treatment it becomes much better."</p><p>Merck & Co's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/MSD-Indias-out-of-the-box-Hep-C-financing-how-why-and-what-next-352206%5d" target="_new">out-of-the-box hepatitis C therapy financing</a> initiative in India is believed to have improved accessibility to its Viraferon Peg (interferon alfa 2b) in pockets of the country. </p><h2>Nintedanib</h2><p>Mr Tyagi underscored how BI hopes to make a "big impact" in the lung cancer space first with afatinib and then followed by nintedanib - expected to be launched next year. Volasertib is another pipeline product for India. </p><p>BI's Vargatef (nintedanib) is available for advanced lung cancer following chemotherapy and also as Ofev (also nintedanib) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</p><p>"Of course, nowadays it's all about targeted therapies also, so there will be specific targeted areas in lung cancer where the products will have a much better effect. But overall, when it comes to lung cancer, no one has, so to say, really owned the lung cancer space, whether it is in terms of awareness, targeted therapy," Mr Tyagi noted.</p><p>He also referred to an overall lung health thrust, though Spiriva (tiotropium), for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and BI's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Boehringer-Ingelheim-jolted-in-2014-358015%5d" target="_new">top-selling product in 2014</a> is not currently on the Indian market. </p><p>"But in the future products, we have the olodaterol tiotropium combination. Lung health is something that we are very focused on. We want to own the lung cancer therapy space. Our long term approach is towards creating much better awareness among health care professionals, people and that's how we are looking at it."</p><h2>Consumer health care</h2><p>Meanwhile, Boehringer has ended its long-running alliance with Zydus Cadila for its consumer health care (CHC) range of products in India.</p><p>BI has launched its CHC business in India last year and its products have since been introduced under modified names &ndash; Dulcoflex, Buscogast and Buscogast Plus. </p><p>"The launch has been good&#8230; uptakes very good. We are fully focused on introducing even newer OTC products going ahead," Mr Tyagi added. Zydus has its own generic products.</p>
