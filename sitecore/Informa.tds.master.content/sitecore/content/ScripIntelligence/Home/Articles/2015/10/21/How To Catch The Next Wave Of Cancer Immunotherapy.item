<p>Forging a development partnership with a big pharma PD-1/L1 sponsor has become a sort of beauty contest with many in the running, and small companies are best advised to invest in good preclinical datasets to make the grade, execs say at the BIO Investor Forum in San Francisco.</p><p>Four large pharmas may dominate the checkpoint immunotherapy space today, but opportunities remain for companies of all sizes to improve response rates alongside checkpoint inhibitors in combinations, and to offer value through personalized approaches, execs said during an oncology panel at the Forum.</p><p>Today, the family of programmed death (PD-1/L1) checkpoint inhibitors dominates cancer immunotherapy development. Merck & Co. Inc<b>.</b>'s <i>Keytruda </i>(pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s <i>Opdivo </i>(nivolumab) have been at the front of the pack, both having recently secured approval in second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, on top of initial clearance in melanoma. Filings of PD-L1 inhibitors from Roche andAstraZeneca PLC &ndash; atezolizumab and durvalumab, respectively &ndash; are expected relatively soon in NSCLC. </p><p>Still, potential remains for the next wave of immunotherapies, panelists said during a session on emerging oncology trends at the Oct. 20-21 meeting.</p><p>The field of immunotherapy is moving at a rapid pace and there is "still a lot we don't know", in a range of areas, including the roles of competing types of therapies, moderator Jeff Smith, VP of investment banking at H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, told the panel.</p><p>"If we all had crystal balls, we wouldn't be here. We'd be somewhere else," Smith said.</p><p>Merck's Ben Thorner noted that Keytruda secured approval quickly, within three and a half years from the time the first patient was dosed. But the exec noted that there is still a lot of learning to be done in the PD-1 space. The durability of response has been notable across tumor types, yet there is "incredible diversity" in terms of response. Merck is working very hard to determine what differentiates a responder vs. a non-responder, said Thorner, VP of business development and licensing and head of North American Innovation Hubs at Merck Research Laboratories.</p><p>The data from trials in a number of cancers suggest there is much room for improvement. Opdivo's labeling in melanoma cites a 32% objective response rate, which improves to 60% with the addition of Bristol's CTLA-4 inhibitor <i>Yervoy </i>(ipilimumab), but at the cost of many more severe adverse events. In the overall NSCLC population, per labeling, the ORR with Opdivo monotherapy was only 19%. </p><p>Keytruda's labeling cites a 24% ORR in melanoma. In NSCLC, the ORR for those with higher levels of PD-L1 expression was 41%, but that group represented a relatively small part of the total (22%). The FDA approval is for high expressing patients, but PD-L1 expression still has to be accepted in the provider community.</p><p>In addition to improving response, sponsors are also cognizant of the potential for development of resistance and are closely watching how patients do in the long run.</p><p>That leaves room for both small and large companies that were not part of the first wave of immunotherapy leaders to step in with assets that could complement the established development leaders.</p><p>Asked what kinds of deals and partners Merck was focusing on, Thorner cited numerous transactions with a variety of partners from large companies like Pfizer, Amgen and Lilly, down to startups and "everything in between."</p><p>"Honestly, they really run the gamut," Thorner said.</p><p>Also, among other personalized approaches Merck has been exploring PD-1 blockade in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficiency as a potential biomarker for response.</p><p>Merck and the other leaders in the space have invested heavily to explore activity of the PD-1/L1 inhibitor in multiple tumor types and as part of many combinations, often relying on collaborations. </p><p>Getting to a quick, reliable answer is the "immediate target," Thorner said.</p><h2>In Search Of More Targeted Markets</h2><p>Unlike big pharmas that are sponsoring large trials of all comers, small companies can't fund huge trials, added Jeffrey Wolf, founder and CEO of Heat Biologics Inc., which is developing the allogeneic cell-based vaccine HS110 (viagenpumatucel-L) in NSCLC. </p><p>Research suggests that patients with low expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have weaker response to PD-1 immunotherapy and are not well served by these agents, creating a need for more cost-effective strategies, Wolf noted. HS110 consists of lung cancer cells modified with the company's proprietary <i>ImPACT</i> platform. The Phase Ib, multi-arm DURGA study will test HS110 in combination with Opdivo in 18 NSCLC patients, half of whom have low expression of TIL and half of whom have high expression. </p><p>Patients with low TIL expression are not well served by PD-1 immunotherapy and the company expects the addition of HS110 could improve response rates.</p><p>"Combinations do represent the future," Wolf said.</p><p>The leading PD-1/L1 therapies look similar now, but combinations and partnering will help sponsors of the checkpoint inhibitors bring differentiation in earlier lines of therapy and perhaps expand to new tumors, Olivier Lesueur, managing director of Bionest Partners, suggested.</p><p>For example, AstraZeneca announced in April a tie-up with Celgene to develop its PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab (MEDI4736) in blood cancers.</p><p>For the next wave of immunotherapy developers, the goal won't be to go head-to-head against the leading drugs, but rather to catch up and play a role in combinations, Lesueur said. In some cases, big pharmas are paying big for assets. Bristol was aggressive in bringing a preclinical IDO inhibitor into its portfolio through the acquisition of Flexus for $850m up front in February. Bristol recently expanded an agreement with Five Prime Therapeutics for the company's colony stimulating factor 1 program, a deal that included a $350m upfront payment. The companies had already been working together to combine Five Prime's anti-CSF1R candidate FPA008 with Opdivo in six tumor types.</p><p>Catching the attention of a potential big pharma partner in immunotherapy has become "sort of like a beauty contest" for small companies, and companies are best advised to invest in the data they need to prove a synergistic effect with PD-1/L1 immunotherapies as well as safety, Lesueur suggested.</p><p>Merck's Thorner agreed with the importance of early data to make the case for a complementary mechanism of action, noting that tools are much better nowadays for understanding immune response; for example better animal models and the advent of the gene-editing technique CRISPR allow companies of all sizes to develop that "killer dataset," providing "extremely meaningful" information about the potential for combinations to enable deal-making and to further learning in the industry, Thorner suggested.</p><p>Data showing the benefits of combinations on outcomes will change the nature of deals, Lesueur said. FDA granted accelerated approval to Bristol's combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in melanoma in early October, based on ORR and progression-free survival results, and overall survival data will follow. GlaxoSmithKline's combination of the BRAF inhibitor <i>Tafinlar</i> (dabrafenib) with <i>Mekinist</i> (trametinib), now owned by Novartis, has proven an overall survival benefit in melanoma. However, these are examples of companies successfully combining drugs in their own portfolio. In the case of Opdivo/Yervoy, Bristol was able to offer the combination at a discount over what the drugs would cost if added together as monotherapies, Lesueur pointed out.</p><p>It remains to be seen to what extent smaller companies developing their drug in combinations will be able to influence price, Lesueur said.</p><p>This story has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet" target="_new">'The Pink Sheet'</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p>
