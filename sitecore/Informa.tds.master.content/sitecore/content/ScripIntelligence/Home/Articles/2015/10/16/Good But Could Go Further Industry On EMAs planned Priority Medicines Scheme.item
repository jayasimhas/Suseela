<p>If all goes to plan, the European Medicines Agency will shortly be offering companies yet another tool for expediting the development of innovative drugs for major public health needs: the PRIME (priority medicines) scheme, which is expected to be put out for consultation around the end of October. </p><p>It's not yet fully clear what is on the table, but it seems that the scheme would focus on specific products for serious unmet medical needs, and that the EMA would offer companies additional regulatory and scientific support at a very early stage, with a "rapporteur" being assigned to the product for its development lifetime. </p><p>The proposal also seems to be akin to the US "breakthrough" designation for specific drugs for serious unmet public health needs. Indeed, the EMA is planning to meet with experts at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to see how the PRIME criteria could be aligned with those of the "breakthrough" designation scheme as a way of helping to support global drug development. </p><p>Just how the new initiative will fit with the EU's existing panoply of regulatory tools &ndash; accelerated assessment, conditional approval, early scientific advice, adaptive pathways, etc. &ndash; isn't entirely clear at this stage, although the criteria used to select drugs for the PRIME treatment would probably be similar to those used for the accelerated assessment procedure.</p><p>Industry reactions to the EMA's proposal have been mixed. Some see advantages in terms of rectifying the perceived shortcomings of the accelerated assessment procedure and sending clear signals to investors, but others are lukewarm, believing it does not go far enough and that the agency should place more emphasis on the involvement of health technology bodies at an early stage. </p><p>Of course, the proposal is still at an early stage, and stakeholders will have the opportunity to comment and make suggestions when it goes out for public consultation. But at least it shows the direction of travel the EMA is taking with regard to further supporting early innovative drug development. </p><p>Originally named "Pathfinder", the initiative has the backing of the European Commission, albeit with a number of caveats regarding the eligibility criteria, transparency, fair treatment, and legal certainty. The commission believes the scheme should be applied in a "holistic" manner and integrated with other regulatory tools such as conditional approval.</p><p>An outline of the PRIME proposal was presented by the commission's Sabine Jülicher at last week's TOPRA meeting in Berlin, as reported in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/productsector/pharmaceuticals/Faster-EU-Drug-Assessment-Pathway-Takes-Shape-Convergence-With-US-Breakthrough-Designation-On-the-Cards-361078?autnID=/contentstore/rajpharma/codex/e7a56785-73c0-11e5-91ab-c94c2ef2f9d3.xml" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>. She said PRIME would build on the accelerated assessment procedure, which is intended to hasten the approval of medicines for unmet needs but has come under fire from industry and is now being revised to address questions such as how to justify a major public health interest and improve the assessment timetable. </p><p>Under the PRIME scheme, she said, the appointed "rapporteur" would advise companies on the design and conduct of their development programs and work with them throughout, while issues relating to market access further down the line would be brought more firmly into early discussions. It also appears that PRIME would be directed preferentially at specific types of drugs or diseases with the greatest unmet needs and public health issues.</p><h2>Welcome, with reservations</h2><p>Will this be enough to fill the gaps in the innovative drug development pathway? Certainly many in industry feel it would be a valuable addition to the regulatory toolbox. Sabine Atzor, director of regulatory affairs at the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), said that the federation was "very pleased to see things moving in Europe within the last year, starting with the adaptive pathways pilot and an improvement of existing regulatory tools, such as conditional marketing authorization and accelerated assessment." </p><p>PRIME, Atzor told <i>Scrip</i>, was "another important element in the EU regulatory system building on the existing elements of scientific advice and accelerated assessment." Once these elements are redefined and further established, "a renewed holistic view on the application of EU regulatory system will be possible &ndash; this will certainly have the potential to mark an important milestone for patients in Europe." EFPIA had "high expectations" that the scheme would enhance the development of priority medicines for unmet medical needs.</p><p>However, she said that just improving the regulatory tools was not enough, and that it was important to get health technology assessment bodies on board during the early discussions in order to avoid access delays following EU approval. </p><p>"We understand that the cooperation between the agency and HTA bodies is currently subject to other initiatives than PRIME, such as joint/parallel scientific advice and the SEED [Shaping European Early Dialogues] project," Atzor said, adding that further development of those projects would also be considered for PRIME. </p><p>"It is therefore understandable that, at this stage, EMA decided not to specifically address HTA involvement into PRIME. However, EFPIA would like to underline that ultimately, a substantial move towards early patient access to innovative medicines in Europe will not be possible without HTA bodies' early involvement into the discussions."</p><p>A key issue, Atzor continued, was the need to ensure that national HTA bodies assigned sufficient resources to be able to cooperate in these kinds of schemes and to contribute to the discussions. "This seems to be a bottleneck for various initiatives where EMA strongly depends on the engagement by member states."</p><p>The commission seems to be quite aware of this concern. Jülicher told the Berlin conference that there was little point in speeding up marketing approval only to lose the time gained because of delays at the HTA stage. </p><p>The question of downstream access was also raised by Paul Catchpole, value and access director at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). He said the association welcomed the scheme, particularly where there was an urgent medical need, such as cancer, and where there were clear signals of emerging clinical promise. He noted that the FDA already has the breakthrough designation system for flagging up key innovative drugs, and that the EMA needs something similar to be able to signal and assess priority medicines.</p><h2>Downstream connections</h2><p>But Catchpole said it was no good having a regulatory system in isolation, and those signals had to be connected downstream, to the HTA bodies and through to those who commission and fund new treatments. "It is an important new opportunity. It should be a whole end-to-end system, I think that is really exciting, and it is important to deliver that, and to recognize that it is not just regulatory work but it needs to go beyond that into HTA and access," he told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview.</p><p>Catchpole also raised an issue that was flagged up by Richard Bergström, EFPIA director general, at the European Commission's <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/productsector/pharmaceuticals/Friends-Or-Foes-The-Changing-RegulatorIndustry-Relationship-In-Europe-360874?autnID=/contentstore/rajpharma/codex/69bbd0dc-6d22-11e5-91ab-c94c2ef2f9d3.xml" target="_new">recent conference</a> on 50 years of the EU pharma legislation: the importance of identifying early on what is coming down industry pipelines so that both regulators and payers have an idea of what lies in wait in terms of expensive innovation. </p><p>Bergström said that some sort of "observatory" was needed to increase the visibility of what is coming along the pipeline so as to "create some understanding as to why it's not so easy to deliver new medicines, why it's also costly." At the end of the day the price of a medicine must reflect the value for that particularly medicine and that health service, he said, adding: "We have a collective duty I think between industry, regulators and others to prepare health systems for the unprecedented level of innovation that is going on right now." </p><p>Catchpole agreed that horizon scanning was becoming more important "to help all players get together earlier to see what evidence will be needed downstream, what kind of evidence will be needed in the payer context, what needs to happen to support the development of infrastructure and assistance so that new medicines can be quickly adopted." </p><p>"I think this goes hand in hand with other changes happening now, in the context of early scientific advice&#8230; it helps companies to think about the evidence requirements," he said. He noted that parallel advice was already offered by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and that similar arrangements were being explored at EU level. "The ambition is right, and this is a very helpful thing we are working towards." </p><p>One question is how PRIME might fit with other national access initiatives, such as the UK Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS), which offers a "Promising Innovative Medicine" designation. Catchpole sees no problem there: "In a way the EAMS is the UK version of the PRIME initiative. In a way the experience we have gained with the EAMS will definitely help &ndash; the experience will feed into PRIME."</p><p>PRIME will of course be of great interest to biotechnology firms working in cutting-edge R&D. Christiane Abouzeid, head of regulatory affairs at the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA), said biotech companies would benefit from the scheme, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) "where an early confirmation of eligibility to the scheme could send a strong signal to investors." </p><p>She too felt it could address the failings of the accelerated assessment pathway by enhancing early dialogue and regulatory support. She said she understood that PRIME would be complementary to national innovation schemes such as the EAMS, and suggested that companies might be able to request eligibility for the scheme and for US breakthrough designation in parallel. </p><h2>Dissenting voice</h2><p>A somewhat dissenting opinion of PRIME was voiced by Philippe Wolgen, CEO of the Australian firm Clinuvel, which at the end of last year obtained EU approval for Scenesse (afamelanotide), a groundbreaking new treatment for the rare genetic skin disorder erythropoietic protoporphyria, and is now <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/ClinuvelFDA-To-Discuss-NDA-For-Phototoxicity-Drug-Scenesse-360159" target="_new">discussing US NDA filing requirements</a> and the possibility of an accelerated assessment. </p><p>In an opinion piece accompanying this article, Wolgen says that while the EMA is exploring new pathways, including PRIME, it seems to be overlooking the foundation of successful pharmaceutical development. He suggests that the EMA needs to do more to really foster innovative breakthrough technologies in Europe. And, rather than a rapporteur, he says a scientific "janitor" or "chaperone" should be appointed by the agency to liaise with clinical and regulatory experts and offer much deeper scientific advice that would eventually become binding on both the agency and the company.</p><h2>Other aspects </h2><p>Certainly there are aspects of the PRIME proposal that must still be fleshed out, such as the criteria for eligibility, the ability to tailor the idea in the light of experience, and how the scheme would dovetail with the US breakthrough designation. </p><p>While much more detail will presumably be contained in the consultation document, EFPIA's Atzor outlined a number of issues on which she says the success of the scheme could depend:</p><ul><li>Flexibility to allow frequent or continuous communication between the company and the agency.</li><li>The possibility of having a (co-) rapporteur appointed early.</li><li>Eligibility for the scheme should not differentiate between the innovative industry and small and medium size enterprises.</li><li>Flexibility to allow the scheme also to be applied to type II variations/extension of indications.</li><li>There should be substantial alignment of the criteria of the PRIME scheme with the US breakthrough designation to foster the concept of global development.</li><li>Flexibility to develop the concept further over time on the basis of experience gained, and the importance of establishing a dialogue on the functioning of the tool to allow adjustments as needed.</li></ul>
