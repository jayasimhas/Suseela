<p>With all of the hoopla on Capitol Hill over Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s aggressive pricing practices involving drugs like Isuprel (isoprenaline) and Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) &ndash; whose prices were hiked considerably after the company acquired the medicines from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February &ndash; it was inevitable it wouldn't take long until federal prosecutors got involved.</p><p>And they did.</p><p>Valeant disclosed late on Oct. 14 it had received subpoenas from the US attorney offices in Boston and New York seeking information about the firm's pricing decisions.</p><p>The company's shares took an immediate 12.4% hit on Oct. 15, before closing at $168.87, down $8.42, or 4.75%.</p><p>But it's not just the sharp increases in the prices of drugs like Nitropress, which jumped from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel, which rocketed from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, the feds are interested in probing.</p><p>Prosecutors also are taking a look at information Valeant provided to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and at the company's patient assistance programs.</p><p>In fact, Valeant said most of the materials requested by the subpoenas are related to documents with its patient assistance programs and financial support provided by the company for patients.</p><p>In a letter to Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), who has be highly critical of Valeant's price increases &ndash; declaring at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">July 30 hearing</a> the matter needed to be investigated by Congress &ndash; Valeant said it spent $544m in 2014 on patient assistance programs, and as of September, it had spent $476m so far this year, estimating it will put out $630m by the time 2015 is at its end.</p><p>In her letter to the company late last month, McCaskill had scolded Valeant's CEO for promising, but failing, to provide an explanation for its "dramatic increases" in the price of Isuprel and Nitropress.</p><p>As part of their ongoing investigation, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">opened an investigation</a> into Valeant's pricing of Isuprel and Nitropress.</p><p>The two lawmakers also have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introduced legislation</a> aimed at reining in the costs of prescription drugs in the US.</p><p>But analysts warned the probe by federal prosecutors into Valeant may bring more scrutiny overall to the patient assistance programs offered by biopharmaceutical makers in the US.</p><p>One firm that touted its patient assistance program this week is Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, which also is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">under investigation</a> by the New York attorney general for possible antitrust violations.</p><p>Turing was quickly criticized by patient groups, doctors and lawmakers after it was revealed the company raised the price of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine) by more than 5,000% &ndash; a move that even grabbed the attention of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose tweet about it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">sunk the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index</a> last month, which limped back to recovery.</p><p>Investors were worried the first Democratic debate would again thrust pricing practices into the spotlight, bringing the biotech index down once more.</p><p>But while Clinton and Sanders both said they were proud to have the biopharmaceutical industry among their greatest enemies, the actual topic of drug pricing never came up at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Clinton-Sanders-Proud-Pharmas-An-Enemy-361031" target="_new">Oct. 13 debate</a>, although there are five more debates where the candidates may bring the matter up.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
