<p>Predictions that biosimilar versions of infliximab will continue to erode the European market share of Merck/J&J's Remicade appear to be holding up after it was announced that the Paris hospital group AP-HP has agreed a 45% discount on the cost of Hospira's Inflectra versus Remicade.</p><p>Noting that French law allows patients to be started on a biosimilar instead of the reference drug, the hospital group said the discount would help to curb overall health spending and free up money to pay for more expensive new drugs coming to the market. It also noted that biosimilars had to be prescribed at the start of treatment, and that patients should not be switched from the originator product.</p><p>Biosimilar competition for Remicade began in 2014 in certain central and eastern European markets, but really took off this year after the expiry of patent protection in all remaining European markets in February. </p><p>At a first-quarter results conference call in April, Merck said that biosimilar competition was still at an early stage in core EU markets, but that the discounts offered by biosimilars of Remicade were higher than its original expectations of 30%, and were closer to 45%. It said it expected that the impact of biosimilar competition, particularly for new patients, would accelerate throughout the year as more tenders took place in the core European markets.</p><p>The news from Paris appears to confirm that this is indeed happening, and that strong price competition will be a key component of any biosimilar strategy. </p><p>Clear proof of the importance of the size of the discount can be seen in Norway, where Orion Pharma offered its Remsima product at a 39% discount to Remicade last year, while Hospira offered 33% for Inflectra (both are licensed from South Korea's Celltrion). This made Remsima the preferred option, and brought it a 6-7% share of the market, but the product's fortunes rose dramatically earlier this year when the discount was raised to 69%. </p><p>This had the effect of pushing Remsima's market share up by 10% in one month, and by March it had become the infliximab <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Norways-infliximab-experience-shows-effect-of-deep-price-cuts-on-biosimilar-success-358091" target="_new">market leader</a> with a 51% share, according to Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian medicines agency. Speaking at the EGA/EBG biosimilars conference in April, he said that the 39% discount for Remsima was "nice, but nobody said we have to switch. But with 69%, the medical directors of the four health regions all said, 'now we have to switch'." </p><p>Not all will be convinced that such deep discounts are sustainable in the biosimilars field in the longer run, and the amount of price cutting that can be offered will depend on numerous factors such as the price of the originator, the kind of product involved, the costs of development, the size of the patient population, and the way that pricing and tendering systems work. </p><p>Nonetheless, with concerns about the costs of new biological medicines, and biosimilars becoming a more familiar part of the medicines landscape, payers will increasingly be seeking the best possible prices on offer. </p><p>Elsewhere, Hospira, which is being acquired by Pfizer, launched Inflectra in Canada in March, and announced last month that the product had also been approved in <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=175550&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2055602" target="_new">Brazil</a>.</p>
