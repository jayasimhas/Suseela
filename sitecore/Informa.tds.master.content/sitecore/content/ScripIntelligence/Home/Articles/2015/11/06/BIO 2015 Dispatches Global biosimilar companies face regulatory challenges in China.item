<p>Chinese regulatory requirements are making it difficult for biosimilar companies to incorporate China into global development programs, a Pfizer representative told the Biotechnology Industry Organization's annual meeting June 17.</p><p>Speaking during a panel discussion on global regulatory trends in biosimilars, Owen Fields, vice president of regulatory strategy, said that despite China's efforts to clarify its biosimilar regulatory process through a recent guidance document, developing a biosimilar for the Chinese market continues to poses challenges.</p><p>In February, China's Food and Drug Administration released a guidance document on biosimilars that lays out a regulatory framework and includes provisions on analytical characterization, nonclinical and comparative clinical testing.</p><p>Mr Fields said that under the guidance it is possible to register a product that is not made in China, although the country favors locally sourced products.</p><p>However, uncertainty about the need for local clinical data and delays in getting approval to conduct such trials are "the main issue that the global companies face in China."</p><p>"The problem is we would like to include China in a global program so that we can meet the global clinical data requirements, but the clinical trial application timelines in China, especially for biologics, are so long it makes it nearly impossible to actually include them in a global trial," Mr Fields said. </p><p>A Covington and Burling summary of CFDA's draft guidance issued in October notes that the waiting time for approval to begin research and development for biologics can be nearly twice that for small molecule drugs. "It can take up to two years just to obtain approval to conduct the necessary clinical trial to bring a biologic to market," the law firm noted. </p><p>Given this lengthy timeline, "it really gets difficult to think of China as a component of your global program," Mr Fields said.</p><p><b>Are local data needed?</b></p><p>Pfizer also seeks further clarity as to whether clinical data from Chinese patients are needed to register a biosimilar in the country.</p><p>"I believe that China's guidance was silent on the need for local clinical data, which medically makes sense obviously because the reference product will have already shown that there is or is not a difference in the local population based on local product as background therapy [and] medical standards," Mr Fields said.</p><p>"We've never thought that biosimilars and the requirement for local data really were in concordance with each other," the Pfizer rep said. "That's something I think we're looking for China to be more clear on."</p><p>Ivana Knezevic, a scientist with the World Health Organization's Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products, said the issue of local clinical data requirements has been discussed in various meetings of global regulatory authorities.</p><p>"Our understanding for the time being is that Japan, China and I think Korea &#8230; are still really strongly standing on the position that local clinical data are needed" for biosimilar development, she said.</p><p>WHO has questioned the scientific basis for such a requirement, she noted.</p><p>Although there have been cases of ethnic differences in metabolism of small molecule drug products, "I think if there is one example out of 100 products I'm not sure that this is really justifying the need, because this is definitely causing the delay in the development," she said.</p><p>"We don't mind if local clinical data are requested in post-marketing surveillance," Ms Knezevic said. "I think this is beautiful information that could come afterwards, but I think holding on licensing is a bit problematic."</p><p>"I'm not aware of any case of a biologic that had different pharmacokinetics in different ethnic groups," Mr Fields noted.</p><p>Ms Knezevic said there is a huge potential for biosimilars in China, with lots of companies interested in getting into the space. However, the regulatory discussions are still ongoing and it remains to be seen how the new guidelines will be applied.</p><p>"I'm not actually sure of how fast or how far they will go with biosimilars in China," she said. "There is a potential, but how it's going to be regulated, I don&rsquo;t think we can answer that question right now."</p><p><i>Sue Sutter is with "The Pink Sheet."
