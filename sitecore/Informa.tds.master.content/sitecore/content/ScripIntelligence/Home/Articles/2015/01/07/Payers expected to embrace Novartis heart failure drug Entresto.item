<p>After the markets closed on 7 July, the FDA revealed it had approved Novartis' oral heart failure treatment Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan), which previously was known as LCZ696.</p><p>Specifically the drug &ndash; a combination of sacubitril, a neprilysin inhibitor, and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker &ndash; is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p><p>The medicine is intended to be administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the likelihood of Novartis' drug winning US regulators' nod at 98%, which is 13% above the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Novartis told <i>Scrip</i> the company set the wholesale acquisition cost for Entresto at $12.50 per day, less discounts, which she said is in line with the current price of other new cardiovascular therapies "and well below other recently launched life-saving products for other diseases."</p><p>Analysts at <i>Datamonitor</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, forecasted annual sales of Entresto to reach $6bn in 2023 &ndash; higher than the $5bn Novartis predicted for peak sales &ndash; and anticipated the drug's ability to reduce hospitalizations, and therefore reducing the economic burden of heart failure, would be attractive to payers. </p><p>The Entresto new drug application (NDA), which was granted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Novartis-heart-failure-drug-wins-FDA-priority-review-356800" target="_new">priority review</a> from the FDA this past February, was based on the results from Novartis' 8,442-patient PARADIGM-HF study &ndash; the largest ever conducted in heart failure &ndash; which showed the drug was superior to the ACE-inhibitor enalapril on key endpoints, including significantly reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization.</p><p>Results of the PARADIGM-HF study showed Entresto reduced the risk of death from cardiovascular causes by 20%, cut hospitalizations by 21%, reduced heart failure hospitalizations by 21%, and cut the risk of all-cause mortality by 16%, versus enalapril.</p><p>Overall, there was a 20% risk reduction on the primary endpoint &ndash; a composite measure of CV death or time to first heart failure hospitalization.</p><p>Analysis of safety data showed that Entresto had a similar tolerability profile to enalapril.</p><p>Fewer patients on Entresto discontinued study medication for any adverse event, compared to those on enalapril. </p><p>The Entresto group, however, had more hypotension and non-serious angioedema. But patients on the Novartis drug had less renal impairment, hyperkalemia and cough, versus the enalapril group.</p><p> "Despite the uncertainty and high financial risk, we designed the world's largest heart failure trial to compare Entresto to the previous gold standard," said Dr David Epstein, division head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals. "As a result, millions of people diagnosed with reduced ejection fraction heart failure now have a much greater opportunity to live longer and stay out of hospital."</p><p>He said the company would begin shipping Entresto in the US in the coming week.</p><p>Dr Milton Packer, a professor and chair clinical sciences at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, insisted the "very meaningful survival advantage" of Entresto seen in the PARADIGM-HF trial "should persuade physicians" to consider the drug for all appropriate patients, in place of traditional ACE inhibitors or ARBs.</p><p>"Entresto is expected to change the management of patients with HFrEF for years to come," he declared.</p><p>Of the nearly 6 million people in the US with heart failure, about half have HFrEF.</p><p>Novartis said Entresto currently is under review by other regulatory bodies, including those in Canada, Switzerland and the European Union. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
