<p>The renewed break-out of a frighteningly deadly virus with no known cure or vaccine in a region that will shortly host a couple of million international pilgrims has prompted a rash of recent headlines linking Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the SARS-like coronavirus that first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and the annual Hajj to Mecca. </p><p>With the apparent complacency that let Ebola get out of hand in West Africa so fresh in the mind, anxiety is understandable; like Ebola, the mortality rate from MERS is high. Of around 1,430 people reported to have been infected since 2012 (predominantly in the Middle East and, thanks to the hospital outbreak earlier this year, South Korea), just over 500 have died. </p><p>MERS is a bit different from Ebola, though: while Ebola spread readily in the community among previously healthy people, the spread of MERS in humans has to date been almost entirely within the hospital setting, and that includes the most recent outbreak in Riyadh. In its current form, it does not look likely that the Hajj would provide the conditions for an epidemic to spread.</p><p>Nevertheless, viruses mutate and the possibility that MERS will eventually become more transmissible in the community represents a real if still theoretical threat to global public health. So what defence can pharma offer the world?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, given the disease has been around for less than four years and it takes a lot longer than that to develop a new drug, the pipeline for treatments is very early stage. Repurposing existing drugs is likely to be the best hope for the short to medium term, and to this end the University of Maryland last year screened a large number of compounds for activity against MERS to create a shortlist for further testing. </p><p>Meanwhile, an analysis of Citeline's Pharmaprojects database shows that there are 11 early-stage programs in company pipelines (work confined to academia and other public institutions is not captured by Pharmaprojects). </p><p>Recent progress has included the development of a cell line for the production of a treatment or prophylaxis based on antibodies isolated from a patient recovering from infection with the MERS coronavirus, by Humabs and its academic/public partners, which it says could be made available for Phase I trials or compassionate use within a few months depending on regulatory clearance. </p><p>Inovio and its public partners are preparing to begin Phase I trials this year of a synthetic DNA vaccine against the disease, following successful trials in monkeys and camels, while Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which moved fast to develop a monoclonal antibody to treat Ebola, is evaluating a fully human MERS MAb. Others in the space include Hemispherx with an existing interferon product, TamirBio with a ribonuclease derived from frog eggs, Novavax, Nanoviricides, Replikins, Greffex, and SAB Biotherapeutics. </p><table><h2>Candidates In Development For MERS Coronavirus (CoV)</h2><tbody><tr><td><p>Developer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Candidate</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Status</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Notes</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hemispherx</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Natural alpha-interferon (alfa-n3/Alferon N)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Has worked with NIAID and University of Texas to show <i>in vitro</i> potential as preventative or early treatment for MERS; application for orphan drug status under review in EU</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>TamirBio</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ranpirnase (ribonuclease derived from frog eggs)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Has shown antiviral activity in MERS and offers this as a licensing opportunity</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Humabs BioMed</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>LCA-60 (CD26-targeting human MAb isolated from memory B-cells of a patient recovering from MERS)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Has worked with academic/public partners and developed a production cell line that with regulatory clearance could make product available for compassionate use or Phase I trial within a few months.
