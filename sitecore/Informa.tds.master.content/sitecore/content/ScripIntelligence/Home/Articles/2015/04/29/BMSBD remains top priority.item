<p><p>While touting the accomplishments of its closely-watched immuno-oncology product Opdivo dominated Bristol-Myers Squibb's first quarter earnings call on 28 April, the big pharma's management did stress the importance of business development to the company. </p><p>"We continue to look at opportunities of different size, as long as they make financial sense and they give us the possibility of expanding our pipeline and our portfolio. Size is not the main element of judgment or the main element of selection. It's more the fit with our portfolio and our pipeline. So the moment is always mature for good business development opportunities," said BMS CEO Lamberto Andreotti. The first quarter call was the last for the executive, who will take over as Chairman of the company on May 5 and pass the reigns to Giovanni Caforio.</p><p>Andreotti had high praise for his successor during the call, adding, "I also feel very good that Giovanni will be my successor as CEO. He's a trained physician, a global business leader with broad industry experience, and a senior BMS executive who has been instrumental in driving the execution of our strategy over the past several years. There is no question that Giovanni is the right person at the right time and will bring to the position the right mix of experience, passion, vision, and energy."</p><p>Other executives on the call echoed Andreotti's sentiments about the company's business development strategy. "We've been fairly consistent in that BD remains a top priority for the company as we recognize that innovation must be sourced, not just internally but externally, as well. And as Lamberto said, we're agnostic around size, and we're also very good at looking at different structures that suits our partners. And also, and very importantly, we're very disciplined around what we think makes strategic sense for us, as well as good science. And of course the financial metrics have to all tie it all together," noted CFO Charles Bancroft. </p><h2>Opdivo, Opdivo, Opdivo</h2><p>By the tone of the earnings call, it's easy to see that Opdivo (nivolumab) and the company's immunotherapy franchise are the future of BMS. The drug gained its first approval in melanoma late last year and its second approval in lung cancer in March. Recent data showed that a combination of Opdivo and BMS' earlier immunotherapy Yervoy (ipilimumab) could be the next standard of care in melanoma &ndash; the company is on track to submit the combo for approval by mid-year. </p><p>"As we continue to advance our immuno-oncology portfolio, Yervoy certainly remains an important treatment option for patients. However, as we have mentioned before, the introduction of new immuno-oncology agents, such as Opdivo in melanoma, will likely create some variability in Yervoy sales," noted Caforio on the call. Yervoy had sales of $325m for the quarter, up 20%. </p><p>Beyond the combo, BMS expects to submit data for approval of Opdivo monotherapy in advanced lung cancer settings, said Caforio, who also noted that the drug has rapid uptake so far. '</p><p>"With the early approval in lung cancer, we are the first PD-1 to market in this area of high unmet need. Our commercial organization was ready, and we were able to start treating patients within 48 hours. It has been very encouraging to see that we have nearly 100% access for Opdivo in the approved indications, and we are seeing an acceleration of usage in both the academic and community setting," said the CEO-designate. The drug has sales of $40m so far worldwide and BMS noted that 75% of claims so far are coming from on-label indications. </p><p>Overall, BMS reported earnings per share of $0.71 on revenues of $4bn. </p><p><p><p>
