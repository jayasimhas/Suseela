<p>A surprising slide in global stock indices on Monday did not stop venture capital investors from keeping their commitments to private biotechnology companies during the last full week of August, but no new initial public offerings launched in the US between Aug. 24 and 28.</p><p>Venture capital firms eventually may pull back from funding early-stage biotech companies if stocks continue to tumble and publicly-traded drug developers lose favor with stock market investors, because IPOs will disappear as an exit opportunity for private firms. However, big pharma still must acquire new assets for their development pipelines, so with mergers and acquisitions still a possibility VC investors will continue to back pre-commercial biotech companies without an IPO as an exit option.</p><p>The Dutch biotech firm Merus raised a &euro;72.8m ($80.5m) Series C venture capital round to advance its portfolio of preclinical and clinical therapies that recruit cells from the immune system to kill cancer cells. The company's lead bi-specific antibody MCLA-128 is under evaluation in a Phase I/II clinical trial enrolling patients with solid tumors. Merus plans to begin a trial for its second bi-specific antibody MCLA-117 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia during the first quarter of 2016. </p><p>New investors Sofinnova Ventures and Novo A/S co-lead the Series C round with participation from several other new Merus backers: RA Capital Healthcare Fund, Rock Springs Capital, Tekla Capital Management and an unnamed US life science-focused investor. Prior investors also participated: Novartis Venture Fund, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Pfizer Venture Investments, Bay City Capital, LSP Life Sciences Partners and Aglaia Oncology Fund. Merus closed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Merus-raises-31m-as-JandJ-third-corporate-VC-to-invest-347025" target="_new">&euro;47.6m Series B round</a> in 2013. </p><p>Syndax Pharmaceuticals, which recently entered into a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Syndaxs-Newly-Arrived-CEO-Briggs-Morrison-Announces-Clinical-Collaboration-With-Genentech-360131" target="_new">clinical collaboration</a> with Roche's Genentech subsidiary, also announced during the last full week of August that the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company raised $80m in Series C venture capital. </p><p>Syndax's lead drug candidate entinostat already is in Phase III and has a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-grants-Syndax-breast-cancer-drug-entinostat-breakthrough-status-346512" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> from the US FDA in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The company will use its new venture capital to conduct additional clinical trials, expanding on recent data that show entinostat may enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors, like Genentech's PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-inks-latest-immuno-oncology-collab-with-Syndax-357607" target="_new">Merck & Co.'s PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab)</a>.</p><p>Fidelity Management & Research Company and Delos Capital Fund co-led Syndax's Series C funding round with participation from EcoR1 Capital, OrbiMed, Jennison Associates, Tavistock Life Sciences, Arrowpoint Partners, Cormorant Asset Management, BioMed Ventures and undisclosed top-tier mutual funds. Prior Syndax investors Domain Associates, MPM Capital, RusnanoMedInvest and Forward Ventures also backed the Series C round.</p><p>But it wasn't just cancer drug developers that raised venture capital during the past week. Madison, Wisconsin-based FluGen closed its first major venture capital funding, a $12m Series A round led by Knox LLC, to fund completion of its first human clinical trial for the universal influenza vaccine candidate REDEE FLU and preparation of a quadrivalent vaccine candidate. </p><p>Venture Investors LLC, The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), the State of Wisconsin Investment Board and other new and existing investors backed the FluGen Series A round.</p><p>Research Triangle Park, North Carolina-based Hatteras Venture Partners recently raised $90m of the $150m that the venture capital firm intends to accumulate for its fifth fund known as Hatteras Venture Partners V (HVP V). As with prior funds, 20% of the cash will be set aside for early and seed-stage investments. All of the money will be invested in technology spun out of academic institutions in the Southeastern US. HVP now has $350m under management.</p><p><b>IPO Slowdown</b></p><p>No companies launched IPOs between Aug. 24 and 28 following the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Investors-Need-Drug-For-Market-Induced-Shock-360092" target="_new">stock market meltdown</a> at the start of the week, but four drug development firms signaled their intention to go public in filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p><p>Continuing the trend of pursuing an IPO after a significant investment from venture capital backers, CytomX filed paperwork with the SEC on Aug. 28 to raise up to $100m in its first-ever public offering. The South San Francisco-based company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CytomX-advancing-PD-L1-targeting-Probodies-with-70m-in-new-cash-359001" target="_new">closed a $70m Series D round</a> in June to fund its immunotherapy and Probody-drug conjugate programs.</p><p>Cortendo said in an Aug. 28 SEC filing that it wants to raise up to $86.25m in an IPO to fund late-stage clinical trials for COR-003 for endogenous Cushing's syndrome and COR-004 for acromegaly as well as preclinical and clinical studies for COR-005 for acromegaly. The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cortendo-expands-rare-disease-pipeline-358453" target="_new">raised more than $30m in May</a> and in-licensed drug candidates from Antisense Therapeutics and Aspireo Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Mirna Therapeutics <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Deep-in-the-heart-of-Texas-Mirna-and-ZS-Pharma-corral-80m-combined-in-C-fundings-336539" target="_new">raised $34.5m in Series C venture capital</a> in 2012 and now the company plans to rake in up to $80.5m in an IPO for continued clinical development of the oncology drug MRX34 and to take a second drug candidate into the clinic.</p><p>Advanced Inhalation Therapies of Israel said in its SEC filing on Aug. 25 that it will raise up to $34.5m in an IPO to fund Phase II and IIb clinical trials for its inhaled drug-device candidates to treat asthma, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis and bronchiolitis.</p><p><p><p><p>
