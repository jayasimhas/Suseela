<p>Two of the biggest young names in biotechnology, Kite Pharma and bluebird bio, are to work together to develop new treatments for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers.</p><p>Kite, which has a platform technology that re-engineers T cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells, already has a series of product candidates directed to HPV, including HPV-16 E6 TCR, which is currently in a Phase I study. These are not affected by the collaboration. Meanwhile, bluebird's platform comprises a lentiviral gene delivery system and gene editing capabilities. The collaboration is aimed at bringing together the technologies of both companies.</p><p>Under the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize second generation TCR product candidates directed against the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein, incorporating gene editing to modify certain genes to enhance T cell function. In addition, the companies will explore using lentiviral vectors to optimize delivery of HPV-16 E6 TCRs into patient T cells.</p><p>Financial terms were not disclosed. However, Kite will lead the program in the US, and bluebird bio will have the option to lead the program in the EU. Both companies will share overall costs, and split any profits equally. The companies have also co-promotion options in the others' territories.</p><p>Both Kite and bluebird have raised $100m+ IPOs within the past two years, and have been back to the markets for significant follow-on cash. </p><p>Kite is widely known for its work in the chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) immunotherapy space, where it competes with Novartis and Juno Therapeutics. The start of this year saw it sign a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-hangs-on-to-Kite-in-CAR-T-race-355933" target="_new">significant deal with Amgen</a>, which paid $60m upfront for Kite to apply its engineered autologous cell therapy (eACT) platform to cancer targets from Amgen. The eACT platform allows a patient's T cells to be genetically modified to express cancer-targeting receptors.</p><p>bluebird, meanwhile, released positive <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Bluebird-Bio-still-flying-on-new-blood-disease-data-358955" target="_new">new data</a> earlier this month from three patients treated with its LentiGlobin BB305, a gene therapy for sickle cell anemia. It has already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/therapysector/Bluebird-Bio-takes-gene-therapy-into-EMAs-adaptive-pathways-pilot-358665" target="_new">started to explore</a> the EMA's adaptive pathway pilot for European approval of the product in beta-thalassemia major. In the US, it is has been in discussions with the FDA and the product has been granted breakthrough designation.</p><p>However, there was less positive news at the start of June <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-backing-off-bluebird-partnership-358728" target="_new">when Celgene opted to hand back</a> all of the work the companies were doing together and only move forward with one program.</p><p>
