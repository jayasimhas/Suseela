<p>The blunders that led to live anthrax being shipped from a Utah military base to 86 private, academic and federal laboratories in 20 US states and the District of Columbia and seven foreign countries over the last decade were the result of a "massive institutional failure," a top Department of Defense (DOD) official said on 23 July.</p><p>A comprehensive review of the DOD's laboratory protocols found that in certain cases, the US military's procedures to irradiate and kill live anthrax spores and test the viability after that process are ineffective.</p><p>But a committee charged with investigating the matter concluded there was no single root cause that led to the inactivated <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> spores being shipped from the US Army's Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG) in Utah in April to labs around the US and Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the UK, explained Robert Work, the deputy secretary at the DOD.</p><p>The DOD regularly ships inactivated biological materials for research, development, testing and evaluation to industry, academia and other federal labs. </p><p>But on 22 May, a private company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Live-anthrax-may-have-reached-numerous-US-labs-358624" target="_new">notified</a> the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the firm had discovered live anthrax spores in samples it received from DPG.</p><p>While the military's labs have safety protocols and procedures in place, they're not standardized, a committee that was tasked with conducting the investigation said.</p><p>"The primary systemic issue responsible for failures in the preparation of inactivated [anthrax] spores is the lack of specific validated standards to guide the development of protocols, processes and quality assurance measures," the investigative committee said in its report. </p><p>The Pentagon on 23 July said at least 21 people of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lawmakers-expand-anthrax-probe-69-labs-affected-358934" target="_new">31 initial people</a> &ndash; six US civilians and 15 DOD employees &ndash; are still being treated with post-exposure prophylaxis antibiotics in the event they were exposed to the anthrax. </p><p>The House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which opened a probe into the DOD matter in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lawmakers-troubled-over-anthrax-mishap-demand-answers-358649" target="_new">late May</a>, plans to hold a hearing on 28 July on the matter.</p><p>The committee already had an ongoing investigation underway involving near-calamities that occurred last year at labs at other government agencies, including the CDC, National Institutes of Health and the FDA, involving <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-anthrax-mishap-puts-spotlight-on-biosafety-lab-vulnerabilities-352431" target="_new">anthrax</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Smallpox-discovery-triggers-FBI-probe-NIH-lab-search-352714" target="_new">smallpox</a>, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Anthrax-smallpox-and-H5N1-Bad-beyond-Walter-White-352849" target="_new">H5N1 influenza</a> virus and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-reports-another-lab-mishap-this-time-Ebola-355849" target="_new">Ebola</a>.</p><p>The E&C subcommittee has broadened its investigation look into the oversight of the US Federal Select Agent Program, which oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products.</p><p>In a statement to Scrip, the CDC said Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the agency, has directed the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR) to begin a 90-day review of the select agent program.</p><p>The review, which will be overseen by the OPHPR's new director, Dr Stephen Redd, will be" wide-ranging" and includes a review of regulatory authority and the exercise of that authority so that we can identify potential modifications to the methods used to inspect labs. </p><p>The CDC said Dr Redd currently is working out the particulars of the review and identifying those who will conduct.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
