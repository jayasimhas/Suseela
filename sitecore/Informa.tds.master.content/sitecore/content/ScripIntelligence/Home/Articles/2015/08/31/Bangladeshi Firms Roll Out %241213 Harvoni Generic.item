<p>Bangladeshi firms Incepta Pharmaceuticals and Beximco Pharmaceuticals have now introduced what are probably the first cut-price generic versions of Gilead's money-spinner hepatitis C treatment, Harvoni (the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir), on the domestic market.</p><p>The launches are interesting, not just because of the huge price differential, but also because none of Gilead's India-based licensees appears to have yet introduced versions of Harvoni on the domestic market. Beximco's Harvoni generic (marketed as Lesovir-C), though, has an India connection &ndash; the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is sourced from an Indian firm.</p><p>Last year, the US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">approved</a> Harvoni, the first once-daily hepatitis C virus (HCV) fixed-dose combination pill. Gilead was then reported to have set Harvoni's wholesale average cost at $94,500 for 12 weeks and $63,000 for an eight-week course in the US, the latter option intended for treatment-na&iuml;ve patients without cirrhosis with baseline HCV viral load below 6 million IU/mL. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Harvoni-US-sales-dip-reflects-progress-in-treating-sickest-patients-Gilead-says-359661" target="_new">Harvoni</a> reported sales of $3.60bn worldwide during the second quarter of this year. </p><p>Incepta's Harvoni generic (marketed as Twinvir) was launched on Aug. 28, and has been priced at Taka1,000 ($12.5) per tablet, Incepta's chairman and managing director, Abdul Muktadir, told <i>Scrip</i>. The product is manufactured at Incepta's site in Zirabo, Savar.</p><p>"Twinvir is the first generic version of such combination anywhere in the world," Muktadir declared.</p><p>Beximco's Lesovir-C, launched on Sept. 5, is made at the firm's Tongi formulation site and comes at a maximum retail price of Taka1,200 per tablet.</p><p>Beximco, though, told <i>Scrip</i> that the actual price to the consumer is Taka1,034 (around $13) as the drug is distributed through the firm's own distribution channel. </p><p>"Our version is technically better/improved one (amorphous version of ledipasvir) and that's why our price is Taka1,200," Dr Shawkat Haider, general manager, Beximco Pharma, told <i>Scrip.</i></p><p>The firm also claimed that its product is "superior to others" as the API is being sourced from a "very renowned/accredited" supplier. </p><p>Incepta is speculated to be sourcing its API from China, though Muktadir declined to comment on this or whether the firm's ledipasvir was also an amorphous form, citing confidentiality concerns.</p><p>Last year Gilead entered into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">licensing deals</a> with seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Strides, Ranbaxy and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries. </p><p>Biocon subsequently joined the list of licensees, followed by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Patent-challenger-Natco-is-now-Gilead-licensee-for-Sovaldi-357020" target="_new">Natco</a>, which had previously challenged the Sovaldi patent. Several sofosbuvir brands have since been launched in India.</p><p>Incepta hopes to take its generic Twinvir to other least developed countries (LDCs) and other countries where the "process could be done under international legal system."</p><p>Beximco too underscored that it is legally allowed to supply within LDC countries, but added that it was currently focused on the domestic market.</p><p>Asked whether Incepta expected to supply its Sovaldi/Harvoni generics to nations where Gilead's patents may have been rejected (as in the case of China), Muktadir said: "We are observing the situation as Incepta does not want to get into any patent litigation issue with Gilead."</p><p>Earlier this year China was reported to have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/China-rejects-secondary-Gilead-Sovaldi-patent-359061" target="_new">rejected a patent application</a> for a prodrug of Sovaldi. </p><h2>Sovaldi</h2><p>Both Incepta and Beximco previously launched generic versions of Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) at a fraction of the innovator product's cost, though Incepta indicated that its product (marketed as Hopetavir) was yet to rake in the moolah.</p><p>"The sales are yet to achieve any significant value. Many organizations are in active discussion with us as to how our product could be made widely accessible. We expect our sales to increase once we are able to register our products in several other countries," Muktadir said.</p><p>Hopetavir is priced at Taka600 per tablet and was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891" target="_new">launched in February</a> this year. </p><p>Beximco's sofosbuvir was launched in Bangladesh at the end of June and the firm said it had received a "good response" from the physicians with whom it was closely working to promote access to the drug. </p><p>Beximco's chief operating officer, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beximco-looks-beyond-Bangladesh-with-6.6-sofosbuvir-359212" target="_new">Rabbur Reza</a>, has previously told <i>Scrip</i> that his firm expects to make supplies to a clutch of LDCs, with filings for at least 15 countries expected to commence in the next six to nine months.</p>
