<p>The US FDA has told Gedeon Richter and Allergan that it needs another three months to review the NDA for their novel antipsychotic cariprazine, hitting the product with a further delay. The drug, was filed in late 2012, but received a Complete Response Letter in November 2013 asking for another clinical trial to determine the dosing regimen. </p><p>The companies resubmitted the NDA in December and the FDA has now determined that this constitutes a "major amendment", requiring the three-month extension. The resubmission included data supporting approval of cariprazine for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Despite the further delay, the companies said they remained committed to pursuing this "important treatment option". </p><p>Once on the market, the problem for cariprazine is to show enough differentiation from other atypicals in a crowded field. It is a potent dopamine D(3)/D(2) receptor partial agonist with preferential binding to D(3) receptors. Analysts at Jefferies say that its main differentiating feature is its potential effect on negative symptoms. </p><p>
