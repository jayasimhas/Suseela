<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, looks set to recommend biosimilar versions of Merck's Remicade (infliximab) &ndash; Napp's Remsima and Hospira's Inflectra &ndash; as well as the originator, for some NHS patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Today's final draft guidance updates several pieces of existing guidance on drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis. NICE advises that treatment should start with the lowest cost drug, which puts Remicade at a disadvantage. Its list price, excluding any discounts, is &pound;419.62 per 100mg vial, while the list price of its biosimilar competitors is &pound;377.66 per 100mg vial. </p><p>The recommendations come shortly after NICE published some "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-how-to-switch-NHS-patients-from-Remicade-to-a-biosimilar-359800" target="_new">practical advice</a>" for the NHS on managing the introduction of the two biosimilars, which were launched in February in the UK. Shortly after their launch, NICE published guidance recommending infliximab (including Remicade and its new rivals) as possible treatments for some patients with ulcerative colitis if conventional treatment has failed or is unsuitable. </p><p>The draft guidance published 3 September also recommends Abbott's Humira (adalimumab), Pfizer's Enbrel (etanercept), UCB's Cimzia (certolizumab pegol), Merck & Co's Simponi (golimumab), Roche's RoActemra (tocilizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Orencia (abatacept). All drugs, except infliximab, must be provided at the price agreed with the manufacturers through a confidential patient access scheme. The guidance is out for consultation and is likely to be published in October.</p><p><p>
