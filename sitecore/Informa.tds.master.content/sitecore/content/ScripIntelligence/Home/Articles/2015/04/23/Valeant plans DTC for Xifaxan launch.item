<p><p>When the company isn't running around making acquisitions, Valeant is trying to squeeze growth out of its current products, said CFO Howard Schiller on its 29 April first quarter conference call. </p><p>The Canadian company believes the best way to do that is through a strong sales force and direct-to-consumer campaigns. </p><p>"We have also decided to take a more focused targeting of the primary care market. We plan to cover the primary care market through our specialty sales force, coupled with extensive direct-to-consumer campaign once the IBS-D indication for Xifaxan is improved," said Valeant Chairman and CEO J. Michael Pearson. </p><p>Valeant expects the approval of Xifaxan for irritable bowel syndrome &ndash; diarrhea (IBS-D) from the FDA in May. The company intends to hit the ground running and will base its launch strategy off its earlier success for the antifungal Jublia. </p><p>"So in terms of the launch, we'll actually start promoting the next day. We use the package insert, just like we did with Jublia and Onexton. Then we'll prepare the marketing materials, review with the FDA, develop a DTC campaign and then we'll do a formal launch meeting later in the summer. But we'll be able to promote off the package insert the very next day," said Pearson. </p><p>Both Jublia and the acne drug Onexton have had strong support from DTC campaigns, particularly television commercials. "On April 20 we launched a new television campaign featuring John McEnroe, which is already having a positive impact on [Jublia]," said the CEO. "Next week we will be launching a Jublia 8-milliliter SKU as opposed to our current 4-milliliter SKU, with a $0 co-pay. At the end of Q2 we will be eliminating our $0 co-pay on the 4ml SKU. We expect this will further accelerate the growth of the brand."</p><p>Onexton launched earlier this quarter; the company began a DTC campaign on 06 April targeted at adult females and expects the product to have peak sales of $100m to $200m. </p><h2>Changing it up</h2><p>The company currently has three gastrointestinal sales forces that it "made minor adjustments to" to "maximize efficiency," said Pearson. Meanwhile, the company is doubling its hospital sales force and adding some legacy Valeant products into the rep's bag, and doubling the size of its federal sales team, while adding the foot fungus drug Jublia, the antifungal cream Luzu and the periodontal gum treatment Arestin to their offerings. </p><p>"Next, we have established a new sales force to provide greater attention to the pain community, promoting Relistor and other Valeant brands such as Migranal and Bupap. We expect significant revenue synergies to Valeant products which have historically not been actively promoted to either hospital, government entities, such as the DoD or pain specialists," added the exec. </p><p><p><p>
