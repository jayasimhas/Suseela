<p><p>While Bristol-Myers Squibb has been at the forefront of immuno-oncology, the big pharma has lagged behind competitors in some other therapeutic areas. The New York pharma is aiming to correct that by picking up a small cardiology focused biotech to get its hands on a mid-stage program that is high risk, but could also hold high reward. </p><p>Bristol-Myers announced Nov. 2 that it is paying $300m upfront and has agreed to pay another $1.8bn in potential milestones to purchase all outstanding shares of privately-held North Carolina-based biotech Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc. </p><p>The draw of the biotech is its lead compound, a Phase II drug called CXL-1427 that is an intravenous treatment for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). CXL-1427 transforms into nitroxyl once in the body and is able to boost heart muscle function and improve blood flow. Early studies have shown that the drug may not increase heart rate, potentially making it a differentiator from other compounds on the market. </p><p>Expected to close in the fourth quarter, the deal provides BMS with a mid-stage compound that could potentially serve a large market. Yet, BioMedTracker places the likelihood of approval at 12%, 1% below the average. </p><p>But BMS needs to fill its cardiovascular pipeline if it's going to stay dedicated to the space. Currently, the anticoagulant <i>Eliquis</i> (apixaban) is its only newer cardiovascular drug on the market, while it still has older drugs like <i>Coumadin</i> (warfarin) that are competing in highly genericized markets. The big pharma only has three drugs in its cardiovascular pipeline &ndash; two in Phase I and another in Phase II. </p><p>According to BioMedTracker, there are 13 other drugs in the pipeline for the indication, including one other from Cardioxyl &ndash; CXL-1020, also in Phase II. The biotech also has a preclinical molecule in its pipeline dubbed CXL-1036 for congestive heart failure. </p><p>Adding to its pipeline is just the first hurdle for BMS in cardiovascular disease. The therapeutic area is plagued by costly, long-term clinical trials that need to include large numbers of patients. Should BMS be able to move these compounds through late-stages, it will face a competitive market that is flooded with low-cost generics. </p><p>Eliquis and the other anticoagulants that entered the market in the last few years faced an uphill battle and were all slow starters. Major marketing pushes from their big pharma sponsors have been their only saving grace. More recently, Novartis launched the oral heart drug <i>Entresto</i> (secukinumab). It was only able to pull in about $16m in the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Entresto-Hurdles-Dog-Novartis-361259" target="_new">recently reported third quarter</a>, raising eyebrows from analysts &ndash; Novartis claims reimbursement for Medicare Part D patients has been a problem. </p><p><p>
