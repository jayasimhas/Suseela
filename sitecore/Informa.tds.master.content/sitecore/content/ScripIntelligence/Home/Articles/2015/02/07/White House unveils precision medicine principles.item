<p>The White House on 8 July unveiled a set of principles aimed at ensuring privacy and trust are built into each step of President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI).</p><p>The principles are intended to guide actions involving governance, transparency, reciprocity, respect of participant preferences, data sharing, quality and integrity of information and its security, officials said.</p><p>"The principles articulate a set of core values and responsible strategies for engendering public trust and maximizing the possible benefits of a large national research cohort, while minimizing the risks inherent in large-scale data collection, analysis and sharing," the White House said.</p><p>The principles also are intended to guide the development of the PMI's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">one-million person research cohort</a>, said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p>The White House said the principles evolved out of a series of roundtables it convened and a review and analysis by a special work group of the available literature on bioethics and the frameworks for other existing cohorts.</p><p>The work group concluded that a parallel process should be undertaken to develop a robust data security framework for the PMI with input from experts in security, data science, health IT and ethics and should draw on industry best practices in identifying strong administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of all cohort specimens and data.</p><p>They said that framework should be reevaluated regularly to "keep pace with an ever-advancing technological environment."</p><p>The White House said the PMI cohort should be planned and conducted in partnership with participants, researchers, healthcare providers, the federal government and other stakeholders &ndash; a process that already is underway. </p><p>Indeed, Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, noted during an 8 July White House forum that his agency already had engaged a broad spectrum of stakeholders in a series of workshops &ndash; with the most recent one held <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trust-Precision-medicine-effort-fails-without-it-359222" target="_new">last week</a> over two days.</p><p>In its principles, the White House called for a central governance system for PMI, which it said should be "highly dynamic and transparent" to ensure continuous assessment of policies and practices, and should maintain currency with scientific, technological and ethics-related developments. </p><p>It said the governance mechanisms should include substantive participant and community representation at all levels of program oversight, design and implementation. </p><p>Officials said the governance mechanisms also should ensure accountability, responsible data management and should protect against unauthorized or inappropriate access, use disclosure or re-identification of PMI cohort data. </p><p>To ensure participants remain adequately informed throughout participation in the cohort, the White House said information should be provided at the point of initial engagement and periodically thereafter. </p><p>"Information should be communicated to participants clearly and conspicuously concerning: how, when, and what information and specimens will be collected and stored; generally how their data will be used, accessed, and shared; the goals, potential benefits, and risks of participation; the types of studies for which the individual's data may be used; the privacy and security measures that are in place to protect the participant's data; and the participant's ability to withdraw from the cohort at any time, with the understanding that data included in aggregate data sets or used in past studies and studies already begun cannot be withdrawn," the White House said.</p><p>Mr Deese said the White House is accepting comments on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/pmi_privacy_and_trust_principles_july_2015.pdf" target="_new">set of principles</a> until 7 August.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
