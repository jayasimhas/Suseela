<p>Novo Nordisk's recombinant coagulation Factor VIII product NovoEight (turoctocog alfa) for haemophilia A appears to have inched closer to an approval in India after a key expert panel exempted it from local trial requirements.</p><p>Last month a subject expert committee (SEC), which advises the Indian regulator on trial-related permissions as part of a layered approval process, opined that since the drug is used for a rare and life threatening disease and is already marketed in the US, EU and Japan the requirement of clinical trials may be waived and marketing authorization be granted subject to certain conditions.</p><p>Novo Nordisk will be required to undertake a Phase IV study for assessment of safety and development of inhibitors on at least 50 Indian subjects and the protocol for that will need to be submitted before initiation of marketing the product in India, the SEC (haematology) said.</p><p>India currently follows a three-tier review process for clinical trials, under which applications are initially evaluated by specialized SECs. The recommendations of the SECs are then vetted by a technical review committee and finally cleared by an "apex committee".</p><p>Novo Nordisk confirmed that it had submitted a New Drug Application for turoctocog alfa and said that it was awaiting the decision of the health authorities. </p><p>"[The] Regulatory approval process involves multiple steps and we expect to know the final outcome in few months' time. Novo Nordisk adheres to all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines and would be fully compliant with all requirements specified by the Drugs Controller General of India," the company told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>India currently provides for a waiver of clinical trials in the Indian population for new drugs, which have already been approved outside India, only in cases of "national emergency, extreme urgency, epidemics and for orphan drugs for rare diseases and drugs indicated for conditions/diseases for which there is no therapy".</p><p>Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven (recombinant Factor VIIa) is already available on the Indian market.</p><h2>Re-deliberated</h2><p>Notably, the SEC suggested at a meeting in January this year that Novo Nordisk conduct Phase III trials in Indian patients for turoctocog alfa. </p><p>The SEC then observed that the drug had been "shortly" marketed in EU and Japan with patient exposure of approximately 100 each and had not yet been launched in US. </p><p>Novo Nordisk, however, requested that the matter be reconsidered and sought a trial waiver and based on the "additional information and relevant facts", the matter was re-deliberated. </p><p>In March this year, Novo Nordisk said it expected to make NovoEight for haemophilia A available in the US by mid-April. A company statement then said NovoEight was shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials with "zero inhibitors" confirmed in 213 previously treated patients with haemophilia A. </p><p>Last month Novo Nordisk said that interim data from its Guardian 2 extension trial, showed that in a Phase III trial, NovoEight provided long-term efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in people with severe haemophilia A.</p><p>Significantly, earlier this year Novo Nordisk filed a declaratory judgement complaint in the US district court of New Jersey in response to what it claimed was baseless charge by its US rival Baxter, which alleged that NovoEight infringed some of its patents. Novo Nordisk said that the allegations were intended to "interfere" with its lawful competition with Baxter. Baxter is said to have filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Novo Nordisk in April. </p><p>The latest position on these could not be immediately ascertained.</p><p>Last year, Novo Nordisk reported <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Positive-Phase-III-data-with-Novo-Nordisks-hemophilia-A-follow-on-350769" target="_new">positive pivotal data</a> from the first Phase III trial of N8-GP (turoctocog alfa pegol), its follow-on product to NovoEight. </p>
