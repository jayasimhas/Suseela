<p>FDA drug reviewers on 27 April questioned the study design and results of Amgen's oncolytic immunotherapy T-Vec (talimogene laherparepvec) &ndash; declaring there is "uncertainty" about the meaningfulness of the observed responses in the firm's single Phase III study of the product in treating injectable regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma.</p><p>The FDA scientists also said there may have been patient and investigator bias involved in the study, which they said "could have had substantial impact on the results of the survival analysis" of T-Vec.</p><p>Shares of Amgen slipped 3.8% on 27 April, before closing at $162.38, down $5.53, or 3.3%.</p><p>Based on the briefing documents, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, lowered its likelihood T-Vec would make it to the US market in melanoma from 87% to 80%, which is 2% below the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Specifically, US regulators raised concerns with the appropriateness of the control in Amgen's trial, known as study 005/05; the differential outcome assessments in the two arms; the reliability of response assessments; the meaningfulness of the primary endpoint of durable response rate; the absence of a clear effect on overall survival; and limited evidence there was a systemic effect with T-Vec, which is based on a genetically modified herpes virus type 1 &ndash; the virus that causes most cold sores.</p><p>T-Vec is intended to be injected directly into cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal lesions, resulting in selective lysis, or breakdown, of the injected tumor cells, but not the normal tissue. </p><p>The result, according to Amgen, is the release and presentation of tumor-derived antigens and local expression of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to initiate a systemic anti-tumor immune response that also induces regression of noninjected and distant lesions.</p><p>In briefing documents released ahead of a 29 April joint meeting of the FDA's Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (CTGTAC) and Oncologic Drugs (ODAC) Advisory Committees, regulators went out of their way to note the agency has the regulatory flexibility to consider Amgen's biologics license application (BLA) for T-Vec for an accelerated approval for either the proposed indicated population or a subgroup. </p><p>But Amgen isn't seeking an accelerated approval and didn't include any statements in its BLA to support that pathway.</p><p>So the FDA said it will stick with asking the CTGTAC-ODAC to only vote on a traditional approval for T-Vec.</p><p><b>Multiple options</b></p><p>When development first got underway about a decade ago of T-Vec, which Amgen obtained in 2011 through its $1bn acquisition of BioVex, the treatment landscape for melanoma was quite different, with options limited to high-dose interleukin-2 and dacarbazine &ndash; neither of which have been demonstrated to prolong overall survival.</p><p>But in the past five years, newer drugs, like immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab); BRAF inhibitors, including Genentech's and Daiichi Sankyo's Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and GlaxoSmithKline's Mekinist (trametinib) and Tafinlar (dabrafenib); and programmed death 1 inhibitors, such as BMS' Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), have entered the US market.</p><p>Yervoy and Zelboraf have been shown to prolong overall survival, while Mekinist and Tafinlar have demonstrated delay of disease progression. Opdivo and Keytruda &ndash; the newest melanoma drugs &ndash; have demonstrated improvements in durable objective response rates. </p><p>"Thus, patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma now have multiple systemic treatment options," the FDA's reviewers pointed out in the briefing documents.</p><p>So Amgen may have an uphill battle in convincing the FDA's CTGTAC-ODAC panelists to back T-Vec, especially given the concerns raised by the agency's reviewers about the company's trial, which was a multicenter, open-label, randomized study comparing the drug to GM-CSF in 436 patients with stages IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma that was not surgically resectable.</p><p>Amgen reported there was a statistically significant higher durable response rate, including complete responses or partial responses, maintained for at least six months with T-Vec, versus GM-CSF.</p><p>Regulators noted that at the time study 005/05 was initiated, GM-CSF was in clinical studies, with no concrete evidence of its efficacy. Therefore, it was selected as the comparator to control for any activity &ndash; either therapeutic or adverse &ndash; due to the control alone. </p><p>But, the FDA's scientists said, if the study investigators or patients viewed the control as unlikely to have any therapeutic effect, "then their bias in favor of the talimogene laherparepvec arm may have influenced the study conduct and the study results." </p><p>Under the protocol, the patients were supposed to receive treatment for 24 weeks, even in the presence of disease progression, including the appearance of new lesion, or achievement of a complete response. </p><p>But the FDA said there was a high withdrawal rate from the study before the protocol-specified 24 weeks: 172, or 58.3%, in the T-Vec arm, versus 106, or 75.1%, in the control.</p><p>In addition, there were four patients randomized to the T-Vec arm who never received the drug, versus 14 patients, or 9.9%, who didn't get the GM-CSF control product. </p><p>Patient or investigator bias about the relative benefit of T-Vec and the control "may have influenced the determination" it was in the best interest of the patient to stop treatment or to be given other therapy for melanoma, the FDA's scientists said.</p><p>And, they said, the patients who dropped out early would not have had any opportunity to receive further treatment or tumor response assessment, and thus, "had less chance to respond to the treatment or to be assessed as durable responders."</p><p>Given the uncertainty about the clinical meaningfulness of study 005/05's primary endpoint results, the absence of a clear effect on overall survival with T-Vec and the fact there are multiple treatment options available for US melanoma patients, regulators said it's unclear if Amgen's drug offers an "acceptable benefit-risk profile" for the proposed indicated population.</p><p><b>An appropriate alternative?</b></p><p>But the FDA's scientists also managed to throw Amgen a bone &ndash; declaring there may be some melanoma patients for whom T-Vec may be an appropriate alternative to the currently approved therapies.</p><p>Amgen is indeed arguing that with the toxicities associated with the BRAF and checkpoint inhibitors and the fact that the overall benefit-risk profiles of those medicines have been determined primarily in patients with the most advanced stages of melanoma, "an unmet medical need exists for additional treatment options that can provide patients with regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma an opportunity to achieve durable responses with a favorable safety profile."</p><p>"Melanoma is a complex cancer that requires the use of multiple treatment modalities for patients over the evolution of their disease," Amgen said in separate briefing documents. "Despite recent advances in therapy, not all patients currently benefit and there is a need for additional treatment options in this population."</p><p>"Given the recent FDA oncology decisions, I wouldn't be surprised if the FDA approved T-Vec with a narrow-ish label, regardless of what the panel says," said <i>BioMedTracker</i> analyst Jolene Lau.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
