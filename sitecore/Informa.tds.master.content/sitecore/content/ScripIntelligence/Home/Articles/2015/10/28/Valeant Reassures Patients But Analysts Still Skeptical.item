<p><p>Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. reminded people this week that the recent debacle with its specialty pharmacy operation was not just about the loss of hundreds of dollars in share price but about real patients who need access to prescriptions. While Valeant is taking steps to stem the bleeding of its business, the market is considering worst case scenarios. </p><p>Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson sent a letter to physicians on Nov. 2 explaining that the recent separation from Philidor will not cause a disruption of prescriptions to patients and that the company is in the process of putting in place new distribution avenues. </p><p>"We know many doctors and patients were concerned about the recent allegations surrounding Philidor&rsquo;s business practices, and so were we. Over the weekend, we developed an interim program to help provide an orderly transition, in anticipation of the wind down of Philidor&rsquo;s operations," wrote the exec. </p><p>Valeant's plan includes protocols for the next week as operations with Philidor are unwound and then other instructions for after Nov. 9. </p><p>For the next week, all prescriptions submitted to Philidor will be filled at no cost to the patient, including all auto-refills. No insurance claims will be made and Valeant will pay for the cost of drugs through Nov. 8 to all cash pay and commercially insured patients. </p><p>Beyond Nov. 9, Valeant is developing a program to make its drugs more available through major pharmacy chains for zero dollar copays for commercially insured patients and will make a $35 copay available to those patients that need a cash pay option. Patients in the auto-refill program will be helped to transition to another pharmacy and "over the next few months we will work to develop a new, more comprehensive program to ensure your patients can continue to have access to Valeant&rsquo;s products at affordable prices," the letter said. </p><p>Philidor also issued a statement on Nov. 2 saying it will work to fill prescriptions as operations are sound down and will help employees find other opportunities. </p><p>The letter comes just <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ackman-Philidor-Is-No-Big-Deal-Buy-Valeant-361323" target="_new">a week after</a> Valeant terminated its relationship with specialty pharmacy Philidor after allegations came to light that the company was engaging in misconduct to stuff inventory channels and changing patient prescriptions to Valeant products. </p><p>It's unclear yet if any of the conduct by Philidor was illegal or how much Valeant will be held accountable. But most analysts agree that there is a major fine in Valeant's future as well as a hit to revenues from the loss of the distribution channel &ndash; Philidor and specialty pharmacies account for about 7%, $550m, of Valeant annual revenues. </p><p><b>Downward Momentum</b></p><p>Analysts are in disagreement in how all of this is going to play out for Valeant, but they virtually all agree that the downside hasn't ended yet. Valeant has already lost nearly half of the value of its stock since mid-October when accusations began, and even more of its value prior to that. The stock is currently trading near $97 per share, down from its 52-week high of $263 apiece. Some analysts believe the only bottom will be $0. </p><p>"We have long been skeptical of VRX&rsquo;s high-speed roll-up strategy and the associated high debt levels, heavy historical reliance on price increases (US business), and what has become a complicated global business managed in a de-centralized manner. Ongoing political and media scrutiny, legal risk, and the notion that 'other shoes could drop' make it difficult to call the timing of a bottom on this one," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert in a Nov. 2 note. </p><p>Meanwhile BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei believes Valeant will lose 80% of its specialty pharmacy business, or roughly one-third of its US dermatology business. He also expects the company to lower its revenue forecasts for the year from current estimates of $7.5bn. </p><p>Ultimately, analysts believe Valeant has to get its name out of the headlines and reduce its exposure to Philidor and specialty pharmacies, in general. Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse said it best when he noted that Valeant needs to isolate and contain the specialty pharmacy "contagion." </p><p>The company will likely have to work on paying down its high debt levels and will be constrained from acting on its normally acquisitive business model. Valeant will also have to put some price controls in place due to pressures from the Senate and the public regarding <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">high drug prices</a>. This will put pressure on its overall ability to bring in revenues. </p><p><p>
