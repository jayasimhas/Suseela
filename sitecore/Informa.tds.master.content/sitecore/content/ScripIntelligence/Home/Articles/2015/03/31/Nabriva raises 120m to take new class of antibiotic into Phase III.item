<p>Nabriva Therapeutics, which is developing a new class antibiotics called pleuromutilins, has raised $120m in a series B financing involving a group of transatlantic investors. CEO Colin Broom told Scrip there was no key piece of data that secured the cash, but rather the "a package combining data from 450 treated patients" including a 200-patient Phase II efficacy trial.</p><p>The financing was led by new US-based investors Vivo Capital and OrbiMed, and included EcoR1 Capital, Boxer Capital of Tavistock Life Sciences and existing investors HBM, Phase4 Partners, Wellcome Trust, GLSV and Novartis Venture Fund. </p><p>The initial tranche of $50m will enable Nabriva, which is based in Vienna, to progress its lead product, lefamulin (formerly BC 3781), into Phase III studies in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) later this year. Final details of the Phase III trial have yet to be settled with the US FDA but it will be powered to support both US and European filings, said Dr Broom.</p><p>"There are certain triggers in place to ensure that the additional $70m funding is available, when required, to complete the two Phase III studies and submit an NDA/MAA for lefamulin." </p><p>Lefamulin is the first systemically available pleuromutilin for human use and Dr Broom is not aware of any currently active pleuromutilin development programs. Lefamulin has been found to be active in vitro against the most common pathogens associated with CABP, specifically <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, <i>H. influenzae</i>, <i>M. catarrhalis</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, <i>L. pneumophila</i>, and C<i>. pneumoniae</i>, including multi-drug resistant strains. There are also plans to explore its potential for "pediatric uses and additional indications including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and several other indications such as sexually transmitted infections (including MDR gonorrhea) and osteomyelitis. "It's practically a pipeline in itself," said Dr Broom. </p><p>Lefamulin is being developed in both IV and oral formulations. Dr Broom said patients enrolled in the Phase III trials would initially be treated with the IV formulation, and then switched to the oral treatment when they improved, enabling them to be released from hospital. </p><p>Dr Chen Yu, managing partner at Vivo Capital, who joins Nabriva's supervisory board (along with Chau Khuong from OrbiMed) said: "We believe Nabriva is one of a few development stage companies with a truly novel antibiotic product ready for Phase III studies and with a clear path to commercialization. We are pleased to support the company as it enters its next stage of growth."</p><p>Dr Broom expects to begin Phase III trials in the second half of this year, with top-line data in early 2017 and an initial filing in early 2018. </p><p>In 2012, Forest Laboratories <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Forest-plants-Nabriva-acquisition-seed-with-25M-antibiotics-deal-331425" target="_new">took an option to acquire Nabriva</a> as part of a co-development deal covering lefamulin, which expired after 12 months owing to "business reasons" prior to its acquisition by Actavis, said Dr Broom. </p><p>Dr Broom took over as CEO of Nabriva last year. He was formerly the CSO of ViroPharma <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-to-pay-4.2bn-for-rare-disease-firm-ViroPharma-348012" target="_new">before its $4.2bn acquisition by Shire</a>. </p><p>"My first task was to go out and raise these funds," he noted. He has also built up a clinical development operation in Philadelphia and says Nabriva intends to commercialize lefamulin by itself in the US. "But we'll look at partnering outside of the US," he added.</p><p>Nabriva was spun out Sandoz, the generics arm of Novartis, in 2006 with funding from a &euro;42m series A round involving Phase4 Ventures, HBM, the Wellcome Trust, Global Life Sciences Ventures and the Novartis Venture Funds. The same group of investors invested a further &euro;15m in October 2009. </p><p>
