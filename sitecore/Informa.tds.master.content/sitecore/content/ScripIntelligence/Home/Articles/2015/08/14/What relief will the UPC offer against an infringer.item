<p><b>In his latest column on the future Unified Patent Court, Paul England outlines the remedies that will be available to injured parties in the case of infringement, and argues that the court will be a powerful forum for the enforcement of patent rights in Europe</b>.</p><p>If a party is held by a Unified Patent Court panel to have infringed a unitary patent or bundle of classical European patents, what relief is available to the patentee or their licensee? The UPC provides a number of possible remedies to the injured party, not only after a final decision but also on a preliminary basis. </p><p>The principal final remedies in the UPC, as in the national courts, are the grant of a permanent injunction and an award of damages. The purpose of an injunction is to prevent any further infringing activity. Damages are intended, as near as possible, to compensate the injured party financially for the harm caused by the infringement, such as lost sales or royalties, and the profits made by the infringer. However, there is no punitive element to damages in the UPC. </p><p>Damages will be awarded if the infringer knew or had reasonable grounds to know that they were infringing the patent. Otherwise &ndash; for "innocent" infringements &ndash; the court has discretion as to whether to award damages. There are other remedies available in the UPC: these include a declaration of infringement, ordering that the infringing products are recalled or "definitively removed" from the marketplace, and orders for the destruction of products.</p><h2>Provisional relief</h2><p>The UPC panels also have the power to order a number of preliminary (provisional) measures, early in infringement proceedings, against a party that is suspected of infringing a patent. These again include orders for the seizure or delivery up of goods, but also extend to measures to assist the recovery of damages, such as the seizure of a defendant's property and the blocking of their bank accounts. </p><p>Preliminary injunctions will be possible to prevent &ldquo;any imminent infringement&rdquo; of a patent. But a preliminary injunction is not guaranteed. The UPC panels will use their discretion as to whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, weighing up the interests of the parties and the potential harm that could be caused to them if the injunction is ordered. They may also require reasonable evidence that the patent in question is valid and that it is being infringed, or that such infringement is imminent. </p><p>The UPC panels must have regard to any &ldquo;unreasonable delay&rdquo; by a party seeking provisional measures. Therefore, urgency will also be required from applicants, although the degree of urgency is yet to be established.</p><h2>Scope of injunctions and damages</h2><p>An injunction based on a unitary patent will take effect across all EU member states except Spain and Croatia, which are not participating in the unitary patent. Italy is not currently taking part either, although it recently expressed its intention to do so.</p><p>Injunctions based on European patents (that are not opted-out) will have effect in all the validating countries so long as they are contracted to the UPC Agreement. Similarly, damages will be assessed for every country in which the infringement before the UPC has occurred.</p><p>The pan-European nature of the remedies available in the UPC means that it is a potentially powerful forum for patentees and licensees to enforce their rights.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at law firm Taylor Wessing</i>.</p>
