<p><p>Feeling pressured by the approval of a biosimilar Copaxone and by the increasing likelihood that Mylan will be out of its league once it acquires Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceuticals has finally jumped into the M&A fray with an $82 per share bid for Mylan. Meanwhile, Perrigo is playing hard to get. </p><p>The Israeli pharma confirmed the speculation 21 April, making a $40bn bid for its generics competitor. Teva said it would conduct the acquisition with 50% stock and 50% cash and that the deal would be accretive within three years. The proposed acquisition price was a 48% premium to Mylan's stock price on 10 March, the day before speculation about the merger began. Mylan's share price rose 9% on the news to linger near $75 per share the day the proposed merger was announced. Meanwhile, Teva stock moved up slightly. </p><p>Teva claims the "combined company would leverage its significantly more efficient and advanced infrastructure, with enhanced scale, production network, end-to-end product portfolio, commercialization capabilities and geographic reach." Adding that a combined Teva/Mylan "would focus on complex technologies and more durable and sustainable products, in combination with robust capabilities in specialty drug development and commercialization," allowing the company to be able to compete more efficiently in a rapidly changing pharma environment. </p><p>Amongst those claims, Teva believes the combined company could have about $2bn in synergies annually. In 2018, the combined company is expected to have cash flow from operations of greater than $8.5 billion, revenues of approximately $33 billion and EBITDA of approximately $13 billion, according to Teva. </p><p>The deal definitely make sense for Teva, which recently lost its battle to keep a generic of its best-selling multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) off the US market. The FDA <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SandozMomenta-nab-1st-US-generic-Copaxone-launch-unclear-357920" target="_new">gave the greenlight</a> to a biosimilar made by Novartis' Sandoz unit of the blockbuster drug on 16 April. The generic drug will be marketed by Sandoz in the US as Glatopa and was approved at the 20mg once-daily dosage &ndash; it's unclear when the drug will be launched. One positive for Teva: Glatopa's labeling makes it clear the 20mg/mL is not interchangeable with the 40mg/mL dose of brand-name Copaxone. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat pointed out that Teva has switched over 67% of Copaxone volume to the 40mg formulation, which has patent protection until 2030.</p><p>Beyond the now inevitable competition for its most important drug, Teva has a scattering of patent expiries coming and a pipeline that hasn't given investors much confidence. </p><p>"The Mylan deal could create a new generics powerhouse with more than $27 billion in revenue and establish Teva as the leader in the space, setting the stage for growth in post generic Copaxone world," wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a 21 April note. </p><p>Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry added in his own note that that the Teva/Mylan transaction is not likely to take place at current levels and that Teva would likely have to up its offer to $88 per share. "Given</p><p>MYL's public denouncement of the deal and the fact that hostile bids have low success rates, we believe TEVA will need to up its bid ($85-88/shr) and even then we question whether the deal ultimately gets done," he wrote in the sameday note. </p><h2>Mylan's reaction</h2><p>Mylan <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylans-Coury-on-Teva-deal-without-logic-357962" target="_new">wants none of it.</a> The generics company responded to speculation about a combined Teva/Mylan before the official bid was announced. "Such a combination is without sound industrial logic or cultural fit," said Mylan's executive chairman Robert Coury. He said Mylan had studied the potential combination of the two companies "for some time", and added that it was unlikely it would obtain antitrust clearance given the "significant overlap" in their businesses.</p><p>In an effort to proactively stave off the bid from Teva, Mylan <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-generic-consolidation-Mylan-goes-after-Perrigo-357722" target="_new">announced 08 April</a> that it made an unsolicited offer to Perrigo for $29bn, or $205 per share. The offer, which was made privately on 06 April, is a 25% premium to Perrigo's closing price of $163.73 on 02 April &ndash; the last trading day before the offer was made. The deal would be a mix of cash and stock. Mr Coury added in a letter to Perrigo's CEO Joseph Papa, "We have complementary operations across all of our businesses, both from a product and geographic perspective. . .the combination of our companies would result in an unmatched global platform, substantial revenue and operating synergies, and enhanced long-term growth potential."</p><h2>Let's stay single</h2><p>Perrigo has thrown a wrench into Mylan's plans and could make things easier for Teva to play the role of acquirer. Perrigo announced 21 April in a statement of its own that the Mylan offer "substantially undervalues Perrigo&rsquo;s differentiated global business" and that the deal "does not take into account Perrigo&rsquo;s innovative new product pipeline, which is expected to generate nearly $1 billion in net sales over the next three years."</p><p>Perrigo Chairman Joe Papa added in the statement, "With the acquisition of Omega Pharma, we are a top five global OTC company with a diversified portfolio, a leading market position in key franchises and a strong and established global distribution platform. We will continue to capitalize on our durable competitive position by expanding our international platform organically and through future synergistic deals."</p><p><p><p>
