<p>India's Emcure Pharmaceuticals has joined an unenviable list of local firms under fire from the US FDA for deviations in good manufacturing practice (GMP).</p><p>The FDA on 13 July placed under import alert a range of drugs manufactured at Emcure's Hinjewadi site in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The agency, though, has excluded from the alert a clutch of products including amikacin, ondansetron, prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, zoledronic acid, cidofovir, carmustine and haloperodil.</p><p>It's not immediately clear if any of the products under the import alert were being manufactured for partner firms. </p><p>Details in Emcure's 2013 draft red herring IPO prospectus refer to how the Indian firm is an "important outsourcing partner" to Teva for oral solids pharmaceutical products for the US market. Emcure, which was reported to have subsequently withdrawn its plans to go public, has nine manufacturing facilities - eight in India and one in the US.</p><p>The prospectus also refers to how Emcure's "advanced" manufacturing facilities had helped it establish or initiate relationships with companies such as Pfizer, Roche, BMS and Teva and that many of these relationships are through "long-term and broad based manufacturing contracts."</p><p>Privately owned Emcure, which has emerged as quite a darling of large foreign firms seeking a deeper marketing and distribution push into India, did not immediately respond to requests for a comment on the FDA action. </p><p>Teva did not immediately respond on whether the FDA action against Emcure could have an impact, if any at all, on its supplies. </p><p>Indian firms such as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Wockhardts-compliance-improving-as-FDA-woes-ease-357392" target="_new">Wockhardt</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ipca-slumps-after-US-import-alert-ripple-effect-fears-356336" target="_new">Ipca</a>, among others, have, over the recent past, been under the lens after the US FDA issued import alerts at their facilities. Most firms have, however, emphasized a slew of efforts underway to improve compliance at their sites. </p><p>"FDA standards are tough and Indian firms have to meet these challenges," an industry veteran told <i>Scrip</i>. He, though, underscored that regulatory action is not restricted to Indian firms.</p><p>Some analysts also referred to how the FDA's "hardware and software" requirements had been evolving and Indian companies would need to meet these standards.</p><p>"In due course, I see most frontline Indian companies graduating to becoming fully compliant," one analyst told <i>Scrip</i>, referring to efforts underway at some affected firms.</p><p>A <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Fewer-regulatory-snags-in-FY16-for-Indian-firms-report-359383" target="_new">report</a> by Fitch group company, India Ratings & Research (Ind-Ra), recently predicted that Indian drug manufacturers may face fewer regulatory hurdles in FY16 backed by strengthened quality and control processes. </p><p>Ind-Ra noted how in 2014, import alerts against Indian firms declined to eight from 21 in 2013 due to quality measures implemented by firms. </p><p>The report also sees double digit export growth likely led by fully operational US FDA sites on restored regulatory approvals, with the US likely to stay the top export market for the Indian industry.</p>
