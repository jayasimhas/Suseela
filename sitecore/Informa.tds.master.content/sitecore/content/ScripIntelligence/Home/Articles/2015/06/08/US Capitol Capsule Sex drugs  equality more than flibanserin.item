<p>With the vigorous debate that went on in a jam-packed room at the FDA's headquarters on 4 June between various members of the public over whether the agency should approve Sprout Pharmaceuticals' pill for boosting a woman's libido, one would think achieving equality in women's health revolved around sex dysfunction products alone. </p><p>Indeed, several people who testified at the FDA's public hearing were even on Capitol Hill a day earlier pleading for members of Congress to pressure US regulators into acting on Sprout's flibanserin &ndash; a lobbying effort some have called a calculated, well-funded publicity campaign by the company, known as "Even the Score," aimed at forcing the agency to put a "mediocre aphrodisiac with scary side effects" on the US market.</p><p>One message the FDA wanted to get across loud and clear at the meeting was that it fully rejects any assertions it is gender biased.</p><p>It remains an open question, for now, on whether the FDA will follow its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-female-sex-pill-but-multiple-caveats-358749" target="_new">advisory panel's recommendation</a> to put flibanserin on the US market, but with certain restrictions, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan and prescriber registration &ndash; a decision the agency is expected to make by 18 August.</p><p>But some at the FDA's meeting argued that flibanserin &ndash; worthy of approval of not &ndash; is the wrong vehicle in which to drive the conversation about ensuring sexual equality in healthcare for women and insisted there are better examples to show the agency has been lax on the matter.</p><p>Indeed, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) both have been condemned for being too slow to ensure women are equally represented in drug research.</p><p>One only need point to Sanofi&rsquo;s sleep aid Ambien and its related zolpidem generics in seeing how long it took the FDA to actually act on the differences in which drugs may affect women versus men &ndash; with the agency taking more than 20 years to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Next-morning-impairment-leads-to-lower-doses-for-zolpidem-sleep-aids-338962" target="_new">change the labeling in 2013</a> to lower the dose for women to about half of what was being prescribed because of how the active ingredient is metabolized based on gender. </p><p>After recognizing most government-funded clinical studies were largely only including men, Congress adopted a provision under the <i>NIH Revitalization Act of 1993</i> to require the inclusion of women in trials supported by the US biomedical research agency.</p><p>More than 20 years later, about half of the participants in NIH-funded studies are women. </p><p>But unfortunately, much of that research lacks subgroup analyses.</p><p>So in passing the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA)</i> in 2012, Congress told the FDA to take a closer look at the inclusion and analysis of demographic subgroups in applications for drugs, biologics and devices &ndash; including by sex, race, ethnicity and age &ndash; and report the agency's findings by August 2013.</p><p>In responding to that mandate, the FDA said that while progress had been made, gaps still remained in the full representation of women in clinical trials, analysis of the safety and effectiveness data by sex and making information about treatment differences readily available to women and their healthcare providers.</p><p>The agency also was under a requirement to come up with an action plan by August 2014, and in so doing, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-vows-more-sex-and-other-subgroup-diversity-353479" target="_new">FDA committed to taking 27 actions</a> intended to improve the completeness and quality of demographic subgroup data collected, reported and analyzed by drug makers; identify barriers for enrolling diverse populations in clinical trials and employ strategies to encourage greater participation; and make subgroup data more transparent and available to the public. </p><p>Some of the FDA's actions were aimed at reminding biopharmaceutical makers to increase the diversity of clinical trial participants &ndash; taking into account the disease prevalence in demographic subgroups in the US.</p><p>This past November, the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-launches-Snapshot-subgroup-data-website-355215" target="_new">launched a new website</a>, dubbed Drug Trials Snapshot, intended to provide information about who was in the clinical trials for newly approved drugs and whether various demographic groups were part of the consideration of safety and efficacy in the applications submitted to the agency.</p><p>After recognizing much of the preclinical research in the US had neglected sex-based considerations and predominantly used male animals, NIH Director Dr Francis Collins and Dr Janine Austin Clayton, director for the agency's Office of Research on Women&rsquo;s Health, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-to-balance-sex-in-cell-and-animal-studies-1.15195" target="_new">announced a plan</a> in May 2014 to roll out new policies aimed at changing those failures &ndash; although completing that process has been slow.</p><p>Drs Collins and Clayton noted the reasons for male focus in animal-model selection typically centered on concerns about confounding contributions from the oestrous cycle. </p><p>"But for most applications, female mice tested throughout their hormone cycles display no more variability than males do, as confirmed in a meta-analysis" published in 2014, they argued. </p><p>This past September, the NIH issued a so-called "request for information" (RFI) on the consideration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in biomedical research to gather input from the scientific community and other interested stakeholders.</p><p>In the RFI, the NIH asked whether considering SABV affected the reproducibility, rigor or generalizability of research findings; what were the areas of science or phases of research that might benefit; what would be the main impediments; and how could the agency help facilitate such a consideration.</p><p>The vast majority of respondents to the RFI, which included professional associations, academic institutes and centers and advocacy groups, agreed the consideration of sex as a biological variable was an issue affecting the reproducibility, rigor or generalizability of research findings, according to a report posted on the agency's website late last month. </p><p>But the researchers and other stakeholders also raised concerns about practical matters, such as cost in a time of austerity and constraints on methodological and experimental design. </p><p>About half of the RFI respondents suggested the NIH should offer tangible resources to help with SABV policy implementation.</p><p>The NIH said it currently is working on developing the SABV training resources and scientific tools, such as courses, workshops and online resources, to help grant applicants, reviewers and internal program staff be prepared for the agency's new policy, which officials acknowledged is still pending.</p><p><b>In Other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Heart-of-FDAs-1st-PCSK9-review-population-ditching-statins-358772" target="_new">Heart of FDA's 1st PCSK9 review: population, ditching statins</a></p><p>FDA drug reviewers on 5 June had little safety or efficacy concerns about the first of the experimental proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors to come before the agency as a treatment to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in certain patients.
