<p>The annual Euro Health Consumer Index has just been published by Health Consumer Powerhouse, with the Netherlands' healthcare system coming out on top among 37 European countries.</p><p>In Europe for several years now, the shock of austerity has in some respects been mutating into the clich√© of austerity. The trope has become that austerity measures target healthcare budgets, with a disproportionately large knock-on effect (at least to the pharma industry's mind) on medicines spending. </p><p>Indeed, one of the chief effects of the austerity years across European healthcare provision, aside from increased waiting times, has been the slower inclusion of novel medicines in reimbursement systems, the report notes. </p><p>Now, this lingering focus on austerity is one that HCP's founder and president Johan Hjertqvist suggests we should move away from, in favour of highlighting best practice and achieving the best value for money. You can achieve more with less, if you are wise. Mr Hjertqvist notes in his introduction to the report that there is a surprising number of low and middle-income countries among those ranked as offering the best healthcare value for the money spent. By this measure, the Netherlands slips down to ninth place, below countries including FYR Macedonia, Estonia, Finland, Czech Republic and Iceland.</p><p>For pharma, this offers hope: drugs can represent good value, and value improvements are there to be seized, notably in the larger, richer markets.</p><p>Meanwhile, rather surprisingly, the financial crisis has actually had a relatively small impact on countries' performance by the nearly 48 indicators that contribute to the overall ranking, particularly when it comes to medical treatment outcomes. This the report puts down to output monitoring in healthcare having been so poor in the past. </p><p>This suggests another chink of light for pharma. If rigorous self-monitoring of effectiveness and the sharing and adoption of best practice are still in their infancy in European healthcare, then as austerity-induced monitoring matures there is room for hope both that the value of new medicines will be increasingly recognized, and also that savings from newly identified inefficiencies in systems can, as economies begin to grow again, be redirected towards medicines once more.</p>
