<p>Beximco Pharmaceuticals has tied with two leading firms including Sigma Pharmaceuticals to supply of pantoprazole to Australia &ndash; the first time a drug made in Bangladesh would be available in the nation.</p><p>Beximco's chief operating officer Rabbur Reza told <i>Scrip</i> that the company had its own registration for pantoprazole in Australia and had given access to its license to two companies so far including Sigma (now part of Aspen). The second partner firm is a leading generic player.</p><p>Pantoprazole supplies are being made from Beximco's Tongi site in Bangladesh.</p><p>''We are working on several molecules with a number of partners including Sigma and are talking to a few others. We have more than 15 products in the pipeline for the Australian market,'' Mr Reza told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The ophthalmic product latanoprost may be among the other products under consideration for the Australian market.</p><p>While the license with Sigma pertains only to the OTC version of pantoprazole, which is expected to hit the market in April, Beximco's other partner has access to both the prescription version that has been launched and the OTC offering. </p><p>The pantoprazole market in Australia is estimated to be valued at around $50m, with more than a dozen generic brands/players. The top three players there are Takeda (almost 40% market share), Apotex (22%) and Mylan (11%), data provided by Beximco suggested. Prescription products essentially drive the market, while the OTC segment has generally seen low volumes. </p><p>Beximco expects to participate in the prescription and the pharmacist-only segments in Australia for now. ''We are not going for pure OTC at this stage,'' Mr Reza added.</p><p>Beximco already supplies atorvastatin and pantoprazole to Germany and Austria for a European company under a contract manufacturing agreement. Mr Reza indicated that the company also hoped to enter five small Eastern European markets with these products in the first half of this year. </p><p>Last year, Beximco delivered its first consignment of a multivitamin/mineral product (marketed as SunVita Gold) to Romania under a contract manufacturing deal with a Romania-based firm <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bangladeshi-contract-manufacturing-expands-as-Beximco-ships-to-Romania-355092%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 November 2014)</a>. Beximco was also the first Bangladeshi firm to launch salbutamol HFA inhaler into Singapore in 2012.</p><p>The launches in Europe, though, have been a valuable learning experience for Beximco. Mr Reza said that while price was ''definitely one of the factors'', it was clear that the ''originator [firm] doesn't want generics to enter'' and these firms were also participating in tenders at a ''very competitive'' price.</p><p>''We've launched only at the retail level but our goal is that we will, with our partners, go for government supplies as well, because that's a big market. That is where we will be participating this year,'' Mr Reza said.</p><h3>FDA audit</h3><p>Meanwhile, Beximco may also be on course to another milestone, should it be able to go through successfully with a US FDA audit at its Tongi site. </p><p>The audit, which is underway, currently involves only the firm's oral solids site. ''We are hoping for the best,'' Mr Reza said.</p><p>No Bangladeshi pharma firm is believed to have a FDA-approved facility yet, though Square Pharmaceuticals, another leading Bangladeshi firm, has previously indicated that its dossiers had been accepted in the US and the firm was awaiting an FDA inspection <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Square-Beximco-lead-Bangladeshi-charge-for-slice-of-global-pie-34829%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 22 November 2013)</a>. </p><p>Beximco, which had earlier entered the US market via the acquisition of an ANDA for the antihypertensive drug carvedilol, has been readying for a larger play in the US <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Brick-by-brick-Bangladeshs-Beximco-builds-for-play-in-the-US-351856%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 May 2014)</a>. The company had made five ANDA filings with the US FDA and five additional filings were in the pipeline for submission, it said earlier.</p>
