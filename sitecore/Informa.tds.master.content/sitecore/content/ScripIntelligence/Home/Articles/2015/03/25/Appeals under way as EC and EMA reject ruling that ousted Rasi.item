<p>One of last year's most disruptive events for the European Medicines Agency was the loss of its executive director Guido Rasi, who had to step aside in November after the EU's civil service tribunal annulled the procedure that led to his appointment in 2011. </p><p>Both the EMA and the European Commission, which is responsible for running the recruitment process for executive directors of EU agencies, have appealed against the tribunal's ruling, and the grounds for those appeals are expected to be published in the Official Journal any day now.</p><p>The ruling by the civil service tribunal &ndash; which came three years into Professor Rasi's five-year tenure &ndash; was issued on the grounds that the procedure for drawing up the shortlist of candidates for the job was compromised by conflicts of interest. </p><p>The case had been brought by Emil Hristov, former head of the Bulgarian medicines agency, who had applied for the EMA job at the same time as Professor Rasi and a number of other candidates, but who failed to make the shortlist. Dr Hristov claimed that the fact there were EMA board members on the pre-selection panel could have led to favoritism towards two candidates (including Professor Rasi) who were also board members. </p><p>The commission argued that there were no rules preventing board members from either being on the pre-selection panel or applying for the executive director post. But the judges sided with Dr Hristov, citing conflicts of interest, a lack of impartiality, and failure to observe procedural rules. </p><p>The commission and EMA appeals were lodged with the EU's General Court at the end of January this year. It normally takes around two months for the Official Journal to publish the grounds for appeals, so publication in this case should be imminent.</p><p>Whatever the grounds, the matter of Professor Rasi's ousting is unlikely to be resolved any time soon: a commission spokesperson said that the appeals process can take anything between 12 and 18 months, so there may not be an outcome until autumn 2016. </p><p>Meanwhile, the process for the recruitment of a new executive director is well under way. Last month the commission revealed to Scrip's sister publication Scrip Regulatory Affairs that a total of 36 candidates had applied for the job. Just who they might be is open to speculation, although it has to be assumed that Professor Rasi is among them. </p><p>The recruitment process can take up to six months, but much depends on the complexity of the procedure and the number of people applying for the job. </p><p>Moreover, it is not clear what effect the eventual outcome of the appeals procedure might have: what if the General Court accepts the appeals and overturns the tribunal's ruling? This would mean in effect that Professor Rasi should not have had to step down. But what happens if someone else has by then been appointed to the position?</p>
