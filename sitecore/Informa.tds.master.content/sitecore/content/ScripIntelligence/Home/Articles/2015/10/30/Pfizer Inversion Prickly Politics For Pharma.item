<p>Certainly, Pfizer Inc. knew what it was doing when it decided to consider another possible merger under a tax inversion scheme in the midst of the high-stakes political battle ongoing in the US &ndash; bringing with such a move more condemnation of the entire biopharmaceutical industry, which already is under fire for certain firms' drug pricing practices and some shady looking relationships with specialty pharmacies.</p><p>Tax inversion is a practice in which American companies are reincorporating abroad through mergers and acquisitions to pay lower tax rates, while enjoying the benefits of keeping most of their operations in the US.</p><p>In this case, Pfizer would move its headquarters &ndash; or at least on paper &ndash; to Dublin, Ireland if it goes forward with a merger with Allergan PLC.</p><p>Allergan was first on Oct. 29 to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292" target="_new">confirm</a> the reports it had been approached by Pfizer for some preliminary "friendly" discussions about a potential business combination transaction, with the latter company soon corroborating that information in a statement of its own.</p><p>And Allergan investors loved it, while Wall Street was abuzz.</p><p>Shares of Allergan jumped 10.3% on Oct. 29, or $29.60, before closing at $304.38, up $17.18, or about 6%.</p><p>Pfizer investors, however, were much less enthused, even reluctant as the day wore on.</p><p>While Pfizer's shares got a 1.2% bump, the stock fell as low as 3.6%, before closing at $34.77, down 68 cents, or about 2%.</p><p>Pfizer <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Scrips-biggest-stories-of-2014-355841" target="_new">tried, and failed</a>, last year to do a tax inversion deal with UK-based AstraZeneca PLC.</p><p>But in so doing, Pfizer put the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizers-hot-pursuit-of-AZ-Fuel-for-more-tax-driven-mergers-351617" target="_new">ball in motion</a> in which the Obama administration and Capitol Hill decided it was time to take action to stop such transactions. </p><p>The momentum for that tax reform effort, however, has had its fits and starts over the past year.</p><p>But Pfizer may have just breathed new life into the matter.</p><p>"We assume political rhetoric around inversions may flare up again now," said Credit-Suisse Equity Research analyst Vamil Divan.</p><p>Indeed, it didn't take long for word of the potential Pfizer-Allergan deal to reignite the tax inversion issue among politicians.</p><p>"When corporations choose to invert and don't pay their fair share of taxes, they leave the rest of us to pick up the tab," Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (IL) said in a statement.</p><p>A spokesman for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told <i>Scrip</i> the Democratic presidential candidate frontrunner was "committed to cracking down" on inversions, "where a company chooses to leave the US on paper to game the tax system."</p><p>Clinton, the spokesman said, "believes that our entire economy benefits when companies invest for the long term, not when they undercut competition by consolidating markets or juice profits by gaming the tax code." </p><p>He said Clinton would like to see the American tax code reformed to "encourage investment in the US, rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas."</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Clinton's main rival in the Democratic race for the White House &ndash; with both declaring earlier this month they were proud to include the pharmaceutical industry <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Clinton-Sanders-Proud-Pharmas-An-Enemy-361031" target="_new">among their enemies</a> &ndash; argued that since Congress has failed to close the loopholes that have allowed tax inversion, President Barack Obama and the Treasury Department must do more to end the practice.</p><p>While White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Oct. 29 he could not comment specifically on a Pfizer-Allergan merger, he insisted President Obama's "passion for closing these kinds of corporate loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected has not changed."</p><p>The president, he said, has made it "quite clear that this is the kind of loophole that leaves a lot of Americans shaking their head and wondering why we've seen Republicans in Congress work so hard to aggressively protect corporate loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and not trying to look out for middle-class families and look out for the kinds of investments that we know are in the best interest of middle-class families &ndash; things like investments in research and development, investments in job training and education."</p><p>A Treasury spokesperson contended that the "targeted steps" the agency took <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-admin-takes-action-to-thwart-tax-inversion-354073" target="_new">last fall</a> to try to reduce the benefits of tax inversion transactions, like making it more difficult for companies to engage in certain tax-avoidance practices, such as "hopscotch" loans, in which an inverted firm makes a loan to the new foreign parent company with the intent of deferring American taxes, had an "important effect."</p><p>But the spokesperson argued that "only Congress can close this loophole entirely." </p><p>"The president has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-tax-inversion-needs-to-be-fixed-in-2015-355777" target="_new">called upon Congress</a> to do so, and more broadly, to reform our business tax system to make it simpler and more pro-growth," the spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>. "We are continuing our review of a broad range of options for further action, but there is a limit to what we can do administratively."</p><p>Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told <i>Scrip</i> in an emailed statement the talk of a Pfizer-Allergan tax inversion deal "appears to be another example of our anti-competitive tax code's pushing companies overseas." </p><p>"Until we can reform our tax code so we have a more globally competitive system, businesses will seek ways to limit their taxes in the United States in favor of foreign tax systems," Grassley said.</p><p>While the US is "at the leading edge of scientific and technological research and advancement, and the American pharmaceutical industry has long been the envy of the world" &ndash; making "transformational discoveries" &ndash; Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, said the nation's "broken, outdated tax code" is driving those firms overseas "at enormous cost." </p><p>Wyden said he was going to continue "beating the drum on tax reform until more members of Congress build up the political will to address this ongoing inversion crisis."</p><p>It remains unclear now whether a Pfizer inversion &ndash; and the loss to the US of the taxes the corporation pays &ndash; would be the mallet Wyden needs to bang his message louder.</p><p>But with President Obama and Capitol Hill leaders actually striking a deal on the budget and debt ceiling and Republicans coming together, after much anguish, to elect a new House speaker, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), tax reform may have a clearer path ahead.</p><p>Efforts to get it done, however, also are at risk of simply fading into the noise of the 2016 elections.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
