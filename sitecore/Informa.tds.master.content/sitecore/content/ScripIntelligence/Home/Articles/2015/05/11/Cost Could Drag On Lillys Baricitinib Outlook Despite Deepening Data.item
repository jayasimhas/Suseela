<p>Eli Lilly & Co. and partner Incyte Corp. have added to the growing dataset for their once-daily oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib ahead of their planned filing by year-end, with detailed results from the pivotal Phase III RA-BEAM which showed the investigational therapy had superior patient-reported outcomes compared with AbbVie's market-leading injectable anti-TNF antibody, Humira (adalimumab), along with better response claims and structural improvements for patients. </p><p>Detailed baricitinib data was also released at the joint meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and the Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals, held Nov. 6-11 in San Francisco from the Phase III trial RA-BEGIN, a non-inferiority study testing it against methotrexate in early rheumatoid arthritis, showing baricitinib alone and in combination were superior to methotrexate monotherapy in helping rheumatoid arthritis patients achieve clinical remission.</p><p>Lilly aims to submit baricitinib for FDA regulatory approval for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by the end of the year. If approved, the drug will represent a new therapeutic category for Lilly.</p><p>But competition in the rheumatoid arthritis market is intense. Injectable anti-TNFs dominate the market following treatment with older disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs like methotrexate. Nevertheless, Lilly sees an opportunity for an effective oral drug with a solid safety profile. </p><p>Baricitinib's clinical performance to date has been promising. As an oral small molecule, baricitinib has the potential to be positioned early in the RA treatment paradigm. However, Datamonitor Healthcare believes that its uptake will be largely driven by its cost, should the drug receive approval in RA. This assumption is based on the case of Xeljanz (Pfizer Inc.'s JAK inhibitor tofacitinib) in the US and Japan, where the oral small molecule was approved for use after conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs but has been relegated to later lines of therapy due to its high cost. </p><p>"We believes that if baricitinib is priced in line with its immediate competitor, Xeljanz, which is comparable to currently marketed biologics, it will mainly be used late in the RA treatment paradigm, targeting non-responders to TNF therapy," said Christina Vasiliou, Immunology & Inflammation Analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare. </p><p>Xeljanz has struggled to make significant inroads into the market despite being the first new oral option. Safety is a concern with Xeljanz, and the drug carries a black box warning on the risk of serious infections and malignancies. </p><p>FDA recently issued a "complete response" to Pfizer for its sNDA seeking to expand the use of Xeljanz to psoriasis, citing worries about safety and requesting further safety analysis.</p><h2>Baricitinib Data</h2><p>Lilley on Nov. 8 released deeper data from the RA-BEAM Phase III trial, which randomized 1,305 patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis with inadequate response to methotrexate to baricitinib, adalimumab or placebo (with crossover to treatment after 24 weeks). All of the study participants received background methotrexate therapy. </p><p>The update showed baricitinib at week 12 was statistically superior to Humira on ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 endpoints; composite scores representing at least a 20%, 50% and 70% improvement in multiple measures of RA disease activity. </p><p>At 52 weeks, baricitinib significantly improved all seven components of the ACR composite score compared to adalimumab, including reducing the number of tender and swollen joints, reducing patients&rsquo; pain, and improving physical function, the companies said.</p><p>Patient-reported outcomes in the RA-BREAM Phase III trial, including degree of tiredness and the severity and duration of morning joint stiffness, assessed daily for the first 12 weeks of the study, were all significantly improved with baricitinib compared to adalimumab.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first Phase III study showing that a once daily, oral treatment significantly improved clinical outcomes compared with injectable adalimumab for patients with active RA who were also receiving treatment with methotrexate,&rdquo; said Rich Levy, chief drug development officer at Incyte.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare's Vasiliou said: "The fact that baricitinib is an oral drug which demonstrated superiority to adalimumab means it has the potential to be positioned early in the RA treatment paradigm; again, we think it will all come down to cost but we expect Lilly to leverage its latest RA-BEAM data and its once-daily dosing to promote prescribing over Xeljanz."</p><p>Lilly and Incyte's release of deeper data from the RA-BEGIN Phase III trial at the joint meeting of the American College of Rheumatology and the Association of Rheumatology Health Professionals on Nov. 7 followed top-line announcements <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Another-Positive-Phase-III-For-Lillys-Incytes-Baricitinib-360738" target="_new">in September</a> and October.</p><p>The year-long RA-BEGIN non-inferiority study tested baricitinib 4 mg once daily as a monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate against methotrexate in 584 patients with early active rheumatoid arthritis who had not generally received treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Compared to methotrexate, a commonly used treatment for early rheumatoid arthritis, baricitinib as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate demonstrated improvements in all ACR components &ndash; such as swollen and tender joint counts, pain, patient and physician global assessment of disease activity and physical function &ndash; as early as week 1 and maintained through 52 weeks, the companies said.</p><p>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, including serious infections, was similar across treatment groups through week 52. No cases of tuberculosis or spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation were reported with the most common adverse events being consistent with previous studies of baricitinib in RA, the companies said. Compared to methotrexate, baricitinib monotherapy was associated with lower rates of liver abnormalities, lymphopenia and adverse events leading to interruption, while the combination of baricitinib plus methotrexate was associated with increases in non-serious infections and adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation, they added.</p><p>Baricitinib plus methotrexate also demonstrated significant inhibition of progressive radiographic joint damage versus methotrexate alone in RA-BEGIN, the third Phase III study of baricitinib in RA to show this finding.</p><p>Lilly and Incyte announced top-line results in December 2014 for the first Phase III trial of baricitinib, RA-BEACON, in February 2015 for the second, RA-BUILD, in September 2015 for the third, RA-BEGIN, and in October 2015 for the fourth, RA-BEAM. The companies plan to submit additional detailed data from all four studies for presentation in scientific meetings and publication in peer-reviewed journals in 2016. A fifth late-stage trial &ndash; RA-BEYOND &ndash; is assessing long-term effects.</p><p>
