<p>Lilly has entered into separate collaborations with two other big pharmas &ndash; Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb &ndash; to test combinations of drugs against various forms of cancer.</p><p>What makes the deals interesting is Lilly is teaming with two companies that are in fierce competition with each other in the human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody space. </p><p>Under Lilly's partnership with Merck, the companies will test the latter firm's anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in combination with several compounds from the former pharma.</p><p>The collaboration calls for Merck to conduct a Phase II study examining the combination of Keytruda and Lilly's Alimta (pemetrexed) in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p>Lilly will be responsible for conducting a multiple-arm Phase I/II trial examining the combination of its drug Cyramza (ramucirumab), an vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 antagonist, with Keytruda in multiple tumors. </p><p>The Cyramza-Keytruda study is anticipated to begin in 2015.</p><p>Lilly also will conduct a Phase I/II study, set to begin in 2015, examining the combination of its experimental recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody necitumumab with Keytruda in NSCLC. </p><p>Under its other collaboration, Lilly will conduct a Phase I/II study of its experimental TGF beta R1 kinase inhibitor galunisertib (LY2157299) in combination with BMS' anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Opdivo (nivolumab) as a potential treatment for three advanced cancers: glioblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and NSCLC.</p><p>Keytruda and Opdivo both received approval in the US last year to treat melanoma &ndash; with Merck's drug beating BMS' medicine to the market (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">4 September 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Now, Merck and BMS are in a closely watched race for the NSCLC market &ndash; a competition for which Lilly has just put itself in the middle (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-ups-filing-pace-for-lung-cancer-HCV-drugs-356097" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>No financial details of either deal were disclosed.</p><p>Shares of Lilly closed at $69.38 on 13 January, down 4 cents.</p><p>Merck's stock also ended the trading day down, losing 11 cents, to close at $62.19.</p><p>BMS' shares, however, gained 94 cents, closing at $63.12.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
