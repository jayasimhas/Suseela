<p><p>Swedish-American biotech Cortendo is looking to make a splash in rare endocrine disorders with the purchase of two mid-stage assets and an infusion of cash. </p><p>The company announced 15 May that new and existing investors have contributed to $33.2m private placement; Cortendo tapped new investors Longwood Capital and Granite Point Capital, as well as existing investors RA Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Broadfin Capital and HealthCap. TVM Capital, the largest investors in Antisense Therapeutics, made a $4.25m equity investment in the company as part of the financing. </p><p>"This is a very powerful message [from investors] in regards to us, as well as DG3173," said Coretendo Chief Executive Officer Matthew Pauls in an interview. </p><p>The money is being used to fund two recent licensing deals and move those drugs in to late-stage studies. </p><p>Cortendo inked a deal with Australian biotech Antisense Therapeutics to purchase the development and commercialization rights to ATL1103. The Swedish company is paying $3m in cash upfront, as well as making a $2m equity investment in Antisense Therapeutics. The Australian company is eligible to receive $105m in development and commercial milestones, as well as royalties based on sales performance. ATL1103 has completed Phase II trials that Pauls said "gives us confidence" we can bring the drug forward in endocrine applications, including acromegaly. </p><p>The second deal Cortendo inked this week was the acquisition of somatroprim (DG3173) from Aspireo Pharmaceuticals. The Swedish company is paying $30m in equity for the Phase II asset. The deal is subject to approval by Cortendo shareholders, which are expected to meet at the end of June. </p><p>Somatroprim is a somatostatin analog that that inhibits human growth hormone without affecting a patient's insulin profile. The drug has completed Phase II studies and Cortendo expects to publish those results shortly. </p><p>Pauls said in an interview that the company has not determined timelines for development of the new assets yet, but hopes to develop ATL1103 and somatroprim in conjunction with Cortendo's Phase III treatment for Cushing's Syndrome COR-003. </p><p>"We proved today that we can find late-stage assets and late-stage development is a core competency for us," said Pauls. "We're a commercially focused organization, so it would make sense as we move forward that we would be looking at potential commercial rare endocrine disease assets that would fit nicely in these vertical that we are building."</p><p>Pauls noted that Cortendo intends to continue building its pipeline through the acquisition of mid-to-late stage assets and that the company may look to build a second vertical in rare diseases. </p><p>Cortendo is a publicly-traded on the Norwegian stock exchange. It had $38m in cash on hand at the end of February. Pauls expects that Cortendo will continue to explore other US financing options in the future, even eventually an IPO. </p><p><p>
