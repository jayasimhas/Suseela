<p>The FDA has accepted Pfizer's new drug application for its ALO-02, an extended-release combination of oxycodone hydrochloride and naltrexone hydrochloride, which is formulated in a way intended to deter abuse via snorting and intravenous (IV) routes when crushed. </p><p>The company is seeking approval of the drug as a therapy to treat pain severe enough to require a daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. </p><p>Pfizer said ALO-02 capsules contain pellets that consist of extended-release oxycodone, an opioid agonist, which surround sequestered naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist. </p><p>When used as directed, the naltrexone remains sequestered and patients receive oxycodone in an extended release manner, Pfizer said. </p><p>But when the pellets are crushed in an attempt to misuse or abuse ALO-02, the naltrexone is released and is designed to counteract the effects of oxycodone.</p><p>Pfizer&rsquo;s drug would compete with Purdue Pharma's reformulated version of OxyContin, which was the first opioid approved in the US to win the abuse-deterrent language in the product's labeling (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/OxyContin-wins-abuse-deterrent-label-but-FDA-bans-older-generic-forms-342210" target="_new">17 April 2013</a>).</p><p>Purdue also has an abuse-deterrent form of pure hydrocodone on the US market, sold under brand name Hysingla, which gained the FDA's approval this past November (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-clears-Purdues-harder-to-abuse-hydrocodone-Hysingla-355182" target="_new">21 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Zogenix gained the FDA's blessing on 30 January to market the firm&rsquo;s new formulation of its a single-entity extended-release hydrocodone Zohydro, which uses an abuse-deterrent technology. The drug, though, has not yet been awarded the claim against abuse in its labeling &ndash; something it is hoping to win once it submits the results of its human abuse liability studies in the second half of this year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-new-Zohydro-formulation-abuse-deterrent-claims-pending-356480" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Pfizer said its NDA for ALO-02 was based on the results of two Phase III trials in patients with moderate-to-severe, non-cancer chronic pain. </p><p>The company also conducted three abuse-potential studies in recreational opioid users, comparing the abuse potential of crushed ALO-02 with immediate-release oxycodone when taken by the oral, intranasal or IV. The combination of oxycodone and 12% naltrexone was used to simulate crushed ALO-02 in the IV study routes. </p><p>Shares of Pfizer closed at $34.64 on 13 February, down 23 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
