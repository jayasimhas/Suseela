<p>From trade to improving global health, the biopharmaceutical industry is playing multiple vital roles in President Barack Obama's 2015 <i>National Security Strategy</i>, unveiled on 6 February.</p><p>Dr Susan Rice, president Obama's national security adviser, said the basic framework of the administration's new security strategy is the same as the one established five years ago by the White House, but "2015 is a whole new ballgame," with the nation in a "better position to confront current crises and seize the opportunities of this new century."</p><p>Yet, Ambassador Rice said during a 6 February speech at the Washington think tank the Brookings Institution, the US continues to be faced with a complexity of challenges &ndash; at home and abroad.</p><p>Among those are the threats that a deadly pandemic of influenza, Ebola or some other infectious disease could spread around the world and reach the US; the growing resistance of dangerous organisms to anti-infectives; and the potential for a wide-scale bioterrorism attack of agents like anthrax or smallpox. </p><p>The White House said the Obama administration plans to continue its efforts to enhance its pandemic preparedness under the <i>Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act</i>, which buoys up the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) &ndash; the US agency that facilitates the development and acquisition of vaccines and therapeutics against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents and infectious diseases (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Whos-your-daddy-Obama-signs-PAHPA-reauthorization-341163" target="_new">14 March 2013</a>).</p><p>The administration also is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy for attacking antimicrobial resistance, which the White House unveiled this past September. As part of President Obama&rsquo;s fiscal year 2016 budget request, which he sent up to Capitol Hill on 2 February, he called on Congress to double the nation's current investment in the effort and provide new funds for BARDA and the National Institutes of Health (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>"At home, we are strengthening our ability to prevent outbreaks and ensure sufficient capacity to respond rapidly and manage biological incidents," the White House said.</p><p>"As an exemplar of a modern and responsive public health system," the administration vowed to quicken the pace of its work under the Global Health Security Agenda, a collaboration under which several nations, the World Health Organization and other international groups and public and private stakeholders have pledged to work together to accelerate progress towards a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats and to make those goals a priority (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Ebola-crisis-spurs-vows-to-boost-global-health-security-354174" target="_new">29 September 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/As-H7N9-MERS-loom-leaders-put-some-stick-about-global-health-security-350038" target="_new">13 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The ongoing Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone "serves as a stark reminder" of the threat posed by infectious diseases and the imperative for global collective action to meet it, the White House said. It pointed out that the US has led much of the response and funding of those efforts, including supporting the development of Ebola medicines and vaccines, some of which are now being tested in clinical trials in West Africa, although one company, Chimerix, recently abandoned studies of its drug brincidofovir &ndash; blaming it on lack of enrollment due to a slowdown in cases (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Chimerix-abandons-Ebola-trials-of-brincidofovir-356478" target="_new">1 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-Ebola-vaccines-set-for-testing-in-Liberia-356313" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Spending-bill-done-no-NIH-FDA-shutdown-355650" target="_new">15 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Funding-deal-gives-Ebola-5.4bn-FDA-NIH-slight-boosts-355535" target="_new">10 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-plans-800m-command-and-control-attack-on-Ebola-353963" target="_new">16 September 2014</a>).</p><p>The White House emphasized America's interests with African nations go well beyond aiding in the Ebola outbreak and helping to rebuild those countries' healthcare systems under the 2015 <i>National Security Strategy</i>. </p><p>It said the US also plans to increase its trade and business ties with Africa, generating export-driven growth through initiatives, like Trade Africa and the <i>African Growth and Opportunity Act</i>. </p><p>"We will continue to support US companies to deepen investment in what can be the world's next major center of global growth," the White House said.</p><p>"Africa is primed to become a major center of global growth," Ambassador Rice said.</p><p>The US also is pursuing "historic opportunities" with trade in other parts of the world, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), the White House said.</p><p>The TPP and the TTIP are both supported by the biopharmaceutical industry, which have been involved in the negotiations for both (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-Cameron-declare-trade-Ebola-among-priorities-356204" target="_new">19 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Break-logjam-on-Asia-Pacific-trade-pact-354960" target="_new">11 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-US-seeks-to-get-TPP-Asia-pivot-back-on-track-354941" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Trade-officials-TTIP-aims-to-lift-smallmid-sized-firm-barriers-350660" target="_new">17 March 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Biopharma-weighs-in-on-US-EU-trade-pact-343084" target="_new">13 May 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/USEU-trade-investment-big-deal-pact-could-serve-biopharma-well-339997" target="_new">14 February 2013</a>).</p><p>"Our rebalance to Asia and the Pacific is yielding deeper ties with a more diverse set of allies and partners," the administration said, noting the nations in the TPP Pact represent 40% of the global trade. </p><p>Ambassador Rice said the administration was working to "make rapid progress" on the TTIP deal with the European Union, "expanding what is already the largest trading relationship in the world."</p><p>"We believe trade agreements have economic and strategic benefits for the United States," the White House said.</p><p>But Ambassador Rice noted President Obama is seeking renewal of the trade promotion authority (TPA), often referred to as fast track, which would give him the authority to negotiate international trade agreements, which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals.</p><p>But so far, it's mostly been members of Mr Obama's own party that have pushed back against giving him TPA and have raised objections to the two trade deals (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-faces-more-trade-pushback-from-Dems-356352" target="_new">26 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-How-to-beat-China-in-innovation-race-Fine-pharma-356354" target="_new">26 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Nonetheless, the White House insisted the TTP and TTIP trade deals would bring more economic security to the US. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>Who is Dr Stephen Ostroff?</b></p><p>When FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg revealed she planned to depart the agency next month, she said Dr Stephen Ostroff would be stepping into her shoes as the acting chief. </p><p>Who is Dr Ostroff? </p><p>Currently, he's the FDA&rsquo;s chief scientist &ndash; a job he's only held for about a year, initially in an acting capacity after the departure in February 2014 of Dr Jesse Goodman, who had been in the role since 2009. </p><p>Dr Goodman left the FDA to teach at Georgetown University in Washington and to lead its medical center's newly formed Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.</p><p>Dr Ostroff had joined the FDA in 2013, taking on the role of chief medical officer at the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. </p><p>He came to the FDA from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where he was the deputy director of its National Center for Infectious Diseases.</p><p>The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine-educated physician also previously served as the acting director of CDC's Select Agent Program, which oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products.</p><p>He also had been an assistant surgeon general as a member of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps &ndash; the federal government's nonmilitary, uniformed force of health care professionals &ndash; but has since retired at the rank of rear admiral.</p><p>Before coming to the federal government, Dr Ostroff was involved in state public health, serving as the director of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Epidemiology. He also was the commonwealth's acting physician general.</p><p>Dr Ostroff experience includes consulting for the World Bank on public health projects in South Asia and Latin America.</p><p>It's unclear how long Dr Ostroff may be at the helm of the FDA. President Obama has yet to announce his choice for replacing Dr Hamburg, who has not yet revealed her future plans since telling her staff on 5 February she was leaving the agency (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The US Senate must confirm whoever the president selects to lead the FDA.</p><p>It's been widely speculated a possible contender for the next commissioner is Duke University's Dr Robert Califf, who is joining the FDA this month as the new deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco and may have been put into that role to ease him into the top job (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Dukes-Califf-takes-deputy-job-at-FDA-next-chief-356386" target="_new">26 January 2015</a>).</p><p>President Obama, however, could very well have someone else in mind for his next FDA chief.</p><p><b>FDA wants easier-to-understand Rx drug print ads</b></p><p>In a policy shift, the FDA is calling on pharmaceutical manufacturers to make risk information in their print advertisements and promotions easier for consumers to understand &ndash; directing companies in a newly revised draft guidance how to accomplish that feat.</p><p>Instead of an exhaustive list of possible adverse events and other risk information, the FDA said it wants the focus in the so-called brief summary of a print ad or promotion to focus on the most important information, which regulators said would provide consumers with better and more actionable information.</p><p>The FDA said it believes exhaustive lists that include even minor risks detract from and make it difficult for consumers to comprehend and retain information about the more important risks.</p><p>Because the FDA wants risk information to be presented in a way most likely to be understood by consumers, it now is recommending against the inclusion in the brief summary of the risk-related sections from a drug's package insert (PI), which generally appears verbatim and in a small font in the print ads and promotions. </p><p>PIs are written for healthcare providers in highly technical terminology, which the FDA said is potentially of limited value to consumers, who may not have the medical or scientific background to understand that information, regulators noted in the revised draft <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM069984.pdf" target="_new">guidance</a>, <i>Brief Summary and Adequate Directions for Use: Disclosing Risk Information in Consumer-Directed Print Advertisements and Promotional Labeling for Human Prescription Drugs</i>.</p><p>The volume of material in excerpted sections of the PI, along with small fonts and very technical language may serve to detract from consumers' comprehension of the information or from the likelihood of them reading the material in its entirety, the FDA said. </p><p>"Research has demonstrated that people process only a limited amount of information at one time both in general communications and in direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising specifically," the agency said. </p><p>Indeed, in an FDA survey, regulators said few respondents reported reading half or more of the brief summary presented in the traditional format. </p><p>Of those who read at least some of the brief summary, 55% described it as hard to read. Over 40% said they don't usually read any of the brief summary in direct-to-consumer prescription drug print advertisements.</p><p>So the FDA said it does not intend to object if companies do not include each side effect from the PI in the brief summary in consumer-directed print ads.</p><p>Regulators also said they will give firms a pass for not including the entire PI in those advertisements and promotions as long as pharmaceutical companies follow the FDA's advice in its revised guidance. </p><p>The FDA strongly encouraged the use of consumer-friendly language in promotional materials directed at that audience. </p><p>"The consumer brief summary should be written in language designed for understanding by a broad target audience, with various levels of literacy skills," regulators added.</p><p>In addition, they said, technical language, scientific terms, and medical jargon should be avoided. </p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
