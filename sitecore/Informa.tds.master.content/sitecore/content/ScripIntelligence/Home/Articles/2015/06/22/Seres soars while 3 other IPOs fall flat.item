<p>Seres Therapeutics nearly tripled its initial public offering price of $18 per share by closing its first day of trading at $51.40 on 26 June, but three other biotechnology IPOs earlier in the week fell flat.</p><p>With biotech IPO bubble concerns floating above the industry, market watchers could look at the week of 22 to 26 June in two different ways. On one hand, some might argue that the large one-day jump in the stock price for Seres &ndash; a company developing drugs that target the microbiome, which is an unproven therapeutic approach &ndash; shows that investors are over-enthusiastic about the biotech sector. But on the other hand, the fact that three other biotech IPOs foundered earlier in the week may show that investors are still discerning when it comes to new biotech stock offerings.</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Seres grossed $133.7m from the sale of 7.43m shares just 10 days after the company said it planned to sell 6.25m shares for $15 to $17 each. The expanded offering shows that while drug developers exploring the microbiome &ndash; the collection of bacteria in the gut &ndash; have a lot to prove investors are excited about the possibilities. </p><p>Seres has the good fortune of having an early endorsement from the US FDA for its lead drug candidate SER-109. About a week before the company's IPO, the FDA granted a coveted <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-12-18-June-2015-359043" target="_new">breakthrough therapy</a> designation for Seres's lead drug candidate for the prevention of clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in people who've had at least three prior CDIs. SER-109 and SER-262, which is designed for administration after antibiotic treatment of primary CDI to prevent reinfection, are both in Phase II.</p><p>Breakthrough therapy designations, which can speed up FDA review of a new drug, apparently mean a lot to investors, because Seres's microbiome colleague Ritter Pharmaceuticals had a tough time getting its IPO into the market at the company's preferred price.</p><p>Los Angeles-based Ritter is targeting the microbiome to treat gut-related diseases and the company is preparing lead drug candidate RP-G28 for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance for Phase IIb. To fund the program, which first reported <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Ritter-RP-G28-has-could-become-first-FDA-approved-lactose-intolerance-drug-327080" target="_new">Phase II results</a> three years ago, Ritter planned to take its IPO to market at $10 to $20 per share. However, the offering priced at $5 instead for gross proceeds of $20m on 24 June and the stock closed at $4.96 on its first day of trading.</p><p>While the difference between its proposed and actual IPO price was not as big as Ritter's, Catabasis Pharmaceuticals also had to cut its expectations to enter the public market. </p><p>Catabasis launched its IPO on 25 June at $12 per share to gross $60m, which was below a previously anticipated $13 to $15 range. The stock finished its first day of trading at $13. The Cambridge-based company is running a Phase I/II clinical trial for CAT-1004 in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a Phase I trial for the hypercholesterolemia drug CAT-2054. Catabasis previously completed three Phase II pilot trials for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Catabasis-shares-1st-triglyceride-data-for-drug-conjugate-345370" target="_new">CAT-2003</a> in hypertriglyceridemia.</p><p>Meanwhile, Menlo Park, California-based BioPharmX had the smallest IPO of any drug developer so far this year. The company proposed an offering at $2.75 to $3.25 per share and took its IPO to market on 25 June at $2.75 for gross proceeds of $10m. The drug delivery specialist did a concurrent private placement with a Korean investment fund, which also will support development of BioPharmX's over-the-counter products and prescription therapies in dermatology and women's health.</p><p>There have been nine IPOs by drug development companies so far in June &ndash; the most of any month in 2015. June also has had the most new biotech IPO filings this year with 12 drug developers taking the first step toward becoming public companies. </p><p>With that in mind, here's a two-sided prediction for July: If the number of first-time offerings and new IPO filings rises, bubble concerns will gain even more traction; but if the number of offerings and IPO filings falls, market observers will declare both that investors are showing more discipline and that the bubble has burst.</p><p><p><p><p>
