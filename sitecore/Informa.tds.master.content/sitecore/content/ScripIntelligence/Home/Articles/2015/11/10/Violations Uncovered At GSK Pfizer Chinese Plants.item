<p>Two recently released inspection results by western pharmaceutical regulatory authorities have put GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pfizer Inc. in the spotlight after both multinationals ran into manufacturing problems in China. </p><p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) released an inspection report on the EudraGMDP database operated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which found a GSK manufacturing plant in Tianjin, China was non-compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). The non-compliant operations involved non-sterile products, packaging and quality control testing.</p><p>&ldquo;We confirm the UK MHRA has made the decision to withdraw any previously issued GMP certificates and issue a statement of non-compliance with EU GMP for our GSK's site in Tianjin, China,&rdquo; Susan Song, GSK China Communications, told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> in an email response. </p><p>&ldquo;The decision relates to an inspection by the MHRA in June 2015 and, specifically, the Tianjin site's internal processes of investigation and reporting to relevant authorities,&rdquo; Song added.</p><p>According to the report, from the knowledge gained during inspection of this manufacturer, the latest of which was conducted on 25 June, 2015, a critical deficiency was cited with regards to system failures to ensure that the manufacture of medicinal products were fit for their intended use.</p><p>Also, the UK-based company didn't take actions to address identified tablet stability problems of <i>Zantac</i> (ranitidine), a drug used to treat and prevent gastrointestinal ulcers, which indicated non-sterile manufacturing and packaging.</p><p>In a similar situation at Pfizer, the US company received an FDA Form 483 after its plant in Dalian, China was inspected by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April, and was found keeping a second set of quality and manufacturing records that didn't match official ones.</p><p>The plant was also cited for using expired manufacturing materials or ones that hadn't been recently checked, noted a Bloomberg report on the inspection results.</p><p>&ldquo;Pfizer would like to make it clear that we did not use any expired materials in manufacturing at the Dalian site and that all products released in market from Dalian met every national and international testing specification,&rdquo; Mackay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman, told <i>PharmAsia News</i>. </p><p>&ldquo;Pfizer has responded and addressed the issues raised during a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing site at Dalian,&rdquo; he added.</p><h2>Affected Products</h2><p>In terms of specific products, GSK's Song noted that &ldquo;This affects Zantac, which is the only product supplied to Europe from the Tianjin site, and Zantac is not supplied to the China market.&rdquo;</p><p>According to the MHRA report, the dosage forms of Zantac manufactured at Tianjin include tablets in 75mg, 150mg and 300mg strengths, respectively. The drugs were shipped to markets including the UK, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and others. The MHRA ordered that the site should not be named on any marketing authorizations while this statement remains in place.</p><p>The patent of Zantac expired in 1997, after which it became an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine in some markets. GSK sold some OTC products in Europe to Belgian-based Omega Pharma NV for &euro;470m ($505m) in 2012, to further diversify its consumer division. The product range included rights to Zantac and several other products such as <i>Beconase</i> (beclametasone dipropionate). </p><p>In March 2015, Perrigo Co. PLC announced that it had completed the acquisition of Omega Pharma, including the product lines. Earlier in 2011, Perrigo received an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) approval from the FDA to market the generic version of Zantac 150, called Ranitidine 150 (regular and cool mint). Currently, the GSK Tianjin plant is the contract manufacturer of Zantac.</p><p>Pfizer didn't specify the products manufactured at its Dalian plant. &ldquo;The issues cited in the FDA Form 483 do not indicate any quality or safety concerns and do not have any impact on products currently on the market manufactured at the Dalian site,&rdquo; Jimeson said.</p><h2>China A Major Production Site</h2><p>China has become an important global manufacturing site for several multinationals. GSK has six manufacturing sites in the country: Sino-American Tianjin Smith Kline & French Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (Suzhou) Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Biological (Shanghai) Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. and Nanjing Meirui Pharm.</p><p>&ldquo;GSK Tianjin is currently not in operations and is undergoing repairs following the recent series of explosions which occurred in the Tianjin port area in August,&rdquo; said Song. &ldquo;We are working hard to restore the site to an operational condition.&rdquo; Major damage was caused in the city from the massive explosions, which occurred at an unconnected industrial site.</p><p>Pfizer has already established four plants in China, in Dalian, Suzhou, Wuxi and Fuyang, which manufacture products for the pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare sectors. The Dalian plant was the first GMP-certified plant in China, while Pfizer Suzhou engages primarily in the production of consumer healthcare and other OTC drugs.</p><p>Pfizer Wuxi is a production base for the firm's ant-cancer drugs and the Fuyang plant is a joint venture between Pfizer and Hisun Pharmaceutical, Hisun-Pfizer Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., which manufactures off-patent pharmaceutical products in China and for global markets.</p><p>&ldquo;Patient safety is of utmost importance to Pfizer, and Pfizer is committed to ensuring the safety and quality of our medicines,&rdquo; Jimeson stressed.</p><p>&ldquo;We take this issue very seriously with specific corrective actions having been put in place, and make every effort to ensure our global supply network fully complies with all applicable regulatory expectations,&rdquo; GSK's Song echoed.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients need to be confident that our products are made to the highest standards, worldwide. Achieving this is our mission, on a daily basis, in all our facilities.&rdquo;</p><h2>Ensuring Safe Bilateral Trade</h2><p>During the past years, the FDA and the competent authorities in Europe have tightened their supervision of pharmaceutical products coming from China.</p><p>In September this year, Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. was put on the import alert list of the FDA after issues were found for 15 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) made at its Taizhou facility. The warning letter came three months after a quarantine request from Health Canada for a similar problem caused by data integrity concerns.</p><p>Earlier this year, a number of Chinese pharmaceutical companies failed to pass EU GMP inspection, including North China Pharmaceutical Group Semisyntech Company, Apeloa Kangyu Pharmaceutical, and Fujian South Pharmaceutical.</p><p>On the other hand, since 2011, the China FDA has started to conduct on-site inspections at overseas production facilities of seven multinational pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly & Co., Roche, Novartis AG, Sanofi, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp., Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. and Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.</p><p>In December 2013, the CFDA decided to stop importing Pfizer's fluconazole injection manufactured at its overseas site, as the company failed in a supplementary application for drug exports.</p><p>When US Vice President Joseph Biden visited China in the first week of December 2013, the two countries decided to expand US-China cooperation in food and drug safety, as part of which China committed to allow a substantial increase in the number of US FDA inspectors stationed in China.</p><p>The two regulatory bodies are continuing to strengthen their ties through regular meetings.</p><p>This story has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.
