<p>Even though Congress put in place clear criteria when it wrote the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the task of actually approving biosimilars in the US has turned out to be much more complicated than lawmakers may have realized, said Kim Greco, director of global regulatory and R&D policy at Amgen.</p><p>Nonetheless, regulators elsewhere in the world are grappling with the same issues the US agency is facing, "but they don't have the articulated standards that FDA put in place," Ms Greco told a group of reporters on 13 July.</p><p>Congress was at least "thoughtful" in designing a biosimilars framework for the FDA to construct its guidelines and rules, she said.</p><p>"A lot of other jurisdictions don't even have that framework," the Amgen executive said. "In the US, we're fortunate in that at least we have very articulated statutory guidelines to deal with."</p><p>"We feel good that of all of the jurisdictions around the world that are looking at this, FDA is the one doing it," Ms Greco added. </p><p>But the fact remains the FDA has yet to issue two critical guidance documents &ndash; one governing interchangeability and another on what path to take for naming, such as whether to have all biosimilars use the same international nonproprietary names (INNS) &ndash; which representatives from the biopharmaceutical industry, specifically Amgen and Novartis unit Sandoz, patient groups and other stakeholders said during a 13 July Capitol Hill briefing they've been eagerly waiting for more than five years to see.</p><p>The agency, however, did manage to finalize <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-finalizes-3-biosimilars-guidances-358100" target="_new">three biosimilars guidances</a> in April.</p><p>Ms Greco said she would not be surprised if there are some firms that submit applications to the FDA before the agency issues its interchangeability guidance.</p><p>"That's one of the interesting things about the BPCIA &ndash; it didn't require there be guidances in place before FDA acted," she said, noting that was one of the lessons learned from the generic drug paradigm.</p><p>"I think the bottom line is FDA will make thoughtful decisions, whether they do it by articulating their theory or philosophy first or by approving an application first" for an interchangeable product, Ms Greco said. </p><p>For interchangeability, she said Amgen currently is most focused on "what makes scientific sense and urging FDA to be very thoughtful and to address a range of concerns that we think are very unique to biotech medicines."</p><p>Ms Greco acknowledged the interchangeability issues the FDA is wrangling with are not easy and very unlike those the agency dealt with when it undertook approving generic drugs for the first time.</p><p>For instance, with generics, the FDA must ensure the product is chemically identical, Ms Greco pointed out.</p><p>But with biotech products, "that's not a meaningful question," she said.</p><p>"There are a lot of other considerations they are going to have to evaluate, and we think the regulatory challenges that this presents are really quite complicated," Ms Greco said.</p><p>But, she added, "That doesn't mean they are unsolvable."</p><p>Dr Jim McKay, director of clinical development and medical affairs at Sandoz, emphasized that every biosimilar seeking the FDA's approval must show it is highly similar to the reference product and has no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy.</p><p>But without the guidance, companies don't clearly know the standards for interchangeability, Dr McKay said.</p><p>He noted that in some countries under so-called "tendering," in which a nation may use only one supplier, patents are "switched frequently" from biosimilar to biosimilar.</p><p>"Every year, the whole population can be switched . . . repeatedly, and there haven't been any adverse events," Dr McKay said during the briefing, which was hosted by the Global Healthy Living Foundation, a Nyack, New York-based nonprofit focused on improving chronic illnesses.</p><p>Dr Gregory Schimizzi, cofounder of Carolina Arthritis and the treasurer for the Coalition of State Rheumatology Organizations, said he believed "the idea of interchangeability will likely remain a concept for the time being" in the US.</p><p><b>Slow to the name game</b></p><p>The reason it's taken the FDA years on the naming issue is likely due to there being "so much energy and discussion around the topic," which may have signaled to the agency that it was "more sensitive" than regulators first thought, "so they may just be a little bit more cautious in going forward," Ms Greco told reporters.</p><p>Dr McKay argued that all biosimilars referenced on the same innovator drug should use the same INN.</p><p>In March, Sandoz became the first company in the US to win the FDA's approval of a biosimilar &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz).</p><p>The FDA assigned Zarxio the nonproprietary name of filgrastim-sndz, which the agency said was intended to be a "placeholder" &ndash; a move that irked some members of Congress.</p><p>In a 30 April letter to acting FDA Commissioner Stephen Ostroff, a group of Senate Republicans said the term "placeholder" was unclear to them and likely would also be confusing to doctors and patients.</p><p>The lawmakers demanded to know under what authority the agency took such an action.</p><p><b>Traceability</b></p><p>Dr McKay contended that for traceability, the drug's brand name, Zarxio, would likely be the most effective way to identify it from other biosimilars.</p><p>"Most people use the brand name to identify pharmaceuticals because it is designed to be recognizable and it is specific to the product," a Sandoz spokeswoman told <i>Scrip</i>. "Indeed, each brand name has been carefully vetted for distinctiveness and clarity by FDA." </p><p>In fact, she said, "there are close to 40 FDA approved biologics currently on the US market that were approved as standalone products, but that share the same nonproprietary name, and there has been no issue from a traceability perspective."</p><p>Ms Greco, however, argued biosimilars based on the same innovator drug should have "distinguishable" names rather than using the same INNs &ndash; insisting that would be the best way to trace the medicines and ensure companies are accountable for their products.</p><p>"When we receive adverse event reports that don't belong to our products, we can't actually solve the problem and it could confound the solving of a problem," Ms Greco said.</p><p>She noted the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) just issued a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Group-Biosimilars-need-unique-CMS-reimbursement-codes-359392" target="_new">new proposal</a> to use a single average sales price payment limit for biosimilars that are assigned to a specific healthcare common procedure coding system code &ndash; often referred to as J codes for drugs &ndash; which means that products that rely on a common reference product's biologics license application will be grouped into the same payment calculation.</p><p>While J codes are important because they provide a "system where we can look back," Ms Greco said they are not a "panacea or the silver bullet" for traceability issues.</p><p>Nonetheless, she said, those codes should be distinguishable, "so we can associate the adverse event to the correct product."</p><p>"If those are scrambled, we cannot do that," Ms Greco declared. </p><p>"You can always aggregate data. You can't disaggregate it, and it would be a shame to lose that granularity," she said, calling CMS' action "not helpful."</p><p>But, Ms Greco added, perhaps "CMS didn't appreciate the implications."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
