<p>Low growth in R&amp;D investment by Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bringing down the European average across industries, according to a report by the European Commission.</p><p><i>The 2014 EU Industrial R&amp;D Investment Scoreboard</i>, which compares R&amp;D investment globally across industry sectors, found that compared with other industries, pharma was lagging when it came to R&amp;D investment growth. In a sample of 2,500 top R&amp;D investors in the world, pharma and biotech increased their R&amp;D investment by 2.4% from 2013-2014. Of the 633 European companies included, the pharma and biotech industries combined increased their R&amp;D spend by just 0.9%, compared with 7.9% growth in software and computer services, and 6.2% in automobiles and parts.</p><p><preform><script id="infogram_0_eu-randd-investment--change-over-2013-by-sector" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?hne" type="text/javascript"></script><div><a target="_blank" href="https://infogr.am/eu-randd-investment--change-over-2013-by-sector">EU R&D investment by sector (% change over 2013)</a> |<a href="https://infogr.am" target="_blank">Create infographics</a></div></preform></p><p>Europe's average investment across industries grew by 2.6%, below the world average of 4.9%. The US increased its R&amp;D investment by 5%, while Japan's grew by 5.5%. The European Commission said, &quot;The poor R&amp;D performance of EU companies in relevant high-tech sectors such as Pharmaceuticals &amp; Biotechnology (0.9%) and Technology Hardware &amp; Equipment (-5.4%) weighed down the total average R&amp;D increase of the EU sample.&quot; </p><p>Despite this, pharma remains one of the top sectors for R&amp;D investment, contributing 17.3% of the total R&amp;D spend in Europe. This puts it second only to automobiles and parts. Of the top 10 global companies ranked by investment growth, three were pharmaceutical companies, two of which (Novartis and Roche) were European (the third was US-based Johnson &amp; Johnson). The US's Pfizer and Merck both appeared in the top 10 last year, but this year were ranked 15th and 12th respectively.</p><p>Investment fund manager Andy Smith commented that any growth in R&amp;D investment, however low, was not to be sneered at. On the 0.9% growth in Europe, he said: &quot;I still think that is positive since pharma is coming off a period of patent expiries and consequent R&amp;D cuts.&quot;</p><p>As for the fact that Europe appears to be lagging behind the US, much of this is accounted for at biotech level rather than pharma level. The US pharma industry invested just &euro;3bn more in R&amp;D than its European counterparts, but the difference in R&amp;D spend between the biotech companies in the two regions was &euro;11bn (&euro;1.2bn total spend in Europe, versus &euro;12.3bn in the US).</p><p>Mr Smith said this discrepancy between the EU and the US was not surprising. &quot;Obviously there are smaller EU biotech companies. Most are loss-making but they are lowly compared to US Biotech R&amp;D investment for a good reason &ndash; we've never had the quality of management in Europe to shepherd assets through clinical, regulatory and commercial development optimally,&quot; he commented.</p><p>Three of the top biotechs on the scoreboard, all of which had double-digit investment growth, were Gilead, Amgen, and Celgene, all US-based. Moreover, there were 47 EU pharma companies and 46 US pharma companies, while in biotech the numbers were 20 and 98 in the EU and US respectively.</p><p>Overall, biotech companies' investment increased by 20.4%, while pharma's decreased by 0.2%. Mr Smith said he was surprised by the size of this difference, &quot;bearing in mind the renaissance of pharma pipelines. This means that those pipelines were not developed in the EU.&quot;</p>
