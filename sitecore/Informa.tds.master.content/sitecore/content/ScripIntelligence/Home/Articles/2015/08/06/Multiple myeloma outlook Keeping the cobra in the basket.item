<p> Is multiple myeloma treatment at a tipping point? With new treatment approaches based on monoclonal antibodies and immuno-oncology drug combinations demonstrating improved outcomes, experts hope that the answer may be yes. </p> <p> The question wasposed at a Celgene sponsored media event in Vienna Austria on 12 June, held during the European Hematology Association 2015 Meeting. Professor Paul Richardson from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, and Professor Thierry Facon from H&ocirc;pital Claude Huriez, Lille, discussed the new treatments that are emerging for multiple myeloma and expressed optimism about their potential to improve survival outcomes for multiple myeloma patients. </p> <p> Monoclonal antibodies and immuno-oncology drug combinations in development for multiple myeloma have achieved some very promising results and although they may not cure the disease it is hoped they could tip multiple myeloma treatment in a positive direction and significantly improve the length of remissions. </p> <p> Multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease that tends to follow a relapsing disease course. This means that most, but not all, patients achieve remission with the help of therapy but that not all the cancer cells are eliminated. Some cancer cells remain in the bone marrow, even during phases of remission, and almost all patients will eventually relapse. Professor Richardson compared multiple myeloma to a cobra that can be put in its basket for a while but that will eventually strike back up. With each relapse the disease becomes increasingly difficult to treat and so the goal with therapy is to put the cobra back in the basket and keep it there for as long a time as possible. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/6A64BAA6533C4AD0B4F2269211F564B2.ashx"> </p> <h2> Monoclonal antibodies </h2> <p> The most advanced monoclonal antibodies in development for the treatment of multiple myeloma are Janssen and Genmab's daratumumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie's elotuzumab. </p> <p> Janssen have submitted a Biologic License Application (BLA) for daratumumab to the US FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma based primarily on data from the Phase II MMY2002 (SIRIUS) monotherapy study announced in May 2015 at the 51st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (Abstract LBA8512). In the SIRIUS trial 29.2% of heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients responded to treatment with daratumumab monotherapy. </p> <p> At the European Hematology Association 2015 Meeting the first Phase III data for a monoclonal antibody in the treatment of multiple myeloma were presented. The data came from elotuzumab's ELOQUENT-2 study (Abstract #S471). This study compared elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (ELd) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Ld) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who received a combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone had a significant relative reduction of 30% in the risk of disease progression or death. </p> <p> A number of Phase III clinical trials that will help establish the role of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of multiple myeloma are ongoing. </p> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> Phase </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Drugs </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Trial Name </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Elotuzumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> ELOQUENT-2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT01239797 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Elotuzumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> ELOQUENT-1 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT01335399 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Daratumumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> MAIA </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02252172 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Daratumumab + bortezomib </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> ALCYONE </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02195479 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Daratumumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> POLLUX </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02076009 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <h2> Immuno-oncology </h2> <p> After the introduction of monoclonal antibodies, the next major improvement in the treatment of multiple myeloma is likely to come from the use of immuno-oncology drug combinations. The field of immuno-oncology has come to the fore recently because of the unprecedented response rates that have been observed in multiple tumor types with drugs like the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. These drugs diminish the ability of tumors to evade and suppress the immune system and this results in an enhanced antitumor immune response. It is hoped that the combination of these drugs with immuno-modulatory drugs like IMiDs and with other multiple myeloma treatments will results in extended periods of remission and extended survival. </p> <p> <b>PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors</b> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00250/MM_image_2_250087a.GIF"> <img src="-/media/F347383DBDDD45D38C3FA7B5490A0BAC.ashx"> </a> </p> <p> In order to be able to develop immuno-oncology drug combinations for the treatment of multiple myeloma Celgene paid AstraZeneca $450m up front in April 2015 to gain access to the latter's PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI-4736 (scripintelligence.com, 24 April 2015). Celgene will now be able to investigate the combination of MEDI-4736 with its IMiDs Revlimid (lenalidomide) and Pomalyst (pomalidomide) and with a variety of other multiple myeloma treatments they have in development. The most clinically advanced immuno-oncology combinations for the treatment of multiple myeloma currently involve Merck &amp; Co's PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab). </p> <p> <p> A selection of trials investigating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as treatments for multiple myeloma is shown in the table below. </p> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> Phase </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Drugs </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Trial Name </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Pembrolizumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td><p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02331368 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> I/II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Pembrolizumab + pomalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td><p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02289222 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> I/II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Pidilizumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td><p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02077959 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> I </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Pembrolizumab + lenalidomide </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> KEYNOTE-023 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT02036502 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> I </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Pembrolizumab </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> KEYNOTE-013 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT01953692 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> I </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Nivolumab alone or nivolumab + ipilimumab or nivolumab + lirilumab </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td><p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> NCT01592370 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><h2></h2> <h2> Improving survival </h2> <p> In his discussion of these new treatment options Professor Richardson noted that these drugs could build upon advances that have been made in the last 30 years. Between 1992 and 2008 advances in treatment have resulted in a 50% increase in 5-year survival rate for multiple myeloma patients. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies and immuno-oncology drug combinations is likely to further improve this survival rate. With a greater variety of treatment approaches available it should become easier to put the cobra back in the basket and keep it there for longer. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/8B6C87B4ABA4445E89DE491E7DE828EF.ashx"> </p> <p> <b>Where can I find out more? </b> </p> <p> If you are interested in the field of immuno-oncology then you might be interested in Datamonitor Healthcare's new <a target="_new" href="http://store.datamonitorhealthcare.com/Product/immuno_oncology_overview?productid=HC00048-003">Immuno-Oncology Overview</a> report. </p> <p> Dr Colin White is a lead analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare, an affiliate of Scrip Intelligence. </p>
