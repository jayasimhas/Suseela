<p> A look at data generated through <i>Scrip</i>'s annual number crunch of the pharmaceutical industry, the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scrip100.com">Scrip 100</a>, suggests Novo Nordisk's impressive sales successes in recent years are coming at a cost. </p> <p> This is worth noting in light of the fact that Sanofi's US diabetes sales woes were one of the main reasons for the shock sacking of CEO Christopher Viehbacher last year. Mr Viehbacher blamed the US problems on &quot;aggressive discounting by competitors&quot; &ndash; openly presumed to be Novo Nordisk, but Sanofi's board was not pacified and he lost his job. </p> <p> The following chart highlights the tough decisions Novo Nordisk has been forced to make to secure sales in the US. </p> <p> <p> <img border="0" src="-/media/17DA6AD0C1C94A3D81ED67EA11C0ADE8.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>NB. 'Rebates, discounts, etc' is the sum of US Medicare and Medicaid rebates, US managed healthcare rebates, US wholesaler charge-backs, and US sales returns and discounts. The data are from tables in Novo Nordisk's annual report called 'gross-to-net sales reconciliation'. 'Net sales' figures are for all Novo Nordisk's North American products in Diabetes Care and Biopharmaceutics (of which the US represents 95% and Canada 5%); 'Rebates, discounts, etc' are for the US only. </i> </p> <p> <p> While US sales have clearly grown year-on-year between 2008 and 2013 (the solid blue segment of each bar), the value of the discounts and rebates that Novo Nordisk's has provided to secure those sales have increased proportionately more (the striped segment). The result is that the ratio of net sales (the money Novo Nordisk sees after discounts and rebates) to gross sales (the list value of the goods sold), has decreased steadily by two percentage points a year between 2008 and 2013. </p> <p> In fact, in 2008, for every $100 in North American gross sales, Novo Nordisk got $68 but gave back $32 in rebates, discounts, and returns to Medicare/Medicaid, managed healthcare providers, and drug wholesalers. By 2013, Novo Nordisk was getting only $58 and giving back $42. </p> <p> If the trend continues, Novo Nordisk's 2014 results, to be released on 30 January, will show yield down to just $56 from each $100 of gross sales. </p> <p> It is easy to understand the scale of the battle Mr Viehbacher faced in the US diabetes market. </p>
