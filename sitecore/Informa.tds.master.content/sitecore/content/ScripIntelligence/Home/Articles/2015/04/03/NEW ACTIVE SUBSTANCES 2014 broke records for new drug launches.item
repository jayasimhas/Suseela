<p> Pharma take a bow: in 2014 you launched a record number of new active substances in their first markets worldwide. </p> <p> <i>Scrip</i>'s annual review, conducted with Citeline's <i>Pharmaprojects</i>, shows that no fewer than 61 novel products reached the market last year (ie, new chemical and biological entities, and excluding generics, new formulations and new combinations of old products). This figure trounces last year's tally of 48, which was itself a record high for the century so far (see Figure 1), and suggests that the industry has regained its R&amp;D mojo after a decade of lackluster performances immediately following the turn of the millennium. </p> <p> <img border="0" src="-/media/720ECCFD9528477C9831687FF289C71E.ashx"> </p> <p> Even with the vaccines stripped out, the total remains remarkable, with 55 new products arriving. Sometimes public health crises such as bird flu can see a flurry of new vaccines skewing the figures, although in 2014, the vaccines reaching the market were for a range of indications, including two for group B meningococcus. </p> <p> Table 1 includes the full alphabetical list of 2014's NAS products by generic name, and also includes their trade names, mechanisms of action, the companies responsible, the diseases for which they are launched, and the country and month of first launch. It also shows whether or not they have received orphan drug status in at least one market, and whether or not they are the first product to reach the market with that mechanism of action. </p> <p> As seen, 12 products or 20% are deemed first in class, a key performance indicator for the health of innovation in the industry. This was numerically similar to previous years but a lower proportion than in 2013 (21%, or 10 products) and the 31% (or 11 products) seen in 2012. </p> <p> Orphan products accounted for 22 on the list, or a third. This was up slightly on the 27% (13) for 2013, and reflects the industry's continued focus on rare diseases as a reliable source of income. </p> <p> <preform><iframe src="http://cf.datawrapper.de/COt57/2/" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" oallowfullscreen="oallowfullscreen" msallowfullscreen="msallowfullscreen"></iframe></preform></p> <p> <p> So what accounts for the steep rise in NAS launches this year? There seem to have been several factors at play. First there is the background effect of the steady increase of products coming through to Phase III (see <i>Pharma's R&amp;D pipeline reaches new heights</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharmas-RandD-pipeline-reaches-new-heights-356708" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 February 2015</a>). Until recently, this rise had not been accompanied by similar increases in novel drug launches, and in part this can be attributed to the time it takes a product to traverse Phase III and the regulatory processes, but it looks like that the pipeline bulge is now moving through to the market, boosted by some accelerated approvals. </p> <p> But 2014 did see an anomaly in the number of products reaching the market for just one indication: hepatitis C. No fewer than seven NASs were launched for this disease as the explosion of R&amp;D for direct-acting antivirals came to fruition. </p> <p> This is a classic example of science-led R&amp;D (in this case the elucidation of the molecular biology of the hepatitis C virus) leading to a revolution in treatment as a raft of smallmolecules were developed to block key points in the hepatitis C virus life cycle. While 2013 saw the arrivals of the true game-changing products, simeprevir (Olysio) and sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) &ndash; which themselves followed the now-superseded pioneers boceprevir and telaprevir &ndash; 2014 saw the full harvest of this research. Notably, there do not appear to be any NASs for hepatitis C awaiting approval at present, so next year will be a very different story. </p> <p> Similarly, of the six products launched for diabetes in 2014, four were SGLT2 inhibitors &ndash; again an example of pharma taking up a successful pharmaceutical strategy and running with it all the way to the touchline. The first two SGLT2 inhibitors, Forxiga (dapagliflozin) and Invokana (canagliflozin), were launched in 2013, and again there a no new ones awaiting approval and set for launch this year. </p> <p> Encouragingly, given the need, four new antibacterials were launched last year, compared with just one in 2013, helping make the anti-infectives segment as a whole the winner in terms of therapy areas. And four products for use in various hemophilias (compared with none in 2013) also boosted the 2014 tally. </p> <p> But at least part of the rise can be attributed to the strong Japanese showing: 10 of the products were launched there compared with four in 2013 and five the previous year. This is likely down to recent developments there that have resulted in more simultaneous international development and an improved performance at the Japanese regulator that has cut the standard review time for drugs by more than half to 11 months (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PhRMA-spies-opportunities-amid-remarkable-Japan-improvements-356838" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 February 2015</a>). </p> <p> But one thing that does not seem to have been a factor in this year's NAS tally is the rise of the emerging markets. The number of products launched for the first time in the emerging markets was similar to last year, and therefore lower in terms of their proportion of the whole: nine made their debuts in countries such as China, India, Asia-Pacific and Russia. That these were mostly by local firms shows the ongoing maturation of the R&amp;D industry outside its traditional borders of North America, Europe and Japan. </p> <h2> Geography </h2> <p> As always, the US dominated as the choice of debut market, accounting for more than half of the launches, and Europe matching Japan with 10. </p> <p> No one company dominates the list: Novartis, Merck &amp; Co, and Eli Lilly managed four launches apiece, while five companies debuted three products (see Table 2), and Gilead enjoyed a vintage year with two. But the offerings from last year's M&amp;A combatants, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, were meager, with one and zero respectively. </p> <p> Merck &amp; Co was the most successful at delivering novelty through 2014, with three drugs, ahead Bristol-Myers Squibb, which had two. </p> <table> <h2> Table 2:Top company NAS launch performance 2014 </h2> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Company</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>No of NAS launches 2014</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Position by pipeline size (Top 25 only)</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Novartis </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Merck &amp; Co </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 6 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Eli Lilly </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 10 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> GlaxoSmithKline </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 1 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Roche </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Bristol-Myers Squibb </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 11 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Boehringer Ingelheim </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 20 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Biogen Idec </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> - </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Sanofi </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 8 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Takeda </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 9 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> AbbVie </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 16 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Gilead </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> - </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Johnson &amp; Johnson </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 1 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 5 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Pfizer </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 1 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 7 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> AstraZeneca </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 0 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <h2> 2014's pioneers </h2> <p> Of the 12 first-in-class products, the PD-1 targeting drugs &ndash; Ono/Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck &amp; Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for melanoma &ndash; stirred the most interest, both arriving with FDA Breakthrough Therapy status. </p> <p> These immune-oncology products target the programmed cell death 1 protein on the cell surface. Opdivo became the first PD-1 antagonist on the market when it was launched in Japan in September, picking up orphan drug status for melanoma in both Japan and the US along the way. Its successful launch meant that it just pipped Merck &amp; Co's similar molecule Keytruda to the title of first PD-1 antagonist available. These particular antibodies have broad potential use in other cancers too; indeed Opdivo has already been filed in the EU and US additionally for non-small cell lung cancer. </p> <p> Other novel anticancers launched include Blincyto (blinatumomab), the first CD19 antagonist to gain approval, having been brought to market by Amgen for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). CD19 is a cell surface molecule which assembles with the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes and decreases the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation. </p> <p> The third anticancer MAb with a novel mechanism is Lilly and Dyax's Cyramza (ramucirumab), which acts via direct antagonism of the VEGFR-2 receptor, a new mechanism according to <i>Pharmaprojects</i>. The drug has been launched in the US for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine- or platinum-containing chemotherapy, but this one does not have orphan drug status. </p> <p> The remaining first-in-class anticancer is Zydelig (idelalisib), a small molecule PI3 kinase delta inhibitor, the first PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibitor of any type to reach the market. Its US approval for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was swiftly followed by the nod from the EU, and it is another success story for Gilead. </p> <p> Other notable launches of 2014 include BioMarin's Vimizin (elosulfase alfa) for the orphan indication of mucopolysaccharidosis IV. There are only around 3,000 MPS IV patients in total in the developed world, and this enzyme replacement therapy has an eye-watering &pound;190,000 per year price tag. </p> <p> Another interesting new orphan product is PTC Therapeutics' Translarna (ataluren), which was launched first in Germany for the treatment of patients with nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Mechanism-wise, this product is curious. The drug was presumed to act by promoting read-through nonsense mutations in mRNA; however, it has been suggested that this ascription of this mechanism was due a misinterpretation of a preclinical result. Nevertheless, it appears to increase dystrophin levels, and received conditional approval in the EU. For now at least, <i>Pharmaprojects</i> records it as the first ribosomal read-through stimulant to reach the market. </p> <h2> Therapy areas </h2> <p> Overall, despite dominating the R&amp;D landscape, the oncology therapy area came third in terms of new launches, with eight, behind alimentary/metabolic (13) and anti-infectives (21, six of which are vaccines). A major factor in the explosion of cancer research is that much of the development is focused on one product in a wide range of potential indications and patient populations. </p> <p> CNS launches were thin, despite being the second largest pipeline therapy area, but industry did manage three launches, with one first-in-class product, Merck &amp; Co's Belsomra (surovexant), a new insomnia drug and the first orexin receptor antagonist. The dermatology segment, meanwhile, saw no new launches last year. </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/nas2_249187a.jpg" target="_blank"> <img border="0" src="-/media/54FCA9F712D3409AAAA5579EFBA5291A.ashx"></a> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.citeline.com/resource-center/whitepapers/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read Citeline's full report, New Active Substances Launched During 2014. </p> <p> <b>With thanks to Ian Lloyd of Citeline's <i>Pharmaprojects</i> for help in compiling, refining and analyzing the NAS list.</b> </p> <p> <p> <b>Related stories: </b> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-US-and-EU-new-drug-approvals-2014-356938" target="_new">INFOGRAPHIC: US and EU drug approvals 2014</a> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-EU-products-in-2014-a-batch-of-breakthroughs-a-bevy-of-anticancers-and-a----troupe-of-orphans-356395" target="_new">New EU products in 2014: a batch of breakthroughs, a bevy of anticancers and a troupe of orphans</a> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-2014-a-year-for-orphan-drugs-anti-PD-1s-2nd-chancers-355915" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule: 2014: a year for orphan drugs, anti-PD-1s, 2nd chancers</a> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/10-drug-approvals-to-watch-for-in-2015-356016" target="_new">10 drug approvals to watch for in 2015</a> </p>
