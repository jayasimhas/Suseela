<p>The development of Vertex's fixed-dose combination for cystic fibrosis Orkambi (ivacaftor plus lumacaftor) should provide some benefit to patients with the most common mutation associated with the disease but really just paves the way for more effective treatments, experts say.</p><p>The benefit seen in the combination product was not as great as might have been expected, with interactions between the two drugs thought to be to blame. However, progress with Orkambi should enable further drug development that will lead to real breakthroughs, it is hoped.</p><p>The comment comes with the publication of the two Phase III trials supporting approval of the product, TRAFFIC and TRANSPORT, in the <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1504059?query=OF" target="_new">New England Journal of Medicine</a>. These were the subject of a recent FDA advisory panel meeting earlier this month which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vertex-CF-patients-convince-FDA-panel-to-back-Orkambi-358384" target="_new">voted to approve the combination 12-1</a> in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene, despite questions over the extent of the benefit provided by the lumacaftor component. The FDA is expected to make its decision by 5 July. </p><p>The ivacaftor part of the combination is already approved as a single agent (Kalydeco) for use in patients who have one of nine mutations in the CFTR gene (G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R) in the EU, and 10 mutations in the US (adding R117H to the list).</p><p>But these mutations account for just 5% of CF patients. In all there are more than 1,000 different mutations in the CFTR gene that can cause the disease, which fall into six functional categories, but lumacaftor has been developed for the main therapeutic target, the Phe508del mutation &ndash; around half of CF patients in the US are homozygous for this mutation and more than 90% have at least one Phe508del allele. </p><p>The Phe508del <i>CFTR</i> mutation causes a processing defect that severely reduces levels of the protein channel at the epithelial membrane. And for the few channels that do reach the cell surface, the mutation also disrupts their opening. Therefore, to restore activity, a therapy needs both to correct the cellular misprocessing to increase the amount of protein at the cell surface, and improve channel opening. </p><p>Vertex hopes to do this with Orkambi: lumacaftor acts to correct the F508del misprocessing and increase the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface, while ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that increases the time that the channel is open. Neither product is effective alone in homozygous patients, but combining the two does produce some benefit. </p><p>In the two studies, a total of 1,108 patients homozygous for the Phe508del <i>CFTR</i> mutation were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor (600mg once daily or 400mg every 12 hours) in combination with ivacaftor (250mg every 12 hours) or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<subscript>1</subscript>) at week 24.</p><p>In both trials there were significant improvements in FEV<subscript>1</subscript> in both lumacaftor&ndash;ivacaftor dose groups; with the difference between the drugs and placebo in mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV<subscript>1</subscript> ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points (P<0.001), which="" corresponded="" to="" a="" mean="" relative="" treatment="" difference="" of="" 4.3="" to="" 6.7%=""></0.001),><0.001).></0.001).></p><p>Pooled analyses also showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39% lower in the lumacaftor&ndash;ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor&ndash;ivacaftor groups as well. The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment and placebo groups but discontinuations due to an adverse event were higher with the treatment at 4.2% compared with 1.6% for placebo.</p><p>However, while significant, the size of the benefit was underwhelming. In an editorial accompanying the studies, Dr Pamela Davis of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, noted that the extent of improvement with the combination was not as great as that produced by ivacaftor alone in the treatment of patients with the G551D mutation, where the increase in FEV<subscript>1</subscript> was 11 percentage points. "To put these changes in context, approximately the same relative improvement was seen when inhaled DNase was introduced into the cystic fibrosis treatment armamentarium, and greater improvement, about 10% of baseline FEV<subscript>1</subscript>, was seen with inhaled tobramycin, although neither drug addresses the basic defect in the protein," she said.</p><p>The relatively disappointing efficacy is in part due to drug-drug interactions of the two components: lumacaftor is a strong CYP3A inducer but ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate and weak inhibitor, necessitating higher doses of ivacaftor plus creating difficulties for concomitant use of other CF therapies, she said. "More effective treatment may require an individualized combination of doses rather than a single, fixed-dose combination."</p><p>Furthermore, a Phe508del <i>CFTR</i> cell culture model showed that prolonged exposure to ivacaftor interfered with the therapeutic effect of lumacaftor. "Although it is not certain that this interaction occurs <i>in vivo</i>, these observations provide a plausible explanation for the modest degree of improvement observed in the clinical studies despite good individual drug performance and expected synergy. Other drugs in combination might avoid these interactions."</p><p>Despite these problems, Dr Davis says the combination is paving the way for a new beginning in CF therapy. "This is the beginning of effective therapy for cystic fibrosis associated with the most common mutant form of CFTR. With further drug development to avoid drug&ndash;drug interactions, even the challenging Phe508del <i>CFTR</i> mutation will almost surely come under excellent therapeutic control."</p><p>There are a number of other agents that act to increase the effectiveness of the CFTR protein in development but most are at early stages. Vertex has another candidate, VX-661, in Phase II, while Galapagos/AbbVie, ConCERT Pharmaceuticals and Flatley Discovery Lab have candidates in Phase I. There appear to be more than 10 investigational products at the preclinical stage, according to Citeline's Pharmaprojects database. </p><p><p>
