<p>An EU task force is to be set up to discuss how new standards for the identification of medicinal products are to be implemented. The European Medicines Agency, which wants industry and other stakeholders to be part of the task force, says the aim is to open a dialogue with all interested parties to discuss the implementation of the new ISO IDMP standards from July 2016.</p><p>The IDMP standards, which were finalized in 2012 and will supersede the current XEVMPD format, are intended to standardize the identification of individual products, simplify the exchange of information among regulators and improve safety monitoring. </p><p>They will affect all levels of the industry, such as regulatory systems, clinical trials, manufacturing and pharmacovigilance. In preparation for the new system, companies were to have brought all their product information up to date by the end of 2014 (scripintelligence.com, 29 December 2014).</p><p>Implementation guides for the new standards are currently being prepared at international level, and are expected to be available for use in 2016. In the EU, the task force is expected to agree an EU strategy and develop a road map and an EU implementation guide this year. </p><p>As envisaged by the EMA, the task force will comprise about 60 representatives from the following organizations and companies:</p><ul><li>The EMA. </li><li>National competent authorities in EU member states.</li><li>Pharmaceutical industry associations.</li><li>Software vendors, service providers and developers of medicinal product dictionaries or databases.</li></ul><p>Other interested parties such as organisations with expertise in terminologies supporting the electronic exchange of information on medicines and substances.</p><p>The task force will meet four times during 2015, and may also convene ad hoc meetings via conference calls and webinars. Those interested in being on the task force should apply by 6 March.</p><h2>Service providers</h2><p>In a separate document aimed at software and service providers, the EMA says that it is currently developing an EMA roadmap to implement substance, product, organization and referential (SPOR) master data management services that will also support the implementation of the new standards. </p><p>Expressions of interest in the task force by representatives of software vendors, service providers, developers of medicinal product dictionaries and database, and terminology maintenance organizations will be evaluated on a range of criteria including their expertise in medicines terminology data management, EU regulatory requirements for the electronic submission of information on human-use medicines and lifecycle management, and knowledge of the ISO IDMP and other relevant standards.</p>
