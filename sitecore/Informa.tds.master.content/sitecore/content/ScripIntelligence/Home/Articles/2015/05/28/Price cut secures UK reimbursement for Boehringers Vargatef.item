<p>Boehringer Ingelheim has convinced UK health technology appraisal body NICE to make a U-turn on its previous decision not to reimburse its lung cancer therapy Vargatef (nintedanib). </p><p>NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) said in a December 2014 draft guidance that Vargatef &ndash; though described as a new and more effective treatment &ndash; did not offer enough benefit to patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed on first-line treatment to warrant its cost. </p><p>But NICE has now issued final draft guidance for the product approving its use on the NHS following agreement of a price discount with manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim. Final guidance for this decision is expected to be published next month. </p><p>Vargatef's recommended dose is 200mg twice daily, though this can be reduced to 150mg or 100mg twice daily in patients who experience adverse events. The therapy initially cost &pound;2151.10 for a 30-day pack of 150mg or 100mg capsules for oral use. However, Boehringer has agreed a patient access scheme for the drug at a price low enough to change NICE's mind on reimbursement for the product. </p><p>The HTA body said the level of the discount is commercially confidential. But it noted that "The Department of Health considered that this patient access scheme does not constitute an excessive administrative burden on the NHS."</p><p>In its summary, following consultation on its initial <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-rejects-Boehringers-new-lung-cancer-drug-in-draft-guidance-355848" target="_new">2014 draft guidance</a>, NICE said it "agreed that the most plausible incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was likely to be below [its limit of] &pound;50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained."</p><p>Vargatef is the first triple angiokinase inhibitor licensed for the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC, to be used in combination with docetaxel. The therapy was granted European approval in November last year based on results from the international, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase III LUME-Lung I trial, which compared nintedanib plus docetaxel, to placebo plus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced/metastatic or recurrent NSCLC after failure of first-line therapy. The study included 1,314 patients in Europe, Asia and South Africa.</p><p>Duncan Cantor, Boehringer communications director, told <i>Scrip</i>: "Boehringer Ingelheim is committed to working with UK HTA bodies, such as NICE, to ensure UK patients have access to appropriate treatments and continues to research and develop new medicines to benefit patients with cancer. We are therefore very pleased with NICE's decision, which confirms that Vargatef in combination with docetaxel is both clinically and cost effective for patients&#8230;who have few treatment options available to them."</p><p>Vargatef (known as Ofev in the US) has not yet been approved for NSCLC in the States. However, it is marketed in the US and Europe already for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </p>
