<p>The FDA plans to convene its newly formed Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee (PCAC) over two days next month to provide recommendations on what drug substances the agency should permit pharmacies to produce without seeking approval under the regulatory process. </p><p>The FDA already has established lists of substances that may or may not be compounded. But regulators are seeking to tweak both lists and therefore, they want the agency's advisers to weigh in on the matter.</p><p>The first-ever meeting of the PCAC, which will take place 23-24 February, comes more than a decade after the FDA dissolved an earlier advisory committee on pharmacy compounding, largely in part because of ambiguities in the law about the agency's authority over the practice of compounding (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-No-formal-efforts-for-change-before-NECC-deaths-but-time-is-now-338439" target="_new">20 December 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-FDA-chief-blames-crazy-quilt-of-legal-powers-for-compounding-debacle-337240" target="_new">15 November 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-official-Regulating-compounding-pharmacies-a-catch-22-for-feds-336094" target="_new">12 October 2012</a>).</p><p>But Congress clarified the FDA's powers over compounders when it passed the <i>Drug Quality and Security Act</i> (DQSA) &ndash; a law enacted in November 2013 in response to a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis, in which 751 people in 20 states became ill, with 64 of those patients dying from contaminated drugs made by the now-defunct Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/After-decades-of-apathy-blunders-compoundingtrack-and-trace-bill-done-348213" target="_new">19 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-signs-compoundingtrack-and-trace-bill-348404" target="_new">28 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NECC-100m-compounding-settlement-filed-at-bankruptcy-court-351643" target="_new">7 May 2014</a>).</p><p>The lead owner of NECC, Barry Cadden, and the company's supervising pharmacist, Glenn Chin, were arrested last month and indicted on several criminal charges, including second-degree murder, for their involvement in the deaths of several Americans linked to the tainted drugs made by the firm (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ARRESTED-Compounders-of-tainted-steroids-face-life-in-prison-355717" target="_new">17 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Under the DQSA, Congress mandated the FDA create a new panel to provide advice on scientific, technical and medical issues about drug compounding (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-resurrects-compounding-advisory-panel-355699" target="_new">17 December 2014</a>).</p><p>During the morning session of the 23 February meeting, the PCAC will discuss proposed revisions to the list of drug products that may not be compounded under the exemptions provided by the <i>Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act</i>.</p><p>The FDA has proposed a rule that would add 25 agents to the list and wants to modify the description of one product to add an exception. </p><p>The agency said it received only two drug-specific comments from the public on the proposed rule &ndash; one requesting the FDA clarify whether regulators meant for all three forms of adenosine phosphate to be included and another asking that chloramphenicol tablets 250mg be excluded.</p><p>The panel will then spend the afternoon of the first day and the full day on 24 February discussing whether the FDA should permit six agents &ndash; cantharidin, diphenylcyclopropenone, piracetam, silver protein mild, squaric acid dibutyl ester and thymol iodide &ndash; to be included on the list of products that may be compounded. </p><p>Those who nominated the six agents are being invited by the FDA to make short presentations explaining why those products should be allowed to be compounded. </p><p>In comments to the FDA, many of those who nominated the six substances argued it was necessary to permit those products to be compounded because there either were no US-approved medicines on the market to address patients' needs or there were limited options available.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
