<p>After years of soul-crushing disappointment, the Alzheimer's research and development community may have reason to be optimistic, a panel of stakeholders said last week.</p><p>"Things are at a pretty exciting point now," Biogen CEO Dr George Scangos declared during an online briefing hosted by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).</p><p>"We certainly understand more about the biology of Alzheimer's disease and potentially how to intervene in the development of the disease," said Dr Scangos, whose firm's 54-week data from its Phase Ib PRIME study testing the 6 mg/kg dose of Biogen's experimental monoclonal antibody aducanumab (BIIB037) are among the most anticipated results coming out of the 2015 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in Washington, which got underway on 18 July.</p><p>"We understand more about how to do clinical trials properly to get a good answer in an appropriate patient population," the Biogen chief added. "The goal of slowing progression of Alzheimer's hopefully is in reach."</p><p>Alzheimer's, first identified in 1906, is a progressive disease that slowly destroys brain function, leading to cognitive decline, such memory loss, language difficulty and poor executive function. The disease also comes with behavioral and psychiatric disorders, including depression, delusions and agitation, and declines in functional status, like the ability to engage in activities of daily living and self-care. </p><p>Alzheimer's affects more than 5 million people in the US &ndash; a number that could grow to more than 13.5 million people by 2050 if nothing is done to slow or stop the disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association.</p><p>The US is expected to spend about $226bn this year alone in direct medical costs for Alzheimer's, which is projected to increase to $1tn by 2050, said Sue Peschin, president and CEO of the Alliance for Aging Research.</p><p>With billions of dollars being spent by Medicare and Medicaid on Alzheimer's, research funding for the disease ought to be among the highest priorities for the US government, Ms Peschin contended.</p><p>And yet, she asserted, it's not.</p><p>But the White House, which last week released its <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/napa/NatlPlan2015.shtml" target="_new">2015 update</a> to the <i>National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease</i> at its 13 July Conference on Aging, argued the disease has been a top priority for the Obama administration &ndash; pointing out the president has called for increased funding each year in his budget requests to Congress and told National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-boosts-US-Alzheimers-funding-by-50M-seeks-80M-more-from-Congress-326727" target="_new">redirect $50m</a> to the effort in 2012 and use another $40m more for the research work in 2013 from the agency's unallocated funds.</p><p>In its report, the White House said there currently are 40 trials ongoing of investigational Alzheimer's drugs being funded by the NIH's National Institute on Aging. </p><p>The administration also said the NIH is supporting more than 70 projects aimed at discovering and developing new therapies against Alzheimer's, including the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-10-drug-makers-in-230m-pact-to-attack-Alzheimers-other-diseases-349803" target="_new">Accelerating Medicines Partnership</a>, a $230m five-year venture with 10 biopharmaceutical companies and several nonprofits launched in February 2014.</p><p>The White House noted the administration is in fact charged with accelerating the development of new treatments to prevent, halt or reverse the course of the disease under the <i>National Alzheimer's Project Act of 2011</i>. </p><p>But the disease has been difficult for the biopharmaceutical industry to tackle &ndash; as evidenced by a <a href="http://phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/alzheimers-setbacks-and-stepping-stones.pdf" target="_new">new analysis</a> from PhRMA that showed that between 1998 to 2014, 123 experimental Alzheimer's drugs either had their clinical development halted or failed to gain US approval, versus four medicines that were brought to the market, although only to treat symptoms and not the disease itself.</p><p>"This low success rate reminds us that discovering and developing medicines for Alzheimer's patients is hard, and sadly, we're going to fail more often than we succeed," said Dr William Chin, executive vice president of science and regulatory affairs at PhRMA.</p><p>"This is a very difficult scientific and medical issue," Biogen's Dr Scangos said. "It's a massive problem. No company, no university lab, not even NIH on its own is going to solve the problem. We can all chip away parts of it."</p><p>He said part of the reason some trials have failed is because it's difficult to distinguish patients with Alzheimer's from those with other kinds of dementia &ndash; with about a third actually in the latter group.</p><p>The most reliable way to differentiate patients with Alzheimer's disease is with PET scanning, Dr Scangos explained. </p><p>"But Pet scanners are not available everywhere and PET scanning is very expensive," he said. "The development of tests that can reliably detect the presence of beta-amyloid deposits in the brains of patients deeply, reliably, quickly and non-invasively will be a key to the development of drugs and to getting them to the right patients once those drugs are approved."</p><p>In a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDAs-love-letter-to-itself-359477" target="_new">report</a> issued by the FDA last week, regulators pointed specifically to Alzheimer's as a disease in which scientists have failed to find any biomarkers that can accurately identify patients with the condition &ndash; with all attempts failing so far.</p><p>But research presented on 19 July at AAIC may offer some hope.</p><p>One of those studies suggested it may be possible to detect Alzheimer's-like changes in saliva, although the researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada acknowledged more work needs to be done to confirm their early results.</p><p>Also reported at AAIC on 19 July were preclinical results of NeuroPhage Pharmaceuticals' NPT088, which was effective at preventing protein aggregation in laboratory-cultivated brain cells and helped brain cells survive after exposure to toxic aggregated proteins. NPT088 also had broad beneficial effects in transgenic mice with brain damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, in most cases improving memory and cognition, and reducing the brain levels of amyloid beta, aggregated tau and alpha-synuclein. </p><p>Researchers also reported preclinical results of Treventis' TRV 101, which demonstrated the drug prevented toxic oligomerization of beta-amyloid and tau. </p><p>Other results Wall Street and patients are eagerly awaiting to be presented at AAIC &ndash; the largest international conference focusing on Alzheimer's &ndash; include a long-term analysis of data from Lilly's failed trials of solanezumab, which like Biogen's aducanumab is intended to bind to beta-amyloid and clear it from the brain.</p><p>Biomarker results from Phase III studies of Roche's gantenerumab and 24-week data from Axovant's Phase IIb and extension trials of its 5-HT6 serotonin receptor blocker RVT-101 as an add-on to Pfizer's and Eisai's Aricept (donepezil) also are anticipated to be presented.</p><p>"We are at an important transition time in research," said Robert Egge, chief public policy officer at the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.</p><p>"Now we are seeing the kinds of results we have not seen before," he said. "We truly are making impressive progress."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Are-FDA-pre-filing-user-fees-in-pharmas-future-359518" target="_new">Are FDA pre-filing user fees in pharma's future?</a></p><p>When the FDA negotiates with brand-name manufacturers for the next round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> &ndash; PDUFA VI &ndash; the agency may try to finagle a way to receive some payments up front, said Dr Gillian Woollett, senior vice president at Washington-based analysis and consultancy firm Avalere Health.
