<p><p> Novartis's Japanese subsidiary must suspend the bulk of its business activities for 15 days this month following the confirmation of an expected official order in relation to the firm's tardy reporting of side-effects.</p><p><p>Japan's minister of health, labour and welfare issued the order &ndash; which is unprecedented in the country's pharma industry &ndash; to Novartis Pharma KK after months of investigations into the operation's submission of side-effect reports for a group of more than 20 of its drugs. </p><p><p>The 15-day ban, now formally confirmed for 5-19 March inclusive, is the official response to findings that the subsidiary failed to forward to the ministry in an appropriate way and within prescribed time limits a total of 3,264 side-effect cases as of the end of last year, despite some of its staff being aware of the reports.</p><p><p>This has been determined to be a violation of Japan's Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, which requires such cases to be passed to the ministry within either 15 or 30 days, depending on severity.</p><p><p>The ban, which was hinted at around a month ago (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-Japan-facing-unprecedented-business-suspension-356541" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 February 2015</a>), will encompass a broad range of business and sales and marketing activities at Novartis Japan. </p><p><p>In a new statement on the suspension, the firm again apologized and expressed deep regret for the affair, and laid out the steps it has been taking to improve its practices and prevent any recurrence.</p><p><p>A medical impact analysis conducted last year under the supervision of Japan's drugs regulator, the PMDA, concluded that no revisions to existing use precautions for the products for which late side-effect reports were submitted were necessary.</p><p><p>These included two drugs for leukemia, Glivec (imatinib) and Tasigna (nilotinib). </p><p><p>This in turn came after a July 2014 warning from the ministry by MHLW, which prompted Novartis to draw up and submit a formal business improvement plan in August, and to retain outside investigators to look into the matter and suggest internal procedural and structural improvements.</p><p><p>The side-effects probes came after the affair concerning post-marketing efficacy studies for the antihypertensive Diovan (valsartan) in Japan, in which company employees were suspected of inappropriate involvement and use of the data (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Japanese-authorities-press-charges-against-Novartis-352612" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 1 July 2014</a>).</p><p><p>In the wake of the serious compliance problems, the subsidiary has undergone an extensive shake-up of its senior management and completed an early retirement program.</p><p><h2>suspension details</h2><p><p>Under the suspension order, shipments of most prescription drugs will be halted for the period, with medical facilities to switch to alternative products.</p><p><p>The stop excludes certain products whose use is essential to patients' health, and Novartis will also be allowed to continue its over-the-counter business. The exempted prescription drugs include the interleukin-1 beta inhibitor Ilaris (canakinumab) for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes; a pediatric and standard formulation of the CD25-targeting antibody Simulect (basiliximab) for use after renal transplants; the immunosuppressant Sandimmune (ciclosporin); and Regitect (phentolamine) for pheochromocytoma hypertensive crisis. </p><p><p>Otherwise, Novartis Japan (excluding its external business partners) must refrain from conducting sales and marketing or promotional activities, including phone calls and e-mails, interviews and site visits, interactions with patient groups and other medical activities.</p><p><p>While Phase IV study work for new drugs and new clinical trial agreements and research events will be stopped, essential post-marketing surveillance studies, safety-related activities and operations related to proper product use will be allowed to carry on.</p><p><p>The subsidiary gave no indication of the financial impact of the suspension, although its parent does not expect this to be materially significant.</p><p><p>Scrip's sister publication PharmAsia News has calculated that, based on figures for the Japanese pharma business (excluding Sandoz, Alcon, vaccines and consumer health) reported by Novartis for calendar 2014, monthly sales at Novartis Japan equated to around $225m, or roughly $113m for a 15-day period.</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
