<p>The FDA on 29 January gave the go-ahead for Janssen Biotech and its partner Pharmacyclics to market Imbruvica (ibrutinib) as a treatment for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare, indolent type of B-cell lymphoma &ndash; the first therapy ever approved in the US specifically the disease. </p><p>WM usually gets worse slowly over time and causes abnormal blood cells, known as B lymphocytes, to grow within the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen.</p><p>The abnormal B-cells also overproduce immunoglobulin M or macroglobulin, which may lead to excess bleeding, problems with vision and with the nervous system.</p><p>Imbruvica works by blocking the enzyme that allows the abnormal B-cells in WM to grow and divide, US regulators noted.</p><p>The drug already is approved in three other indications: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least one prior therapy; chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) after at least one prior therapy; and patients with CLL with 17p deletion (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JanssenPharmacyclics-drug-Imbruvica-2nd-FDA-breakthrough-to-cross-finish-line-348135" target="_new">14 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PharmacyclicsJanssen-win-FDA-nod-for-Imbruvica-in-CLL-350013" target="_new">13 February 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharmacyclics-Janssen-win-early-Imbruvica-label-expansion-in-CLL-353077" target="_new">29 July 2014</a>).</p><p>The WM indication was based on data from a multicenter Phase II study, conducted by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, with the results showing a response rate of 62%.</p><p>Nearly 51% of patients achieved a partial response (PR) and 11% achieved a very good PR. No complete responses were reported. </p><p>The median duration of response has not been reached. </p><p>The median time to response was 1.2 months.</p><p>The most commonly occurring adverse reactions in the WM trial were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, rash, nausea, muscle spasms and fatigue. </p><p>The companies reported that 6% of patients in the WM trial receiving Imbruvica discontinued treatment due to adverse events. </p><p>Adverse events leading to dose reduction occurred in 11% of patients.</p><p><p><p><p>
