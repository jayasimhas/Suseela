<p><b>The future EU unitary patent and Unified Patent Court system will include an opt-out for companies wanting to remove a patent from the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC. In the fourth in his series of articles on the new system, Paul England explains the thinking behind the opt-out &ndash; and its withdrawal</b>. </p><p>The previous article in this series explained that disputes about classical European patents will fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC after the expiry of the seven-year (as it is initially intended to be) transitional period. That is, unless those patents are opted-out. So, what is opt-out?</p><p>Opt-out allows the proprietor or applicant for a classical European patent (not a unitary patent) to opt out of the exclusive competence of the UPC. The effect of opt-out is widely thought to give the national courts exclusive jurisdiction for classical European patents until they, and any Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) based upon them, expire. </p><p>While there is an alternative view &ndash; that the UPC will retain non-exclusive jurisdiction for opted-out patents, shared with the national courts &ndash; it is unlikely that this is what was intended. Nevertheless, the issue has still not been entirely settled. </p><p>In any case, an opt-out may be withdrawn by the proprietor at a later date. The effect of withdrawing an opt-out is to take the classical European patent back within the shared jurisdiction of the UPC and the national courts (if it is withdrawn prior to the expiry of the transitional period) or within the exclusive jurisdiction of the UPC (if it is withdrawn after the end of the transitional period).</p><p>There is an important bar on each opt-out and withdrawal: if an action relating to the patent has already been filed in the UPC, opt-out is barred; and if an opted-out patent has become subject to litigation in the national court, withdrawal of the opt-out is barred. The present Rules of Procedure (17th draft) state that these bars continue even after the litigation has concluded. </p><p>In order to exercise the opt-out of a classical European patent or application, together with any SPC based on it, an application must be lodged with the UPC Registry. This application must contain details of the patent, or a patent application, and of any SPC. Other details include the numbers and designated member states of the patents concerned. </p><p>The names of the proprietors or applicants for the patent (and the holders of any SPC) must also be included, together with postal and electronic addresses. A fixed fee, currently proposed to be &euro;80, must be paid. The same fee will be payable to withdraw an opt-out.</p><p>The UPC Registry will come into existence at the same time as the UPC, which had raised concerns that a third party could lodge an application to revoke a patent in the UPC before the proprietor had time to file an application to opt out. </p><p>To address this concern, a "sunrise" provision has been proposed. This will enable a proprietor to opt-out a classical European patent at the European Patent Office before the UPC comes into force and the Registry opens. The EPO will then transfer the opt-out applications it receives to the Registry as soon as it opens. </p><p>Next in the series: What should we think about when considering an opt-out?</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at international law firm Taylor Wessing LLP.</i></p>
