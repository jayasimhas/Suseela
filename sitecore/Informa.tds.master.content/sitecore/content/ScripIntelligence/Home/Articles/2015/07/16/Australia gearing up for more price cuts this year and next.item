<p>Innovator companies are facing the prospect of more significant falls in the prices of medicines paid for by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) after the Australian government launched a consultation on changes to the price disclosure process that are due to take effect in October next year. </p><p>As part of a set of amendments to the National Health Act of 1953 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Australian-medicines-access-package-includes-biosimilar-substitution-price-cuts-358612" target="_new">passed in June</a>, as of 1 October 2016 originator brands are to be removed from the calculation of the weighted average disclosed price of PBS-funded drugs that have been on the F2 (multisource) formulary for three years or more. </p><p>The government has just published the draft table of PBS drugs that are currently on the formulary, and which it proposes to identify as originator brands and exclude from the price disclosure calculations. The table is out for consultation until 7 August. </p><p>As a result of the proposed changes, as well as other routine price reductions on drugs funded by the PBS, innovator companies in particular will need to ensure that they take account of likely price declines over the next couple of years when calculating their sales projections and market shares. </p><p>Price disclosure reductions, a routine part of maintaining PBS listing for multi-brand drugs, are intended to ensure that the prices paid by the PBS more closely reflect prices in the market. Under the system, companies have to provide information on the sales of brands subject to price disclosure, and this information is used to determine the PBS price. Where there is discounting as a result of competition, price disclosure progressively reduces the prices of PBS drugs and ensures better value for money, the government says.</p><p>Removing originator brands from the price disclosure calculation will in most cases reduce weighted average disclosed prices because originator companies tend to maintain higher prices than other brands, thereby pushing the weighted average price up. The first "reduction day" will be 1 October 2016.</p><p>The reason for allowing originators to be retained in the calculation for three years is to allow time for brands listed on the F2 formulary to gain market share; various safeguards will be included to ensure that the originator is included in the calculation if there is no other brand available, or if the inclusion of the originator results in a greater price disclosure percentage reduction.</p><p>According to the government, amendments to the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 will give further details about the circumstances in which, and how, an originator brand will be removed from the price disclosure calculations. </p><p>A fact sheet about the circumstances in which originators will be removed, and how this will be done, is to be published sometime during the week of 27 July, the government says, noting that originator brand data will still have to be submitted for each cycle of price calculations, as it will always be used for some parts of the calculations.</p><p>The price disclosure arrangements will be extended to multiple-brand combination drugs on the F2 formulary from 1 April 2016.</p><h2>Other reductions</h2><p>In the meantime, other, more routine price cuts for multi-source drugs are in the offing after the government published the latest cycle of reductions, which will kick in on 1 October this year. The cuts average just over 20% for some 70 products in around 230 dosages and presentations. These come on top of price cuts to more than 100 PBS-listed drugs that were implemented on 1 April this year. </p><p>Moreover, the amendments to the National Health Act mandate a one-off 5% statutory price cut for single-brand medicines after they have been on the F1 (single-source) formulary for five years. The first "reduction day" for these products will be on 1 April 2016, and the last will be 1 April 2020.</p>
