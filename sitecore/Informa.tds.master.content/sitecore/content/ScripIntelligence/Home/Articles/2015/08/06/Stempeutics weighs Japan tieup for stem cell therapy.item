<p>Japan continues to attract interest in the area of regenerative medicine. Indian firm Stempeutics Research now says it is eyeing collaboration opportunities for its stem-cell based drug, Stempeucel, initially targeted for the treatment of critical limb ischemia.</p><p>Stempeutics, which is backed by Cipla, said that it has been granted a process patent in Japan for Stempeucel. The novelty covers the method of preparing master cell banks, working cell banks and the final therapeutic product Stempeucel based on the novel pooling technology, the partners said in a joint statement. </p><p>Stempeutics, which was founded by the Manipal Education and Medical Group in 2006 and went on to sew up an alliance with Cipla in 2009, claims to be the first company in the world to be granted a Japanese process patent for a stem cell drug based on pooling technology. Earlier this year Stempeucel was granted a process patent in the US. Stempeutics then said it had submitted a marketing authorization application for the product to the Indian regulator.</p><p>Stempeucel is derived from allogeneic pooled mesenchymal stromal cells extracted from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors. The firm's proprietary pooling approach is said to allow an efficient manufacturing process with minimum wastage of resources. It also allows more than a million patient doses from a single set of master cell banks.</p><p>Stempeutics' CEO, B N Manohar, said that the new regenerative medicine law implemented in Japan allows conditional approval of stem cell products thereby facilitating more rapid entry into that market. </p><p>"We are actively evaluating the potential for accelerated development of Stempeucel for critical limb ischemia and osteoarthritis indications in Japan with strategic collaborations," Mr Manohar said.</p><p>Last year, Japan formally enacted new legislation governing the development, approval and use of regenerative medicines, including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication PharmAsia News reported (Japan Regenerative Medicine Laws Take Effect, Encourage Industry -PharmAsia News Dec 9, 2014).</p><p>Researchers in Japan also <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/First-iPS-cell-trial-underway-but-a-long-way-to-go-354110%5d" target="_new">dosed the initial patient</a> in the world's first clinical trial involving a regenerative therapy based on the country's flagship induced iPS cell technology last year.</p><p>Earlier, <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Asia-Israel-Teva-to-steer-golden-era-of-regenerative-meds-356403%5d" target="_new">a report by MP Advisors</a>, an Indian strategic business advisory firm, suggested that industry was probably headed towards the ''golden era'' in regenerative medicine/stem cell based therapies, with the segment achieving critical mass, clarity emerging on regulatory pathways and pivotal data readouts anticipated. </p>
