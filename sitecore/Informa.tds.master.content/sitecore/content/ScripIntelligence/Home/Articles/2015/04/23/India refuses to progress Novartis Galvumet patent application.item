<p>The Indian patent office has declined to "proceed further" with Novartis' application for vildagliptin and metformin in a single formulation (Galvumet) citing lack of inventive step and objections around the "sufficiency of disclosure".</p><p>Referring to a set of prior art documents, Dr D Usha Rao, Assistant Controller of Patents and Designs, said that these provide a "combined teaching" making it clear that the use of vildagliptin and metformin in tablet form is "well known in the art."</p><p>"Based on the above facts and the circumstances of the case, the objections with respect to inventive step under section 2(1) (j (a), and sufficiency of disclosure raised vide office letter dated 25 February 2014 is still outstanding and not met. Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the invention disclosed and claimed in the instant application 2045/DELNP/2008 entitled 'New Formulation' has been refused to proceed further," Dr Rao said in a decision dated 31 March.</p><p>Dr Rao held that Novartis' claims lack inventive step over the disclosure of D7/D13 since these suggest such compositions. </p><p>The Assistant Controller observed that D7 [which concerns a prior Novartis patent application WO 2006/047248] describes that it is possible to add other anti-diabetic drugs to the claimed metformin compositions. Similarly, D13 [which concerns a prior application WO 01/52825] discloses a combination which comprises a DPP-IV inhibitor (such as vildagliptin) and at least one further anti-diabetic compound, which is, according to a "preferred embodiment", metformin.</p><p>"It is clear from the above that the range of the claimed composition lies inside the range disclosed in the prior art."</p><p>Novartis had argued that D7 cannot provide any guidance on how to formulate a combination of metformin and vildagliptin as claimed, while D13 does not suggest that the two should be formulated either.</p><p>Novartis shared no specific comment on the merit of the patent decision, though industry experts say that the ruling is unlikely to have any material impact on the company's ongoing infringement suits concerning Galvus in India.</p><p>On whether an appeal was likely, the Swiss multinational said: "Any decision will be taken after we review the order which we are yet to do."</p><p>Novartis had earlier initiated pre-emptive legal action against a clutch of Indian firms including Alembic, Glenmark, Biocon, Cadila and Ranbaxy to defend its patent on vildagliptin. Novartis managed to <a href="http://(http:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Early-win-Novartis-wards-off-Indian-Galvus-contender-353387)" target="_new">ward off</a> one such firm, Bajaj Healthcare last year after it was granted a "permanent injunction" order prohibiting Bajaj from commercializing its generic version of vildagliptin while the compound patent is in force. </p><h2>Novartis' arguments</h2><p>Among a string of arguments, Novartis emphasized that its invention was for the first time able to co-formulate metformin and vildagliptin in a single formulation. </p><p>"There is not a single prior art document that discloses, teaches or suggests co-formulating metforrnin and vildaglitpin in a single formulation, leave alone high-dose metformin and vildaglitpin in a single pharmaceutical formulation," Novartis said.</p><p>The company said that "hindsight arguments" had been used to establish obviousness stating that since metformin, vildagliptin and binder were independently known in the art it would be obvious for any person to combine them. </p><p>On the requirement of submitting data on the stability of the tablet formulations in its application vis-&agrave;-vis prior art cited, Novartis submitted that such comparison is "not relevant" as its instant application for the first time formulates vidaglitpin and metformin in a single pharmaceutical tablet. </p><p>"The prior art either teaches separate use of vildaglitpin and metformin or relates to fixed combinations of other actives. Therefore a comparison of said prior art documents with the instant formulations shall not be relevant."</p><p>Novartis also said that it was the formulations claimed in the application comprising vildagliptin and metformin granules wherein the binder is present in metformin granules that provide for the "least degradation" of vildagliptin therefore amounting to improved efficacy.</p><p>Novartis explained that a high-dose metformin-vildagliptin co-formulation allowed a patient to take both drugs in a single tablet of acceptable size. It underscored that due to their properties, vildagliptin and metformin are typically formulated differently when prepared as single API formulations.</p><p>"It is therefore a significant challenge to prepare these formulations in a single tablet formulation as in the present invention. The tablet formulations of the instant invention address the unmet need to provide diabetic patients with a compressed tablet comprising a high dose of metformin and vildagliptin with an acceptable tablet size, good tablet properties like hardness, friability and stability of the active ingredients," it added. </p><p>The Swiss firm also referred to the advantages of using the formulation in that it imparts "compressibility, cohesiveness and flowability "of the powder blend. In addition, the compression provides competitive unit production cost, shelf life, eliminates heat and moisture, allows for prime particle dissociation, physical stability and ensure particle size uniformity, it said.</p>
