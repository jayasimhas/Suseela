<p>It's been five years since President Barack Obama signed the <i>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) into law.</p><p>And while many of the law's key provisions have gone into effect &ndash; with the White House declaring progress has been made toward the ACA's goals of improving the affordability, accessibility and quality of healthcare nationwide &ndash; it's been a bumpy ride for Obamacare. </p><p>Against the law from the beginning, Republicans have worked towards the ACA's demise &ndash; voting about 60 times to kill it, which those lawmakers know is unlikely to happen while President Obama is in the White House. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped them from trying.</p><p>The ACA survived a legal challenge <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Affordable-Care-Act-constitutional-under-Congress-taxing-powers-332248" target="_new">in 2012</a> at the US Supreme Court over the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Constitutionality-declared-Surgery-or-hammer-time-next-for-health-reform-332278" target="_new">individual mandate</a>, only to be back before the justices three years later in a lawsuit hinging on a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Washington-gears-up-for-next-SCOTUS-Obamacare-fight-356436" target="_new">four-word phrase</a> buried deep in the legislation: "established by the state," which Obamacare opponents are arguing means Congress intended for the tax credit subsidies aimed at lowering the amount Americans pay for their insurance premiums to be available only to those who purchase health coverage through the exchanges operated by the states and not the federally run marketplaces.</p><p>The Supreme Court, which heard <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">oral arguments on 4 March</a> in the latest challenge, known as King v Burwell, is expected to make a decision by 30 June, when its current term ends. </p><p>If the challengers prevail, an estimated 6 million Americans could potentially lose the subsidies, and possibly drop their coverage because of a lack of affordability &ndash; killing the central key driver of the ACA.</p><p>The law also has had to endure one blunder after another during its implementation, including the biggest flub of all &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shutdown-drama-exchange-trauma-Obama-said-thered-be-days-like-this-346988" target="_new">1 October 2013 crash</a> of the federal government's online hub, HealthCare.gov, which was followed by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Frustrated-Obama-recruits-best-brightest-to-fix-exchanges-GOP-attacks-347481" target="_new">a series of website glitches</a> that took the administration months to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Website-fix-goal-met-but-salvaging-ACA-credibility-tougher-348439" target="_new">get under control</a>.</p><p>The latest stain on the ACA came last month when the administration admitted it had sent out an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Oops-US-feds-goof-on-800000-Obamacare-tax-forms-356876" target="_new">erroneous tax credit subsidy form</a> to 800,000 Americans, which caused those people to have to delay their tax filings, and ultimately, held up any refunds they were due.</p><p>But the Obama administration also has been able to claim victory in many instances with the ACA &ndash; including boasting that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/HHS-chief-11.7m-Americans-enrolled-in-Obamacare-357143" target="_new">11.7 million Americans</a> have selected or were automatically re-enrolled in 2015 healthcare plans through the online marketplace.</p><p>In addition, since the enactment of the ACA, the rate of uninsured has dropped drastically, tumbling lower than it has done in the past five decades &ndash; with more than 16 million additional people now having coverage.</p><p>President Obama pointed out that more than 9 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved an average of $1,600 per person on their prescription medicine &ndash; over $15bn in all since the ACA became law five years ago. </p><p>The ACA is important to the biopharmaceutical industry because it brought millions of new customers who otherwise may not have filled their prescriptions because of a lack of affordability without insurance.</p><p>More than 70 million Americans also have gained access to preventive care, including contraceptive services, with no additional out-of-pocket costs. </p><p>Under the ACA, more than 11 million Americans have been added to the rolls of Medicaid &ndash; with 29 states adopting the law's measure to expand the program and another six considering doing so &ndash; and the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p><p>Healthcare prices also have risen at their slowest rate in nearly 50 years since Obamacare became law.</p><p>The Obama administration also got some additional good news earlier this month when the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which conducts nonpartisan analyses for Congress, said the ACA would cost 29% less than it initially projected for the next five years &ndash; dropping from $710bn to $506bn.</p><p>The CBO said the cost over the next decade would be 11% less than it earlier projected. </p><p>"The <i>Affordable Care Act</i> has been the subject of more scrutiny, more rumor, more attempts to dismantle and undermine it than just about any law in recent history. But five years later, it is succeeding &ndash; in fact, it's working better than even many of its supporters expected," President Obama declared in a 22 March statement. "It's time to embrace reality."</p><p>But five years into the law, President Obama still has his work cut out for him in convincing Americans to embrace Obamacare.</p><p>Indeed, 43% of Americans surveyed said they still don't like the ACA, although 41% responded that they had a favorable view of Obamacare, according to a poll released earlier this month from the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><p>But only 30% said they want Congress to repeal the law, while another 10% said they want Obamacare left in place, but scaled back.</p><p>The KFF poll showed that 23% want lawmakers to move forward with implementing the ACA as is, while another 23% want Congress to expand it.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-headed-to-losing-credibility-biosafety-experts-charge-357423" target="_new">CDC headed to losing credibility, biosafety experts charge</a></p><p>It's no surprise the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not eager to make public a scathing report from a panel of outside expert advisers that condemned the agency's laboratory safety practices &ndash; declaring it "is on the way to losing credibility" after a series of near-calamities involving anthrax, the H5N1 influenza virus and Ebola. An 11-member external laboratory safety workgroup of the advisory committee to CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden delivered the report in January, but the agency waited until now to post it &ndash; quietly sneaking it onto its lab safety website</p><p>The panel of biosafety experts said the CDC's leadership commitment toward safety has been "inconsistent and insufficient at multiple levels."</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Warning-added-to-Gileads-Sovaldi-Harvoni-after-cardiac-death-357426" target="_new">Warning added to Gilead's Sovaldi, Harvoni after cardiac death</a></p><p>Gilead Sciences warned prescribers on 20 March that co-administering the anti-arrhythmics agent amiodarone with the company's hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) or Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) in combination with another direct acting antiviral could be deadly.</p><p>In a "Dear Healthcare Provider" letter, Gilead told prescribers there were nine postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia &ndash; a slower than normal heart rate, under 60 beats per minute &ndash; in patients who got amiodarone while taking either Harvoni or Sovaldi with Bristol-Myers Squibb's investigational HCV drug daclatasvir or Johnson & Johnson's Olysio (simeprevir). One of those patients died of cardiac arrest and three others required pacemakers.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-others-avoid-patent-dance-after-Sandoz-court-win-357429" target="_new">Will others avoid 'patent dance' after Sandoz court win?</a></p><p>With a California district court siding with Novartis unit Sandoz last week that it did nothing wrong by not engaging in the disclosure and dispute resolution process, often called the "patent dance," laid out by the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> &ndash; the law that established the abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilars &ndash; the ruling may spur other companies to do the same.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Getting-to-drug-safety-Can-it-be-done-357428" target="_new">Getting to drug safety: Can it be done?</a></p><p>The fact that it's taken the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) several years just to identify and prioritize its drug safety-related research needs may not bode well for the future of achieving any goals the agency may have in fulfilling those demands. CDER last week revealed seven areas it says it is ready to focus on &ndash; calling on outside stakeholders to step up and help the agency meet its mission.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Breo-adult-asthma-use-rejects-adolescents-357398" target="_new">FDA panel backs Breo adult asthma use; rejects adolescents</a></p><p>An FDA panel on 19 March backed the use of GlaxoSmithKline's Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) as a once-daily inhaled treatment for asthma in adults, but said the medicine was not ready for primetime in adolescents with the disease.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Adolescents-FDAs-greatest-concern-for-GSKs-Breo-in-asthma-357343" target="_new">Adolescents FDA's greatest concern for GSK's Breo in asthma</a></p><p>The FDA raised several concerns about the use of GlaxoSmithKline's Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder) in treating patients 12-17 years as a once daily treatment for asthma.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amicus-to-seek-quicker-market-paths-for-Fabry-drug-357400" target="_new">Amicus to seek quicker market paths for Fabry drug</a></p><p>Shares of Amicus Therapeutics soared 41% on 19 March after the company said it plans to seek an accelerated approval of its experimental Fabry disease drug migalastat. The firm said it would submit its new drug application in the second half of this year based on positive information from the FDA. The company said it also intends to accelerate the timeline for its marketing authorization application in Europe for the investigational medicine.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bill-Gates-Infectious-disease-must-be-attacked-like-war-357373" target="_new">Bill Gates: Infectious disease must be attacked like war</a></p><p>There is a significant chance an epidemic much more infectious than Ebola could occur sometime in the next two decades and the world's health systems are unprepared to handle it, warned computer mogul-turned-philanthropist Bill Gates. Even if the system the world has today had worked perfectly for the Ebola outbreak it would fail to contain a more infectious disease, like a flu pandemic, he asserted.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Voucher-FDA-approval-lure-Retrophin-to-buy-Cholbam-357371" target="_new">Voucher, FDA approval lure Retrophin to buy Cholbam</a></p><p>It didn't take Retrophin long to make a decision on exercising its rights to purchase Cholbam (cholic acid) after the FDA approved the drug on 17 March. San Diego-based Retrophin revealed on 18 March it was quickly snapping up the worldwide rights, titles and ownership of Cholbam and its related assets from Asklepion Pharmaceuticals for a one-time cash payment of $27m plus 661,278 shares of Retrophin common stock. A likely lure to the deal for Retrophin was the rare disease pediatric voucher Asklepion won from the FDA, which is good for a priority review on a subsequent application that would not have otherwise qualified for priority review.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Asklepion-secures-US-OK-for-Cholbam-wins-peds-voucher-357344" target="_new">Asklepion secures US OK for Cholbam; wins peds voucher</a></p><p>Maryland-based Asklepion Pharmaceuticals won US approval of Cholbam (cholic acid) on 17 March as a once-daily treatment for bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and as an adjunct to standard of care for peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders in patients with evidence of liver disease. The FDA also granted the firm a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-expanded-pediatric-use-of-CF-drug-Kalydeco-357372" target="_new">Vertex wins expanded pediatric use of CF drug Kalydeco</a></p><p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals said on 18 March the FDA had expanded the use of the company's cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in children 2-5 years who have one of 10 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R and R117H.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-seeks-panels-advice-on-Ebola-vaccine-RandD-licensure-357323" target="_new">FDA seeks panel's advice on Ebola vaccine R&D, licensure</a></p><p>The FDA plans to convene its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on 12 May to provide advice and recommendations about the development and licensure of vaccines against Ebola, which has infected about 24,600 people during the current outbreak, killing over 10,100. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
