<p>Mylan's chairman is ready to take Perrigo whether all of its shareholders agree or not. And he's not making any apologies about it. </p><p>There has been plenty of controversy and confusion about Mylan changing the threshold for the number of Perrigo investors it needs to tender their shares in order to take over the company. Mylan chairman Robert Coury clarified the situation during a conference call with investors and expressed his confidence that Mylan will own Perrigo.</p><p>Mylan hosted a conference call for analysts and shareholders after the close of the market on Oct. 13 to tout the incentives for Perrigo shareholders to give up their shares. Mylan has been pursuing the smaller generic drugmaker since April and has faced with nothing but <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigos-Papa-Responds-To-Mylan-Tender-Offer-360396" target="_new">criticism and stern rejections from Perrigo management</a>. </p><p>The Irish-domiciled Mylan's bid values Perrigo at $27.4bn based on Mylan's closing share price on Sept. 8 &ndash; the last trading day before Mylan took its offer hostile &ndash; and includes $75 per share in cash, giving Perrigo shareholders a 40% stake in the combined company.</p><p>After several public and private rebuffs from Perrigo management, Mylan took its offer straight to shareholders and began asking for Perrigo shareholders to tender their shares in mid-September. </p><p>Under Irish law, Mylan needs to gain 50% of Perrigo shares before it can go forward with the acquisition. The threshold for this was previously 80% of shares, but Mylan changed the requirement shortly before initiating the tender offer. </p><p>Mylan's Coury explained the process on the Oct. 13 call. "I want to make sure everyone understands," the exec began. "Originally, when we came with the offer, we said that we would close if we had an 80% minimum threshold. We subsequently reduced that threshold to close to 50%. Once we get to 50% then we're obligated to close. By Irish law we would be required to keep the offer open for 14 days and to purchase any shares at the same terms and conditions that we bought the 50% for."</p><p>Coury asserts that once 50% of shares are tendered that Mylan will take operational control of Perrigo &ndash; whether shareholders and management like it or not. Mylan will then have the majority stake in the company and will be able to oust the smaller company's board of directors. </p><p>While Mylan wouldn't have complete ownership of Perrigo, it would only face some administrative hurdles at that point, according to the acquirer &ndash; and Coury welcomes the opportunity. </p><p>"I mean selfishly I would love to continue to run this company with operational control at 50.1%," he said. "Why?" he asked, "because if you look at the compelling value we're offering the Perrigo shareholders, one of the greatest components is the issuance of 2.3 of our shares for every one of their shares. If you think about it, if we only close on 50.1% and have operational control, there is 49% of outstanding Perrigo shares that I don't have to give 2.3 of our share to. There are that many less shares issued."</p><p>Adding insult to injury, Coury clarified that even if Mylan only gets operational control, it can still deliver on the $800m in synergies that it has promised with this acquisition.</p>
