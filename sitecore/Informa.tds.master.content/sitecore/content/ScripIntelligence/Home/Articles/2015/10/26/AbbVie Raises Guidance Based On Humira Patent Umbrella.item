<p>Analyst buzz about the AbbVie Inc. third quarter earnings call Oct. 30 centered on its strongly optimistic sales guidance through 2020, based on its belief in a suite of intellectual property that it says will protect top-seller Humira from US biosimilar competition until 2022 or later.</p><p>The Chicago-area pharma projects that it will bring in $37bn in product sales in 2020, reflecting roughly 10% sales growth on average over the next five years. This guidance predicts tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) will continue its growth to $18bn in 2020, while oncology drug <i>Imbruvica</i> (ibrutinib), added in the March acquisition of Pharmacyclics, will grow to approximately $5bn.</p><p>Wall Street has questioned AbbVie's long-term prospects from the moment it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Abbott-split-to-take-effect-from-new-year-337673" target="_new">spun out from Abbott</a> in 2013, due to the company's over-reliance on Humira sales. AbbVie has regularly added indications to the autoimmune powerhouse's label, but many analysts projected sales to begin declining by 2018 due to expected biosimilar competition.</p><p>"This guidance includes estimated global Humira sales of more than $18bn in 2020, which we believe appropriately captures the expected biosimilar dynamics globally," CEO Rick Gonzalez said on the earnings call.</p><p>It will be a shifting landscape. There is already biosimilar competition in the TNF inhibitor space, with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-Recommends-Biosimilar-Infliximab-For-RA-360230" target="_new">biosimilar infliximab</a> (Johnson & Johnson/Merck & Co. Inc.'s <i>Remicade</i>) on the market in Europe and coming soon in the US. Novartis AG's Sandoz Inc. unit just filed a biosimilar copy of etanercept, Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel. It is early to tell the impact of non-adalimumab biosimilars on the AbbVie branded product, but increasing availability and familiarity with the biosimilars is likely to have an impact.</p><p>Amgen is planning on submitting <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Revenue-Exceeds-Expectations-Threats-Remain-Despite-New-Launches-361283" target="_new">its own biosimilar of adalimumab</a> by the end of the year.</p><p>Gonzalez projects that AbbVie's pipeline "has the potential to achieve nominal peak revenues of nearly $30bn by 2024. This estimate excludes new Humira and Imbruvica indications and sales from our next-generation HCV combination, which are considered on-market products for the purpose of this calculation. We have the potential to launch more than 20 new products or indications through 2020, including seven approvals that will contribute in 2016 and beyond."</p><p>Several analysts differed with those projections, particularly on Humira. Although his Oct. 30 note on AbbVie rated the stock "outperform," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said he expects Humira to face domestic competition from biosimilars by 2019, and projects sales of the drug in 2020 in the range of $12.3bn.</p><p>"While we expect significant debate around the assumptions behind [AbbVie's] guidance, we believe on first glance that it should be very well received," Divan said.</p><p>BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei, who also rates AbbVie shares "outperform," said in an Oct. 30 note that he is "skeptical about the aggressive Humira guidance," which is based on expectations that a raft of patents will stave off approval of adalimumab biosimilar products until 2022. "While we appreciate AbbVie laying out its strategy, investors will likely take a cautious view for now," he concluded.</p><p><b>Multiple Areas Of Patent Protection</b></p><p>Gonzalez spent much of the call detailing Humira's patent protection, noting that it the first fully human therapeutic antibody approved by FDA and is protected by dozens of US patents that reflect more than 100 clinical trials conducted over 18 years. He said the biologic is insulated from competition by patents covering formulation, manufacturing and method of treatment.</p><p>"Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously," the exec said, "With respect to formulating the drug, we have patents on formulating the Humira antibody that also expire no earlier than 2022. Biologic drugs must be administered intravenously or as injections and can be difficult to formulate properly. Given our extensive experience with Humira, these patents cover not only our commercial formulation but also other related formulations that biosimilar companies might employ. Fourteen patents have been issued covering different formulations of Humira."</p><p>"With respect to making the drug, we have important patents on the methods of manufacturing Humira that expire no earlier than 2027," Gonzalez continued. "The living cells that produce biologic drugs such as Humira can be sensitive to small changes in the manufacturing process. Minor differences in manufacturing process can affect the nature of the biologic drug and even its clinical effect. Twenty-four patents have been issued covering methods of manufacturing Humira and Humira compositions resulting from those methods."</p><p>Gonzalez said AbbVie does not have enough information today to know exactly how those patents might be infringed by potential competitors, but said Humira enjoys additional protection from patents that cover how the drug is administered.</p><p>"Since the biosimilar statute requires the biosimilar to obtain approval for one or more indications previously approved for the innovator drug and have the same route of administration, dosage form and strength, we know biosimilars will infringe these method-of-use patents," Gonzalez stated. "We have method of treatment patents covering all the indications for which Humira has been approved. These patents do not expire until 2022 or later."</p><p><b>Building Out Imbruvica's Potential</b></p><p>Less controversial was AbbVie's projection that Imbruvica, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-outdoes-rumored-JandJ-bid-with-21bn-Pharmacyclics-buy-357078" target="_new">the Pharmacyclics drug</a> that is partnered 50/50 with Johnson & Johnson, might yield sales of $5bn by 2020. BMO's Arfaei pointed out that Imbruvica's $304m in sales during the third quarter bested consensus projections by about 18%. "We continue to remain bullish on Imbruvica and argue that it has the potential to offset slowing Humira sales because of biosimilar competition," the analyst said.</p><p>Gonzalez explained that AbbVie is undertaking a broad clinical development program to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/New-Pharmacyclics-data-could-move-Imbruvica-to-front-line-357325" target="_new">expand Imbruvica's label</a> so that it can be a second underpinning of consistent sales growth over the next five years.</p><p>"Imbruvica has vast potential for label expansion and future indications," he said. "It is currently being evaluated in mid- and late-stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma."</p><p>"We are also encouraged about Imbruvica's potential in graft-versus-host disease based on data from an earlier-stage study," the exec added. "If Imbruvica demonstrates clinical value in solid tumors, there would certainly be significant upside to our expectations. We recently initiated a Phase III trial evaluating Imbruvica in pancreatic cancer, and we are currently studying Imbruvica in other solid tumor types in combination with immuno-oncology agents, including early-stage studies in breast and lung cancer."</p><p>Overall, AbbVie reported global sales of $5.9bn for the third quarter, making for 18.4% growth year-over-year. Humira sales increased by 19.4% over the 12 months, including by 30.4% in the US. Growth was slower internationally for the drug, which AbbVie attributed largely to the impacts of foreign exchange.</p><p><p><p>This article also was published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from sister publications to subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
