<p>In the 2013 science fiction film Elysium the human race was divided up into the wealthy, who lived on the utopian space station Elysium with access to the machines that could cure all injuries and diseases, and those who were stuck with poverty and disease back on a dystopian polluted earth. After last week's American College of Cardiology (ACC) conference, we may be a little closer to this sort of bifurcation in healthcare.</p><p><p>If they hadn't already been publicized enough, last week's ACC conference was the coming out party for the monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PCSK9 activity and lower low density lipoproteins to levels seen in neonates. The PCSK9 target was discovered from the genome analysis of phenotypically normal individuals with very low LDL levels and corresponds to a mutation in the gene-encoding PCSK9. However, as companies like Amarin have found to their cost (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/STOCKWATCH-The-death-of-surrogate-markers-347302" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 14 October 2013</a>), the FDA remains unconvinced that a reduction in the surrogate marker LDL alone is correlated with a reduction in cardiovascular events. Studies presented last week by Amgen and Sanofi at ACC demonstrating such a benefit were a welcome step in this evidential journey (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16 March 2015</a>). Although larger outcome studies that will take another two years to report will be needed to get the improved cardiovascular outcome claims on the labels of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, the longer-term data presented at ACC was sufficient to stoke further debate on premium drug pricing. The issue is that if, as last week's results suggest, very low LDL levels achieved by the inhibition of PCSK9 results in far fewer adverse cardiovascular events, then everyone should get the drugs. Unfortunately, the prospect of treating large populations with expensive drugs regardless of the significant long-term societal benefit has brought payers out in a rash of protest as Gilead Sciences found when Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Express Scripts balked at reimbursing its drug for HCV infection (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/High-cost-drugs-for-a-low-cost-future-353232" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 August 2014</a>). </p><p><p>Despite the HCV drug pricing debate not working out well for Express Scripts or the patients in its restrictive National Formulary &ndash; since they seem to be almost the only group of US covered lives who cannot gain access to Gilead's drugs &ndash; the imminent approval of the anti-PCSK9 antibodies has prompted claims by PBMs that the population that could benefit from treatment is so big as to be unaffordable (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 18 February 2015</a>). From the investors' perspective we want highly priced drugs, but unlike investment bankers who push as many IPOs as they can onto the public market until the bubble bursts, investors can usually see the benefits of an interplay between price and volume. On the other side of the transaction are the investors in PBMs (ourselves included) who may want their companies to demand big discounts on drug prices and not pass all those savings onto the patients, health insurers and employers. Unless we want the Elysium scenario, with fewer wealthy treated patients (who would probably include the senior managers of the PBMs) but most denied a low cardiovascular event rate, there should logically be a negotiated drug-price settlement between the factions (unlike that which is currently eluding the Greek government and the rest of the EU). </p><p><p>All this interplay assumes highly efficacious and safe drugs for big populations as is the case with the most recently approved HCV antivirals and the soon to be approved anti-PCSK9 antibodies. In addition, one of the consistencies of the PCSK9 antibodies from Sanofi/Regeneron, Amgen and Pfizer is that they all have similar efficacy and, it seems, safety, right down to the 1% or so of patients who see neurocognitive effects. Apparently this is not so in the world of antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Biogen reported a second batch of positive interim Phase Ib data for the ongoing PRIME study of its anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody aducanumab in 166 patients divided over five doses including a placebo (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogens-high-risk-bet-on-Alzheimers-a-potential-game-changer-357421" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 20 March 2015</a>). Efficacy was demonstrated in some of the small groups in the PRIME study but not in about 5,500 patients in all the Phase III studies conducted by Pfizer/Janssen, Eli Lilly and Roche with their anti-amyloid antibodies. Where Biogen's aducanumab did score over the other anti-amyloid antibodies was in the unprecedented safety signal: 32% of patients in the highest dose cohort dropped out, making the statistics surrounding the remaining completers of the PRIME study even more unreliable. AD is, and will be, a large patient population and many billions of dollars in sales have already been attributed to aducanumab as it avoids the end of Phase II review with the FDA and jumps straight to Phase III (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Biogens-belligerent-repetition-355489" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 December 2014</a>). With aducanumab coming from a company that just enacted another 5.5% price increase across its drugs to treat multiple sclerosis, aducanumab is likely to galvanize the Elysium debate much more than the HCV antivirals or the PCSK9 inhibitors ever did.</p><p><p>It's ironic, isn't it, that during the tenure of a president who brought affordable care to millions of previously uninsured Americans, there is increasing recognition that the best but most costly drugs may be inaccessible to many patients. </p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include Amgen, Regeneron, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Roche and Biogen Idec. </p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest manages the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for four life science</i>&ndash;<i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p>
