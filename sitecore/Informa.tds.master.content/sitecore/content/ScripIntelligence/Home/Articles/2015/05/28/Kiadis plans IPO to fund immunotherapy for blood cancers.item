<p>Dutch biotech Kiadis Pharma, which is developing T-cell immunotherapy treatments for blood cancers, says it plans to raise new funds through an IPO of its shares on the Euronext in Amsterdam and Brussels. </p><p>The company's lead product, ATIR 101, is currently in a Phase II trial with results expected at the beginning of 2016. ATIR is a cell-based product designed to enable stem cell transplantations from partially matched (haploidentical) family donors for blood cancer patients who do not have a standard of care stem cell donor available. </p><p>The Phase II study is an international multi-center study in which 23 leukemia patients, including patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), are being enrolled and treated with ATIR as part of the transplant regimen.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study is the rate of Transplant Related Mortality (TRM) at six months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Data from the pre-specified interim analysis of the first 10 patients, presented in December at the American Society of Hematology meeting, showed only two cases of TRM at six months post-HSCT and both TRM cases resulted from a viral infection. Overall, six out of the 10 patients were completely free from severe infections (grade 3-5) after ATIR administration and up to six months after the transplant.</p><p>"We got lots attention following ASH," CEO Dr Manfred Rüdiger told <i>Scrip</i>. Of the 23-patient target, 18 patients have been treated and a further three enrolled. "We expect to have the trial fully enrolled this summer," he added. </p><p>Positive <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/New-hope-for-unmatched-bone-marrow-transplant-patients-346662" target="_new">five-year follow-up data</a> from a Phase I/II trial were presented in 2013.</p><p>The decision to list the company locally "was not obvious but the result of discussions with the company's stakeholders," said Dr Rüdiger. He declined to say how much cash the company hoped to raise but said it would be enough to see it through to the end of the Phase II trial and make plans for Phase III testing.</p><p>Subject to the outcome of the ongoing Phase II trial, the company intends to file for conditional approval in the EU and Canada for ATIR 101 in the fourth quarter of 2016. A randomized, controlled Phase III trial for ATIR 101 with 80-90 patients in each arm is envisaged to start in the second quarter of 2016. If successful, this trial is expected to result in filing for full marketing authorization with the EMA, the US FDA and Health Canada in 2019. </p><p>Kiadis' second product, ATIR 201, is expected to enter clinical development for thalassemia with a Phase I/II trial in the first quarter of 2016.</p><p>Kiadis has been funded to date by international investors including LSP, Alta Partners, DFJ Esprit, Quest for Growth, MedSciences Capital and NOM.</p>
