<p>The FDA on 27 May approved Actavis' and Patheon Pharmaceuticals' Viberzi (eluxadoline) and Valeant's and its subsidiary Salix's Xifaxan (rifaximin) to treat adults with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).</p><p>As many as 35 million adult Americans may have IBS, with 40% of those experiencing the subtype with diarrhea symptoms, including urgency, loose, watery stools and abdominal pain.</p><p>"The unpredictable symptoms experienced by patients with IBS-D can have a significant impact on everyday life," said Dr William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan Health System. "</p><p>Viberzi, which has mixed opioid receptor activity &ndash; a mu receptor agonist, a delta receptor antagonist and a kappa receptor agonist &ndash; was approved as a twice-daily, oral treatment for adults with IBS-D. </p><p>The FDA has recommended the drug be classified as a controlled substance. </p><p>Actavis said the recommendation has been submitted to the US Drug Enforcement Administration and once Viberzi receives final scheduling designation, the updated labeling will be available. </p><p>Pending final scheduling designation, Actavis anticipates launching Viberzi in the first quarter of 2016.</p><p>The drug was approved in the US based on two Phase III studies, which Actavis said demonstrated significant superiority over placebo on the composite endpoint of simultaneous improvement in both abdominal pain and diarrhea at both 75mg and 10 mg twice daily doses. </p><p>The primary efficacy responder endpoint was evaluated over the duration of double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment. </p><p>Response rates were compared based on patients who met the daily composite response criteria of improvement in both abdominal pain and stool consistency on the same day for at least 50% of the days from weeks 1 to 12, the FDA's endpoint, and weeks 1 to 26, the European Medicines Agency's endpoint.</p><p>Xifaxan can be taken orally three times a day for 14 days to treat IBS-D. But patients who experience a recurrence of symptoms can be retreated with a 14-day treatment course up to two times. </p><p>Xifaxan, an antibiotic derived from rifampin, was previously approved as treatment for travelers&rsquo; diarrhea caused by E coli and to reduce the risk in adults of recurring overt hepatic encephalopathy, the changes in brain function that occur when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood. </p><p>The FDA approval in IBS-D "extends the reach of Xifaxan" to a population "greatly in need of a different treatment approach," declared Dr Bill Forbes, president of medical and R&D and chief development officer at Salix.</p><p>The FDA approved Xifaxan in IBS-D based on data from three studies of more than 3,000 patients. The results of the TARGET 1 and 2 trials showed patients treated with Xifaxan 550mg achieved relief of the FDA composite endpoint of stool consistency and abdominal pain versus placebo. </p><p>The TARGET 3 trial showed that patients who responded to treatment with Xifaxan 550mg but experienced recurrent symptoms responded to repeat treatment in the FDA composite endpoint versus placebo.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
