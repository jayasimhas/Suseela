<p>Intellectual property rights (IPR)-related issues pertaining to the pharmaceutical segment are touchy in India. They figure prominently in the long-running negotiations on the proposed EU-India free trade agreement. Ditto for the US-India tug of war over IPR issues.</p><p>While the USTR's 2014 "Special 301" report kept unchanged India's position as a "priority watch list" partner nation that presents the most significant IPR-related concerns, there has been an apparent thaw in US pressure since.</p><p>Last December the US said that it was <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-softening-on-Indian-IPR-fuels-trade-off-claims-355657%5d" target="_new">concluding its out-of-cycle review</a> of India with respect to IPR-related issues amid "useful commitments" made by India including to institutionalize high-level engagement on IP issues, fuelling trade-off allegations. The 2015 Special 301 report is awaited.</p><p>Against this backdrop and on the occasion of World IP day on 26 April, <i>Scrip </i>posed a clutch of burning questions to Ranjana Smetacek, director general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), the voice of foreign innovator firms in the country. OPPI has long advocated a robust IPR regime. </p><p>Ms Smetacek claimed that the seemingly large number of patents held by foreign firms in India was "deceptive" and underscored the importance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reported recent reference to the need to bring India's patent laws on par with global norms. Indian firms, however, have argued that much was being read into the PM's statement, and it was also perhaps being taken out of context.</p><p><b>Scrip: </b>India's draft national IPR policy suggests a string of measures to help resolve IP disputes including designation of a specialized patent bench in the High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras for speedy disposal of patent cases and the designation of one IP court at the district level depending on the number of such cases filed. Does this allay some of big pharma's concerns around delays in the judicial system in India/inadequate IP enforcement?</p><p><b>Ranjana Smetacek:</b> One of our inputs to the draft IPR policy is the need for specialized IP courts, to ensure effective and timely enforcement. Further, since patents involve technical issues, it is recommended that a panel of technical experts be attached to the specialized benches, to support judges on the technical issues involved in disputes. It would be relevant to point out that the Bharatiya Janata Party manifesto, one year ago, also promised the setting up of courts specially equipped to deal with IPR cases. </p><p><b>Scrip: </b>Some pro-health activist groups, though, argue that specific IP courts may be more sensitive to IP enforcement issues and may potentially undermine public interest. Are such concerns valid?</p><p><b>RS:</b> Patent protection and continued research are in the public interest. There are still huge unmet medical needs in cancer, diabetes and mental illness (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's remain unconquered) and dengue remains a threat to 40% of the world's population. Clearly, there has to be access to medicines for everybody but, equally, if there isn't a return on investment, how will innovators justify investing in research for new medicines? According to a 2014 Tufts study, the average cost of developing a drug, including the cost of failure, is pegged at $2.6bn. Protecting intellectual property will help bring new solutions for rare diseases and new medicines to save and improve lives. Access to healthcare extends beyond the cost of medicine, to the proximity, quality and functionality of the infrastructure that supports that access. More than affordability, the barrier to access is the inability to pay out-of-pocket and the lack of insurance cover. </p><p><b>Scrip: </b>India's draft IPR policy also aims to integrate IP with government initiatives such as "Make in India'', ''Digital India'' and ''Smart Cities''. How crucial is such effective linkage to the success of these initiatives; how best can such integration be done?</p><p><b>RS:</b> Prime Minister Modi's 'Make in India' vision lists a vibrant IPR regime as one of its stated goals. Stronger IP protection will reduce business uncertainty and increase investor confidence. Greater FDI will augment partnerships with foreign firms and lead to more technology transfers. A 2014 study, by economists Robert Shapiro and Aparna Mathur, predicted that India could well become a global center for innovative drug development and production, increase the life expectancy of its people, expand output and employment, and achieve considerable cost savings in medical care and government subsidies by increasing its IP protection.</p><p><b>Scrip</b>: Despite all the concerns against India's IPR regime, data suggests that of the 4,614 pharmaceutical <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-firms-Dont-judge-IP-regime-by-isolated-cases-354815%5d" target="_new">patents granted</a> in India between January 2005 and 10 October 2014, 3,575 were for those by foreign applicants. Just 22 patents were revoked by the patent office &ndash; 15 from foreign applicants and seven from Indian ones. Indian industry argues that concerns by foreign firms are overstated and present a skewed picture. Your take?</p><p><b>RS:</b> This seemingly large number of patents held by the research-based companies is deceptive. There are finally only about 48 patented products in the market (while one or two core patents might cover a molecule, there could be 200-300 patents/applications that surround the product) and one patent is certainly not equal to one product.</p><p>Importantly, of 48 patented products, three-fourths are under threat. Five patents have been revoked; more than 11 patents are under challenge by way of infringement; patents on an additional seven products are involved in pending opposition proceedings; one patent is under compulsory license; a dozen others are under 'review'. Research-based pharmaceutical companies continually face challenges - from delays and unpredictability to poor enforcement and compulsory licensing threats.</p><p><b>Scrip: </b>Section 3 (d) of India's Patent Act continues to be a thorny issue and has begun finding its way into proposed laws of other emerging markets. Isn't it about time for OPPI to move on accepting that Section 3(d) is in line with Article1.1 of TRIPS. Or then are we perhaps heading towards a TRIPS (North) and TRIPS (South)? </p><p><b>RS:</b> Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act means that much of the incremental innovation done on existing treatments is not patentable in India &ndash; which is bad for medical progress and for patients. </p><p>Experts like Dr Kristina Lybecker, assistant professor of economics at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, have in the past referred to how incremental innovation ensures that an array of drugs is offered within a therapeutic class, and that helps doctors treat individual needs of diverse patients. Dr Lybecker also noted that innovative improvements can increase the number of available dosing options, reveal new physiological interactions of existing medicines, allow for reformulations to encourage children&rsquo;s compliance, increase the shelf-life or heat-stability of a given drug to secure effectiveness in diverse environments, minimize or eliminate treatment-limiting reactions or side effects, and improve patient compliance.</p><p>[<b>Ed:</b> Section 3 (d) of India's Patent Act - which sets a higher bar for patentability - broadly deals with incremental inventions that are not patentable in India unless they show improved efficacy or unless a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant]</p><p><b>Scrip: </b>Has the new Bharatiya Janata Party government brought improved confidence in terms of a more stable, predictive IPR regime or has there been little change on the ground?</p><p><b>RS:</b> On the eve of World IP day, the research-based pharma industry is encouraged by the view expressed by Prime Minister Modi on April 23, that India's patent laws should be brought on par with global standards to make Asia's third largest economy a hub for outsourced creative services. He said: "If we don't work towards bringing our intellectual property rights on par with global parameters, then the world will not keep relations with us. If we give confidence to the world on IPR, then we can become a destination globally for their creative work."</p>
