<p>Private equity player Carlyle has exited India's Claris Lifesciences, ending a nine-year association with the Ahmedabad-based injectables company.</p><p>First Carlyle Ventures III sold 6,159,267 shares, representing a stake of just under 11.3%, at INR277.03 each via a block deal netting around INR1.7bn ($27m), data on the Bombay Stock Exchange indicated. </p><p>Emsaf Mauritius and Tata AIA Life Insurance Company also bought Claris shares in block deals, the data suggested. </p><p>Last year, Carlyle participated in Claris' share buyback plan offering around 951,828 shares to the Indian firm and netting close to INR240m in the process.</p><p>Carlyle invested $20m in Claris in March 2006 and some investment bankers noted the rather dismal returns over a nine-year horizon. Other experts in the PE space, though, claimed it was a "fairly rich" valuation, though they believe that Carlyle's entry price may have skewed the overall returns. </p><p>These experts also referred to general investment interest in smaller niche Indian firms in areas such as neurology, psychiatry that are using an "umbrella" approach offering both products and treatment-related services. </p><p>"We are seeing an aggregation between services and product play. Such firms can attract early growth funding and potentially see attractive valuations mid-way via the entry of a strategic partner," the expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Investment bankers, though, claim that such niche plays may be at a very nascent stage and the services component would essentially be aimed at getting "product leverage".</p><h2>Claris</h2><p>Carlyle's exit from Claris comes even as the Gujarat-based firm has, on and off, been speculated to be considering a sale of its injectables business &ndash; something that the firm had denied in February this year.</p><p>Claris on 12 February informed Indian bourses that it was not negotiating the sale of stake in the injectables business, and that the board had "neither considered nor taken any decision" in this regard. </p><p>It, though, hedged its statement, adding: "For the growth of the business, the company continues to explore and evaluate inorganic and strategic opportunities in various forms from time to time. However nothing definitive in this regard has happened."</p><p>Investment bankers, though, maintained that a deal was in the making, though multiple options were likely being evaluated. </p><p>"A joint venture is probably what may be considered but typically such a model would have been inefficient for financial investors such as Carlyle," the banker suggested. </p><p>Claris Lifesciences' specialty injectables business in currently vested in its wholly owned arm, Claris Injectables, while the company also holds 20% in a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Otsuka-opts-for-majority-JV-as-it-links-with-Claris-for-IV-solutions-337969%5d" target="_new">joint venture</a> with Otsuka and Mitsui & Co for the infusions business in India and emerging markets. </p><p>Edelweiss Securities recently indicated that Claris expects to report a 30% compound annual growth rate in revenue in the next three years, backed by a string of new filings and potential launches in the EU and the US and also a tripling of capacity. Claris currently has 13 ANDAs approved, with a pipeline of 25 such filings.</p>
