<p>US companies have been hoarding their foreign earnings &ndash; with an estimated $2tn of untaxed profits sitting overseas &ndash; and President Barack Obama wants firms like Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson to bring their cash back home.</p><p>In his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, unveiled on 2 February, President Obama has called for revamping the way taxes on foreign profits are paid.</p><p>Corporations are supposed to pay 35% on their foreign earnings, but they generally avoid doing so by a loophole that allows them to defer, resulting in the cash piling up overseas. </p><p>President Obama would drop the foreign earnings rate to 19%, but the taxes must be paid on the profits when they are earned &ndash; banning any attempts to defer paying.</p><p>He also is seeking to impose a one-time &ldquo;transition toll charge&rdquo; of 14% on offshore profits, declaring that he would use those funds, estimated to be about $240bn, to finance a $474bn six-year surface transportation reauthorization project &ndash; which he said is pro-growth and fiscally responsible. </p><p>But President Obama would permit companies to reinvest their foreign funds in the US without additional taxes under his plan, the White House said. </p><p>Mr Obama's international reform plan also would prevent US companies from avoiding paying US taxes through so-called inversions &ndash; a practice in which American firms are reincorporating abroad through mergers and acquisitions to pay lower tax rates.</p><p>His proposal also calls for preventing foreign companies operating in America from using excessive interest deductions to "strip" earnings out of the US and avoid paying taxes there. </p><p>The US Treasury Department this past September took initial steps to reduce the economic benefits of inversions (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-admin-takes-action-to-thwart-tax-inversion-354073" target="_new">23 September 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Legality-effectiveness-of-US-Treasury-inversion-actions-questioned-354097" target="_new">24 September 2014</a>).</p><p>But President Obama has insisted the only way to fully address inversions is through action by the Congress. </p><p>In his budget request to Congress, the president also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 28%, with a 25% effective rate for domestic manufacturing &ndash; a proposal he repeated from last year and something for which Republicans have supported, although many in the party want an even lower rate (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brain-research-antimicrobial-resistance-among-Obama-FY15-priorities-350379" target="_new">4 March 2014</a>).</p><p>But Republicans are likely to reject most of the president&rsquo;s other proposals.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr Obama insisted his plan would put the US in line with major competitor countries and encourage greater investment here at home. </p><p>The rate reduction would be paid for by eliminating dozens of inefficient tax expenditures and through additional structural reforms &ndash; addressing accelerated depreciation and reducing the tax preference for debt financed investment, the White House said. </p><p>During a briefing with reporters, White House officials said the president would not agree to a "tax holiday" &ndash; something that has long been backed by the biopharmaceutical industry &ndash; calling it "bad policy."</p><p>An October 2011 report from the Institute for Policy Studies found that a 2004 tax holiday failed to live up to the promise that it would create US jobs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-IOM-focus-on-affordable-essential-benefits-expected-to-stir-debate-on-drug-prices-322128" target="_new">10 October 2011</a>).</p><p>Pharmaceutical makers benefited the most from the 2004 tax holiday on repatriated profits than any other industry &ndash; pocketing an estimated $30bn in tax savings on the $100bn in offshore earnings they brought back to the US, the group said. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
