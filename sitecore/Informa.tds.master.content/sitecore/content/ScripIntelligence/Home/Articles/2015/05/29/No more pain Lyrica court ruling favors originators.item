<p>Swiss claims are in the news again. No, not the allegations of corruption and bribery laid at FIFA's door, but the latest ruling from the Court of Appeal in the UK Lyrica (pregabalin) patent case. </p><p>In its 28 May ruling, which concerned the interpretation of "Swiss form" (second medical use) claims, the Court of Appeal said that if a generic company knows, or can reasonably foresee, that its product might be used for a patented indication of the originator drug, it will be infringing the patent on that indication. </p><p>The ruling, which effectively reverses a previous High Court judgment, shifts the balance in favor of originator companies seeking to prevent generics being used for still-patented indications of otherwise patent-expired drugs. </p><p>It also helps to clarify some legal issues surrounding the Swiss form claim, a rather convoluted type of second medical use claim that covers "the use of a compound X for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for treating disease Y". Simplified second medical use claims were introduced in 2007 under the European Patent Convention 2000, and Swiss form claims can no longer be used for new products. </p><p>The Lyrica case originated in 2014 when Actavis filed for UK approval of Lecaent, its generic version of the Pfizer product. Lyrica is marketed in the UK for epilepsy, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and neuropathic pain. Its compound patent expired in 2013, but Warner-Lambert (a Pfizer group company) has a Swiss form claim covering its use in the pain indication.</p><p>Actavis duly sought approval only for the first two indications, and its proposed product information for Lecaent omitted the pain indication &ndash; a so-called "skinny label". </p><p>But Warner-Lambert said it was concerned that because doctors generally prescribe pregabalin generically, Lecaent might end up being dispensed to patients with neuropathic pain, and so it began patent infringement proceedings. In December 2014 it applied for an interim injunction requiring Actavis to take steps to prevent Lecaent being dispensed for pain, pending the outcome of a full validity and infringement trial that is due to take place later this month. </p><p>The High Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Pfizer-UK-appeals-generic-Lyrica-ruling-as-patent-trial-nears-356332" target="_new">refused the injunction</a> on the grounds that Warner-Lambert did not have an arguable case for infringement and that even if it did, the balance of the risk of injustice favored the refusal of the injunction.</p><p>In a subsequent judgment in February, the High Court struck down Warner-Lambert's claim for indirect infringement, saying this would require infringement by persons further down the supply chain, and this was not the case because "no wholesaler or pharmacist will use Lecaent to prepare a pharmaceutical composition". Warner-Lambert appealed, and the case came before the Court of Appeal in April. </p><h2>What does "for" mean?</h2><p>A key aspect of the case concerned the meaning of the word "for" in Swiss form claims. The High Court had said that "for" implies a "requirement of subjective intention on the part of the manufacturer that the medicament or pharmaceutical composition will be used for treating the specified condition". In other words, the patentee would have to show Actavis had a "specific subjective intention" or desire for Lecaent to be used for pain, and in this case there was no evidence that it did. </p><p>However, Lord Justice Floyd of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the word "for" does not require subjective intention to be shown in order for there to be patent infringement. Instead, it is enough that the manufacturer knows, or can reasonably foresee, the ultimate intentional use of the product in the patented indication. In other words, the generics firm does not itself need to have shown any intention to have the product used for that indication. Lord Justice Floyd said it was therefore "plain that Warner-Lambert have an arguable case of infringement" &ndash; this will be considered at the trial towards the end of this month. </p><p>The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision to refuse the preliminary injunction but reversed its decision to strike down Warner-Lambert's indirect infringement claim. This means that both the direct and indirect infringement claims will go to trial. </p><h2>"Helpful guidance"</h2><p>Law firm Herbert Smith Freehills said the appeals court had provided "helpful, and detailed, guidance on issues of construction and infringement affecting Swiss form claims. It remains to be seen whether Actavis will be found to infringe when the matter goes to trial at the end of June and, if they do, what remedy the court will award to Warner-Lambert."</p><p>As for the business implications, the firm said it would no longer be possible for a generics firm to argue that they do not fall within a Swiss form claim because they have no specific intention for their product to be used for a patented indication. Moreover, just having a "skinny label" that does not mention indications covered by a Swiss form claim is unlikely to be enough to avoid a patent infringement claim.</p><p>"There is, therefore, more scope than there was after the High Court decision in this case for originators to take action where it is foreseeable that some of the generic medicine may be used for a patented indication regardless of the generic manufacturer's intention," Herbert Smith Freehills noted, although it cautioned that any application for an injunction in such cases would still have to be justified on the balance of justice.</p><p>It also pointed out that the case deals only with Swiss form claims, and noted that the High Court had made it clear that nothing it said about such claims necessarily applied to EPC 2000 second medical use claims. "It therefore remains to be seen how the English courts will deal with the question of intention in relation to EPC 2000 claims." </p><p>For Claire Phipps-Jones and Brian Cordery of law firm Bristows, it will be "interesting to see what the trial judge makes of the Court of Appeal decision, particularly given Floyd LJ&rsquo;s observation that 'the judge found that in these circumstances, it was foreseeable that a generic version of Lyrica with a skinny label will be dispensed for patients who have in fact been prescribed the drug for pain'. Either way, an appeal is almost certainly inevitable and it is not hard to imagine these issues eventually being considered by the Supreme Court such is their complexity and importance."</p><p>Christopher Hayes of IBB Solicitors said this was the first time that the UK Courts had had to deal with issues surrounding the launch of a pharmaceutical product using a skinny label where the originator still has a second medical use patent in force. </p><p>"Such patents are extremely important and valuable in the pharmaceutical sector and providing guidance as to the scope of such patents is of enormous assistance to companies considering launching for non-patented indications," Dr Hayes said. </p><h2>NHS guidance on pregabalin for pain</h2><p>The High Court had also looked at the question of what practical measures should be taken to prevent Lecaent being dispensed for pain, given that doctors usually prescribe pregabalin by the generic name. On 26 February the court concluded that the NHS should issue guidance to doctors to use the Lyrica name when prescribing pregabalin for pain, and that guidance was duly issued. </p><p>The guidance says that when prescribing pregabalin for the treatment of neuropathic pain, doctors should "so far as reasonably possible" write the prescription with only the Lyrica name, and not the generic name pregabalin or any other generic brand. When prescribing pregabalin for the treatment of anything other than pain, doctors should continue to prescribe by the generic name.</p>
