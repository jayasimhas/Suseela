<p>President Barack Obama has decided to bring home all America military troops from West Africa, except for 100 soldiers, who will remain in the country, under what he said was a "transition" in the US mission to fight Ebola.</p><p>But the move came on the same day the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were again on the upswing &ndash; rising for the second week in a row after a couple of months of steady decline. </p><p>"Despite improvements in case finding and management, burial practices, and community engagement, the decline in case incidence has stalled," WHO said.</p><p>It reported there were 144 new confirmed cases in the past week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. </p><p>Guinea had the sharpest increase, with 65 new confirmed cases, versus 39 the week before, WHO said. </p><p>The agency said transmission of Ebola remains widespread in Sierra Leone, which reported 76 new confirmed cases, while the resurgence in cases in the western district of Port Loko continued for a second week. </p><p>"The spike in cases in Guinea and continued widespread transmission in Sierra Leone underline the considerable challenges that must still be overcome to get to zero cases," WHO said. "The infrastructure, systems, and people needed to end the epidemic are now in place; response measures must now be fully implemented."</p><p>Liberia, however, reported only three new cases of Ebola, WHO said.</p><p>It said a total of 22,894 people have been infected with Ebola during the current outbreak, with 9,177 of those dying of the disease.</p><p>Surrounded by healthcare workers and Ebola survivors at the White House on 11 February, President Obama emphasized he was not declaring "mission accomplished" by taking the majority of the 3,000 American troops out of West Africa by 30 April.</p><p>But, he said, because the US military was so effective in setting up the infrastructure in the three nations hardest hit by Ebola, the broader international coalition and the people who live locally are now capable of handling the situation.</p><p>President Obama also said the US would expand its civilian response to Ebola.</p><p>The president also stressed that US activities to develop drugs and vaccines against Ebola would continue.</p><p>The White House noted the US "achieved a major milestone" earlier this month with the launch of the Phase II/III PREVAIL trial in Liberia testing two candidate vaccines: one jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline, and the other from NewLink Genetics, Merck and the Canadian government (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The White House noted NIAID supported preclinical trials of Mapp Biopharmaceutical's ZMapp and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority is now sponsoring the manufacturing of the monoclonal antibody medicine for clinical studies to determine the product's safety and efficacy, including a trial in West Africa (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-Ebola-vaccines-set-for-testing-in-Liberia-356313" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The US government also has provided funding for other experimental Ebola drugs, including Tekmira's TKM-Ebola and BioCryst Pharmaceutical's BCX4430, which are in safety trials (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BioCryst-Ebola-drug-BCX4430-enters-safety-testing-355673" target="_new">16 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-pumps-more-cash-into-BioCryst-Ebola-antiviral-353375" target="_new">14 August 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-military-gives-Tekmira-go-ahead-on-Ebola-contract-but-ends-Sarepta-work-335715" target="_new">03 October 2012</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
