<p>Lawmakers acknowledged at a 30 April Capitol Hill hearing that much more work needs to be done on a revised bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical research enterprise and the process for assessing and approving new therapies &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; which was unveiled a day earlier.</p><p>Indeed, said Representative Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), one of the "Cures" authors, there are many brackets in several sections of the draft bill's text and placeholders where language still needs to be hammered out on certain provisions.</p><p>Lawmakers managed to whittle down the size of the bill to about half what it was in its original draft form when it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">revealed in January</a> &ndash; from about 400 pages to 199 &ndash; with many of the divisive measures now gone, including the added exclusivity that had been the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/21st-Century-Cures-leaders-vow-to-work-out-differences-356688" target="_new">trigger</a> that caused Representative DeGette to back away from the first version. </p><p>The revised Cures bill is calling for a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn boost</a> to the annual budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over the next five fiscal years &ndash; which had Dr Kathy Hudson, deputy director for science, outreach and policy at the agency, repeatedly saying "thank you" to lawmakers.</p><p>"The research community is ecstatic to see these funds" in the bill's language, she said.</p><p>Those dollars, however, are not guaranteed, since they must be appropriated by the House committee that oversees those actions and then agreed to by Senate appropriators, after which both chambers must shake hands on the amount.</p><p>But the Cures bill does not currently include any authorizations for increasing the FDA's funding, despite numerous added mandates for the agency, such as requiring the agency to establish a structured framework for the "meaningful incorporation" of patient experience data into the regulatory decision-making process, including the assessment of desired benefits and tolerable risks associated with new treatments.</p><p>The draft legislation also calls for the FDA to issue several new guidance documents, including one intended to assist in the development of biomarkers, with input from public-private partnerships, and establish a codified process for qualification of biomarkers and other drug development tools. </p><p>Another guidance the bill is mandating is aimed at helping to advance the clinical development of genetically targeted treatments by clarifying how investigations could be designed to answer specific questions about narrow subpopulations of patients.</p><p>Also required under the bill is a guidance intended to assist companies in incorporating adaptive designs and Bayesian statistical modeling into their clinical protocols and new drug applications.</p><p>"We're asking FDA to make many changes to its current operation," said Congresswoman DeGette, so "we need to make sure the agency has the resources to carry out these duties."</p><p>"It's critical we adequately fund the agencies to do all the work we expect them to do," added Representative Doris Matsui (Democrat-California). "We expect the FDA to make sure food and drugs safety, and it's our responsibility to ensure FDA has resources to do so."</p><p>She urged her colleagues to provide a similar amount of added funding for the FDA as the authors of the Cures bill included in the legislative draft for the NIH. </p><p>When asked by Representative Joe Kennedy (Democrat-Massachusetts) if the FDA has adequate funding to deal with the new programs and responsibilities it will be tasked with under Cures, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, responded, "We're very stretched."</p><p>"We're up against the wall always," she told members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. "We are always asked to keep doing more with less."</p><p>Dr Woodcock said one of the things that's the first to go when dollars are tight is the ability to provide advice to drug makers, because the funds spent on those activities are considered "discretionary."</p><p>But, she said, "It's been shown we can cut years off of company's development time if they come in for timely advice."</p><p><b>Hiring barriers</b></p><p>"With all the novel and complicated issues that we're asking the FDA to analyze and approve, I do worry that the FDA may not have the latitude in the government hiring process to hire the best and brightest minds in the field," said Representative Chris Collins (Republican-New York).</p><p>He noted that Health and Human Services &ndash; the parent agency over the FDA and the NIH &ndash; currently works under caps on the number of senior biomedical researchers that apply to the agencies and the salaries that can be paid.</p><p>Earlier in the week at a Senate hearing, Dr Woodcock noted the agency was having a particularly hard time recruiting neurologists because of the salary issue.</p><p>"We are having a desperate time getting enough at time when neurodegenerative disease picking up," she told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">28 April hearing</a>.</p><p>"The science right now is exploding," Dr Woodcock said. "We need scientists who can go toe-to-toe with the best industry scientists. We have great difficulty hiring at the senior level."</p><p>At the House hearing, Representative Collins said a provision in the Cures draft would eliminate the FDA and NIH hiring caps and also would increase the biomedical scientist salaries to as high as $400,000 annually &ndash; President Barack Obama's current level of pay &ndash; "which will hopefully make you competitive."</p><p>She noted one problem the FDA has in hiring is many people in industry hold stock in the firms for which they work and are unable to divest it.</p><p>The FDA currently does not allow prospective employees to put those holdings into a blind trust, Dr Woodcock said.</p><p>She noted that one scientist the FDA was trying to hire from industry who was "passionate" about coming to the agency couldn't because of his stock holdings &ndash; which Dr Woodcock said was his &ldquo;family's future.&rdquo;</p><p>"We've heard that again and again," she said.</p><p>Mr Collins said a measure to fix that problem is one provision he wants to ensure is included in the final Cures bill.</p><p>Dr Woodcock said the agency also needs the ability to do direct hiring rather than the slow government process, which often takes nine months or more.</p><p>"We can't reach the people who we need," she said.</p><p>The law forbids the agency from the direct hiring process because "people are worried we are going to hire our relatives," Dr Woodcock said. </p><p>But, she said, "I don't have too many relatives who are PhD neuropharmacologists."</p><p>Representative DeGette said lawmakers still have to get the Cures bill scored by the Congressional Budget Office &ndash; the nonpartisan organization that provides budgetary advice to lawmakers &ndash; and "We have to find the money for what we are going to do."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
