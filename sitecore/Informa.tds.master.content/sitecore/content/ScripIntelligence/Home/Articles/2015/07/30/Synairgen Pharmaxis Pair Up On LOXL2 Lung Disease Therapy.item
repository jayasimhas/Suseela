<p>UK biotechnology company Synairgen plc is teaming up with Australian pharmaceutical company Pharmaxis Ltd to develop a new drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) which it hopes to pair up with a big pharma on later down the line. </p><p>Synairgen and Pharmaxis are developing a selective inhibitor to the lysyl oxidase type 2 enzyme (LOXL2) from the latter firm's LOXL2 program. The two companies will use Synairgen's BioBank platform of advanced human tissue models in order to select a new drug candidate targeting the LOXL2 enzyme to take forward into a Phase I trial by 2017. </p><p>Synairgen CEO Richard Marsden told <i>Scrip</i> the collaboration was a "beautiful marriage" of Synairgen's strong biology and Pharmaxis' chemistry expertise. </p><p>He noted that Boehringer Ingelhiem is also working in partnership with Pharmaxis on a Semicarbazide-Sensitive Amine Oxidase (SSAO) candidate. "Pharmaxis are a very credible company but they can only do so much and we are looking for people who can do good chemistry and have something exciting," he said. "We have known of each other for some time, but things have been heating up during this year and we realized we can really help each other."</p><p>Though the collaboration is for an early stage product, Mr Marsden said if and when the product gets to market it will be able to compete with available IPF therapies, Roche Holdings AG's <i>Esbriet</i> (pirfenidone) and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH's <i>Ofev</i> (nintedanib), because of its different mechanism of action. </p><p>"LOXL2 is an enzyme which links fibers together and when these fibers become stiff this affects peoples' lungs. It has been observed that LOXL2 is elevated in people with IPF and the higher your level of LOXL2 the worse your prognosis. So LOXL2 is an established target, but trying to find a way to hit the target has been more challenging," he said, adding that recently launched therapies for IPF "were very welcomed as it had been a long time coming to have some drugs to help these patients." </p><p>But despite these drugs patients still experience a decline in lung function and need something else to try. "IPF patients need more options," Mr Marsden said. "So either the LOXL2 approach is going to be so fantastic it's going to knock the other meds to the side, which is an unlikely scenario, or it will be used as an add-on with other medicines. Because it's a different mode of action it won't just double up trying to hit the same target more powerfully: the LOXL2 therapy will hit a different target."</p><p>IPF affects more than 70,000 people in the US and EU. Current products are expected to produce revenues in excess of $1.1bn by 2017. </p><p>No financial details of the deal were disclosed but R&D costs will be covered by Synairgen. The IPF program will be managed by a joint steering committee through to the end of Phase I or Phase IIa clinical trials. "We expect to spend low single-digit millions of pounds to progress the product through Phase I. There is nothing expensive about what we plan to do and we will be using our technology that has been built up over a number of years," Mr Marsden said. </p><p>Once the product hits Phase II stages of development Synairgen and Pharmaxis will be seeking a bigger company to help progress the drug. "We are two small companies. We don't have this big ambition to try and market the drug ourselves. We will be looking to sell this on as an asset outright or, more likely, form some kind of licensing agreement so a large pharmaceutical company can progress it. All the top 30 pharmas will be on our schedule at BIO and events like that. But we will also make contact with the niche, specialist companies that might be looking to market a specialized respiratory product in different territories."</p><p>On the topic of future collaborations between Synairgen and its Australian partner, Mr Marsden said, "Our relationship is at an early stage and there are a lot of scenarios for how we might work together in the future. We need to be driven by the science and will make decisions based on the characteristics of the compound we find."</p><p>Whilst Synairgen is progressing with a LOXL2 program in IPF, Pharmaxis will explore other potential uses for LOXL2 in liver fibrosis and cancer. Â </p><p><i>This story was corrected on 7 August 2015. It originally stated that "Boehringer Ingelhiem is also working in partnership with Pharmaxis on a LOXL2 candidate." This has been corrected to say that Boehringer's product is an SSAO candidate. </i></p>
