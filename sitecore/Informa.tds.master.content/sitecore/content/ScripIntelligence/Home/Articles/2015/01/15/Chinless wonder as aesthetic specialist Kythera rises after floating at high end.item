<p>Aesthetically-focused Kythera Biopharmaceuticals didn't rely on beauty alone to boost its $70.4 million initial public offering on 11 October - the late-stage status of the company's chin-thinning product and previously reported positive Phase III clinical trial results likely appealed to stock buyers who have been wary of earlier-stage investments.</p><p>Kythera said in late September that its IPO would hit the market at $14 to $16 per share for four million shares, giving the Los Angeles-based company $60 million at the mid-point of its price range (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-cash-to-put-Kytheras-chin-thinner-through-Phase-III-335399" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 26 September 2012</a>). However, the IPO priced at $16 and Kythera floated 4.4 million shares then saw its stock price close up 23.7% at $19.79.</p><p>Patient enrolment is complete and data will be reported during the first half of 2013 for two Phase III clinical trials in the US and Canada for ATX-101, Kythera's injectable drug to reduce submental fat - the clinical name for a "double chin." </p><p>The product is a proprietary formulation of sodium deoxycholate, which is a well-known component of human bile that promotes the breakdown of dietary fat.</p><p>The company reported statistically significant reductions in moderate to severe submental fat at 24 weeks after treatment with ATX-101 compared to placebo, according to a five-point clinician rating scale (mean of 0.77 vs. 0.36; p<0.0001) and="" a="" seven-point="" subject="" satisfaction="" rating="" scale=""></0.0001)><0.001) used="" in="" the="" second="" of="" two="" phase="" iii="" european="" clinical="" trials=""></0.001)><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Kythera-doubles-down-in-Las-Vegas-with-second-set-of-positive-chin-thinner-data-331738" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 13 June 2012</a>).</p><p>Kythera also is conducting research in hair and fat biology, facial contouring and pigmentation modulation, but the company has not moved any of those programmes into the clinic.</p><p>It will net $65.5 million from its IPO, after expenses related to the offering, to support the North American Phase III ATX-101 studies. The company also made 660,000 shares available to cover potential demand for its common stock in excess of the IPO, which would generate additional gross proceeds of $10.6 million.</p><p>Kythera's venture capital investors were expected to reduce their ownership stakes via the IPO from 19.5% to 14.6% for Versant Venture II, from 16.4% to 12.3% for ARCH Venture Fund VI, and from 14.8% to 11% for Prospect Venture Partners III.</p><p>Kythera and Intercept Pharmaceuticals both did something on 11 October that many newly public biopharma companies have not been able to do this year: sell their IPOs at the top of previously announced price ranges. </p><p>New York-based Intercept debuted on the Nasdaq at $15 per share and its stock closed up 26.7% at $19. The company, whose primary biliary cirrhosis treatment obeticholic acid is under evaluation in the Phase III POISE clinical trial, grossed $75 million from the sales of five million common stock shares. Its preliminary IPO pricing was estimated at $13 to $15 in September (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intercept-could-net-62.9m-at-middle-of-IPO-price-range-335508" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 28 September 2012</a>).</p><p>Regulus sold shares in its 4 October IPO at $4 each, which was 66% lower than the top end of its previous $10 to $12 price estimate (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Regulus-floats-after-slashing-IPO-price-but-partner-placements-add-to-tally-335762" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 October 2012</a>).</p><p>And Hyperion Therapeutics priced its 26 July IPO at $10 per share, but it previously anticipated that its stock would debut at $11 to $13 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hyperion-hits-IPO-target-with-more-shares-at-lower-price-333442" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 1 August 2012</a>).</p><p>
