<p>Novartis AG's histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor <i>Farydak</i> (panobinostat; also known as Faridak) has secured approval in Europe for the treatment of multiple myeloma &ndash; making it the first drug of this class to reach the European market.</p><p>Farydak is approved for use in combination with bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals' Velcade) and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior regimens including Velcade and an immunomodulatory agent. </p><p>The product, which is already approved for use in the US, Chile and Japan, received a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartiss-Farydak-gets-EU-positive-opinion-359146" target="_new">positive recommendation</a> from the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee the CHMP (committee for medicinal products for human use) back in June this year. </p><p>Bruno Strigini, president of Novartis Oncology, said: "This milestone, the approval of a first-in-class treatment option for patients in need of new therapies, is the result of more than 13 years of dedicated research, which has helped us better understand the development of multiple myeloma."</p><p>Novartis's drug will face direct competition from Pomalyst (pomalidomide; Celgene), which is already marketed as an add-on to the Velcade plus dexamethasone combination in multiple myeloma patients. Pomalyst is also approved in Europe in the second-line setting, for use in adult patients who have received at least two prior therapies. Sales of the drug are expected to reach $45m in the five major European markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, by 2020.</p><p>The EU approval of Farydak is based on efficacy and safety data in a subgroup analysis of 147 patients who had received at least two prior regimens during the Phase III PANORAMA-1 study. The most common non-hematological adverse reactions included diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Treatment-emergent hematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia. It is this unfavorable side effect profile which gained the drug a black-box warning in the US. </p><p>Analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare noted in a 2013 analysis, prior to Farydak's approval in the US or Europe, that "negative tolerability perceptions towards HDAC inhibitors will limit the wide-scale adoption of the drug in the multiple myeloma market." Farydak's indication in Europe reflects the product's approved use in the US, which wasn't what Novartis initially targeted. The company had originally submitted its application for relapsed multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone without the need for prior treatment. </p><p>The price of Farydak is assumed to be in line with other HDAC inhibitors already on the market like Zolinza (vorinostat; Merck & Co), at a US ex-factory wholesale price of $53.58 per mg. Typical treatment with the combination therapy is 20 mg three times a week, on weeks one and two of repeated three-week cycles.</p><p>Farydak, which was designated as an EU orphan product on 8 November 2012, works by inhibiting the activity of HDACs &ndash; slowing the over-development of plasma cells in multiple myeloma patients or causing the cells to die.</p>
