<p><p>Merck & Co and its Asian partner Samsung Bioepis have announced positive results from their late-stage study of SB5, a biosimilar version of AbbVie's blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.</p><p>The companies said 08 July that in a Phase III trial comparing SB5 with Humira (adalimumab) that the copycat version met its primary endpoints. The study used the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) at 24 weeks as the primary endpoint. It showed that rheumatoid arthritis patients improved by at least 20% during the 24 weeks when taking the biosimilar. </p><p>Merck and Samsung's biosimilar of Humira is the third such copycat blockbuster the pair has been working on to make it through late-stage studies. Regulatory applications for a version of Amgen's Enbrel (etanercept) and Johnson and Johnson's Remicade (infliximab) have been filed in the EU and South Korea. </p><p>Merck teamed up with Samsung Bioepis, which is a joint venture between Samsung BioLogics and Biogen, in February 2013. Merck paid an undisclosed upfront and did not reveal of the financial details of the transaction. This is Merck's second foray into biosimilars; the big pharma created a separate division in 2009 to create the large molecule copycats, but shuttered the unit in 2012 after several setbacks. </p><p>AbbVie management has <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-biosimilars-not-a-threat-to-Humira-358037" target="_new">spoken at length</a> about its strategy to defend Humira and said during a recent earnings call that it was not threatened by biosimilar development. AbbVie insists that it has patents that cover the blockbuster until 2022. The drug brings in more than $14bn annually and represents more than 60% of the company's sales. </p><p><p>
