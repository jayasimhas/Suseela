<p><p>Teva Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. CEO Erez Vigodman assured investors during the company&rsquo;s third quarter sales and earnings call Oct. 29 that its acquisition of Allergan Inc.&rsquo;s generic drug business will not be derailed. </p><p>Allergan confirmed the same day that it has entered into <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292" target="_new">preliminary friendly merger negotiations</a> with Pfizer Inc., after the big pharma approached the company. But Teva insisted that Pfizer&rsquo;s interest in Allergan won&rsquo;t stand in the way of its own strategy to consolidate in generics. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way out from the Allergan transaction. No way out,&rdquo; Vigodman said. &ldquo;The deal is sealed.&rdquo; The company acknowledged that it is still awaiting antitrust clearance, however, before being in a position to close the transaction. </p><p>Teva announced <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet/77/31/Teva-Gets-What-It-Wants--Allergan-Generics-Not-Mylan" target="_new">plans to buy</a> Allergan&rsquo;s generics business &ndash; the businesses formerly made up of Actavis and Watson Laboratories Inc. &ndash; in August for $40.5bn. The deal will secure Teva&rsquo;s position as the number one generic drug company in the world and better position it to compete in a consolidating industry. </p><p>CEO-Global Generic Medicines Sigurdur Olafsson highlighted the significance of Teva&rsquo;s customer consolidation during the quarterly call. The company&rsquo;s top three customers account for 83% of the company&rsquo;s generic business. In the US, the top four customers make up 91%, he said. </p><p>&ldquo;There has been such a transformation on our customer side, I think this move will change the generic space in terms of product supply, in terms of offering what our customers are looking for,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>Teva moved to expand its generics business as the company sought to batten down its foundation in generic drugs &ndash; part of Vigodman&rsquo;s strategy to turnaround the struggling business after he took over the helm in February 2014. At the same time, Teva is also expanding its specialty business, currently dominated by the multiple sclerosis therapy <i>Copaxone</i> (glatiramer). </p><p><b>US Copaxone Sales Not Stymied By Generic</b></p><p>Copaxone is <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/7/30/Teva-Cautiously-Optimistic-On-Copaxone-Despite-Generic" target="_new">facing competition</a> from the first generic version, Novartis AG&rsquo;s <i>Glatopa</i>, which launched in June. Teva has been successful, however, switching patients to a new 40 mg version that is dosed just three times a week versus daily. </p><p>Sales of Copaxone declined 2% in the third quarter over the year-ago period to $1.09bn, the firm reported, but most of the slippage came ex-US. Sales of the franchise in the US increased 10% to a record high of $878m, mainly due to higher sales volumes. </p><p>US market share for Copaxone products in the MS market in terms of new and total prescriptions were 27.1% and 29.3%, respectively, the firm said, citing IMS data. The 40 mg version accounted for 76% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the US. The 40 mg together with the 20 mg accounted for 94.5% of the glatiramer space, Vigodman added. Sales outside the US fell 33%. </p><p>One issue for Teva, however, is if it can protect the Copaxone franchise after 2017. Rival Mylan NV announced earlier this year that the US Patent and Trademark Office has instituted inter partes review (IPR) proceedings against three of four patents protecting the 40 mg version. </p><p>Teva believes the patents will be validated, Vigodman said. Nonetheless, he said the company is preparing for the two different scenarios, if a generic version of the 40 mg version should become available. </p><p>As a result, the company provided a forecast for the full-year impact of generic competition in 2017 should it reach the market. Revenues would be $1. bn lower, the firm estimated, and earnings per share would be impacted by $0.65. The guidance includes the Allergan generics business and assumes two generic entrants. </p><p>&ldquo;When you look at the number and you put it all in the right perspective, I think it tells a very compelling story,&rdquo; Vigodman said. Â </p><p>Teva provided a regulatory update on its application for a generic EpiPen, which has fallen behind schedule. The application has an action date before the end of the year, but Teva said it expects to receive a &ldquo;complete response&rdquo; letter from FDA. As a result, a launch would be postponed until the second half of 2016, Olafsson said. </p><p>&ldquo;Nothing new has happened. There&rsquo;s no negative feedback, but simply based on the review, the status of the review, our assumption is that we will get a complete response letter,&rdquo; he said, implying the delay was due to the <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet/77/41/ANDA-Approval-Improvements-Reveal-Just-How-Big-The-Backlog-Is" target="_new">ANDA backlog</a> at FDA. </p><p><i>[Editor's note: This article is also published in &ldquo;The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
