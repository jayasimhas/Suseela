<p>Last year was a rocky one for the 340B drug discount program, with things left uncertain after a US district court judge sided with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in a lawsuit against the Obama administration involving prices for orphan drugs, said Dr Krista Pedley, director of the Office of Pharmacy Affairs at the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).</p><p>The court declared that HRSA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), had gone beyond "the bounds of its statutory authority" when the agency issued a rule in July 2013 permitting certain covered entities to purchase orphan drugs at discounted prices as long as the products were used for non-orphan indications. </p><p>The court vacated the rule, giving PhRMA a victory (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PhRMA-prevails-in-340B-orphan-drug-tussle-352037" target="_new">28 May 2014</a>).</p><p>Nonetheless, HRSA used the challenges created by the lawsuit to "re-group, re-focus and pour our energies into improving the integrity of the 340B program," Dr Pedley said last week in Washington at the Government Drug Pricing Forum.</p><p>Congress created the 340B drug discount program in 1992 under the <i>Public Health Service Act</i> to provide certain hospitals and federally funded grantees access to low prices on pharmaceutical products.</p><p>Drug manufacturers that participate in the US Medicaid program for the poor must offer 340B safety-net covered entities prices at or below the so-called ceiling price &ndash; the highest price a biopharmaceutical maker is permitted by the law to charge participating 340B entities for a prescription medicine.</p><p>Under the original 340B statute, covered entities were generally disproportionate share hospitals &ndash; those that serve indigent populations.</p><p>But under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), Congress added several categories to the covered entities list, such as children's and free-standing cancer hospitals excluded from the Medicare prospective payment system, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals.</p><p>HRSA said it issued its July 2013 rule to clarify the ACA where the 340B pricing for orphan drugs was concerned.</p><p>But PhRMA argued the HRSA rule contravened the plain language of the statute, and was therefore invalid. </p><p>The court agreed.</p><p>So this past July, HRSA issued an "interpretative" rule &ndash; essentially taking the same stance it did in its earlier now-vacated rule on discounts for orphan drugs that are used for non-orphan indications. </p><p>And PhRMA, again, went back to the court seeking to have the interpretative rule struck down.</p><p>Last month, HRSA asked the court to throw out PhRMA's latest suit, insisting the rule was not subject to the court's review &ndash; so the saga has continued.</p><p>On 13 February, HRSA reported that 12 manufacturers &ndash; AuroMedics Pharma, Baxter, Bayer, Eisai, Lilly, Genentech, Ipsen, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Salix and Virtus Pharmaceuticals &ndash; were not offering 340B pricing for their designated orphan drug products when used for their non-orphan indications to newly eligible covered entities. </p><p>"As 340B discounts are not being provided on these drugs, there is no risk of 340B duplicate discounts. Therefore, states may utilize this information to obtain Medicaid rebates for such drugs," HRSA said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in light of the court's earlier ruling in the orphan drug case, HRSA withdrew its proposed Omnibus regulations &ndash; the so-called mega-rule &ndash; in November 2014, Dr Pedley pointed out. </p><p>Now, she said, HRSA is "moving forward in our goal to provide clear policy for all stakeholders."</p><p>"We are working on drafting regulations where we have explicit authority and guidelines subject to notice and comments where we don't have authority," Dr Pedley explained. </p><p>She said HRSA has "explicit authority" for civil monetary penalties (CMPs) for manufacturers and administrative dispute resolutions (ADR).</p><p>Dr Pedley said HRSA plans to publish its CMPs notice of proposed regulation (NPRM) this spring, which will include the calculation of the 340B ceiling price. </p><p>"These penalties would be levied when a manufacturer knowingly and intentionally charges covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price," she said.</p><p>The agency also plans to publish its ADR NPRM in the fall, Dr Pedley said. </p><p>She said additional policies will be addressed in the 340B Omnibus guidelines &ndash; the "mega-guidelines &ndash; which HRSA anticipates publishing in June.</p><p>It will include topics where HRSA does not have rulemaking authority, such as patient definition, hospital eligibility, contract pharmacies, recertification, covered outpatient drug, audits, duplicate discounts, including Medicaid managed care, manufacturer limited distribution plans and more, she said.</p><p>"It is important that all stakeholders review the guidance and provide HRSA with comments for us to assess the impacts on the community," Dr Pedley said. </p><p>She said HRSA is "actively engaged" in manufacturer oversight.</p><p>HRSA is required to collect information from manufacturers to verify the accuracy of 340B ceiling prices and then make ceiling prices available to covered entities.</p><p>The agency expects to operationalize a new system to provide prices by the end of FY 15, which also will include spot checks of sales transactions, Dr Pedley said.</p><p>"We will be using analysis of these sales transactions as an early warning system to conduct proactive analysis and trending of pricing data to assess manufacturer compliance," she said.</p><p>HRSA also is required to establish procedures for refunds and credits to covered entities &ndash; something it plans to address in its upcoming proposed guidance, Dr Pedley said.</p><p>She said HRSA also has statutory authority to audit manufacturers.</p><p>"We review and follow up on all allegations brought to our attention regarding manufacturer compliance, particularly that manufacturers are not charging covered entities at or below the 340B ceiling prices and ensuring that manufacturers are not discriminating against 340B entities," Dr Pedley said.</p><p>She noted that an audit of an undisclosed manufacturer currently is in the process in partnership with the HHS Office of Inspector General.</p><p>"We hope to have more information on the outcome soon," Dr Pedley said, adding that HRSA is developing a protocol to move forward on additional manufacturer audits to be conducted this fiscal year.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
