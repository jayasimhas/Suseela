<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories has announced its first bucket of New Drug Application (NDA) filings with the US FDA for its proprietary products business targeting the dermatology and neurology segments. </p><p>Dr Reddy's said that three 505(b) (2) NDAs - DFD-01 and DFD-09 in the dermatology space and DFN-11 in the neurology segment - had been filed. </p><p>DFD-01 is a corticosteroid delivered in a novel non-irritating spray platform aimed at treating psoriasis, while DFD-09 is a modified release oral tetracycline for rosacea. DFN-11 is a drug-device combination product for acute migraine episodes in certain patient populations that are inadequately managed with existing treatment regimens, a company statement said.</p><p>Raghav Chari, executive vice president of Dr Reddy's proprietary products and president of the firm's US arm, Promius Pharm, said that these products potentially represent new, "compelling options" for specific segments of patients suffering from psoriasis, rosacea and migraine. </p><p>The Hyderabad-based firm had previously indicated that it expects to build targeted dermatology and neurology franchises powered by "lower risk" innovation in the proprietary products segment.</p><p>Earlier this year, at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, Dr Reddy's had maintained that its dermatology commercial footprint in the US was already in place and that it expects to make one to two NDA filings each year from 2016/17 onwards. The Indian firm has more than 15 products at different development or clinical stages with peak sales potential ranging from $30-300m in the proprietary products segment. </p><p>Dr Reddy's CEO G V Prasad has previously told <i>Scrip</i> that the company's lower risk innovation model largely involved looking at a medical problem or patient convenience issue and attempting to address this with existing molecules rather than novel entities. </p><p>The effort, he then said, would essentially involve modifying an existing drug, pharmacokinetics or dose, or combining or even repurposing molecules, and such products would likely go through the US 505 (b) (2) regulatory filing process. "It will not be an NCE [new chemical entity] kind of a development, but be more like a super-generic," he said in the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Dr-Reddys-CEO-on-the-windshield-and-rear-view-mirror-350202%5d" target="_new">interview</a>. </p>
