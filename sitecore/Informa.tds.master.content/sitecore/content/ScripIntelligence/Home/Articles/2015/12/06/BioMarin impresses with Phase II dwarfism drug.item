<p>BioMarin Pharmaceuticals has raised expectations for its dwarfism product BMN-111 (vosoritide) on the back of strong Phase II data.</p><p>In the study in 26 children, BMN-111 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and efficacy at the 15&micro;g/kg daily dose. The 10 children in Cohort 3 treated with 15 &micro;g/kg/day had a mean increase of 50% (p=0.01) in their annualized growth velocity compared to their annualized prior six month natural history baseline growth velocity. </p><p>Jefferies analyst Dr Eun K Yang raised his 'probability for success' (or likelihood of regulatory approval) rating for BMN-111, to 80%, versus 50% prior, on the back on new Phase II proof-of-concept data. The analyst also said BMN-111, which is being developed for the treatment of achondroplasia (a common cause of dwarfism), warrants advancement into Phase III pivotal testing. </p><p>Analysts at Leerink added that the p value of 0.01 was "impressive due to a small cohort size of n=10 in our view."</p><p>Changes from baseline in proportionality as measured by upper to lower body ratio were not observed. However, BioMarin said clinical data were still being collected and collated for analysis and it is keen on studying BMN-111's resolution on clinical manifestations of achondroplasia. </p><p>No serious adverse events were observed for the duration of the study, BioMarin said. The majority of AEs reported were mild (Grade 1) and included injection site reactions, headache, hypotension, back pain and cough. The California firm also highlighted that blood pressure and heart rate were monitored frequently and during every site visit. Symptomatic hypotension was not documented in the study. This had been an issue in an early Phase I study. </p><p>Full data from the Phase II trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. </p><p>BioMarin now plans to meet regulators in the "next few months" to discuss a development path for the drug &ndash; which the company will be hoping to pursue at a higher 30&micro;g dose should its ancillary study yield positive results. The company indicated that a one-year, Phase III trial of 50-100 patients would not be unreasonable based on its experience in Phase II. </p><p>Biomarin also plans to run a future trial in younger (aged 0-5 years) patients with achondroplasia. </p><h2>trial results</h2><p>Patients in Cohort 3 received the highest dose of BMN-111 at 15&micro;g; these patients saw the highest percent increase in growth velocity post-treatment of 6.1cm (50%; mean) per year. Patients receiving the 7.5 &micro;g dose experienced a growth velocity increase of 4.2cm (45%), but patients receiving the lowest dose of 2.5&micro;g saw a decrease from 3.8cm at baseline to 3.4cm per year, post-treatment. </p><p>Surprisingly, change in growth velocity was consistent among age groups, which Dr Yang noted was "somewhat different from our recent expert discussion suggesting the younger, the better outcome."</p><p>Achondroplasia is characterized by failure of normal conversion of cartilage into bone, which results in disproportionate short stature. Currently there is no FDA-approved treatment for the condition. </p><p>BMN-111 is a stabilized analog of C-type natriuretic peptide. It binds to the natriuretic peptide receptor B, which initiates intracellular signals that ultimately inhibit the overactive fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) pathway. Achondroplasia is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in FGFR3.</p><p>According to <i>World FactBook</i>, the worldwide incidence rate of achondroplasia is about one in 25,000 live births &ndash; which BioMarin says translates into about 96,000 potential patients. The initial opportunity is about 25% of the incidence number because BMN-111 is being tested in children whose growth plates are still "open", typically those under 18 years of age.</p>
