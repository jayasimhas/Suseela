<p><p>With the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting scheduled for the end of May in Chicago, the release of the ASCO abstracts is sort of like Christmas for the oncology community. Investors and clinicians likely spent the evening of 13 May pouring over the newly released data. If that's not your idea of a good time, here are a few of the highlights:</p><p><b>ELOQUENT-2</b></p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie's breakthrough designated therapy elotuzumab is currently being tested in the Phase III ELOQUENT-2 study with Celgene's Revlimid and the corticosteroid dexamethasone in 646 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Patients were given either all three drugs or just the Revlimid/dex combo. According to the abstract released 13 May, elotuzumab showed a progression free survival (PFS) of 4.5 months over Revlimid/dex alone (19.4 months vs 14.9 months)and had an overall response rate (ORR) of 79% vs 66% (p=0.0002). There weren't any added toxicities that should scare investors. </p><p>BioMedTracker analysts referred to the top-line data as "somewhat modest" and "in-line" with other therapies in the space. Yet, the analysts note that the PFS benefit of elotuzumab is slightly lower than Amgen's Kyprolis (carfilzomib), which had a PFS of 8.7 months in a similarly designed trial. </p><p>Investors should keep an eye out for further results from this study &ndash; particularly overall survival (OS). It will also be important to watch for data from the other Phase II trial elotuzumab, ELOQUENT-1, which is studying the drug in front-line treatment. </p><p><b>KEYNOTE-021</b></p><p>All eyes are on Merck & Co's programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) &ndash; particularly in lung cancer, where the drug has the best chance of helping the largest patient population. The big pharma is presenting data from more than 10 different types of cancer. </p><p>In abstract 8011, the company details the Phase I study of Keytruda in combination with BMS' Yervoy (ipilimumab) as a second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer, a trial dubbed KEYNOTE-021. </p><p>The trial is still ongoing and only includes 17 patients &ndash; with those patients divided amongst different dosages of the two-drug combo &ndash; but showed that the drug had no dose-limiting toxicities as of December. The company added a lower dose of the combo once the design of a competing trial by BMS for its PD-1 inhibitor was revealed. At a six week analysis, one patient in the study achieved a complete response, while five achieved partial responses, and all patients achieved disease control. </p><p>"Preliminary data from KEYNOTE-021 cohort D demonstrate an acceptable toxicity profile and robust antitumor activity for pembro + IPI in pts with recurrent NSCLC. The use of lower pembro and IPI doses did not appear to negatively impact efficacy," concluded the abstract. </p><p>Merck investors will keep a close eye on this trial and expect a positive reaction from BMS investors since the company is testing Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination with Yervoy in the first-line setting. </p><p><b>ExteNET</b></p><p>Puma Biotechnology is not making a great case for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor neratinib &ndash; it's only product. The company will be presenting data from the primary analysis at two years of a Phase III study of the drug in patients with HER-2+ early breast cancer after adjuvant chemotherapy and Herceptin (trastuzumab). </p><p>The drug provided improvements in invasive disease-free survival, particularly in certain sub-populations. Yet, BioMedTracker analysts were not enthused with the results. "Although ExteNET shows that neratinib provides a statistical improvement in IDFS, this difference may or may not be clinically meaningful in an overall risk-benefit analysis," said the analyst. "The sponsor could potentially seek approval in the narrower HR+/HER2+ population if the FDA is uncertain about risk-benefit for the overall HER2+ population."</p><p>The drug already failed in a Phase II trial of neratinib in combination with paclitaxel in first-line, metastatic breast cancer and analysts believe its likelihood of approval is only 36%. </p><p><b>ENDEAVOR</b></p><p>Amgen's Kyprolis continues to pick up steam since its approval in 2012, and data to be presented at this year's ASCO meeting could help the drug overtake other frequently used therapies. </p><p>Results from the Phase III ENDEAVOR study showed that Kyprolis nearly doubled the PFS benefit over Takeda's Velcade (bortezomib) &ndash; 18.7 months vs 9.4 months, respectively, in patients with multiple myeloma. Both drugs were paired with dexamethasone. </p><p>Kyprolis showed an ORR of 76.9% compared with 62.6% with Velcade. </p><p>BioMedTracker analysts believe that Kyprolis can eventually overtake Velcade. A supplemental NDA for the drug in the second-line setting is currently pending at the FDA with the expectation that it will be approved on 26 July after the agency granted the application priority review. </p><p>The new indication is a major bump for the drug, which will be used in an expanded patient population that will likely use the therapy for a longer period of time. The drug only had sales of $97m in the US during the first quarter of 2015. </p><p><p><p>
