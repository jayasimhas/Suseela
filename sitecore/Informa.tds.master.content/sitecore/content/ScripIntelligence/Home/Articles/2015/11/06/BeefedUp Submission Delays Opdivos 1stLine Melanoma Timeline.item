<p>The FDA said it needed more time to review Bristol-Myers Squibb's supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its programmed death-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) as a first-line monotherapy for advanced melanoma after the company decided to beef up its submission with additional data.</p><p>BMS said it had the "opportunity to submit" the added information, so it took it, although that decision has pushed the FDA's verdict on the sBLA to Nov. 27 because the agency considered the submission a "major amendment" to the application.</p><p>BMS spokeswoman Carrie Fernandez told <i>Scrip</i> the company provided the FDA the additional data from the Opdivo clinical program "to ensure the broadest dataset, irrespective of BRAF status, was available for review."</p><p>Opdivo already is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">approved</a> to treat patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following use of the company's Yervoy (ipilimumab) and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. That win, which came three months early, was gained under the FDA's accelerated approval program.</p><p>The drug also won a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">faster-than-expected</a> approval in March to treat patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy &ndash; a decision that was not expected until June 22. </p><p>Given the FDA's willingness to get Opdivo quickly to the market in the earlier indications, the agency could possibly not use all of the time it has added to the sBLA's review.</p><p>The Opdivo sBLA, which was granted a priority review on April 29, is based on data from BMS' Phase III CheckMate -066 trial, which evaluated the drug in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients with BRAF wild-type advanced melanoma, versus dacarbazine chemotherapy. </p><p>BMS' Fernandez emphasized the delay for the sBLA for Opdivo in the first-line monotherapy indication would not affect the company's supplemental submission to market the drug plus Yervoy as a therapy for patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma, which also gained a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-combo-gains-priority-review-358701" target="_new">priority review</a>. </p><p>BMS said it anticipates the FDA making a decision on that sBLA by Sept. 30.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
