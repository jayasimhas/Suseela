<p>Eisai has managed to ensure patients in England get access to its end-of-life breast cancer drug Halaven (eribulin), but at a big cost to the company that will have a "direct impact on its activity in the UK". The firm also complained it had been hit with a "double whammy" from the Cancer Drugs Fund after it said it wouldn't be assessing Lenvima (lenvatinib) for thyroid cancer.</p><p>Nick Burgin, president of Eisai's global value & access unit, declined to give further detail on the agreement it had to make with NHS England to ensure patients accessed Halaven after it was delisted from the Cancer Drugs Fun, but commented that all the risk lay with the company and that it was "hugely damaging for the company". It is likely that the agreement affects the price that Eisai can charge, which could have ramifications in other markets thanks to reference pricing.</p><p>Eisai slammed the deal, calling it "short-sighted, simplistic and short-termed". The company has said that the agreement would impact what it does in the UK. Mr Burgin pointed to a recent &pound;15mn investment in its manufacturing facilities in Hatfield. "We feel this is all one way. On one hand the government is saying that it wants to improve the commercial environment for companies to invest, and on the other hand we are treated in this way," he said.</p><p>Eisai has trodden a rocky path to secure market access for Halaven. It was rejected by NICE for routine funding on the NHS, but then was funded through the Cancer Drugs Fund. This fund was created to finance promising new oncology products rejected by NICE, and was supposed to be a stop-gap measure until value-based pricing overhauled the system in 2014. This never happened and the fund kept on increasing. To cut back on spending the fund introduced a controversial new cost-benefit assessment and in January threatened to delist 12 drugs, including Halaven, from March.</p><p>Eisai <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Eisai-wins-Halaven-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-appeal-and-exposes-systems-flaws-357277" target="_new">appealed and won</a>, but the fund still refused to re-list the drug after the company resubmitted to the fund. However, recent changes to the system then meant that a drug could remain on the list if it can provide new commercially confidential arrangements for the Cancer Drugs Fund and if it re-submits to NICE. The funding is secured for 18 months, or until NICE makes its final decision. Meanwhile, Mr Burgin is confident about another NICE appraisal. He said the company had planned to resubmit to NICE anyway as it had more mature data to put forward.</p><p>Mr Burgin was also concerned that the fund has said it would not be assessing any new drugs for the foreseeable future, including Lenvima, for progressive, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated (papillary, follicular, HÃ¼rthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, whose disease has progressed despite receiving radioactive iodine. It is unclear at this stage what will happen to Lenvima and whether it will be assessed by NICE as the drug is for a very rare condition.</p><p>Nevertheless, NHS England has announced provisional plans for shaking up access to cancer drugs. These would involve conditional NICE assessments and a new "managed access fund" that would replace the Cancer Drugs Fund.</p><p><p>
