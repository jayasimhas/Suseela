<p>Three months after publishing its draft guideline on biosimilars, China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has just released the final official version, although it is still described as a pilot scheme. The new guideline may look similar to the draft on the surface, but a closer comparison reveals many differences.</p><p>The draft, released in November for public consultation (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/China-drafts-first-biosimilar-guideline-354871" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 November 2014</a>), was regarded as broadly similar to guidelines published by the EU, the US the World Health Organization. </p><p>But while the draft stated that biosimilars must have the same amino acid sequence as their reference product, the new official version states that "in principle" the sequence should be the same. </p><p>Furthermore, reference products were defined in the draft version as original branded biologics registered with the CFDA, while in the official guideline they are referred to only as "approved products, in general branded biologics."</p><p>Also, reference products used for biosimilar comparative tests should have the same batch number &ndash; as was required in the draft &ndash; but the official version more broadly limits comparative tests to "clinical comparative tests", with reference products to be from "the same origin".</p><h2>stricter evaluation?</h2><p>While all this sounds more generous than the draft guideline, the details relating to biosimilarity evaluation in the final version are actually stricter. The official guideline makes it clear that if comparative pharmacology tests show differences between a reference product and a biosimilar candidate that could affect quality, and this is also proved by non-clinical comparative tests, the candidate should not be categorized as a biosimilar for the purposes of further development. By contrast, the draft allowed clinical comparative tests to be carried out even if differences were identified. </p><p>"We definitely think it is good for China to have a guideline for the biosimilar sector. It is important to make quality biologics with affordable prices for Chinese patients," Davy Chen, president of Sino-EU Chemical Manufacturers Association Biomedical Committee (SEBMC), told <i>Scrip Intelligence</i>. Founded in Hong Kong, SEBMC's members are mostly multinational pharma companies and big Chinese firms such as Fosun, as well as academic research institutes including the Shanghai Cancer Institute.</p><p>However, Dr Chen said the apparently more generous standards in the final guideline could mean a lower threshold to provide relatively easy access to what may become a highly lucrative sector.</p><p>For aspiring participants, though, manufacturing technology and costs are seen as the main barriers to entry into the biosimilars sector globally. Shanghai-based Fosun, for example, established a subsidiary, Shanghai Henlius Biotech, in 2009 to take care of its biosimilar business. Its biosimilar version of Roche's Rituxan (rituximab) is currently in Phase I studies to treat B-cell lymphoma.</p><p>"Biologics, no matter if they are innovative products or biosimilars, are highly demanding regarding manufacturing processes. I believe only a few large Chinese companies are competent enough to step into the sector," said Dr Chen. </p><h2>improvements</h2><p>Because the new Chinese guideline is only considered a pilot, Dr Chen said he believes that it will be improved in the future as China's biosimilar sector continues to grow. It includes one possible practical improvement already. While previously companies filing an IND for biosimilars in China had to go through the same procedures as for innovative conventional drugs, they may now follow the pathway for therapeutic biologic products, according to the official guideline. </p><p>At the current stage it is not clear if this move could save biosimilar manufacturers any time in obtaining approvals, but at least the route is more clearly defined.</p><p><i>This article will also be appearing in Scrip's sister publication, </i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a><i>.</i> (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news</a>)</p>
