<p>Scientists exploring the new "frontier" of the brain &ndash; much of which is unchartered territory &ndash; will have millions of dollars in unrestricted funds to support their expeditions, thanks to the philanthropic scientific organization the Kavli Foundation.</p><p>"We have placed no constraints on what the scientists and the universities choose to do to advance science as they see best," said Robert Conn, Kavli's president and CEO. "That is the most precious money any scientist can have, and they will all tell you so."</p><p>In more than doubling a $40m commitment it made to the White House two years ago, Kavli has put forward $100m to support research intended to advance President Barack Obama's Brain Research through Advancing Innovation Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, a collaborative project between the U.S. government and the private and academic sectors, which is aimed at finding new ways to treat, cure and prevent neurological diseases and disorders, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy.</p><p>The Kavli funds will provide "seed money" to academic researchers at three universities &ndash; Johns Hopkins University, the Rockefeller University and the University of California, San Francisco, which each will receive a $20m endowment plus some start-up dollars &ndash; so they can "go after the biggest, brightest ideas," Conn told reporters during an Oct. 1 Capitol Hill press conference.</p><p>The remaining funds from the $100m will be used to increase the investment at Kavli's other existing neuroscience institutes, he said.</p><p>"This is the research that will help provide the essential knowledge to find the cures, discover preventive strategies and find new ways to deal with the often tragic results of brain trauma," Conn said. "The support is going to enable many of the best scientists in the field to drive that engine of discovery."</p><p>Being a scientist himself, Conn said he knew "what this kind of resource can do."</p><p>He insisted the responsibility of the BRAIN Initiative can't be left to government alone.</p><p>"We all benefit from the fruits of basic science, and that has an obvious implication: all of us have to contribute," Conn said.</p><p>At the Oct. 1 press conference, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) also revealed it had awarded a second round of grants totaling $38m for 67 new projects involving 131 investigators at 125 institutions under Obama's BRAIN Initiative. </p><p>Thomas Insel, director of the NIH's National Institute of Mental Health &ndash; who announced last month he planned to leave his post on Nov. 1 to lead Google Life Sciences' new effort focused on mental health &ndash; noted the new funds brings the agency's total investment in the BRAIN Initiative this year to $85m. </p><p>Last year, the NIH <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">awarded $46m in grants</a> to fund 58 projects under the initiative, which the president <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">launched in April 2013</a>.</p><p>Insel pointed out that the awardees are "not to the usual suspects" &ndash; meaning the teams are not made up of only neuroscientists, but also include engineers, physicists and scientists working in nanotechnology and information and computer sciences and genomics.</p><p>Building teams from different disciplines, Insel said, helps change each of those fields by pushing the players into adopting new technologies they otherwise might not have pursued.</p><p>But he said the BRAIN Initiative is going to need far more than $85m each year to accomplish the ambitious <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">blueprint</a> developed by an outside team of advisers.</p><p>Indeed, the NIH's advisers last year determined the agency would need $400m to $500m per year over the next decade, or about $4.5bn.</p><p>Cornelia Bargmann, a neuroscience professor at Rockefeller University in New York, who led the advisory working group, told reporters last year that amount is essentially equivalent to each American paying for a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brains-secrets-unlocked-for-price-of-a-6-pack-352183" target="_new">six-pack of beer</a>.</p><p>"This is not a cost. It's an investment against future costs," Insel said during the Oct. 1 press conference. </p><p>Given the overall costs of brain diseases like Alzheimer's &ndash; which is expected to soar to more than $1tn by 2050 &ndash; Insel insisted "there is no better investment right now than science."</p><p>Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, noted that if Congress passes the fiscal year 2016 budget, which so far it's not been able to do &ndash; barely averting a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-NIH-Saved-From-Shutdown---For-Now-360761" target="_new">shutdown of the government</a> on Oct. 1 &ndash; the NIH could receive $106m for the BRAIN Initiative to support other projects over the next year.</p><p>After the chaos on Capitol Hill over the past few weeks as a result of some Republicans' efforts to hold the budget hostage to an ideological fight involving the reproductive and family planning services organization Planned Parenthood &ndash; which ended in a compromise for a two-month funding bill &ndash; Mikulski joked that the greatest benefactors of the brain research could be members of Congress, who she said "kind of needs it."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
