<p><p>While positive trial results are never a bad thing, they can be overblown &ndash; a surefire way to upset your investors. Anavex did just that this weekend when the biotech overhyped some positive results from a small mid-stage study. </p><p>The biotech announced data from a Phase IIa study of ANAVEX 2-73 at the Clinical Trials in Alzheimer's Disease 2015 conference in Barcelona, Spain. The drug, which targets the sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, is meant to prevent or reduce the number of misfolding proteins like beta-amyloid and tau &ndash; both suspected to be involved in causing Alzheimer's Disease. </p><p>So far, the 2-73 has shown in preclinical and early-stage studies that is has potential to help slow down symptoms of cognitive decline. The Phase IIa study wasn't any different &ndash; it showed that 2-73 had statically significant improvement in cognitive decline, according to a number of different regularly used AD measurements. </p><p>"While it is of prime importance to have confirmed that both the primary and secondary endpoints of the trial have been met, it is extremely encouraging to see the emergence of such strong cognitive signals after only 5 weeks of treatment. Such an outcome in a trial such as this is unprecedented in my experience, and the current results suggest that ANAVEX 2-73 could potentially make a significant difference in patients&rsquo; lives," said Stephen Macfarlane, Director of Aged Psychiatry at Alfred Health, who conducted the study.</p><p>Anavex shares, which only debuted on the NASDAQ in the last two weeks, are down 22%, or $1.90, to trade near $6 apiece in midday trading on Nov. 9.</p><p>So why is the stock down? How could investors possibly be upset about these positive results?</p><p>Here's the rub: Alzheimer's drug development is notoriously tricky and has left a slew of late-stage flops in its wake in recent years. Virtually all of the drugs that failed showed plenty of promise in preclinical and early-stage studies, many even having strong positive results in mid-stage tests, only to show no treatment effect at all once tested in large, placebo-controlled trials. </p><p>Anavex might be putting the cart before the horse in this case. The results they announced this week for 2-73 were from studies that only included 32 patients &ndash; a particularly small number for any clinical trial, but especially one in AD, which usually has trials that include hundreds or thousands of patients. </p><p>Beyond that, results were announced from two time periods &ndash; after five weeks and after 12 weeks. While the extension phase of the study is still ongoing and is meant to conclude at week 52, it's not typical to see clear results after just a month, or even three months. Symptoms of cognitive decline usually take a longer period of time to show themselves. </p><p>The other problem with the study &ndash; there was no control group. None of the patients were taking a placebo or even on a comparator drug. All of the patients in the study were given the test drug and told it would make them feel better, which could be why it did. </p><p>While the results of the Phase IIa study certainly weren't negative, the positive results don't mean very much. The small number of patients, the lack of comparator and the short time period lend the study little credibility and offers no chance of derisking the drug. At this point, ANAVEX 2-73 is just as likely to succeed as it is to fail. </p><p><p><p>
