<p>With Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) CEO John Castellani soon departing, bets in Washington are being placed on medical device lobbyist Stephen J. Ubl to take the drug group's helm in the next few months.</p><p>Ubl has been the president and CEO of AdvaMed &ndash; the world's largest medical device organization &ndash; for a decade, spending seven years before that in other top jobs at the organization.</p><p>He also previously worked at the Federation of American Hospitals and was a special assistant for a time for Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA).</p><p>Castellani, who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Castellani-to-depart-PhRMA-group-elects-Mercks-Frazier-chairman-357923" target="_new">revealed in April</a> he planned to depart by the end of the year, came to PhRMA in September 2010 &ndash; replacing Billy Tauzin, a former member of Congress from Louisiana, who was CEO for more than five years and led the group in sealing the deal with the White House and the Democrats to limit the costs of drugs under Medicare Part D as part of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Castellani was just one of the major lobbying group chiefs this year disclosing plans to leave the top job, with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Generic-drugs-top-lobbyist-to-depart-by-fall-356290" target="_new">Ralph Neas</a> exiting the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, which stole away <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Generics-group-steals-one-of-PhRMAs-guys-359596" target="_new">Chester Davis</a> from PhRMA to take his place, and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Insurance-lobby-chief-Ignagni-to-depart-358552" target="_new">Karen Ignagni</a> departing the America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which convinced former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Former-CMS-chief-to-lead-insurance-lobby-group-359478" target="_new">Marilyn Tavenner</a> to take the post &ndash; essentially a Washington lobbyist game of musical chairs.</p><p>If Ubl does indeed replace Castellani, he would be stepping into the job at the height of criticism over some manufactures charging high drug prices &ndash; a controversy that has pitted PhRMA against AHIP and other payer groups and some patient groups.</p><p>The debate hit a boiling point this week when patient advocates and presidential candidates went after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">Turing Pharmaceuticals</a> for increasing the price by more than 5,000% of Daraprim (pyrimethamine), an old drug it bought last month from Impax Laboratories.</p><p>Former Secretary of State <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">Hillary Clinton</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> (I-VT) both have laid out plans &ndash; albeit similar &ndash; to rein in drug costs, with Turing, whose membership at the Biotechnology Industry Organization was reportedly revoked this week, giving the politicians the perfect opening to make their cases.</p><p>PhRMA's most recent move to back up its arguments against attempts to control drug pricing was to partially pay for a survey of American voters by Morning Consult &ndash; with the group reporting on Sept. 23 that 51% of respondents opposed the federal government setting prices.</p><p>PhRMA said 61% of the respondents to the poll said patients access to medicines would be limited if the government set prescription drug prices, while 65% said fewer new therapies would be developed under such a scenario.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
