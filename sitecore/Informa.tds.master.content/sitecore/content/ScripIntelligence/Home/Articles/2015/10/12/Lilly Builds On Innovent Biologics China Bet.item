<p>Eli Lilly and Company has expanded its cancer drug collaboration with Chinese biotech Innovent Biologics Inc with plans to develop and market up to three anti-PD-1 based bi-specific antibodies over the next decade, both inside China's expanding healthcare market and abroad.</p><p>The development and commercialization deal was announced Oct. 11, under which Innovent could reap extra payments of up to $1bn if the planned immuno-oncology products attain certain development, regulatory and sales targets. It builds on the duo's initial oncology alliance, launched in March and under which Lilly agreed to pay the Chinese biotech $56m up front and $400m in milestone payments, as well as sales royalties. Under that March arrangement Innovent will contribute two compounds, the first being a Phase I-ready antibody targeting the CD20 protein for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. It will also contribute a preclinical immuno-oncology asset that Innovent will develop in China and Lilly will be responsible for in the rest of the world. </p><p>Their expanded collaboration will see Lilly create three preclinical anti-PD-1 based bispecific antibodies based on an antibody sequence from Innovent. The US company will develop, manufacture and commercialize the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies outside the Chinese market while Innovent would have them inside China, where cancer rates are escalating rapidly, posing a major health problem.</p><p>"We are pleased to be expanding our collaboration with Innovent to further the development of potential therapies for those fighting cancer in China and around the world," said Greg Plowman, vice president of oncology research at Lilly, in a statement.</p><p>Innovent's CEO and co-founder Michael Yu added: "We are honored that Lilly is so quickly expanding our relationship and that Lilly is trusting Innovent to develop and manufacture their newly created bispecific antibodies for China. We are excited to be at the forefront of immuno-oncology drug development and to benefit from Lilly's deep experience in bispecific antibodies."</p><p>Lilly has supported Innovent before &ndash; the company's regional venture investment arm, Lilly Asia Ventures, contributed to multiple rounds of financing for the Chinese biotech and helped fund Innovent's founding in 2001. In January this year, Innovent closed a record-breaking $100m private-financing led by new investors Legend Capital, Singapore's government-owned investment fund Temasek, and two other undisclosed investors, as well as existing investors Lilly Asia Ventures, Fidelity Biosciences, Fidelity Growth Partners Asia and Frontline Bioventures.</p><p>The proceeds from the January financing round are mainly for funding Innovent's pipeline, consisting of 10 antibody products including novel biologics and biosimilars of some global bestselling therapies, and the company's general operations, said Innovent. Its pipeline includes IBI301, a biosimilar version of Roche's Rituxan/Mabthera (rituximab) for cancer and autoimmune disorders that is in Phase I study in China, and IBI303, a biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (infliximab) that is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. Another lead compound IBI302 is a novel biologic for oncology indications.</p><p>Mabthera is the best-selling antibody drug in China with sales reaching roughly CNY1.4bn ($226m) a year, accounting for nearly half of the total monoclonal antibody market in China, according to Innovent.</p><p>
