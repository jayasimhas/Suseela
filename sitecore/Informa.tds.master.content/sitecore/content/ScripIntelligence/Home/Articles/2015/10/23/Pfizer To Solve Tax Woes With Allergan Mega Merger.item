<p> Pfizer Inc. has approached Allergan PLC about a possible merger, the latter has confirmed. Such a deal could help Pfizer slash its tax bill and oust J&amp;J as the world's biggest healthcare company. </p><p> The two firms are in in &quot;preliminary friendly discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction&quot;, said Allergan, which added that there was no certainty that discussions would lead anywhere. </p><p> There are no details of what might take shape, but analysts seem confident that a deal will happen. Ian Read, Pfizer's CEO, has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizer-Still-Looking-To-Buy-A-Tax-Advantage---And-Before-Congress-Flips-361263" target="_new">already commented that the firm was weighing what options for tax inversion an M&amp;A might bring</a>. Indeed, this was part of the motive behind its failed bid to buy AstraZeneca back in 2014. As Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Ali Al-Bazergan, points out, a Pfizer-Allergan merger would allow Pfizer to boost its competitiveness by slashing its tax rate as it could redomicile in Ireland, where Allergan is registered and where corporation tax is much lower. </p><p> Aside from that there are also distinct overlaps with Allergan's North American branded portfolio, especially in CNS and cardiovascular disease, which would accelerate growth and drive operating synergies across sales infrastructures. &quot;Pfizer would support its sales trajectory by welcoming momentum from new launches and a robust growth portfolio including Botox and Restasis,&quot; he said. Pfizer's reported revenues fell 2% over the prior-year quarter to $12.09bn, but increased 6% operationally. </p><p> Other potential acquisition targets have included Shire, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline but Allergan makes the most sense, says Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst. The transaction would be low risk as Allergan is a &quot;mostly&quot; US company operating largely in the primary care market, which Pfizer understands well. In addition, the two firms are geographically close and the post-merger integration would likely prove easier than a transatlantic deal, he said. He also thinks that Allergan's management, led by CEO Brent Saunders, would not pose any great obstacle to a transaction. </p><p> There has been some speculation as to whether any deal between Pfizer and Allergan would affect the latter's sell off of its generic business to Teva, but Allergan says it &quot;remains strongly committed to complete the proposed divestment of its global generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and expects the generics divestiture transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016.&quot; This would be good news for Pfizer, which would be &quot;better off with the money&quot; rather than being saddled with a business that does not fit and a legal wrangle to break the deal, said Anderson. </p><p> Allergan has a market value of around $113bn, while Pfizer is worth $219bn, so together their value would total around $330bn, which would outstrip that of J&amp;J ($278bn), currently the world's biggest healthcare company. Analysts put the split in equity between Pfizer and Allergan at around 60/40% given that Pfizer's market capitalization is currently 65% of the two firms' market cap. </p><p> However, amid furore in the US over drug pricing, any deal aimed at tax inversion could prompt backlash, warns Anderson. &quot;What the US Treasury may do could also cause some consternation among investors. When the Treasury issued its proposed changes in September 2014, setting stricter criteria for inversion, it threatened that there could be additional measures in the future. Will it come back with more, or was this bluster?&quot; </p><p> Indeed, Credit Suisse analysts believe that it could actually be Allergan which buys out Pfizer to avoid the problems of completing a &quot;high-profile inversion&quot;. </p><p> Shares in Allergan were up by 8% shortly after it confirmed talks. </p>
