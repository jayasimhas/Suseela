<p>Sanofi and Google's unnamed life science company entered into a partnership to help diabetes patients and their doctors monitor their disease and remain compliant with dosing schedules for glucose-lowering medications via technology that has yet to be defined, but will amount to more than yet another easily ignored smartphone application.</p><p>Pascale Witz, the executive vice president who will lead Sanofi's Global Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease business unit, said the company has been working on various opportunities for integrated care in diabetes for a few years. Its partnership with Google will help Sanofi translate some of the company's ideas into practical technology and the partners could make devices already under development at Google's life science hub useful for diabetes patients.</p><p>Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt recently revealed his plan to divide the company's businesses into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brandicourt-reorganizes-Sanofi-359442" target="_new">five separate business units</a> under a structure that will be implemented in early 2016. </p><p>Witz was selected to oversee the diabetes and cardiovascular disease unit, which will be home to Sanofi's biggest source of pharmaceutical revenue. The company reported more than $3.8n in pharma product revenue from diabetes therapies for the first half of 2015, which was 3.5% lower than diabetes sales during the same period in 2014. Biosimilar competition for Sanofi's top product Lantus (insulin glargine) contributed to a 5.4% drop in Lantus sales to $3.3bn in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-to-face-further-biosimilar-Lantus-impact-in-second-half-359704" target="_new">first half of this year</a>.</p><p>On top of copycat competition for Lantus, Sanofi also faces restrictions on the use of another insulin product in the US as payers edit their formularies in favor of certain medicines. The pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-CVS-Formulary-Updates-Whos-In-Whos-Out-359772" target="_new">Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark recently excluded</a><i>Apidra</i> (insulin glulisine) from their formularies. Apidra sales increased 11.2% to $184m in the first half of 2015 before the PBMs unveiled their revised formularies.</p><p>Payers have been keeping close tabs on the cost and health care value associated with diabetes drugs for a while, because the list of approved therapies is long, brand name products are not cheap, and many of the millions of patients who take those medicines do not comply with treatment regimens.</p><p>"We know that a lot of money is invested in new and better medicines and if patients are not taking them, we consider this a waste," Witz said. "We know that better compliance will deliver better health outcomes and reduce complications downstream."</p><p><b>Diabetes Test Case</b></p><p>One of the first major efforts to evaluate the health care value of newer non-insulin diabetes medicines was Merck & Co.'s <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-and-Co-offers-greater-US-Januvia-discounts-tied-to-improved-health-140938" target="_new">2009 agreement with the private US payer</a> Cigna. Merck agreed to provide deeper discounts for <i>Januvia</i> (sitagliptin) and <i>Janumet</i> (sitagliptin plus metformin) if Cigna's diabetic customers used the payer's medication adherence program and reduced their glucose levels, regardless of which drugs the patients were taking. Merck received better placement on Cigna's formulary in exchange for agreeing to the outcomes-based discounts.</p><p>The companies reported since then that patients covered by Cigna health plans <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INTERVIEW-Cigna-VP-says-outcome-based-contracts-are-here-to-stay-341958" target="_new">lowered blood sugar levels</a> based on better compliance with diabetes drug dosing schedules.</p><p>Payers continue to look for ways to improve adherence to dosing regimens, which could reduce health care costs associated with not taking medicines as prescribed. They also want pharma companies to justify the price of their drugs <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Show-us-the-money-US-payers-demand-value-341997" target="_new">in terms of the value that new medicines provide</a> to the health care system by reducing the need for other treatments.</p><p><b>Sanofi's Focus On Value</b></p><p>Sanofi has focused on medication compliance and disease management in diabetes during the past few years, looking outside of its approved and investigational medicines for technology that could help patients, physicians and payers track the effects of diabetes drugs. </p><p>The company entered into an agreement with Medtronic in mid-2014 to<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-teams-up-with-Medtronic-in-diabetes-352362" target="_new"> develop drug-device combinations</a> that could improve medication compliance. The partners agreed to combine Sanofi's insulin products with Medtronic's insulin pumps and glucose-monitoring technology.</p><p>Google said in its own announcement of the partnership with Sanofi that its life science business unit &ndash; which will be spun out as an independent, yet-to-be-named company &ndash; has developed sensors and digital tools that could speed up the process of giving diabetes patients and their doctors real-time data about the impact of meals, exercise and medicines on glucose levels.</p><p>"If something exists and it can be a big contribution, we will use it, or we can develop something new if something is missing. The idea is not to reinvent the wheel if it's been invented already, but to leverage the wheel in the best way we can," Sanofi's Witz said.</p><p>Following the pharma company's investments in glucose monitoring, she said Sanofi felt that technology was advanced enough to provide more sophisticated diabetes management tools to patients and doctors &ndash; tools that go beyond a three-times-per-day finger prick or a smartphone app to measure glucose and analyze the data then inform diabetes treatment in real time.</p><p>"We felt that Google with their capabilities in miniaturization and analytics could bring a new pressure point into the solution we were trying to develop for the patient," Witz said. </p><p>She added later: "I personally very much believe in the convergence of different [technological] fields to leapfrog innovation."</p><p><p><p><p>
