<p>The FDA has been on this merry-go-round before: If Congress doesn't act by Oct. 1 to pass a fiscal year 2016 budget &ndash; or at least a short-term or long-term continuing resolution (CR) &ndash; the federal government will shut down, which means the agency would be forced to close its doors, potentially stalling new drug and biologic applications and putting off other work vital to the biopharmaceutical industry.</p><p>If there's a shutdown, the FDA may not accept any new drug or device applications during the period the agency is shuttered &ndash; however long it lasts &ndash; delaying manufacturers from moving their products to the U.S. market.</p><p>The FDA should be well-rehearsed in how to deal with a shutdown, given it just went through that process in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Research-blunted-economy-damaged-And-for-what-347447" target="_new">October 2013</a>, in which 6,620 of the agency's employees, or about 45% of its personnel, were told to stay home for 16 days.</p><p>One significant negative outcome at the FDA from that shutdown was a break-in of the data systems run by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), in which a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/HACKED-FDA-reveals-CBER-network-attacked-during-federal-shutdown-348030" target="_new">hacker gained access</a> to 14,000 accounts held by regulated companies.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Left-Companies-Trade-Secrets-Data-Open-To-Hackers-359817" target="_new">congressional investigation</a> of the hack-attack on the FDA found that a lack of security left drug makers' and other firms' trade secrets and other product information open to theft.</p><p>The cyber intruder that hacked into CBER's systems on Oct. 15, 2013 nabbed registered users' first and last names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, usernames and the encrypted "hashed" password for each account, the House Energy and Commerce Committee probe revealed.</p><p>During the 2013 shutdown, the FDA had limited its operations to emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property, criminal law enforcement work and activities funded by carryover user fee balances, including those under the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> and the <i>Generic Drug User Fee Amendments</i>.</p><p>Some drugs whose applications had been submitted during the FY 2013 fiscal year or earlier were approved, however, such as Pfizer Inc.'s hot flash and osteoporosis drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-PfizerLigand-hot-flash-osteoporosis-drug-Duavee-347038" target="_new">Duavee</a> (conjugated estrogens/bazedoxifene), Baxter Healthcare Corp.'s parenteral nutrition product <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Baxters-Clinolipid-wins-FDA-OK-addresses-drug-shortage-347065" target="_new">Clinolipid</a> (lipid injectable emulsion), Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals' pulmonary hypertension drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/APPROVED-Bayers-Adempas-gains-FDA-OK-in-PAHCTEPH-347116" target="_new">Adempas</a> (riociguat) and Antares Pharma Inc.'s injectable arthritis drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/APPROVED-Antares-seeks-niche-in-US-arthritis-market-with-Otrexup-347307" target="_new">Otrexup</a> (methotrexate). </p><p>And the FDA also held an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Panel-CVOT-needed-before-expanding-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-347419" target="_new">Oct. 16</a> Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting, where Amarin Pharma Inc.'s proposal to expand the indication for its fish oil pill Vascepa was rejected by the panel &ndash; and also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-expanded-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-358103" target="_new">later by the agency</a>.</p><p>But in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">Nov. 8, 2013 report</a>, the White House pointed out no new FY 2014 product applications were reviewed over the shutdown.</p><p>Industry insiders have yet to analyze the full impact to biopharmaceutical firms of the 2013 shutdown.</p><p>But one industry source insisted that "regardless of the fact that some FDA employees may be allowed to work during a shutdown, the entire infrastructure of an agency is negatively affected by a government shutdown."</p><p>"Meetings must be cancelled. Outside visitors may be prevented from accessing the agency, because the rules don't allow it and personnel are not in place to process visitors. Phones are not answered, personnel actions are halted, so individuals can't be interviewed, hired or on-boarded," the industry source told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"The work of FDA is critical to the safety and wellness of all Americans," a spokesperson from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America told <i>Scrip</i>, urging Congress to continue to work together in an effort to avoid a shutdown.</p><p>In its report, the White House said that 16-day government shutdown in October 2013 cost U.S. taxpayers $2bn in payroll expenses for furloughed salaried federal employees at the FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies, while more than 6.6 million days worth of combined productivity were lost.</p><p>Standard & Poor's estimated the 2013 shutdown <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Research-blunted-economy-damaged-And-for-what-347447" target="_new">wiped out $24bn</a> from the U.S. economy that year.</p><p>Of its 78,200 employees, the Department of Health and Human Services &ndash; the mothership for the FDA and the NIH &ndash; furloughed about 43,000 total in October 2013.</p><p>NIH Director Francis Collins <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/U.S.-Government-Shutdown-Threatens-Research-Patients-360630" target="_new">told reporters on Sept. 22</a> that during the 2013 shutdown, he had to send home 80% of his employees &ndash; or more than 15,700 workers &ndash; including scientists doing critical research at the agency's laboratories and clinicians and staff at the NIH Clinical Center, which had to turn away hundreds of patients, whose therapy had to be put on hold unless they were in a life-threatening situation.</p><p>Collins pleaded with lawmakers not to let that happen again.</p><p>The FDA and NIH have experienced shutdowns before &ndash; one that lasted even longer than in 2013.</p><p>Indeed, the federal government shut down for 21 days from Dec. 15, 1995 to Jan. 6, 1996.</p><p>That event was preceded by a five-day shutdown in November 1995, in which 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. </p><p>Evercore ISI political analyst Terry Haines doubted Republicans leaders would permit another government shutdown, despite the fact that several members of their party are dead set on using that threat as their weapon of choice to try to kill the reproductive and family planning services organization Planned Parenthood, which has been accused of trying to profit from making fetal tissue available for research &ndash; a charge the group has adamantly denied.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) have pledged not to shut down the government over any issue, "and will not," Haines said in a research note earlier this month.</p><p>And he noted that congressional Democrats also have a stake in focusing on economic growth issues during a time when President Barack Obama supports them and reelection looms. </p><p>Plus, Haines said, the Senate's likely next Democratic leader, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), "understands this well" &ndash; taking a lead role in the tax reform, repatriation and transportation spending battle and is working in a bipartisan fashion to help achieve it.</p><p>But Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), ranking member on the House Budget Committee, wasn't so sure the government would stay open past Oct. 1.</p><p>"I can't stand here right now and say with confidence that there won't be a government shutdown, despite all of our efforts to avoid a government shutdown," Van Hollen told reporters during the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/U.S.-Government-Shutdown-Threatens-Research-Patients-360630" target="_new">Sept. 22 press conference</a> on the NIH campus.</p><p>McConnell plans to hold a vote on Sept. 24 on a CR measure that would keep the government open until Dec. 11, but would defund Planned Parenthood.</p><p>If that move fails, he is expected to try again &ndash; only without the Planned Parenthood rider. But Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who is seeking to be the Republican presidential candidate and is leading the fight against Planned Parenthood, said he would try to derail that effort.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
