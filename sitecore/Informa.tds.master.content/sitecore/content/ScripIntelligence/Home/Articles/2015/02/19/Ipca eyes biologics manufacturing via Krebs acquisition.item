<p>Ipca Laboratories of India has made an open offer to acquire an additional 26% in the loss-making local firm Krebs Biochemicals and Industries &ndash; a deal which is expected to help the former scale up manufacturing capabilities in the biologics space.</p><p>The deal entails joint control of the management of the Hyderabad-based Krebs, details in the open offer statement said.</p><p>Interestingly, Ranbaxy Laboratories, currently in the process of being acquired by Sun Pharma, held 11.04% in Krebs as of December 2014, though this is expected to decline to around 8%, post the preferential offer.</p><h2>Biologics</h2><p>Sources in Ipca told <i>Scrip</i> that the acquisition was generally aimed at securing manufacturing capabilities in the biotech space, though Krebs' sites have been non-functional for some time now. </p><p>''We have our R&D for biotech products but no plants,'' the source indicated.</p><p>Ipca's own biotech department has been involved in developing ''cost effective'' processes for the manufacture of ''biologically and fermentation driven'' drugs and intermediates. It is also involved in development of recombinant DNA based proteins with an eye on the global biogenerics markets, details on the firm's website indicated.</p><p>Krebs has two manufacturing plants &ndash; one in Nellore and the other in Vizag &ndash; along the south east coast of India. Both units are equipped for chemical synthesis, fermentation and enzymatic technologies and the Nellore unit was some years ago approved by the US FDA. </p><p>Krebs' annual report for 2013-14 noted that the continuing closure of its plants on account of a lock out in one and lay-offs in the other had hurt its performance. The firm, which manufactured a clutch of products including simvastatin and lovastatin, said that it was undertaking financial restructuring to revive operations.</p><p>Some analysts, however, claimed that Ipca's plans perhaps aim to factor in both a mix of its long term aspirations in the biologics space and some potential for site transfers, given that its existing sites have been under FDA scrutiny. </p><p>''There is some strategic rationale and a near term need for the deal, but execution is the key,'' one analyst told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The FDA had earlier issued an import alert against Ipca's active pharmaceutical ingredients (APls) unit in Ratlam, while the agency has also raised GMP compliance concerns at the firm's Indore site in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ipca-slumps-after-US-import-alert-ripple-effect-fears-356336%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>Ipca expects to get Krebs' sites up and running at the earliest, probably the Vizag unit within a month or so, the source claimed, though details of products made at the site could not immediately be ascertained. </p><p>That Ipca has been keen for a play in biosimilars is clear. Last year Ipca formed a two-part alliance with the US firm Oncobiologics for the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilar monoclonal antibody products. </p><p>In the first phase, Ipca was to in-license and commercialize biosimilar products for India and associated markets, with the products being developed by Oncobiologics. The partners hoped to launch their first product in 2017. </p><p>Part two of the deal entailed Oncobiologics replicating its biologics R&D and manufacturing facility in India to create capability for Ipca for further biosimilar commercialization, though the partners had then referred to a manufacturing facility in Vadodara in western India. The R&D facility was to be operational in 2015 and the manufacturing by 2016. It is not immediately clear if the Krebs deal, in any way, buttresses these plans.</p><p>Oncobiologics, which has been known to be developing a clutch of biosimilars, including versions of Humira (adalimumab), Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Rituxan (rituximab) in addition to other novel biotherapeutics, last year attracted investments from Strides Arcolab of India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strides-invests-in-promising-Oncobiologics-352920%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 July 2014)</a>. </p><h2>Krebs offer details</h2><p>Ipca said that it was making an open offer to the public shareholders of Krebs to acquire up to 3,573,515 equity shares of INR10 each at INR54 ($0.86) per share, payable in cash. The offer represents 26% of the fully diluted equity and voting share capital of Krebs, post a preferential allotment and conversion of warrants issued on preferential basis of the target firm.</p><p>The offer, if fully accepted, would entail an investment of about INR192.9m by Ipca. The offer is expected to open in April.</p><p>Ipca previously held 1,800,000 equity shares in Krebs &ndash; acquired through an off-market deal with some of the founders of Krebs. On 13 February this year Ipca announced plans to subscribe to 2,300,000 equity shares of Krebs on a preferential allotment basis at INR54 per share, taking its aggregate holding in Krebs to 29.83% of the fully diluted equity voting share capital of the target firm.</p><p>
