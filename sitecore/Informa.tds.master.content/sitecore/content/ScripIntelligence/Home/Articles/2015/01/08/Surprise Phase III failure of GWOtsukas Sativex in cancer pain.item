<p>GW Pharmaceuticals is reeling on news that its cannabinoid-derived product Sativex has failed the first of three Phase III trials in the treatment of cancer pain. Sativex is licensed to Otsuka in the US where cancer pain is the lead indication. Data from the three trials were to form the basis of the first NDA filing for Sativex in the US.</p><p>The product is already approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis in 27 countries outside the US. A request for Special Protocol Assessment has been submitted to the FDA for a proposed single Phase II study in the MS indication. </p><p>Sativex previously completed a Phase IIb dose-ranging study and Phase IIa study which both demonstrated significant improvements versus placebo using the same primary measure as in the Phase III trial, GW's CEO Justin Gover said in a conference call. "So obviously this has come as a complete surprise." GW and Otsuka would now conduct a "deep dive" of the data to try and understand what went wrong.</p><p>The primary efficacy measure of the study was a patient assessment of pain using a 0-to-10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Improvement was also analyzed using a cumulative proportion of responders analysis (CPRA), which analyses the full range of responses achieved across the entire patient population within a trial. These analyses did not show a significant difference between Sativex and placebo. The secondary endpoints followed the pattern of the primary endpoint.</p><p>In this study, the US was the largest single recruiting country. Although not statistically significant, the efficacy data from US sites showed more positive trends than those in non-US sites. "This is consistent with data from the Phase IIb trial," noted Mr Gover, and said this would be one of the aspects being investigated.</p><p>Two further Phase III trials are ongoing. The next to report, with data due in the second quarter, was designed in the same manner as the first trial. The third, from which data are expected by year-end, has an "enriched" trial design. "Responders were identified before enrollment," explained Mr Gover. Positive data from two of three trials will be enough to persuade the FDA about its effectiveness, said Mr Gover. "If the remaining two trials are successful, we will still be able to file Sativex as planned in the US."</p><p><b>NICE setback</b></p><p>Sativex suffered another setback recently when NICE, the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales, released new guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of MS patients, in which it rejected Sativex and Biogen Idec's Fampyra. Bayer, a licensee of Sativex, urged UK prescribers to ignore the guidelines and continue to prescribe Sativex (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Bayer-urges-rebellion-against-NICE-no-for-Sativex-354382" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 9 October 2014</a>).</p><p><b>epilepsy program</b></p><p>GW attempted to soften the blow to its investors by issuing separate news that its epilepsy treatment Epidiolex (pure cannabidiol), for the treatment of severe, drug-resistant childhood epilepsy, would complete its pivotal Phase III program by the end of 2015.</p><p>"In addition to the formal development programs already underway in both Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, data from the expanded access program continues to point to the potential for Epidiolex to treat additional forms of epilepsy and we expect to commence clinical development programs in further potential target indications during 2015," added Mr Gover.</p>
