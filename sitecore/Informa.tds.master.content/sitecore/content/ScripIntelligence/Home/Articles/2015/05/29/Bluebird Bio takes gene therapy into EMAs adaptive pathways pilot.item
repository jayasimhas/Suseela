<p>A total of 58 products have been submitted as potential candidates for the European Medicines Agency's adaptive pathways pilot, but the US company, bluebird bio, appears to be the first firm to have formally announced that it is taking this particular approach to approval. </p><p>Bluebird bio, which plans to pursue conditional approval for its LentiGlobin BB305 product candidate for the treatment of beta-thalassemia major, says it is "one of the first companies to participate in the &#8230; pilot program". LentiGlobin is classified as an advanced therapy medicinal product/gene therapy product.</p><p>It is not clear whether the EMA has already accepted LentiGlobin BB305 to take part in the pilot or if the product is still under discussion. The agency said it was not publishing the details of products that are taking part in the adaptive pathways pilot project at this stage. </p><p>"The pilot project recognises the fact that discussions are of an exploratory nature, and so a confidential environment allows open discussion of strengths and weaknesses of all options for iterative development, assessment and authorisation," a spokesperson for the EMA explained. At the time of writing, confirmation on the matter was still awaited from bluebird bio, of Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p>Under the pilot, which was launched in March last year, a company can either seek an initial approval in a well-defined patient subgroup with a high medical need and later have this widened to a larger population, or alternatively secure an early approval (for example conditional approval) and then gather more data to reduce uncertainty around the product's profile.</p><p>As of the end of 31 March this year, 58 products had been submitted as potential candidates for the pilot. 34 of these have been rejected, seven are still to be assessed, and 17 have been selected for in-depth discussion with the company (ie Stage I of the pilot). Stage I discussions have taken place for 10 products. </p><p>Of the 17 products selected for in-depth discussion, three are from SMEs, five are orphan medicines, three are ATMPs and five are anticancer medicines, the spokesperson said. The main reasons for rejection are that development is too advanced or there is limited learning potential for the pilot (eg, no proposal has been made for the use of real-world data). </p><p>Stage II of the pilot consists of in-depth meetings involving the company and all stakeholders, including health technology assessment (HTA) bodies. Eight proposals have been selected for this second stage: one ATMP, four orphan medicines, three products from SMEs and one anticancer medicine. </p><p>The ATMP selected for Stage II could well be LentiGlobin, as bluebird bio says it has had "several discussions involving the EMA, European HTA agencies and patient advocacy organizations as part of [the adaptive pathways] program". Based on these discussions, the company believes it is possible to seek conditional approval for the treatment of adults and adolescents with beta-thalassemia major on the basis of the totality of clinical data, in particular a reduction in transfusion need, from the company&rsquo;s ongoing Northstar Study and supportive HGB-205 study.</p><h2>Talks with FDA</h2><p>Bluebird bio has been in discussions with the US FDA as well as the EMA regarding its global regulatory strategy for LentiGlobin. "These have resulted in general agreement from both agencies regarding bluebird bio's development plans, which could potentially result in accelerated approvals," the company said.</p><p>It announced in February that it had been granted a breakthrough therapy designation for LentiGlobin BB305. Breakthrough designation is intended to accelerate the development and review of drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions where preliminary data indicate that the product may show a substantial improvement over existing therapies.</p><p>"We are grateful for the collaborative regulatory feedback from the FDA and EMA on the design of our pivotal studies, as well as feedback from the European HTA agencies and patient advocacy organizations that are participating in our adaptive pathways pilot project," said Anne-Virginie Eggimann, vice-president of regulatory science. "We are looking forward to continuing our engagement with all of these stakeholders in the coming months to support the potential acceleration of the LentiGlobin BB305 program."</p><p><i>A version of this story has also been published in</i><a href="http://#http://www.rajpharma.com/productsector/pharmaceuticals/Were-in-Gene-therapy-company-goes-public-on-its-EU-adaptive-pathways-plans-358639" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>. </p>
