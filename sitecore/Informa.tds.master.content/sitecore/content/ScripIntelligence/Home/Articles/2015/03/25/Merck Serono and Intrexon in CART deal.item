<p>True to its word, Merck Serono is boosting its immune-oncology platform by signing an exclusive strategic collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) cancer therapies with Intrexon for an upfront payment of $115m.</p><p>The collaboration aims to develop leading-edge products that "empower the immune system" in a regulated manner to overcome the current challenges of CAR-T therapy, using Intrexon's cell engineering techniques and RheoSwitch platform. CAR-T cells are genetically engineered T-cells with synthetic receptors that recognize a specific antigen expressed on tumor cells. When CAR-T cells bind to a target, an immunological attack against the cancer cells is triggered. </p><p>Earlier this year, the chair of the firm's executive board, Dr Karl-Ludwig Kley, highlighted the importance of immune oncology in Merck KGaA's healthcare business growth hopes during its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Immune-oncology-central-to-Merck-KGaAs-pharma-growth-hopes-357071" target="_new">annual financial results conference</a>. The company has already partnered with Pfizer in this hot R&D area. </p><p>The agreement with Intrexon provides Merck Serono exclusive access to Intrexon's proprietary suite of technologies to engineer T-cells with optimized and inducible gene expression, which were recently strengthened by a license agreement with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. </p><p>Intrexon will be responsible for all platform and product developments until IND filing. Merck will nominate targets of interest for which CAR-T products will be developed. Merck will also lead the IND filing and pre-IND interactions, clinical development and commercialization. In addition, Intrexon has the opportunity to explore targets independently, granting Merck opt-in rights during clinical development. </p><p>Intrexon will receive research funding and is eligible to receive up to $826m in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for the first two targets of interest selected by Merck Serono, as well as tiered royalties on product sales. In addition, Intrexon is also eligible to receive further payments upon achievement of certain technology development milestones.</p><p>Intrexon's chairman and CEO Randal Kirk said Merck was an idea partner "because of their long-term perspective, extraordinary character, worldwide reach and commitment to leadership in immuno-oncology". </p><p>CAR-T is a highly active area in immune-oncology as companies hope to change the way cancer is treated. Novartis, which has several cancer immunotherapy programs, has just boosted its R&D portfolio through <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Aduro-gets-200m-as-Novartis-steps-up-immuno-oncology-357555" target="_new">a deal with Aduro</a> for an upfront payment of $200m. </p><p>
