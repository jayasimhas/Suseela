<p>That strong breeze mid-morning on Aug. 24 was a collective sigh of relief as investors realized that the slight rise in major US stock indices would be sustained following a sharp drop that happened when the market opened on Monday morning; biopharma investors were especially relieved.</p><p>A more than 8% plunge in Chinese stocks rippled around the globe, with Japan's Nikkei index falling more that 4% and European indices dropping at a similar pace by the time fears of a China growth slowdown would hurt companies and commodities around the world. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) alone fell by as much as 6.6% before it closed down 588 points, or 3.6%. The Nasdaq closed down 3.8%, but that wasn't as bad compared with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI), which dropped 4.8%, although many biopharma stocks that plummeted when the market opened regained much of what was lost by day's end. </p><p>Putting the markets in perspective, the declines that stocks have experienced in August follow an extraordinary ramp up in values. Also, US economic conditions are far from equal to the last recession, which began in 2008. </p><p>That year, investors finally realized that the mortgage-backed securities they purchased like packets of gum were backed by real estate loans for property that was overvalued by buyers who borrowed far more than they could afford to repay. That realization rippled through US banks, which &ndash; if they didn't shut down &ndash; needed bail-outs from the government to stay afloat. And until the banks recovered, they stopped lending to businesses and consumers, including worthy borrowers.</p><p>If demand for oil, steel and other commodities were to slow in China &ndash; one of the fastest-growing economies in the world &ndash; that would no doubt ripple across many businesses in the US and elsewhere. However, China still is growing, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Results-Round-Up-Big-Pharma-Grapples-With-China-Slowdown-359956" target="_new">albeit at a slower pace</a>, and for biopharma companies the country still represents a relatively small portion of their business. </p><p>China is a land of opportunity as the country becomes more industrialized and its people gain access to modern medicines, but it's still a largely untapped source of biopharma sales growth. </p><p>Credit Suisse analyzed the significance of China to drug makers' revenues in a report that was issued on Aug. 11 after big pharma and major biotech companies revealed their second quarter earnings. Biopharma companies reported a wide range of China sales growth and loss during the first half of 2015, ranging from a 24% gain for Roche to a 15% decline for Eli Lilly & Co.</p><p>The Credit Suisse analysis notes that pharma companies generate an average of about 5% of their revenue in China. The country's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for health care industrial output &ndash; a figure that reflects the potential for health care usage growth in China &ndash; was about 22% each year from 2010 to 2014, but slowed to 6% to 9% for the first five months of 2015. </p><p>That's a big drop in growth, but for most companies it's still growth. Biopharma forecasts may fall a bit based on slower sales growth in China, but revenue should continue to increase in many cases in the region, although some slowing has been anticipated by biotech and pharma companies.</p><p>The Chinese government has indicated that it would reduce certain health care and related spending, including <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Expert-view-Chinese-healthcare-industry-entering-a-new-normal-359395" target="_new">approved drug prices</a>, as it makes modern medicine available to more people. Also, local generic drug makers are making headway against multinational biopharma corporations. The industry still sees the country as an important region for future growth, despite near-term drug price pressures, given the size of the market and China's focus on expanding access to health care.</p><p>So if China's troubles are not such a big deal for biopharma &ndash; a view that may yet be challenged &ndash; what other factors could drive biotech and pharma stock values even lower?</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-CVS-Formulary-Updates-Whos-In-Whos-Out-359772" target="_new">Payers</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Benefit-vs-cost-ASCO-unveils-cancer-drug-value-tool-359071" target="_new">physicians</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Poll-Biopharma-Focuses-On-Profits-Not-Patients-360053" target="_new">patients</a> are putting pressure on companies to lower prescription drug prices, but at the moment the heat remains on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Gilead-addresses-hepatitis-C-drug-payer-deals-356133" target="_new">individual companies</a>, disease areas and drug classes, i.e. Gilead Sciences, hepatitis C, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Costs-for-cancer-drugs-combos-face-increasing-scrutiny-357432" target="_new">cancer drugs</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">PCSK9 inhibitors</a> for the reduction of very high cholesterol. </p><p>The biggest threat to biopharma stock values are the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Biotech-Triggers-Its-Own-Sell-Off-359898" target="_new">values themselves</a>. The DJIA hit its highest point of this year on May 19 with a 2.8% gain versus the end of 2014 and the Nasdaq jumped 10.2% year-to-date at its peak on July 20, but that seems small in comparison to the NBI, which surged 31.1% versus Dec. 31 to its highpoint on July 20.</p><p>Industry observers continue to worry about whether biopharma is in the middle of a bubble with the value of certain initial public offerings leading many to believe that the bubble is about to burst. </p><p>The latest high-flying IPO was Global Blood Therapeutics, which took its IPO to market at $20 per share and its stock value <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Global-Blood-Doubles-Post-IPO-GlobeImmune-Considers-Options-VC-Deals-Surge-359971" target="_new">more than doubled on its first day</a>. The South San Francisco-based company has traded as high as $55.44 since its public debut, but the stock closed down 13.4% at $39.51 on Aug. 24.</p><p>Another threat to biopharma stock values is bad data, although negative clinical trial results for one drug may only hurt the company reporting the data and its competitors in the same drug class. </p><p>Kite Pharma recently came close to sabotaging its own stock and bringing down other companies in the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy field. The Santa Monica, California-based company let rumors about an early death in one of its studies fester for a few days without comment. </p><p>Kite's stock fell on Aug. 13 and 14, leaving investors to hold their breath during the weekend until a conference call on Aug. 17 to clarify that the patient who died succumbed to their advanced cancer and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Another-Reason-To-Watch-Kites-CAR-T-Results-At-ASH-359993" target="_new">did not fall victim to an unforeseen side effect</a> of the company's cell therapy. Shares of competitor Juno Therapeutics traded in lock-step with Kite's shares during that period. </p><p>Drug price pressures, bursting bubbles, bad data and maybe even China's slowing growth all have the potential to curtail the biopharma boom. But there's also plenty of speculation that recent weakness has more to do with investors taking a break from stocks while enjoying some time off this summer. We'll have to wait until after Labor Day on Sept. 7 to know that for sure.</p><p><p><p><p>
