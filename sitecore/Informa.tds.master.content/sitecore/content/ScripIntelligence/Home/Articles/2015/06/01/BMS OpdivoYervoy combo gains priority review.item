<p>In the midst of the excitement at the annual meeting in Chicago of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Bristol-Myers Squibb revealed it has gained a priority review for its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) to market a combination of Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) as a therapy for patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma. </p><p>BMS said it anticipates the FDA making a decision on the sBLA by 30 September, adding that it is the first regulatory milestone for an immuno-oncology regimen in cancer.</p><p>Opdivo already is approved by the FDA in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">melanoma</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">lung cancer</a> &ndash; gaining those US approvals faster than anyone expected and well ahead of their Prescription Drug User Fee Act action dates.</p><p>The medicine was in fact the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to win regulatory approval anywhere in the world when the firm's partner Ono Pharmaceutical gained the nod in Japan last July as a treatment for patients with unresectable melanoma.</p><p>Yervoy, a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-blocking antibody, has been approved in the US since March 2011 as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p><p>The sBLA for the Opdivo/Yervoy combination was based on data from BMS' CheckMate 069 trial, which was the first randomized study evaluating the regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma. </p><p>In the trial, patients with BRAF wild-type mutation status treated with the regimen achieved an objective response rate of 61%, including a 22% complete response rate, in previously untreated advanced melanoma patients, versus those administered Yervoy alone. </p><p>Results of BMS' Phase III CheckMate 067 trial reported at the ASCO 2015 meeting showed that the treatment with the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy or Opdivo alone were superior to Yervoy as a monotherapy.</p><p>The median progression-free survival for the combination was 11.5 months, versus 6.9 months for Opdivo alone and 2.9 months for Yervoy alone.</p><p>The Opdivo/Yervoy regimen demonstrated a 58% reduction in the risk of disease progression, versus Yervoy, while Opdivo monotherapy demonstrated a 43% risk reduction, compared with Yervoy monotherapy.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
