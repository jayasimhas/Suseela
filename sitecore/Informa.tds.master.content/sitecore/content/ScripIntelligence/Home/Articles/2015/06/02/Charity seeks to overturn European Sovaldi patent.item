<p>French charity Médecins du Monde (MdM; Doctors of the World) has filed an opposition with the European Patent Office in an effort to overturn one of Gilead's patents on hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi, with the hope of introducing cheap generics to the market.</p><p>The charity believes that Sovaldi is unaffordable for even rich European economies, calling the drug's price tag "exorbitant." Sovaldi costs around &euro;41,000 a course in France, &euro;44,000 a course in the UK, and &euro;49,000 a course in Germany. MdM suggested that if its patent challenge is successful, generic versions of the drug could be produced for as little as &euro;88.</p><p>"As Gilead is abusing its patent to impose prices that are unsustainable for healthcare systems," the charity said, "Doctors of the World has decided to contest it: the first time in Europe that a medical charity has employed this method to improve patient access to drugs." </p><p>However, it is not quite clear on what grounds MdM believes it has a case. The charity said that the sofosbuvir molecule itself "is not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent." MdM is specifically opposing Gilead's patent on the prodrug, or marketed form of sofosbuvir. The only other detail the charity gave on its case was that, "The molecule itself does not merit a patent because it relies on existing and commonly practised techniques in the pharmaceutical field." </p><p>It appears that MdM is trying to emulate proceedings in India, where an ongoing patent dispute over Sovaldi is being led by the charity's partner I-MAK (the Initiative for Medicines, Access, & Knowledge). Indeed, I-MAK has collaborated with MdM's European patent attorney to write the dossier for the European opposition. In India, the patent office recently rejected one of the key patent applications on Sovaldi, though Gilead is in the process of appealing the decision (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-reconfirms-India-Sovaldi-plans-despite-patent-challenge-356180" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 16 January 2015). MdM also pointed out that the same patent has been rejected in Egypt.</p><h2>Genuine threat?</h2><p>Mike Snodin, founder and director of Park Grove IP, a UK-based patent attorney firm, said that at this stage it was impossible to guess the strength of the challenge, but that MdM may be underestimating some aspects of the process.</p><p>For example, MdM has estimated that the proceedings will last one-two years. Mr Snodin called this "wildly inaccurate," adding, "Even in the (relatively unlikely) event that first instance proceedings are completed within that timeframe, you still need to consider the time taken for the EPO to deal with an appeal (which could easily add another two-five years to the total)."</p><p>"Moreover," said Mr Snodin, "it seems inherently unlikely that knocking out the prodrug patent would remove all relevant barriers to market entry for generic versions of Sovaldi. In addition to other patents that may provide relevant protection, there will be regulatory data protection (ie, data exclusivity) on the clinical data for Solvadi until at least 10 years from the authorization date for that product.  That data exclusivity would appear to make it almost impossible for there to be market entry of generic sofosbuvir until 17 January 2024 at the very earliest."</p><p>In fact, MdM does not seem to expect that its challenge alone would be enough to get generics on the market. It acknowledged that even if it wins the legal battle, "it is not certain that generic versions of sofosbuvir will be able to be produced in Europe because of these other patents." </p><p>However, the charity stated that it "hopes that its action will encourage other European civil society organizations to oppose other patents requested by Gilead on sofosbuvir." MdM also plans to use the opportunity to launch a national debate on drug pricing mechanisms in France.</p><p>Gilead has come under attack for its pricing of Sovaldi from numerous directions. France has led the charge in Europe, rallying other member states to pile pressure on companies to lower the prices of hepatitis C drugs, and subsequently negotiating the lowest price in Europe for Sovaldi (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/France-enlists-EU-help-to-squeeze-Sovaldi-price-352910" target="_new">16 July, 2014</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/France-gets-cheapest-Sovaldi-in-Europe-355218" target="_new">24 November, 2014</a>). But even in the free market of the US, where the drug costs $84,000, there were rumblings of discontent, and Gilead has since offered US payers substantial discounts (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-sales-soar-but-investors-sour-on-HCV-drug-discounts-356529" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 4 February 2015).</p><p>Nonetheless, several European health technology appraisal bodies have deemed the drug to be cost-effective, recognizing that it will provide cost savings in the long term. The problem is that these markets, including the UK, Spain, and Germany, are struggling to afford the short-term costs, not having budgeted for the revolution in hepatitis C treatment.</p><p>Gilead, which was not immediately available for comment, is no stranger to fighting off patent cases. As well as the ongoing Indian case, the company has successfully beaten off patent oppositions to Sovaldi in the US, the UK, and Norway from Merck's subsidiary Idenix Pharmaceuticals (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Gilead-prevails-in-UK-hep-C-patent-fight-355354" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 1 December 2014). Idenix still has cases open against Gilead in France, Germany, and Canada.</p>
