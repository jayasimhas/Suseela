<p>In response to the expected surge in spending on expensive new drugs over the coming years, the Italian government is to establish a fund to reimburse the costs of new innovative medicines including treatments for hepatitis C. It also plans to strengthen the activities of the regulatory agency AIFA in the area of health technology assessment. </p><p>The moves, which were agreed in the 2015 Stability Law approved at the end of December, come amid a row over a proposal by the Italian regional authorities to cut healthcare spending, including expenditure on medicines &ndash; a move that has understandably got the industry up in arms.</p><p>"We don't want to believe this," said the industry body Farmindustria. "We are hearing that the regions have requested a &euro;2bn cut to the national health fund, of which &euro;750m would be borne by the pharmaceutical industry. The government must reject this proposal."</p><p>Italy, in common with other EU countries, is facing severe pressures on public spending as a result of its economic woes. These pressures are keenly felt in the healthcare area, not least with the imminent arrival of numerous expensive innovative drugs such as Gilead Sciences' hepatitis product Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).</p><p>Italy has a high incidence of hepatitis C, so the effects on health spending of the likes of Sovaldi are a particular source of concern. Gilead reached an agreement with AIFA on the pricing and reimbursement of Sovaldi in September last year, and other similar products are on the way.</p><p>In times of financial constraints, past Italian governments have tended to target the drugs bill as a quick and easy way of preserving scarce resources, imposing price and reimbursement cuts, ceilings on pharmaceutical spending, and changes in patient co-payments.</p><p>However, according to Massimo Scaccabarozzi, Farmindustria's president, recent administrations have proved less confrontational and more open to industry's arguments. </p><p>"For ten years the industry has always been used like a cash machine, but the last two governments, thanks to the health minister Beatrice Lorenzin, have recognized the value of the industry and have brought in much more stability," Mr Scaccabarozzi told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview. "The government recognizes that with its innovation, production and export activity, the industry is good for the economy." </p><h2>Hepatitis C drug fund</h2><p>He said this was reflected in the government's decision to include in the 2015 Stability Law a provision to set up a new fund to pay for the reimbursement of innovative drugs, including those for hepatitis C. Covering the years 2015-16, it will provide &euro;500m in each year, with most of the money (&euro;900m) coming from funds that have already been allotted for specific projects under the national health plan, and the other &euro;100m directly from the state in 2015. </p><p>Under this system, if spending on an individual innovative drug exceeds &euro;300m, a payback mechanism will kick in, with 20% of any extra spending being borne by the company concerned, and the other 80% by the rest of the industry, with the amount per company depending on their sales of non-innovative patented drugs. </p><p>A standing committee will monitor the effects of the use of innovative drugs in terms of savings elsewhere in the health system, such as the avoidance of hospitalization, transplants, and so on.</p><p>The funds are to be given to the regions in proportion to their spending on reimbursement of innovative drugs, with the exact mechanism to be laid out in a health ministry decree. However, the regions are not best pleased with the idea, saying that these resources were already earmarked for regional projects agreed in the state-region conference.</p><p>Industry, though, has welcomed the fund. "We appreciate that even with its financial difficulties the government has tried to find resources for these drugs. It is not a big fund, but it is a very important signal at a time of crisis. It is good that the government has made this effort," Mr Scaccabarozzi remarked. It also reflects a recognition of the longer-term benefits of using innovative hepatitis C drugs &ndash; avoiding hospitalization, cirrhosis or liver transplants, and so on. "This is the positive part," he said.</p><p>The negative part is the regions' proposal for a &euro;2bn cut in health spending this year as part of their efforts to find &euro;4bn in savings this year as required under the Stability Law. To be precise, the regions are proposing not to implement a &euro;2bn increase in the national health fund that was agreed under the "Pact for Health" in 2014. </p><h2>Prime minister "must intervene"</h2><p>Farmindustria said companies already paid "hundreds of millions of euros" towards pharmaceutical spending, in the form of the payback and other mechanisms. "If the regions' proposal were to pass, it would be absolutely impossible for the industry to maintain its investments and convince parent companies of Italy's credibility," the association declared. It called on prime minister Matteo Renzi to intervene "immediately".</p><p>"We already have a sales payback mechanism and prices are on average lower than in other EU countries, and yet the regions continue to want to cut health and pharmaceutical spending," Mr Scaccabarozzi said. "Why? Probably because it is easy."</p><p>The regions originally had until 31 January to present their proposals for cuts to the government, but the deadline was postponed and regional representatives are meeting with the government this week to discuss the way forward. The government is firmly against the cuts to health, and Mr Scaccabarozzi hopes it will prevail. "The national health fund has so far been defended strongly and with great determination by health minister Lorenzin," he said. </p><p>The problem facing the regions, though, is that their finances are already under pressure and a large proportion of their spending is on the healthcare system &ndash; 70-80% in some cases, according to local reports. </p><p>The regions' proposal for cuts came just a week after pharmaceutical round table talks reopened at the ministry of economic development, having been suspended for a year and a half. These talks are intended to address questions of sustainability of the pharmaceutical sector. The vice-minister for economic development, Claudio De Vincente, said at the talks that he wanted to establish a number of working groups to look at issues such as health spending, innovation and drug distribution. </p><h2>More HTA work</h2><p>In an effort to seek better value for money from new drugs, the Stability Law says that "in order to guarantee fair and equal access of patients to all medicines, particularly innovative medicines of exceptional therapeutic importance", AIFA will conduct HTA evaluations in order to identify therapeutic strategies that ensure the cost-effective use of available resources. </p><p>In this way, the regional and local health authorities will have "transparent and transferable information" on the comparative effectiveness of medicines and their cost-efficacy profile in clinical practice, both "before their launch on the market, and during commercialization and their entire life-cycle".</p><p>AIFA, the law says, will work with the regional authorities to coordinate the evaluation of various therapeutic strategies which, together with spending and usage data from the national medicines observatory and data collected by AIFA's drug monitoring registries, will feed into procedures for reviewing drug pricing and reimbursement levels.</p>
