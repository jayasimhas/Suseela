<p><p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC has the right strategy in place to drive near- to mid-term growth and is not interested in a mega-merger with Pfizer Inc., CEO Andrew Witty said during the company&rsquo;s third quarter sales and earnings call Oct. 28. </p><p>The chief executive was questioned by analysts about his thoughts on a potential merger with Pfizer, which has indicated its interest in large-scale M&A, especially if it paves the way to an improved tax situation. Pfizer CEO Ian Read reiterated his company&rsquo;s interest in M&A and potential tax-inversion deals one day earlier during <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/10/27/Pfizer-Still-Looking-To-Buy-A-Tax-Advantage--And-Before-Congress-Flips?" target="_new">Pfizer&rsquo;s quarterly call</a>. </p><p>Pfizer&rsquo;s apparent interest in merging with a company domiciled outside the US has put companies like GSK and Allergan Inc. on analysts&rsquo; and investors&rsquo; short list of potential targets. </p><p>Though Witty stopped short of mentioning Pfizer by name, he said a mega-merger would be bad for business. </p><p>&ldquo;We think there is a very significant benefit from being focused on execution of [our] strategy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As a consequence, that is very much where our attention is devoted and [we are] not looking at other types of transactions, which would potentially, in our view, lead to years of distraction and draw us away from what we can see is a very interesting short-to medium-term cycle of value generation.&rdquo;</p><p>GSK&rsquo;s go-it-alone strategy, underpinned by an important business deal with Novartis AG that closed earlier this year, involves expanding in two high-volume, lower-risk businesses, vaccines and consumer health care, to offset what are expected to be <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet/77/19/GSK-Positions-To-Dominate-In-Vaccines-Will-The-Bet-Pay-Off?" target="_new">challenging years</a> for its larger pharmaceutical business. </p><p>The arrangement with Novartis was <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/3/2/Swapping-Assets-Now-Down-To-Execution-For-GSK-And-Novartis?" target="_new">a multi-million dollar asset swap</a> in which GSK bought Novartis&rsquo; global vaccines business, excluding influenza vaccines, for $5.25bn, and divested its oncology business to Novartis for $16bn. </p><p>GSK has vowed that <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/5/6/GSK-Lays-Out-FiveYear-Growth-Strategy-Underpinned-By-Advair-Generics?" target="_new">pharma sales will grow</a> at a compound annual growth rate of low single-digits from 2016 to 2020 and consolidated revenue will grow at CAGR of low-to-mid single digits over the five-year period, while earnings will grow faster than sales. </p><p>&ldquo;We see very significant opportunity to create value through the expansion of the margin in consumer and vaccines, delivery of the sales growth in those two businesses, and bringing through of the pharmaceutical pipelines,&rdquo; Witty said. </p><p>The strategy appears to have paid off in the third quarter, with consolidated sales up 11% on a reported basis to &pound;6.13bn ($9.39bn), even as pharmaceuticals sales dipped 7% to &pound;3.34bn ($5.12bn). Vaccines sales jumped 32% to &pound;1.18bn ($1.81bn) and consumer health care sales increased 55% to &pound;1.58bn ($2.42bn). </p><p>The lower pharmaceuticals sales reflected the disposal of its oncology business to Novartis, as well as lower respiratory sales, as its top-seller, the asthma drug Advair/Seretide, continues to face competitive and pricing pressures. Advair/Seretide sales fell 19% over the year-ago period to &pound;794m ($1.22bn). </p><p>But Witty pointed to the silver lining in the lower Advair sales: if and when a generic version enters the market in the US, which some analysts expect in 2017, the impact will be softer. &ldquo;The size of the nut which is potentially at risk eventually when and if a generic ever arrives is reduced all the time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are less concerned about the threat than we were.&rdquo; </p><p><b>R&D Update To Showcase More Than 40 Medicines</b></p><p>Given GSK&rsquo;s diminishing pharmaceutical portfolio, investors will be anxious for the pipeline update management plans to provide during an R&D briefing scheduled for Nov. 3.</p><p>Investors can expect to hear more about the company&rsquo;s shingles vaccine, the interleukin-5 antibody mepolizumab for severe asthma and the anti-IL6 sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis. Management declined to provide much in the way of pipeline updates in the meantime, but said the company would showcase more than 40 new medicines in development, 80% of which are potential first-in-class opportunities. </p><p>GSK did announce two important data readouts on Oct. 27, the day before the call. The first was a second pivotal trial for its shingles vaccine candidate Shingrix, which met its primary endpoint of demonstrating efficacy against shingles versus placebo. </p><p>The trial, ZOE-70, conducted in adults 70 and older, was in line with efficacy seen in the first pivotal trial, ZOE-50, in adults 50 and older. In a pooled analysis of both studies, the vaccine also prevented subsequent chronic neuropathic pain, known as postherpetic neuralgia, the most common severe complication of shingles. GSK said it plans to file the vaccine with regulatory authorities in North America, Europe and Japan in the first half of 2016. </p><p>The second trial was a failure, however. The Phase III trial, LATITUDE-TIMI 60, testing the p38 MAP kinase losmapimod for the prevention of cardiovascular events did not demonstrate efficacy in an interim data review from the initial portion of the trial. The data do not support investment in the larger part B portion of the study, GSK said. </p><p>The Part A portion of the study enrolled 3,503 patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome who were randomized to receive three months of twice daily oral treatment with losmapimod or placebo in addition to standard of care. GSK said it will assess the findings over the next few months to evaluate the future development options. </p><p>The company had another <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2013/11/12/GSKs-Darapladib-Poised-To-Become-Latest-Cardiovascular-Outcomes-Casualty?" target="_new">big flop</a> in cardiovascular disease in 2013, when darapladib failed to result in an improvement in reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared to placebo in a 15,828-patient outcomes trial.</p><p><i>[Editor's note: This article is also published inÂ "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
