<p>By the end of this week the European Commission will adopt legislation on the "unique identifier" that manufacturers will have to affix to practically every single pack of prescription medicine sold in Europe under the EU falsified medicines directive (FMD).</p><p>Under EU rules, the legislation, which is in the form of a "delegated regulation," will not be announced or published at this stage but will go straight to the European Parliament and the Council of the EU (member state ministers) for their approval, according to Stefano Soro, head of the product and service safety unit in the commission's health and consumers directorate.</p><p>The two bodies will have two months to approve or reject the legislation. "So early next year this [legislation] should be published, fingers crossed," Soro told a media seminar in Brussels. Manufacturers will then have three years in which to comply with the requirements.</p><p>The aim of the unique identifier (UI) is to make it easier to spot falsified medicines &ndash; those that are passed off as the real thing but may not contain the correct ingredients, for example, or stolen products illegally introduced into the supply chain. </p><p>The technical details of the UI were laid out in the draft delegated regulation when it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Commission-Names-Products-That-Wont-Need-EU-Safety-Feature-360032" target="_new">published in August</a>. It will consist of a 2D bar code containing the product code, serial number, batch number and expiry date, and will form part of a new "safety feature" together with a tamper-proof device that will also have to be included on product packs (although the anti-tamper aspects are not part of the delegated regulation).</p><p>The new safety feature will have to be attached to all prescription drugs apart from those in certain categories such as advanced therapies containing tissues or cells, contrast media, and homeopathic products (the so-called "white list"). The only non-prescription medicine required to carry the safety feature (so far at least) will be omeprazole gastro-resistant capsules (the "black list").</p><p>The bar code will be read by the repositories system that is being set up by an industry consortium called the European Medicines Verification Organization (EMVO). "Packs will have their code checked into the repository system that is being developed as we speak, and will be checked out at the time of dispensing," Soro explained. </p><p>"If a drug has been stolen, for example, you will have the codes in the system, and if someone tries to introduce it into the supply chain, or if the code doesn't exist, an alarm will go off. The idea is to reinforce the legal supply chain and make it difficult to falsify," he said. </p><p>Asked whether, given the low incidence of falsified medicines in the supply chain, placing a code on every pack was like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, as well as being very costly for the manufacturers, Soro said the benefits would outweigh the costs. </p><p>"We have an impact assessment that will be published with the delegated act, but it is important to remember that the whole system is being developed by industry partners. The legislation says the manufacturers pay, so we decided with the member states to trust the supply chain to deal with this."</p><p>The cost of affixing the safety feature is "a couple of cents per pack," Soro said, noting that the cost of the technology involved has fallen significantly since the directive was adopted, and is still coming down. "Our impact assessment shows that the cost of losing trust in the supply chain is higher than the cost of putting a code on the pack," he continued. "Bizarrely, the figures we have show that the anti-tampering device is more expensive than the bar code: it's still only a few cents, but more expensive. The costs are all in the repositories system."</p><h2>Online Pharmacy Checker</h2><p>Soro also noted that new rules on the online sale of medicines came into force in July, including a special logo that all legally operating online pharmacies or retailers must show on their websites, as required by the FMD. When clicked, the logo takes the user to a national website operated by that country's regulator which will tell them whether the pharmacy is operating legally. </p><p>The system is of course not foolproof, said Soro, who is not known for mincing his words. "The legislator might be stupid but is not so stupid as to think that with a logo and this sort of provision you can control completely what happens on the internet. But the idea here is to create a fence within which all legally operating online pharmacies find themselves linked to an exhaustive register of all legally operating online pharmacies that is maintained and updated by the individual member state so as to enable consumers who genuinely want to buy legitimate medicines online to do so."</p>
