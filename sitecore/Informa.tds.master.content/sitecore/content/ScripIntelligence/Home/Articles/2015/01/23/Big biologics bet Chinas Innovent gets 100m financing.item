<p>A record-breaking private financing for a Chinese biotech has seen bets placed on Suzhou-based Innovent Biologics, which has 10 monoclonal antibodies including four biosimilars in its pipeline.</p><p>The company has raised $100m in a Series C financing, with what is the largest untranched private financing by a Chinese biotech being led by new investors Legend Capital, Singapore's government-owned investment fund Temasek, and two other undisclosed investors.</p><p>Existing investors Fidelity Biosciences, Fidelity Growth Partners Asia, Lilly Asia Ventures and Frontline Bioventures also participated.</p><p>Established with $30m from Lilly Asia Ventures, Fidelity Growth Partners Asia and local incubator Suzhou BioBay in 2001, the firm received an additional $25m in 2012 from the investment consortium.</p><p>The proceeds from this round will mainly be used to fund Innovent's pipeline, consisting of 10 antibody products including novel biologics and biosimilars of some global bestselling therapies, and the company's general operations, said Innovent.</p><p>The pipeline includes IBI301, a biosimilar version of Roche's Rituxan/Mabthera (rituximab) for cancer and autoimmune disorders that is in Phase I study in China, and IBI303, a biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (infliximab) that is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p><p>Another lead compound, IBI302, is a novel biologic for oncology indications.</p><p><p>Mabthera is the best-selling antibody drug in China with sales reaching roughly CNY1.4bn ($226m) a year, accounting for nearly half of the total monoclonal antibody market in China, Innovent said.</p><p><p>"This financing enables us to continue progressing our internal pipeline of complex biologics while simultaneously furthering our operational capabilities as the premier biologics company in China meeting international development standards," Innovent co-founder and CEO Michael Yu said in a statement.</p><p><p>"I expect to see the biologics market growing at a very rapid pace in the next five years," Yu told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> during the last round of financing.</p><p><p>Innovent's manufacturing facilities, located in the Suzhou Industry Park, are among the few in China designed specifically to comply with international requirements for cGMP, said the company.</p><p><p>The funding will also help Innovent's goal to be a partner of choice for multinational companies looking to develop and commercialize biologics in China.</p><p><p>Already operating two 1,000L bioreactors, the company plans to build an additional 15,000L bioreactor and pilot plant for production of clinical materials and the commercialization of products upon completion. It strives to be an ideal partner for pharmaceutical and biotech companies seeking to further develop and market biologics in Asia, said Yu.</p><p><h2>factors for success</h2><p><p>A rapidly growing Chinese market has attracted a large influx of investment to emerging biologic startups that meet international quality standards.</p><p>BeiGene (Beijing) for one has raised $75m in a Series A funding (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BeiGene-gears-up-for-cancer-immunology-debut-355901" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 31 December 2014</a>).</p><p><p>Another Suzhou-based antibody firm, Adagene Biologics, obtained $8m in its first round of financing, just days after Beijing-based biopharma CANBridge Life Sciences secured $10m in a Series A round (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hot-money-fuels-China-biotech-me-different-ambitions-355863" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 December 2014</a>).</p><p><p>As a new crop of Chinese innovators, many educated in Western countries, is focusing on differentiation and incremental innovation, the biologics market in China is becoming a sizzling hot area to pursue, investors say.</p><p><p>"As long as the innovation is there, companies won't have to worry about money," said Lilly Asia Ventures CEO Yi Shi in a recent presentation at Duke University.</p><p><p>As the China pharma market is poised to account for 15% of the global total and become the world's second largest by 2017, it offers enormous opportunities for a biotech to differentiate and succeed, Shi stressed.</p><p><p>Banking on a cost advantage, Chinese biotechs have rushed to develop and file regulatory approvals for their biosimilars of various best-selling biologic drugs.</p><p><p>Citing Betta Pharmaceuticals (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Ding-plans-Betta-chances-for-Conmana-in-China-352152" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 June 2014</a>) as a success story, Shi noted that founders who have international insight and a forward-looking approach are key to ensure the success of domestic biopharma firms.</p><p><p>Betta and Innovent aside, Shi's Lilly Asia Ventures fund portfolio also includes Novast Laboratories Ltd., a Nantong, Jiangsu-based generics maker with production lines that have been cleared by the US FDA.</p><p><p>Combining the market potential, incremental innovation and international GMP-compliant quality will fuel a Chinese biotech to win the day, Shi summarized.</p><p><p>"With a focus on quality and compliance, Chinese companies will have the potential to enter the international market."</p><p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
