<p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC held an expansive R&D update Nov. 3, laying out a strategy to file up to 20 drugs with regulators before 2020, seven of which could launch in that timeline. But few investors are likely to walk away from the four-hour meeting with a changed sentiment on the firm in the near-term, where it is facing strong headwinds from slowing sales of its top-seller Advair Diskus.</p><p>Many of the late-stage opportunities like Nucala (mepolizumab) for severe asthma, the Shingrix shingles vaccine and the interleukin-6 blocker sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis have already been factored into investors' long-term growth prospects for the company. </p><p>Some potentially exciting programs like a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) proly hydroxylase inhibitor (PHI) daprodustat and cancer drugs in epigenetics and immuno-oncology are earlier stage, where the chance of success remains uncertain. </p><p>"While it is certainly helpful to have incremental information on pipeline candidates, when early-stage products are profiled it runs the risk of creating expectations when some degree of caution is warranted," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note following the update.</p><p>"Caution is warranted in this case, given (a) GSK's prior R&D track record where promises of superior pipeline output on the back of structural changes to its R&D organization&#8230;never quite played out; and (b) aggregate industry data," he added.</p><p>Indeed, GSK has experienced a string of late-stage R&D failures in the last two years, notably in cardiovascular disease where it pursued high-risk programs that failed. Where it has had success &ndash; in respiratory disease, launching Breo Ellipta, Anoro Ellipta and now Nucala &ndash; the company has struggled to position new drugs competitively in a market dominated by entrenched leaders, the most venerable of which is its own product, Advair. </p><p>Advair has come under serious pricing pressure, however, fueled by competition and payer pushback. And with the threat of a generic on the horizon in the US, possibly as early as 2017, the company's pharmaceutical business is heading toward a challenging period. Last year, the company announced plans to close its research facilities in Research Triangle, N.C., part of a broader effort to save $1.6bn annually in costs in the face of declining Advair sales.</p><p>CEO Andrew Witty's strategy then has been to cut costs while expanding into high-volume, lower-risk areas like consumer health care and vaccines, to offset the challenges in pharmaceuticals. That strategy drove GSK's multi-billion asset swamp with Novartis AG, which closed earlier this year as GSK bought Novartis' global vaccines business and divested its marketed oncology drugs to Novartis, while establishing a consumer health care joint venture. </p><p>But the strategy puts pressure on GSK's pharmaceutical pipeline to eventually deliver, something the chief executive assured investors it will do. </p><p>"We see innovation being pivotal to drive forward this part of the company," he said. Eighty percent of the 40 or so molecules showcased by GSK during the event could be first-in-class, he added. They include drugs in development in six core areas: HIV/infectious disease, respiratory, vaccines, immuno-inflammation, oncology and rare diseases.</p><p>"We believe that having a scaled consumer health care business, global leadership in vaccines and an R&D business driving the future growth of pharma, particularly as the Advair drag starts to recede over the next three years or four years, represents a very long-term opportunity of growth for the company," Witty said. </p><p>In Respiratory, Nucala Expansion And Triple Combo On The Horizon</p><p>GSK's newest opportunity is Nucala, which was approved by FDA Nov. 4 as the first interleukin-5 antibody for use as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma who have an eosinophilic phenotype. The drug will launch by the end of the year with a wholesale acquisition cost of $2,500 per vial. Patients with severe asthma represent just 5% to 10% of asthmatics, but account for about 60% of health care utilization, according to GSK.</p><p>GSK has big plans to expand Nucala beyond asthma. "It's got potential in virtually every eosinophilic-driven disease," President-Pharmaceuticals R&D Patrick Vallance said. "Where eosinophils drive disease there is clearly indication expansion." </p><p>The company is studying the drug in eosinophilic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with data to support a regulatory filing expected to read out in 2017. It is also being studied for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA), hyper-eosinophilic syndrome (HES), nasal polyposis and atopic dermatitis. </p><p>Beyond Nucala, GSK has several other drugs in development for respiratory diseases. The company plans to begin testing the IL-6 antibody sirukumab in patients with neutrophilic asthma &ndash; the other significant driver of severe disease &ndash; in 2016 in partnership with Johnson & Johnson. It is also developing a long-acting IL-5 antibody that could pave the way for injections twice a year rather than every four weeks. </p><p>GSK also updated investors on plans for a triple combination product, combining a corticosteroid, long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in one device. The firm expects to file the product in Europe in 2016, but not until the first half of 2018 in the US as it waits data from an exacerbation trial versus lung function tests.   </p><p>Vallence spent some time talking about two new areas the company is moving into in the respiratory space. One is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where he said the company is about to initiate clinical trials of an &#945;vb6 integrin antagonist and has worked to develop new imaging technologies to see if medicines are actually impacting the disease, improving on current methods of evaluation like the six-minute walk test. The other is acute lung injury, where the company is developing a TNFR1 blocker.  </p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Filing 2014 To 2017</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Filing 2018 To 2020</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Filing 2021 To 2025</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Mepolizumab IL-5 for COPD</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Mepolizumab for nasal polyposis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Sirukumab IL-6 for severe asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Mepolizumab for EGPA</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Mepolizumab for HES</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Danirixin CXCR2 antagonist for COPD</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Fluticasone/vilanterol/umeclidinium ICS/LAMA LAMA for COPD</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK2269557 PI3 kinase delta inhibitor for COPD/asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>fluticasone furoate+vilanterol +umeclidinium ICS/LABA/LAMA </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK2862277 TNFR1 dAb for acute lung injury</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK2245035 TLR7 agonist for asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK3191812 TSLP dAb for asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK3008348 &#945;vb6 integrin antagonist for IPF</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Long acting IL-4 for asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>IL-5/13 bispecific antibody for asthma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>One potentially lucrative opportunity is daprodustat, the proly hydroxylase inhibitor, which the company is studying first for the treatment of resistant anemia, particularly in patients with renal failure. The drug could represent a potential oral alternative to erythropoietin, which is given via injection and carries an increased risk of cardiovascular events. The company unveiled Phase IIb data for the first time, showing the drug increased hemoglobin versus erythropoietin with a safety profile in line with chronic kidney disease.  </p><p>GSK plans to initiate Phase III testing in 2016, including two large cardiovascular outcomes trial in patients on dialysis and not on dialysis. The regulatory filing timeline for the product in anemia in patients with CKD is 2021, putting it three years behind a competing product from FibroGen Inc., partnered with AstraZeneca PLC. Fibrogen's product is already in Phase III testing with a US filing targeted for 2018. </p><h2>HIV: A Bright Spot</h2><p>A positive area for GSK has been ViiV Healthcare, the HIV-focused subsidiary it owns in a joint venture with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi & Co. Ltd. The company reported 65% growth in sales of its HIV business in the third quarter to &pound;622m, driven by strong sales of the once-daily integrase inhibitor Tivicay (dolutegravir), which launched in 2013 and the combination pill Triumeq, which combines dolutegravir with the active ingredients in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Epzicom (abacavir/lamivudine). </p><p>Now ViiV is turning its attention to a follow up, cabotegravir, a long-acting antiviral for HIV infection that has the potential for dosing every two to three months versus daily.</p><p>Cabotegravir is in Phase II development, and GSK and its partner Johnson & Johnson presented positive top-line data from the LATTE2 trial the same day, studying long-acting cabotegravir in combination with Janssen's long-acting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine in 309 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients versus an oral regimen of three HIV medicines. Through 32 weeks on the two-drug maintenance therapy, 95% of patients dosed every four weeks and 94% of those dosed every eight weeks were virologic successes, the firms reported. The data support moving cabotegravir into Phase III development, GSK said.</p><p>"This raises the possibility of a new paradigm of HIV treatment, where you are looking at intermittent injections every two or three months rather than daily treatment," Vallance said.</p><p>ViiV is also exploring cabotegravir together with a broadly neutralizing antibody in a trial conducted together with the National Institutes of Health, the firm said, which will be in the clinic next year. </p><p>GSK is also looking to extend the nanocrystalization technology it is using for cabotegravir to the hepatitis C space, with the potential for a single dose HCV treatment. The company announced a clinical trial collaboration with Regulus Therapeutics Inc. to study GSK2878175, an investigational non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitor, with Regulus' RG-101, a GaINAc-conjugated anti miR that targets MiR-122, in a Phase II study in patients with HCV. GSK is simultaneously developing a long-acting form of the drug that the two could potentially study in combination. </p><p>The goal is a single-dose pan-genotypic treatment, a potentially valuable offering in terms of compliance, though it is unclear what the HCV market opportunity will look like when the drug could launch, given current treatment advances reducing the burden of disease. </p><h2>A Glimpse Into Immuno-Oncology</h2><p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC isn't letting the fact that it doesn't have a PD-1/L1 inhibitor get its immuno-oncology R&D efforts down. Instead, the company is focusing immuno-oncology research on next-generation checkpoint modulators, including the OX40 agonist antibody GSK3174998 and first-in-class ICOS agonist antibody GSK3359609.</p><p>GSK's immuno-oncology pipeline is still in the early stages of development, one reason the company hasn't revealed many details about it. The area of research is also an interesting one for the company because GSK sold its marketed cancer drugs including targeted therapies Mekinist and Tafinlar to Novartis, raising questions in the minds of investors about its long-term prospects in the field.</p><p>Management sought to set the record straight during the R&D day. "The approach in oncology is to go for those areas which we think are profoundly disruptive in terms of what may happen in cancers," Vallance said. "We are not pursuing any of the other things. We are not pursuing targeted therapies."</p><p>"We have a very high hurdle, but we expect the choices we've made will clear that hurdle," he added.</p><p>To that end, GSK is not developing a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, an asset that nearly every frontrunner in immuno-oncology, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Merck & Co. Inc., Roche, AstraZeneca PLC and Pfizer Inc., is developing internally or has licensed rights to. Bristol and Merck have the first two FDA-approved PD-1 inhibitors on the market, Opdivo (nivolumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab), respectively.</p><p>GSK announced the same day that it has partnered with Merck to study its OX40 agonist antibody GSK3174998 in combination with Merck's Keytruda, with studies expected to start in 2016. GSK has already initiated a Phase I trial testing the drug alone in eight different cancers. It plans to begin studies in combination with its own TLR4 agonist in 2017.</p><p>Management said it doesn't need to have its own PD-1 inhibitor to be successful in immuno-oncology. Vallance admitted the company had one in development at one point and missed the mark in the development.</p><p>"We didn't get to where we needed to be and we made a very clear decision that we were not going to be chasing the pack," he said. "We were going to jump to what the next generation of what we saw as combination medicines rather than come in with the sixth, seventh, whatever it might be PD-1."</p><p>Head of Immuno-Oncology Axel Hoos &ndash; well known for leading development of the first cancer immunotherapy to reach the market, Bristol's CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab) &ndash; agreed.</p><p>"We believe it is quite possible that any of these checkpoint modulators could become another backbone strategy, or another backbone medicine," Hoos said. "Until we developed ipilimumab, nobody had fully appreciated how big PD-1 would become afterwards. Now we are at PD-1, and I don't think we fully appreciate yet how big the next generation will be. Our focus is on third generation with leading molecules. ICOS and OX40 both could be backbone strategies."</p><p>There are several other OX40 agonist antibodies in development across the industry, but GSK sees an opportunity to be first-to-market with an ICOS agonist, which appears to be a mechanism that works against multiple cancers and might be positioned after PD-1 inhibitors in unresponsive or refractory patients.</p><p>Under GSK's deal with Novartis, the Swiss pharma has the right to make an offer to buy any of the oncology assets that its partner develops before regulatory filing, but GSK is not obliged to accept the offer. GSK can market the drugs independently or accept a better offer if a partner emerges.</p><p>Chairman of Vaccines Moncef Slaoui also presented an overview of GSK's vaccines business led by the shingles vaccine Shingrix, which has completed Phase III testing with positive results and could pose a serious challenge to Merck & Co. Inc.'s marketed Zostavax due to its apparent efficacy (<a href="http://auth.pharmamedtechbi.com/?sc_itemid=%7b2f6f19c3-cf09-4c7b-80ec-bde580d43efa%7d&sc_mode=preview&sc_lang=en" target="_new">[A#00150511012]</a>). </p><p>Another highlight is a pentavalent meningitis vaccine that would address all five serogroups of the disease, ACYW and B, currently in Phase II. The Phase III trial is expected to start in 2017 with a regulatory filing targeted for 2020. </p><p>GSK has a lot on its drug development agenda but it will need to keep pushing ahead aggressively on its mid-stage assets &ndash; with positive results &ndash; if it is to convince investors to stick with it through diminishing Advair sales to enjoy the longer-term possibilities.</p><p>This article is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet"</a>.
