<p>Bristol Myers Squibb Co. on Oct. 28 won the FDA's approval to expand the use of Yervoy (ipilimumab) as an adjuvant treatment for patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1mm who have undergone complete resection including total lymphadenectomy. </p><p>Yervoy is the first and only FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitor in the adjuvant treatment for fully resected stage III melanoma, BMS pointed out.</p><p>The drug has been approved in the US since March 2011, gaining that initial nod as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma at the 3mg/kg dosage, which is intended to be administered intravenously over 90 minutes every three weeks for a total of four doses. The drug at that dosage costs about $30,000 per injection.</p><p>For the new use in adjuvant melanoma, Yervoy is administered at a dosage of 10mg/kg over 90 minutes every three weeks for four doses, followed by 10mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to three years or until documented disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. </p><p>Yervoy had $1.3bn in global sales in 2014. Unfortunately, BMS' newer drug, Opdivo (nivolumab), a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, has eaten into Yervoy's sales. </p><p>The new use, along with the recent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-OKd-1st-U.S.-Immuno-Oncology-Combo-360779" target="_new">combination approval</a> with Opdivo &ndash; the first immuno-oncology combination regimen approved in the US in cancer &ndash; provides BMS an opportunity to regain ground for Yervoy.</p><p>Opdivo initially was approved in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">December 2014</a> as a single agent in patients with disease progression following Yervoy and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</p><p>Both drugs, however, are fighting off competition from Merck & Co.'s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">Keytruda</a> (pembrolizumab).</p><p>Yervoy is a human antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen, which is believed to play a role in slowing down or turning off the body's immune system, which affects its ability to fight off cancerous cells.</p><p>Yervoy may work by allowing the body&rsquo;s immune system to recognize, target and attack cells in melanoma tumors, according to the FDA.</p><p>FDA's Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, said the new use of Yervoy is for patients at high risk of developing recurrence of melanoma after surgery, and "builds on our understanding of the immune system&rsquo;s interaction with cancer."</p><p>Resectable, stage III melanoma represents 5%, or about 3,100 cases, of all new melanoma cases diagnosed annually, BMS noted. </p><p>"This stage of melanoma can be aggressive, with a 60% risk of recurrence after surgery," the company pointed out, insisting that despite the risk of disease recurrence among stage III patients following resection, there are limited treatment options available to help reduce the risk of recurrence after surgery.</p><p>The new approval of Yervoy was based on data from a Phase III trial, known as CA184-029, which was a cooperative group study initiated in 2008 by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.</p><p>The trial demonstrated Yervoy at the 10 mg/kg dosage significantly improved recurrence-free survival (RFS), versus placebo, with a 25% reduction in the risk of recurrence or death. </p><p>The median RFS was 26 months for Yervoy, versus 17 months for placebo.</p><p>BMS said it was working with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group in conducting an ongoing study to investigate other dosing options for Yervoy in the adjuvant setting.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
