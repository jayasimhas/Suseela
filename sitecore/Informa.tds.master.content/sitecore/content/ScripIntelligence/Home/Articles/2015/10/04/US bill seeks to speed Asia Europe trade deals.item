<p>House and Senate committee leaders on 16 April introduced legislation that could help President Barack Obama more quickly clinch free-trade deals with Asia-Pacific nations and Europe.</p><p>With trade promotion authority (TPA), the US president would have the power to negotiate international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals.</p><p>The US is close to wrapping up the final terms of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Break-logjam-on-Asia-Pacific-trade-pact-354960" target="_new">TPP</a> with 11 Asia-Pacific nations: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.</p><p>US Trade Representative Michael Froman <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-officials-pound-drum-harder-in-trade-agenda-pursuit-357755" target="_new">last week</a> pointed out that the TPP covers nearly 40% of the global economy, with some of the fastest growing markets in the world.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/USEU-trade-investment-big-deal-pact-could-serve-biopharma-well-339997" target="_new">TTIP</a> involves ongoing talks between the US and 28 member countries of the European Union.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization have supported both trade deals.</p><p>The bipartisan, bicameral TPA bills, dubbed the <i>Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015</i>, were introduced in the Senate by Senators Orrin Hatch (Republican-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Ron Wyden (Democrat-Oregon), the ranking member, and in the House by Representative Paul Ryan (Republican-Wisconsin), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.</p><p>The TPA legislation outlines what the executive branch &ndash; whether Democrat or Republican &ndash; must do when entering into and conducting trade talks with foreign countries while also increasing transparency by requiring that Congress have access to important information surrounding pending trade deals and that the public receive detailed updates and see the full details of trade agreements well before they are signed, the authors of the House and Senate bills said. </p><p>"It's no secret that past trade deals haven't always lived up to their promise, and that's why I will only sign my name to an agreement that helps ordinary Americans get ahead," President Obama said. "At the same time, at a moment when 95% of our potential customers live outside our borders, we must make sure that we, and not countries like China, are writing the rules for the global economy."</p><p>"The world is not standing still. Passage of this trade framework will allow us to negotiate modern trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific and with Europe that will open up new markets, ensure fairness for our businesses and workers, and put more American workers in high paying jobs," said US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker.</p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the TPA bill includes specific Congressional guidance for public health priorities, "including striking a balance between promoting innovation and ensuring access to medicines around the globe." </p><p>But several Democrats are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-faces-more-trade-pushback-from-Dems-356352" target="_new">objecting</a> to the TPA &ndash; concerned President Obama's trade negotiators are going down the wrong path with the TPP and TTIP. </p><p>The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen also is among the groups opposing the TPA legislation &ndash; insisting it would "delegate away Congress' constitutional trade authority and give blank-check powers to whoever may be president during the next three to six years for any agreements he or she may pursue."</p><p>Public Citizen has especially criticized the TPP &ndash; arguing it actually would impede access to affordable medicines.</p><p>One proposal the group is objecting to is the creation of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">investor-state dispute settlement tribunals</a>, which Public Citizen asserted would allow biopharmaceutical companies to demand cash compensation for claimed violations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules about the creation, limitation or revocation of intellectual property rights.</p><p>But a USTR spokesman told <i>Scrip</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-officials-pound-drum-harder-in-trade-agenda-pursuit-357755" target="_new">earlier this month</a> that Public Citizen was wrong about the relationship between the investment rules and IP rights in the TPP agreement. </p><p>He insisted the relevant investment rules don't require governments to compensate IP rights holders for any breach of WTO commitments. </p><p>Instead, he said, the language provides that specific requirements for compensation won't apply where governments take certain WTO-consistent IP measures.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
