<p><p>Shares of Cellular Biomedicine jumped 15% on news that the company's early-stage immunotherapy is performing well in patients. </p><p>The biotech presented data from a Phase I trial of its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with CD-30 positive Hodgkin's lymphoma at the annual World Stem Cells & Regenerative Medicine Congress in London. </p><p>The data presented showed that five out of seven patients responded to treatment. Patients in the trial had advanced cancer and had relapsed despite treatment with standard-of-care. Patients in the study were either stage III or stage IV and had heavy treatment history, with an average of 16 prior treatments and multiple tumor lesions. </p><p>During the study, patients received an escalating dose of the CAR-directed T-cell therapy for three to five days. Two out of seven patients in the trial achieved a partial response and three patients reached stable disease. This meant that there was an objective response rate of 28.6% and an overall disease control rate of 71.4%. </p><p>"We previously announced positive clinical data from our Phase I clinical trials for CD19 and CD20 constructs and expect to announce clinical data from our EGFR-HER1-positive advanced lung cancer trial in the third quarter of this year," said Cellular Biomedicine CEO Dr William Cao. </p><p>Shares of the company gained 15.5%, adding $4.80, to trade at $36.37. </p><p>The CAR-T space has had plenty of buzz over the last few years as big pharma has jumped into the immuno-oncology race. Novartis has become the key player in the CAR-T space, but several biotechs, including Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics, have strong contenders of their own. </p><p>Dose-related safety issues have been a factor with these therapies, but the companies have been looking for ways around it due to the strong efficacy of the compounds. </p><p><p>
