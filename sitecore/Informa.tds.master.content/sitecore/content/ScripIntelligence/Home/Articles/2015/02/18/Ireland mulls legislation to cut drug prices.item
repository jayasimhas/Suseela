<p>Ireland needs to make savings on drug spending if patients are to access new and innovative drugs. Authorities will consider using existing legislation to make savings if talks with the pharmaceutical industry fail, the Department of Health told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The problem goes back to the 2012 agreement signed between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA, the pharmaceutical industry association), the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE). This three-year agreement based new medicine prices in Ireland on the average price in nine EU states (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Finland and Austria.) The deal was designed to save the state more than &euro;400m in savings, with the caveat that the state would invest &euro;210m of those savings into providing innovative new drugs over three years.</p><p>However, Ireland's investment in new drugs is likely to exceed the earmarked &euro;210m and further savings are required, said the department. It added that talks between the department, the HSE and the IPHA have so far yielded no results and that although negotiations with industry were its preference, it would use legislation to make the savings if necessary. The 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act gives the HSE powers to review and alter prices.</p><p>Meanwhile, according to an IPHA spokesman, a "mid-term" review of the agreement is underway. He said the review only allows for discussions on governance and operation of the agreement, not price cuts. </p><p>The association added that companies are likely to deliver beyond the agreed amount of and that the state had also saved through a new generic substitution law that came into force in 2013. In addition, the state saved some &euro;800m through nine separate price cuts between 2006 and 2012.</p><p>The 2012 agreement expires in November and discussions on a new agreement between the three parties are due later this year.</p><p>
