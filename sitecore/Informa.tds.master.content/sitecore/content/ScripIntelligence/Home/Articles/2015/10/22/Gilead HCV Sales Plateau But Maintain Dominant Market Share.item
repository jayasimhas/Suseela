<p>Gilead Sciences Inc. continues to bring in blockbuster revenues on sofosbuvir-based hepatitis C regimens and to maintain a dominant market share in that space, but HCV product sales leveled off from the second quarter due to several factors, the company reported during its third quarter earnings call on Oct. 27.</p><p>Continuing a trend seen in the second quarter, US sales of <i>Harvoni</i> (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) flattened during the third quarter due to lowering patient start totals, which Paul Carter, executive vice president of commercial operations, attributed partly to the flow of warehoused patients gradually being exhausted.</p><p>In general, he said Gilead is seeing a reduction in commercial prescriptions for its HCV drugs, also including <i>Sovaldi</i> (sofosbuvir), but non-commercial use is rising, thanks mainly to increased treatment levels in the Veterans Affairs health care system. US sales <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Harvoni-US-sales-dip-reflects-progress-in-treating-sickest-patients-Gilead-says-359661" target="_new">decreased during the second quarter</a>, while ex-US sales increased, but Gilead's HCV franchise <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-Details-Its-HCV-Dominance-As-AbbVie-Seeks-Meaningful-Market-Position-359783" target="_new">maintained a huge lead</a> over AbbVie Inc.'s <i>Viekira Pak</i> (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir).</p><p>In Europe, Gilead is benefiting from a healthy launch curve in more recently initiated markets such as Spain and Italy, while Germany is flattening out, following the trend seen in the US. Going into 2016, Gilead expects to see fluctuating HCV sales in various EU markets, but those numbers will be driven more by budgetary constraints than by the need for treatment, Carter said.</p><p>For the quarter, Gilead posted total product sales of $8.2bn, up slightly from $8.1bn in the second quarter. This is reflected in a slight decline in overall HCV product sales, $4.8bn compared to $4.9bn in the prior quarter. Harvoni sales dropped about $300m on the quarter, from $3.6bn to $3.3bn, while Sovaldi, which has trended downward sharply since the approval of Harvoni, was up from $1.3bn to $1.5bn.</p><p>Overall, Carter said, Gilead is maintaining greater than a 90% market share globally in HCV product sales.</p><p>Gilead attributes the quarterly increase in Sovaldi sales to uptake in Japan, where the polymerase inhibitor was launched on May 25. Harvoni, a fixed-dose combination pill that includes an NS5A inhibitor, only launched in that country on Sept. 1.</p><p>Patient starts on Gilead HCV regimens totaled 58,000 in the US during the third quarter, down slightly from about 60,000 in the second quarter. However, Gilead saw a sharper decline in the second quarter compared to the first, when there were about 70,000 therapeutic starts in the US.</p><p>"We saw an unusually large number of patient starts in the US in the first quarter of this year, which reflected many warehoused patients," Carter said. "It is clear that the number of warehoused patients is now diminished. We anticipate that the rate at which new patients start treatment at the end of this year may be more indicative of the pace of new patient starts in 2016."</p><p>The company noted that year-over-year growth for its HCV drugs is strong, up 67% in the US. The $869m in sales posted during the third quarter in Europe (still driven partly by Sovaldi as Harvoni has not yet launched in all major markets) amounted to a 60% year-over-year increase. Harvoni was up from $20m to $532m year-over-year in Europe, while Sovaldi sales declined 36% but still reached $337m, compared with $523m one year before.</p><p><p>This story has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
