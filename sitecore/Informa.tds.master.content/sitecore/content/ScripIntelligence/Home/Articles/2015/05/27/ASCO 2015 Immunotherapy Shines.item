<p><p>Three days into the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, there have been hundreds of data presentations, but a few have stuck out. The stand-outs come from across therapeutic categories and range from the hot area of immunotherapy to already-marketed products. </p><h2>BMS changes the landscape</h2><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb had a variety of data presentations at the conference, but its Checkmate-057 data caused quite a stir. The company's stock sold off when the late-breaking abstract was first released on 29 May due to the overall survival benefit only being seen in PD-L1 positive patients, but the full data presentation the following day has got analysts raving about the potential of Opdivo (nivolumab) in second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p>The Phase III study of 582 previously-treated NSCLC patients showed that Opdivo was associated with a 27% reduction in the risk of progression or death compared with standard-of-care chemotherapy docetaxel. The drug compared with chemotherapy showed the best overall survival benefit &ndash; virtually double &ndash; in patients with greater than or equal to 10% PD-L1 expression (19.4 months vs 8.0 months).</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><p>Median Overall Survival Benefit by PD-L1 Expression</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Level of Expression</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Opdivo</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>docetaxel</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>? 1% </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>17.2 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>9.0 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10.4 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10.1 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>? 5%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>18.2 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>8.1 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>9.7 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10.1 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>? 10%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>19.4 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>8.0 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>9.9 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10.3 months</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>"The CheckMate -057 results represent progress toward establishing a new standard of care that may replace docetaxel in PD-L1 expressers," said Dr Luis Paz-Ares of the Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre. </p><p>Opdivo demonstrated a superior objective response rate (ORR) of 19% vs 12% for docetaxel (P = 0.0246). The median duration of response for Opdivo was 17.2 months vs 5.6 months for chemotherapy and median time to response of 2.1 months vs. 2.6 months, respectively.</p><p>The way the experts see it, is that the PD-L1 biomarker may not be the best indication of whether a therapy works &ndash; note that those patients taking Opdivo who had only 1% expression of the PD-L1 gene showed an OS benefit of 17.4 months compared with 9.0 months for docetaxel. </p><p>"It is clear that PD-L1 as a biomarker has too many issues at this point in time to be used to determine who should or should not be given PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Even with similar overall survival data, we now believe a longer duration of response and superior safety profile should drive even PD-L1 negative patients onto nivolumab following FDA approval later this year," wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. </p><p>BMS also presented late-stage data from the Checkmate-067 trial in patients with melanoma. The study tested Opdivo in combination with BMS' older immunotherapy Yervoy (ipilimumab) compared with monotherapy treatment with either Opdivo or Yervoy. </p><p>Analysts called the data "extremely encouraging," but are interested in seeing the mature overall survival data &ndash; which aren't available yet. Median progression-free survival was 11.5 months for the combo and 6.9 months for Opdivo monotherapy, vs 2.9 months for Yervoy monotherapy. The combo had a 58% reduction in the risk of disease progression vs Yervoy, while Opdivo monotherapy demonstrated a 43% risk reduction compared with Yervoy alone. </p><p>"However, it remains to be determined if the benefit of the combo vs Opdivo alone applies to both PD-L1+/- patients. The ORR data says yes but the PFS data says the combo is equivalent to single agent on efficacy," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin. </p><h2>The competitor</h2><p>Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) created its fair share of buzz at ASCO as well. The study that stood out to the experts was a Phase II trial that studied the PD-1 inhibitor in 48 patients with heavily pretreated colorectal cancer. The trial stood out because it studied the correlation between immunotherapy benefit and DNA mismatch repair deficiency, a genetic instability in some cancers that is caused by a disruption of the MMR pathway. </p><p>While PFS and OS data were not yet available, the ORR was 62% in those patients with a disease control rate of 92% that had the deficiency compared with no responses for those patients whose tumors were MMR-proficient. The MMR-proficient patients had a median PFS of 2.3 months and an OS of 7.6 months. </p><p>The positive results have prompted Merck to launch another Phase II trial, KEYNOTE-164, in MMR-deficient patients to further test the hypothesis. </p><p>Analysts had a lot to say about this trial: "MRK&rsquo;s data on mismatch repair in colon cancer indicate potential for activity of other biomarkers," wrote Rubin. </p><p>While Divan wrote, "Summing up the various tumor types in which 4-5% of patients have MMR </p><p>deficiency, we now see an additional 27,000 patients annually in the US alone who are likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 therapy over time. Simply assuming a $100,000 per patient per year cost of therapy, this could potentially mean an additional ~$2.7 billion market opportunity in these specific patients."</p><h2>A new SOC</h2><p>Johnson & Johnson and AbbVie's Imbruvica (ibrutinib) is another drug that analysts and experts are saying should be a new standard of care (SOC). In the Phase III HELIOS study, Imbruvica plus SOC was compared with SOC (Treanda+Rituxan) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). </p><p>In March, the companies announced that an independent data monitoring committee recommended that the trial be unblended early and that patients in the SOC alone arm be switched to Imbruvica. </p><p>At the time that the trial was unblended, the PFS rate was 79% in the Imbruvica group and only 24% in the SOC arm. Meanwhile, the median overall survival was not reached in the Imbruvica patients vs 13.3 months. The safety profile was consistent across both groups. </p><p>"The OS data is not yet mature and will be confounded by the 90 patients in the control arm who crossed over to ibrutinib after progressing. Overall, the discussant said this should clearly be the new standard of care," noted Divan. </p><p>For AbbVie, this data will help drive a growing oncology franchise. The company has expectations of peak sales of $7bn for Imbruvica and the strong data further validates the $21bn price tag that AbbVie is paying to acquire Pharmacyclics. </p><p><p><p>
