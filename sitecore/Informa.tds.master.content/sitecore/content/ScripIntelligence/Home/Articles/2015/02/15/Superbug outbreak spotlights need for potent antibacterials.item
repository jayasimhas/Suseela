<p>An outbreak at a California hospital that could potentially turn out to be the largest involving what's been called the "nightmare" superbug, carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (CRE), has put the spotlight once again on the need for more resources to fight antimicrobial resistance and the development of new antibiotics.</p><p>At least two patient deaths have been linked to the outbreak at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles, with seven other patients confirmed as being infected with CRE after undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures using a duodenoscope, which is a flexible, lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth, throat, stomach and into the top of the small intestine. </p><p>The UCLA Health System said it has notified 179 patients they may have been infected with CRE during the endoscopic procedures, which took place between October 2014 and January 2015.</p><p>UCLA said it sterilized its duodenoscopes according to the standards stipulated by the manufacturer. But an internal investigation determined that CRE bacteria may have been transmitted during the ERCP procedures, which are conducted to diagnose and treat pancreaticobiliary diseases.</p><p>The Los Angeles County Health Department determined the recommended cleaning procedures do not eradicate CRE from the devices.</p><p>The FDA reacted by issuing a <i>MedWatch</i> alert on 19 February to raise awareness the complex design of the duodenoscopes may impede effectiveness of the multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize the reusable devices. </p><p>The FDA said it received 75 reports involving 135 patients in the US related to possible microbial transmission from reprocessed duodenoscopes from January 2013 through December 2014.</p><p>Regulators said the number of actual infections could be higher, since it's possible not all cases were reported. </p><p>The FDA recommended healthcare facilities using duodenoscopes to consider taking the devices out of service until they have been verified to be free of pathogens if a patient develops an infection with a multidrug-resistant organism following ERCP.</p><p>UCLA said it has removed from service the two scopes linked to the CRE infections at its facility. The hospital said it is now using a decontamination process that "goes above and beyond manufacturer and national standards."</p><p>In September 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classified CRE as an "urgent threat," warning that "untreatable" and hard-to-treat infections from the resistant bacteria were on the rise among patients in medical facilities &ndash; with the pathogen resistant to nearly all the available antibiotics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-Antibiotic-resistance-emptying-the-medicine-cabinet-346608" target="_new">September 2013</a>).</p><p>"CRE is the nightmare bacteria" CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said during 16 September 2013 media briefing.</p><p>Every year, more than 9,000 healthcare-associated infections are caused by CRE, with the CDC identifying at least one type of the microbe in healthcare facilities in 44 states. </p><p>Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream infections from CRE bacteria die from the infection, according to the CDC.</p><p>Each year, about 600 deaths result from infections caused by the two most common types of CREs &ndash; carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella</i> and carbapenem-resistant <i>E coli</i>.</p><p>"I think we are going to continue to see more of these infections," Guy Macdonald, president and CEO of Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>And, he lamented, "We are reaching a new reality now where antibiotics developing resistance is just a question of when."</p><p>Tetraphase is among the companies developing new antibiotics aimed at treating Gram-negative bacteria, like CREs, including carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella</i> and carbapenem-resistant <i>E coli</i>.</p><p>The firm's lead antibiotic, eravacycline, currently is in Phase III development, with Tetraphase reporting results this past December from one of its late-stage studies, known as IGNITE 1, which demonstrated eravacycline was as effective as Merck's ertapenem in treating complicated intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Tetraphases-antibiotic-as-good-as-Mercks-in-Phase-III-355735" target="_new">18 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Macdonald said eravacycline currently is in a second Phase III trial testing the drug as a treatment for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). </p><p>He said the company expects to have data from the second trial by midyear, with plans to file a new drug application with the FDA before the end of 2015.</p><p>Eravacycline could potentially compete with Actavis&rsquo; ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI), which is awaiting a decision from the FDA, which set 23 February as the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date.</p><p>This past December, the FDA&rsquo;s Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee (AIDAC) voted 11-1 that Actavis, which is partnered with AstraZeneca, demonstrated substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of CAZ-AVI to treat cIAI when limited or no alternative treatments are available (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-backs-2-uses-snubs-1-for-Actavis-antibiotic-355470" target="_new">6 December 2014</a>).</p><p>The AIDAC also voted 9-3 Actavis had demonstrated substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the antibiotic combo to treat cUTI, including pyelonephritis, when limited or no alternative treatments are available.</p><p>But for a third indication &ndash; aerobic Gram-negative infections, including hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and bacteremia, when limited or no alternative treatments are available &ndash; the AIDAC was unanimous in rejecting that use.</p><p><b>Incentives</b></p><p>Tetraphase&rsquo;s Mr Macdonald said eravacycline has benefited by being one of the earliest drugs &ndash; if not the first &ndash; to gain the FDA's qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation, which the agency bestowed the experimental antibiotic in July 2013 for the cIAI and cUTI indications (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-infectious-disease-designation-for-eravacycline-boosts-Tetraphase-344996" target="_new">15 July 2013</a>).</p><p>Antibiotics granted the QIDP designation are eligible for a special priority review and fast-track status, which permits a company to use a rolling application with each piece submitted to the FDA as it is completed &ndash; accelerating the process. </p><p>They also are eligible for an additional five years of market exclusivity if they win US approval.</p><p>QIDP was one of the measures created under the <i>Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now</i> provision of the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i>, signed into law by President Barack Obama on 9 July 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">10 July 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-more-cha-ching-will-PDUFA-V-satisfy-on-the-ba-bling-332986" target="_new">19 July 2012</a>).</p><p>To date, the FDA has granted the QIDP designation at least 68 times to 46 unique molecular entities.</p><p>But Mr Macdonald said more incentives are needed to entice more companies into the antibacterial space.</p><p>The Tetraphase chief said he has high hopes for the provisions included in the 21st Century Cures draft legislative package, which is still being tinkered with, aimed at giving antibiotic makers a break and streamlining the regulatory process (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>In his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $1.2bn to help battle the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance &ndash; calling on lawmakers to double the nation's current investment (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The president called for $100m in new funds for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the development of new antibiotic therapies and diagnostics.</p><p>While the "renewed relationship and focus at the FDA" has helped advance antimicrobial R&D &ndash; with the agency approving novel products last year from Merck/ Cubist, The Medicines Co and Actavis/Durata Therapeutics that held QIDP status &ndash; now there's a need for Congress to work on the reimbursement side, Mr Macdonald said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cubist-wins-FDA-nod-for-antibiotic-Zerbaxa-355772" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medicines-single-dose-ABSSSI-drug-Orbactiv-OKd-353227" target="_new">7 August 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Cubists-Sivextro-another-antibiotic-GAIN-352461" target="_new">20 June 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/APPROVED-Duratas-Dalvance-1st-QIDP-antibiotic-OKd-for-US-market-351986" target="_new">23 May 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
