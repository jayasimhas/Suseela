<p>Novartis has filed new drug applications (NDAs) for two chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) drugs: QVA149 (indacaterol/glycopyrronium bromide) and NVA237 (glycopyrronium bromide).</p><p>According to Datamonitor Healthcare, QVA149 (which is already marketed in Europe as Ultibro Breezhaler) has a peak US sales forecast in 2020 of $259m for COPD. If approved, it will compete with GlaxoSmithKline's Anoro (umeclidinium/vilanterol). </p><p>NVA327 (Seebri Breezhaler) has a peak US sales forecast in 2020 of $192m for COPD. If approved, its main competitor will be Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva. </p><p>The filings included pivotal Phase III data that the Swiss pharma has also provided further detail on. </p><p>The FLIGHT 1 and 2 studies met their primary objectives with twice-daily QVA149 demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (FEV1 AUC0-12) at week 12, compared to indacaterol and glycopyrronium bromide in moderate-to-severe COPD patients. Improvements in overall health status, a secondary endpoint based on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, and rescue medication usage were also seen with QVA149 compared to placebo at Week 12. The common adverse events reported for QVA149 were comparable to the individual components and placebo across the EXPEDITION studies. </p><p>In the GEM 1 and 2 studies, twice-daily NVA237 demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in lung function (FEV1 AUC0-12h) at Week 12 in moderate-to-severe COPD patients compared to placebo; meeting its primary objective. An improvement in health status was also observed in patients at Week 12. The adverse events reported for NVA237 were comparable to placebo across the GEM studies. Data from the EXPEDITION and GEM programs are expected to be presented at major medical congresses later this year.</p><p>The Novartis COPD portfolio also includes Onbrez Breezhaler/Arcapta Neohaler (indacaterol inhalation powder). Glycopyrronium bromide was exclusively licensed to Novartis in April 2005 by Vectura and its co-development partner Sosei. </p><p>GSK has been struggling with commercializing its US respiratory portfolio. Attempts to boosts revenues with newer drugs such as Anoro to fight off generic competition to best-seller Advair did not quite go to plan in 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-climbs-as-revitalization-plan-revealed-354614" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 October 2014</a>).</p>
