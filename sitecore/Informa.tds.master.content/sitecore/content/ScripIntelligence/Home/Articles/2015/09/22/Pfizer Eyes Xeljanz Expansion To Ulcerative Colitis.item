<p>Pfizer Inc. released positive Phase III data from two induction trials testing its oral Janus kinase inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib) in patients with the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis, but the company will await the results of another Phase III maintenance study before filing for an indication expansion. </p><p>The company announced the top-line results from the first two trials Sept. 21.</p><p>The two identical trials, OCTAVE Induction 1 and OCTAVE Induction 2, met their primary endpoints, measured by the proportion of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis receiving tofacitinib 10 mg in remission at Week 8 compared to patients receiving placebo. OCTAVE 1 enrolled 498 patients and OCTAVE 2 enrolled 541.</p><p>No new or unexpected safety issues were observed in the study, Pfizer said, which is important given that Xeljanz is already associated with serious risks, including infections, cancer and stomach tears. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, Pfizer said.</p><p>The Phase III program in ulcerative colitis also includes the maintenance study OCTAVE SUSTAIN, which will evaluate remission rates at 52 weeks as the primary outcome. Data from that trial are expected at the end of 2016. An open-label extension trial, OCTAVE Extend, is also running. The four studies will form the basis of a submission package to regulatory authorities for a potential indication expansion, according to Pfizer.</p><p>Xeljanz was approved in November 2012 as the first oral next-generation disease-modifying drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. But sales have remained relatively sluggish, partly because of the safety concerns, for the first oral drug competing in a multi-billion dollar therapeutic area dominated by injectables. </p><p>Xeljanz generated sales of $308m in 2014, a 170% increase over sales in 2013. The company is hoping to grow sales of the drug through indication expansion. An sNDA for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses of tofacitinib is pending at FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, with an October PDUFA date. Xeljanz failed to demonstrate non-inferiority to Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel (etanercept) at the lower 5 mg dose in the first Phase III studies in plaque psoriasis.</p><p>The existing market leaders in the area, like Enbrel, AbbVie Inc.'s Humira (adalimumab) and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (infliximab) grew into blockbusters by expanding into multiple indications, including psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. </p><p>The safety profile of those tumour necrosis factor inhibitors is well understood, however, and they are deeply entrenched in the market. Adding to the long-term challenges for Xeljanz is that competition in the therapeutic area is expected to intensify if and when the first biosimilar anti-TNFs reach the market. Biosimilar versions of Remicade are already available in Europe.</p><p>Galapagos NV, meanwhile, is advancing a JAK1 inhibitor, filgotinib, that it believes is more selective than other JAK inhibitors and could therefore avoid some of the serious side effects associated with less targeted approaches. AbbVie owns an option to acquire the program, with a decision expected soon following Galapagos' completion in August of the Phase II studies required under the arrangement. </p><p>Galapagos is also studying a once-daily version of filgotinib, but Pfizer is looking to bring a once-daily version of tofacitinib to market first. The company filed an NDA for a once-daily version in July with a user fee goal date in February 2016.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
