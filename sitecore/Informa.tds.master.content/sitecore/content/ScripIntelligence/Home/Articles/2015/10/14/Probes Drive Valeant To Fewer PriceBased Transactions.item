<p>Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. on Oct. 19 said the "turmoil" over its practices of buying up companies with older drugs and raising their prices has driven the company to change its strategy to seek fewer transactions focused on what it called "mispriced products."</p><p>CEO Michael Pearson asserted the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole has been "aggressively sort of attacked for past pricing actions" and said he believed that given the current environment, all companies would turn to "more modest" pricing of their medicines in the future.</p><p>Valeant officials said the company expected to have low single-digit price increases for 2016 and beyond.</p><p>During a conference call with investors and analysts, officials said that while Valeant's focus would remain on high-growth markets &ndash; therapeutics areas and geographies, durable assets, concentrated specialist populations, segments where physician education matters, consumer pay and commercial insurance reimbursement &ndash; pricing would become a less important part of the firm's growth, while research and development activities, specifically with its dermatology, eye care and gastrointestinal businesses, would be broadened.</p><p>One business the company is looking to spin off or even sell, however, is its neurology unit, said Robert Rosiello, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Valeant. He said the firm also is considering doing the same with other portions of the company &ndash; areas he said were not core to the business or its strategy.</p><p>Last week, Valeant <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">received subpoenas</a> from federal prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York seeking information about the company's pricing decisions.</p><p>"The company intends to cooperate in the investigations," Rosiello said. "Like other critical areas, we take both compliance and legal compliance seriously." </p><p>Officials declined during the call to provide any other information about the probe, including whether Valeant had sought the help of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or the Biotechnology Industry Organization, on how to handle the matter.</p><p>Rosiello pointed out, however, the company recently concluded a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, which stemmed from conspiracy and kickback charges involving Biovail Corp., which acquired Valeant in 2010.</p><p>Before prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts opened their probe, Valeant already was being <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">investigated</a> by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) over the spike in the prices of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) and Isuprel (isoprenaline) &ndash; which rocketed from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, respectively &ndash; after the company acquired the medicines from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February.</p><p>Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) also had been highly critical of Valeant's price increases of the drugs&ndash; declaring at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">July 30 hearing</a> the matter needed to be investigated by Congress. She followed up with a letter to the firm late last month &ndash; condemning Valeant for failing to provide an explanation for its "dramatic increases" in the price of Isuprel and Nitropress. </p><p>Rosiello noted during the call that Valeant had responded last week to McCaskill's questions and also told her the company was beginning an outreach to hospitals "where the impact of our price change was significantly greater than average."</p><p>Valeant, which recently just got into the hospital business, does not rely on group purchasing organizations for that customer base and instead wants to directly contract with the facilities, so the firm can avoid selling its products through distributors, "which will save us money and we can pass along those savings," Rosiello told investors and analysts during the company's quarterly earnings call. He asserted there had been several research reports that contributed to the "overall misinformation about our pricing."</p><p>Rosiello took particular aim at a recent report from Deutsche Bank, which said Valeant had raised prices on 56 of its 69 products &ndash; representing 81% of the firm's portfolio &ndash; with an average price increase of 66% on each of those products.</p><p>But, he said, "in reality, we increased prices on 85 of our 156 branded pharmaceutical products, or 54%," with an average gross price increase of 36% and a realized price increase of 24%.</p><p>"We've priced our products to appeal to the middle class and the vast majority of our business is consumer cash pay," Pearson declared.</p><p>While Valeant has historically provided qualitative disclosure on its full portfolio, going forward, Rosiello said the firm would provide quantitative price volume disclosures.</p><p>Valeant officials provided more details about the firm's relationship with specialty pharmacies &ndash; a topic Rosiello said the company has shied away from openly discussing because of its competitive nature.</p><p>But, he said, "given all the incorrect assertions by some," Valeant felt compelled to provide more information.</p><p>"Similar to many pharmaceutical companies in the US, an increasing percentage of our revenue is coming from products dispensed through multiple specialty pharmacies," Rosiello said. "We find specialty pharmacies improve patients' access to medicines at an affordable price and help ensure physicians are able to prescribe the medications, they believe most appropriate for their patients."</p><p>Rosiello insisted Valeant's distribution is "not designed to restrict access to our products."</p><p>"I want to clearly state that all of Valeant's drugs are available to all patients," he said, adding that most of the firm's US pharmaceutical products are available through the big three distributors.</p><p>During the earnings call, Valeant reported a 36% increase in revenue from a year earlier at about $2.8bn, although its profits fell from $275.4bn, or 81 cents per share, to $49.5m, or 14 cents, for the quarter.</p><p>Shares of Valeant fell as low as 10% on Oct. 19, before closing at $163.83, down $13.73, or 7.7%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
