<p> In a surprise development, Merck KGaA has decided to file for approval of cladribine, the oral multiple sclerosis medicine it suspended in late-stage trials more than four years ago. It now says that, having evaluated new data and done additional analyses of the product's benefit-risk profile, it will file for approval in Europe in the first half of 2016, and that it is developing plans for filings in other markets. </p><p> Nevertheless, the drug looks like an also-ran in a highly competitive field, and the fact that it is Merck's best hope to protect its once-mighty MS franchise merely draws attention once again to the company's failure to produce a suitable successor to <i>Rebif</i> (interferon beta-1a). </p><p> The German firm apparently gave up on the candidate for relapsing-remitting MS after the regulators in the US and EU raised concerns about its potential to cause cancer. It <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-Serono-believes-Cladribine-was-victim-of-regulatory-stigma-311558">withdrew its application for a centralized marketing authorization in Europe</a> in February 2011, and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-Serono-ditches-cladribine-leaving-MS-franchise-exposed-317516">pulled the plug on its US application</a> with the FDA in June 2011. </p><p> However, shortly before withdrawing its application from the European Medicines Agency, a company executive had told <i>Scrip</i> that the drug had been the victim of &quot;regulatory stigma&quot; and maintained faith in the firm's ability to take the molecule forward. </p><p> It would appear that the decision to refile was based partly on the undisclosed safety and efficacy data from trials that had been ongoing, namely CLARITY Extension, ORACLE MS and ONWARD, as well as from the PREMIERE long-term safety registry of patients who have participated in cladribine trials, and partly on the changing attitudes of regulators. Since the drug's filing was pulled, the EMA and the FDA have been approving more drugs, approving them faster, and finding more nuanced pathways to approach risk-benefit assessment and clinical evidence. </p><p> A third reason for Merck KGaA's decision was pressure from the scientific community: a company spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i> that it had been encouraged to refile by neurology experts. It would seem this was informed mainly by the need to offer MS patients a diverse range of options, rather than by any particularly outstanding characteristic of the drug itself. </p><p> &quot;This decision is very positive for patients with multiple sclerosis because tailoring treatment to their individual needs is a key strategy for optimizing their care,&quot; commented Professor Giancarlo Comi, director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology (INSPE) and of the department of neurology at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy. &quot;While the options available to treating neurologists have grown over the years, Cladribine Tablets have the potential to offer a truly innovative addition to the armamentarium physicians have at their disposal to treat their patients.&quot; </p><p> Cladribine's commercial prospects are difficult to judge without knowing the evidence from the latest trials, which Merck has yet to publish, but given the prior concerns that it may cause cancer, coupled with high level of competitiveness in the market (it will compete with oral heavyweights like Biogen's <i>Tecfidera</i> (dimethyl fumarate) and Novartis's <i>Gilenya</i> (fingolimod), it is unlikely to become a star player in the market. External threats like the impending arrival of cheap generic competitors to Gilenya (which loses exclusivity in the US in 2019) should also be factored into its sales potential. </p><p> Assuming a first-half filing date in the EU, the product could potentially be launched in late 2016 or early 2017. Before cladribine's filings were withdrawn, the product had already been launched in Russia and Australia, and although it is no longer sold, the Australian authorization still stands so in theory it could be resurrected there fairly fast. Should it get a positive response in Europe, it would likely be filed in the US, too. </p><p> Merck KGaA is in a difficult position because its aging injectable MS blockbuster Rebif, which accounts for around a quarter of its healthcare revenues, is already in decline as the newer oral therapies erode its market. Last year the company <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-Serono-ditches-another-multiple-sclerosis-candidate-352377">dropped another MS candidate</a>, ONO-4641/ceralifimod, partnered with Japanese firm Ono Pharmaceutical, as it looked unlikely to be a competitive product given the advances in the space. </p><p> The company has previously said it would seek to license in development programs to flesh out its MS pipeline, but for now it is left with just M2736 (ATX MS 1467), a peptide vaccine licensed from Apitope Technology in a Phase IIa study in relapsing MS for which results are expected next year. </p> The company says it will publish data from the CLARITY Extension, ORACLE MS and ONWARD trials in peer reviewed manuscripts shortly.
