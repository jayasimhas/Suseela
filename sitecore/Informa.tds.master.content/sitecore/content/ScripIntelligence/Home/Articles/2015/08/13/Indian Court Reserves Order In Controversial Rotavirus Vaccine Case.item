<p>An Indian court has reserved judgement in a case on alleged safety signals concerning an indigenous oral rotavirus vaccine (Rotavac) developed through a unique public-private partnership in India.</p><p>The case follows a public interest litigation filed in the Delhi High Court by Jacob Puliyel, a pediatrician with St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi. </p><p>Puliyel, a member of India's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), had flagged concerns over the allegedly higher risk of intussusception that may potentially be associated with the Indian vaccine. </p><p>He had sought a court direction against further trials of the vaccine till full data from the earlier trials is made available. Puliyel had sought <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-rotavirus-vaccine-row-show-me-the-data-359617" target="_new">disaggregated data</a> on numbers of ultrasound-diagnosed intussusception among the vaccinated and the controls in the trial site in Vellore (in southern India) so that any potential risk may be calculated meaningfully. </p><p>At the hearing on Aug. 18, the Indian government is learnt to have strongly defended its position on not sharing the data. Legal sources told <i>Scrip</i> that the government indicated that the release of the data could potentially cause some alarm. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> could not immediately verify the exact terminology used by the government attorney in his arguments.</p><p>A news agency report said that the Additional Solicitor General, Sanjay Jain, who appeared for the government, argued that the WHO guidelines indicate that the results of the trials need to be disclosed, which had been done. These guidelines, though, are not binding and do not say that data has to be disclosed, the report referred the Additional Solicitor General as saying.</p><p>It would be interesting to see how the court views the case and whether it could potentially leave it to the NTAGI, the highest advisory board on immunization of the Government of India, to decide whether or not to seek the data.</p><p>Puliyel, in his the petition, claimed that he made repeated attempts requesting the then director and the principle investigator at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, Dr Gangadeep Kang, to disclose the data for the Vellore limb of the study but that was "neither provided to him as a member of NTAGI nor was the same disclosed to the public."</p><p>Puliyel suggests that he may look to the Supreme Court, should the High Court not see merit in his case.</p><p>"Data on human trials belong to the public domain. Researchers cannot decide what to disclose and what not to disclose. Especially as this is publically funded research," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Rotavac vaccine originated from an attenuated strain of rotavirus that was isolated from an Indian child at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi in 1985-86, and the project has involved <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Dollar-a-dose-rotavirus-vaccine-on-Indian-horizon-343209" target="_new">multiple partners</a> including India's Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the local firm Bharat Biotech, the US National Institutes of Health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Stanford University School of Medicine, and the non-governmental organization PATH. </p><h2>Subject Expert Committee</h2><p>Meanwhile, last month, an Indian Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on vaccines noted with reference to Rotavac, that as per the Brighton Criteria, overall the percentage of intussusception in the vaccine group was 0.28% (13/4532) and placebo group 0.26% (6/2267). </p><p>The difference is not "statistically significant," the minutes of the SEC's meeting on July.29, noted. </p><p>The SEC said that its opinion follows the examination and review of published data in the journal Vaccine and as per the details in a letter of Puliyel.</p><p>The SEC also noted that none of the events of intussusception required surgical interventions and none were fatal. </p><p>"Further review of data with respect to [the] site at Vellore with regard to intussusceptions may [be] undertaken, if required, based on observations of the High Court of Delhi, where matter is stated to be under trial," the SEC then said.</p><p>Puliyel and a colleague had, in a letter to the editor published in the peer reviewed journal Vaccine last year, noted that a surveillance study for intussusception in a Phase III efficacy trial of Rotavac suggests that there was an excess of 11 cases of intussusception per 10,000 vaccinated. This, he claimed, is nearly 70 times higher than the risk of intussusception with the current, internationally licensed vaccine, RotaTeq.</p>
