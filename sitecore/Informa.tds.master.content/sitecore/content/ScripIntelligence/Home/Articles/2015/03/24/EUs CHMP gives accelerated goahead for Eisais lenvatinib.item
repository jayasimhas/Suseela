<p>The EU's CHMP has recommended approval of Eisai's Lenvima (lenvatinib) for the treatment of adults with progressive, locally advanced or metastatic differentiated (papillary, follicular, Hürthle cell) thyroid carcinoma, whose disease has progressed despite receiving radioactive iodine.</p><p>Lenvima was reviewed under EMA's accelerated assessment programme, as it provides a new treatment option for these patients. It was granted orphan drug status for this indication in 2013. </p><p>The tyrosine kinase inhibitor was approved in its first market, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Eisais-thyroid-cancer-drug-Lenvima-OKd-for-US-market-356758" target="_new">the US, in February</a>, and has just received approval in Japan. To date, one tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Bayer/Onyx Pharmaceuticals' Nexavar (sorafenib), has been approved in the EU for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer in patients who no longer respond to treatment with radioactive iodine.</p><p>The positive opinion was based on the results of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Eisais-lenvatinib-to-follow-in-Nexavars-footsteps-349798" target="_new">the Phase III SELECT trial</a> in 392 patients with progressive differentiated thyroid cancer no longer responding to radioactive iodine, which showed that those treated with Lenvima lived on average 14.7 months longer without their disease progressing than patients on placebo.</p><p>The committee noted that a large proportion of people receiving Lenvima during the studies needed to reduce the dose or interrupt treatment because of side effects (mainly high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine). But overall it considered that Lenvima had a safety profile which is consistent with other similar therapies and that side effects were predictable and manageable. </p><p>However, the CHMP has requested a further study to investigate the most appropriate starting dose of Lenvima to optimise the benefits and reduce risks for patients who will be treated with the medicine.</p><p>Eisai says that levantinib is an oral molecular tri-specific targeted therapy that possesses a potent selectivity and a binding mode different to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). It simultaneously inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), RET, KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR). "This potentially makes lenvatinib the first TKI that simultaneously inhibits the kinase activities of FGFR 1-4 as well as VEGFR 1-3. In addition, lenvatinib was found to have a new Type V binding mode of kinase inhibition that is distinct from existing compounds," the company said.</p><p>Around 2,000 people in Europe have radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, Eisai says. </p><p>Lenvima is also awaiting approval in Switzerland, South Korea, Canada, Singapore, Russia, Australia and Brazil. Lenvima was granted orphan drug designation in Japan for thyroid cancer, in the US for treatment of follicular, medullary, anaplastic, and metastatic or locally advanced papillary thyroid cancer and in Europe for follicular and papillary thyroid cancer.</p><p>
