<p>Democratic presidential contenders former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) put drug makers among the candidates' enemies of which they are most proud to have, they admitted during the first of what is expected to be six debates.</p><p>Clinton also included the National Rifle Association, health insurers, "the Iranians" and "probably the Republicans" among her biggest enemies, while Sanders said Wall Street also was at the top of his list of "people who do not like me."</p><p>While both have taken shots at the biopharmaceutical industry in recent weeks &ndash; charges sparked by the nearly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">5,550% increase in the cost</a> to patients of Turing Pharmaceutical AG's toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine) &ndash; surprisingly, drug prices as an issue didn't come up at the Las Vegas debate, although Clinton, Sanders and the three other Democratic candidates have five other chances to argue the topic together.</p><p>At one point, Clinton brought up prescription drug companies in describing how she would distinguish herself from President Barack Obama &ndash; declaring she'd deal with the firms differently.</p><p>Sanders had more criticism of the biopharmaceutical industry when he insisted the "power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: 'Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.'"</p><p>Another issue that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Prices-Trade-Deal-Hot-For-1st-Democratic-Debate-361005" target="_new">expected</a> to be a hot topic at the Oct. 13 debate &ndash; the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) &ndash; actually also got very little air time.</p><p>Clinton tried to explain her initial support for the TPP by declaring that when she called it the "gold standard," that was something more that she'd "hoped it would be."</p><p>"It was just finally <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">negotiated last week</a>, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards," Clinton said.</p><p>"Our trade policies have cost us millions of decent jobs," Sanders asserted, in weighing briefly into the TPP issue, which in fact was never identified by name during the few times it came up.</p><p>The line that got the biggest applause of the night, by far, was Sanders' declaration to Clinton that "the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails."</p><p>"Let's talk about the real issues facing America," the senator declared. </p><p>And apparently, reforming drug prices &ndash; as many investors had feared &ndash; and the TPP were not among those in any big way at this debate.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
