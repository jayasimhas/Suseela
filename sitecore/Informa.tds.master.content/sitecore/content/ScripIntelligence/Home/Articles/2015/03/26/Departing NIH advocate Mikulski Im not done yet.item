<p>While Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat-Maryland) &ndash; one of the staunchest advocates in Congress for the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which both reside in her home state &ndash; said she may have turned a new page in her life by deciding not to seek another term in the Senate, she insisted she's "not ready to write the final chapter" on Capitol Hill.</p><p>"I have two years left in the Senate. Two years of appropriations cycles and budget cycles," she told a handful of reporters on 31 March at the NIH's $30m research lab run by its National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).</p><p>"I'm putting my shoulder to the wheel, my nose to the grindstone and my feet on the ground, hopefully without any orthopedic injuries, to do everything I can" to keep the NIH running, declared Senator Mikulski, who revealed on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-NIH-to-lose-key-advocate-with-Mikulski-retirement-357033" target="_new">2 March she planned to retire</a> from Congress after nearly 40 years. </p><p>The lawmaker said she was visiting the NCATS lab &ndash; where she observed the agency's robots conducting high-throughput screening and a demonstration of how experimental tissue chips are being engineered to represent units of human organs, with the ultimate aim of making drug development and toxicity screening more reliable &ndash; to learn more about what it does so she can take that information back to her colleagues at the Senate to convince them to lift the austere spending caps on the NIH's budget.</p><p>Ms Mikulski joined her fellow Maryland colleague, Senator Ben Cardin (Democrat), in February in introducing legislation, the <i>Accelerate Biomedical Research Act</i>, which she said would adjust the federal budget to prioritize funding for the NIH over the remaining six years of the <i>Budget Control Act</i> &ndash; the 2011 law that created the sequester. </p><p>The bill, she said, aims to negate the impact on the NIH of the across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, by increasing the agency's budget by an initial 10% for each of the first two years, or $3bn per year, and then by 6% each year thereafter until 2020. </p><p>It would grow the NIH's budget from $30bn to $45bn, Senator Mikulski said.</p><p>She noted President Barack Obama has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">asked Congress in February</a> to increase the NIH's budget for fiscal year 2016 by $1bn.</p><p>"Hats off to Barack Obama. But $1bn more is not enough," declared Senator Mikulski, who was one of the driving forces behind getting the NIH's budget doubled from $13.6bn to $27bn between FY 1998 to 2003.</p><p>She noted the NIH's budget is less than 10% of what is allotted for the US Department of Defense (DOD).</p><p>While Senator Mikulski said she supports defending the nation against predatory threats, like terrorists, she also insisted Americans need to be defended against threats like cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>She pointed to the discovery funded by the NIH that uncovered a potential new treatment for Alzheimer's &ndash; a drug that failed in cancer but is being repurposed for the dementia disease, AstraZeneca's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Failed-AstraZeneca-cancer-drug-provides-hope-for-Alzheimers-357609" target="_new">saracatinib</a> &ndash; as one justification as to why Congress needs to not only keep supporting the agency's work, but to significantly increase its budget.</p><p>"If we can crack the code in Alzheimer's, we can reduce the Medicaid budget by anywhere from 50% to 70%, and that would save us billions and billions and billions," Senator Mikulski said.</p><p>She said her strategy for getting her colleagues in Congress on board to do more than "lip service" to support the NIH is to insist that if spending caps are lifted for DOD, the same should be done for the nation's biomedical research agency, given the ability of its funded research to save lives. </p><p>"We can find common ground," Senator Mikulski said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
