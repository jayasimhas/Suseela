<p>Gilead Sciences reported that its full-year revenue more than doubled from $11.2bn in 2013 to $24.9bn in 2014 revenue, beating analyst consensus by $600m, but investors sent the company's stock lower in after-hours trading on 3 February when Gilead clarified the magnitude of impact that price discounts for its hepatitis C therapies will have on earnings in 2015. </p><p>Paul Carter, executive vice president of commercial operations, revealed during Gilead's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call that the company's gross-to-net adjustment for drugs that treat the hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be 46% in 2015 for US sales of Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) and Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) due to steep discounts negotiated with payers. Gilead fell 4.5% after hours to $102.35 per share even though the company expects the price cuts to drive higher sales volume.</p><p>"We expect our 2015 gross-to-net adjustment for our HCV products in the United States to be approximately 46% or a little more than double where we ended 2014, which was around 22%," Mr Carter said. "This increase is a result of the recent and ongoing round of negotiations with payers and [pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)] and includes the shift towards a higher proportion of public payers and higher prescribing of Harvoni amongst those payers with rebates for payers such as Medicaid and the [Veteran's Administration (VA)] exceeding 50%."</p><p>The HCV drug price discounts affected Gilead's sales forecast for 2015. The company didn't offer guidance for specific products, but net sales are expected to total $26bn to $27bn this year versus consensus estimates of $27.9bn, including the impact of HCV drug discounts.</p><p>Both Gilead and AbbVie have negotiated deals that give their HCV drugs either exclusive access or shared access to patients covered by PBMs and other payers, including Express Scripts, CVS/Caremark and Anthem (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gileads-CVS-exclusive-may-best-AbbVies-Express-Scripts-hepatitis-C-deal-355940" target="_new">6 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-gives-Viekira-dependent-2015-guidance-as-Anthem-chooses-Harvoni-356035" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Discounts for AbbVie's HCV drug Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir) were not characterized as very deep during the company's recent year-end earnings report. However, AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez acknowledged fierce competition for payer and PBM deals, and he noted that about 40% of people with insurance coverage from a managed care company will be able to access Viekira Pak (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-Q4-beats-expectations-as-it-takes-Shire-bid-hit-356487" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Mr Carter said Gilead's negotiations with payers are ongoing, but agreements for about 60% of the covered lives across the US have been negotiated and about 80% of those patients have access to Harvoni. About 140,000 US patients were treated with Sovaldi in 2014, but Gilead didn't quantify the number who received Harvoni following its US FDA approval in October and the negotiated price discounts that followed (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">10 October 2014</a>).</p><p>"These higher levels of rebates are tied directly to opening up access and streamlining the process of starting the patients on therapy. Overall, with these new arrangements in place, we're confident that a substantially higher number patients will be treated in the United States in 2015. We think that there is capacity to treat at least 250,000 patients across all genotypes," Mr Carter said.</p><p>Gilead ended 2014 with $10.3bn in full-year worldwide Sovaldi sales, which took a hit in the fourth quarter when sales totaled $1.7bn versus $2.1bn for Harvoni. European HCV drug sales are expected to increase in 2015, but the US will continue to make up the majority of Sovaldi and Harvoni sales this year as country-by-country negotiations with payers are ongoing.</p><p>Gilead's HIV franchise accounted for the company's top five best-selling products outside of HCV, as outlined in the table below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2014 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2013 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Atripla</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.5bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.7bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Truvada</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.3bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.1bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Stribild</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$539m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Complera/Eviplera</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$810m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Viread</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.1bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$959m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Letairis </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$595m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$520m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Ranexa</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$510m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$449m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Zydelig</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$167m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$141m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>William Blair analyst John Sonnier noted in a 3 February report that "the HIV franchise continues to provide a consistent revenue stream. We expect positive operating momentum to continue into 2015 and note from our experience that management historically gives conservative guidance on its year-end call."</p><p><b>Beyond hepatitis C</b></p><p>Even so, Gilead's strong sales and the announcement that it will pay investors a $0.43 per share dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2015 &ndash; the company's first-ever dividend &ndash; did not soften the blow caused by the HCV drug discount revelations. </p><p>Investors have been waiting for another transformative acquisition, like the Pharmasset deal that gave Gilead its revenue-doubling hepatitis C portfolio, but the company elected to use its considerable cash to pay dividends and buy back stock. Gilead announced that it will spend $15bn during the next five years to repurchase outstanding shares. </p><p>President and chief operating officer John Milligan said the share repurchase program will not keep the company from in-licensing assets that could add value to Gilead's research and development pipeline. In fact, he said, the company will "invest heavily in the pipeline for the future."</p><p>Gilead began 2015 with the acquisition of small molecule farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from Phenex Pharmaceuticals for up to $470m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-buying-another-NASH-program-for-up-to-470m-355961" target="_new">7 January 2015</a>). </p><p>In the fourth quarter of last year, Gilead expanded its partnership with Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen for HIV combination regimens and the company licensed the oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ONO-4059 from Ono Pharmaceuticals (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-Janssen-expand-HIV-combo-RandD-deals-355871" target="_new">29 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Ten-deals-and-a-breakup-GileadOno-VernalisNovartis-SorrentoNantWorks-and-more-355774" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Milestones to be achieved within Gilead's existing pipeline in 2015 include:</p><p>?The first US and EU approvals for HIV therapies that contain tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), starting with TAF plus elvitegravir 150mg, cobicistat 150mg and emtricitabine 200mg (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Gilead-seeks-FDA-nod-for-new-HIV-quad-354908" target="_new">7 November 2014</a>); </p><p>?Initiation of Phase II studies for GS-9883 in HIV, Zydelig (idelalisib) in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and GS-6615 for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;</p><p>?Sovaldi and Harvoni approvals in Japan;</p><p>?Phase II results in HCV for the combination of Sovaldi plus GS-9857 and GS-5816;</p><p>?Phase III results in HCV for Sovaldi plus GS-5816;</p><p>?Phase II results in hepatitis B from separate studies for GS-4774 and GS-9620.</p><p>"We expect 2015 to be a highly visible year for Gilead's HCV franchise, and we anticipate top-line data from four Phase III trials, which assess the combination of sofosbuvir plus GS-5816, a pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor (formulated in a single-tablet regimen), for the treatment of all HCV genotypes," Mr Sonnier said. "We believe that the company's pan-genotypic regimen could have the potential to address a broader patient population compared with Harvoni, eliminating the need to screen patients for the specific genotype."</p><p>The Phase II three-drug combination for HCV could offer treatment durations as short as four to six weeks versus Harvoni's eight to 12 weeks of treatment.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
