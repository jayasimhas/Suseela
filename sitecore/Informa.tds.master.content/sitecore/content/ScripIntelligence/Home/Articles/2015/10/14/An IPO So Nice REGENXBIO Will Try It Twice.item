<p>REGENXBIO Inc. is hoping to build on the success of its IPO &ndash; and investor enthusiasm for gene therapy in general &ndash; by taking its liver disease-focused spinout, Dimension Therapeutics Inc., public as well.</p><p><p>"In our space, particularly in cell and gene therapy, [we] see a lot of real advances in terms of new technologies that are showing benefits clinically," REGENXBIO CEO Kenneth Mills said an interview with <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</i>.</p><p><p>"On our roadshow, we talked a lot with investors [and told them] that there are going to continue to be a lot of touch points and milestones for investors to see, in late 2015 into 2016 and 2017, and our sense was that there was support and bullishness around a lot of the innovation that's happening."</p><p>REGENXBIO netted $148m from its initial public offering in September, on top of more than $100m the gene therapy biotech had raised before going public.</p><p><p>"I think companies that are innovating and are showing strong data are going to continue to find a lot of support, particularly from those long-term investors in health care and biotech," Mills added.</p><p>Dimension, spun out of REGENXBIO in 2013 to focus on rare liver diseases, announced plans to go public in September and may price its offering soon.</p><p><p>REGENXBIO is using the proceeds from its recent IPO to advance the first two of five preclinical programs into clinical development in the first half of 2016.</p><p><p>"From our perspective, one of the reasons REGENXBIO was well received was because of the fundamentals of an innovative technology and a platform that was having and showing meaningful benefit for patients," Mills said.</p><p><p>"I think as companies continue to present themselves with that kind of profile, maybe there's going to need to be a calming of the market on a global level but those companies are there, including some that are licensees of ours, that are looking to step into the public arena and I think they'll be well received." For REGENXBIO, a mezzanine financing it did with crossover investors earlier in 2015 brought in not only $70.5m, but paved the way for a successful IPO, he said.</p><p><p>"People who were working with us and advising us suggested that it was a good stopping point, but quite honestly we debated whether to get public at that point rather than do the mezzanine [round]," Mills added. "I think it afforded us time to get to know some more investors at a broader level before we got to the IPO."</p><p><p>Now, with Spark Therapeutics Inc. having unveiled positive top-line data from a Phase III trial of its lead candidate in genetic blinding conditions on Oct. 5, Mills thinks the investor community is primed to invest further in gene therapy companies, including some that have licensed novel adeno-associated virus (NAV) technology from REGENXBIO.</p><p><p>"With the backdrop of investors understanding already that the better technologies and better profiles in gene therapy are starting to emerge in the public market, I think there's quite a bit of enthusiasm," Mills said.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily/2015/10/12/gene-therapys-future-can-be-navigated-alone-regenxbio-ceo-says" target="_new"> The Pink Sheet</a> Daily.
