<p>The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made his rounds on the network Sunday political programs on 1 February to plead with parents to vaccinate their children against measles, as an outbreak of the highly contagious virus continued to spread in the US.</p><p>The CDC reported that in the past month, the number of cases of measles in the US has jumped to 84 in 14 states in an ongoing outbreak linked to Disneyland, in which an untold number of people were exposed in December 2014.</p><p>Updated figures from the California health department, however, pushed that nationwide figure above 100.</p><p>Now there's concern over a Bard College student who took an international flight from Germany to New York, where he then boarded a train when he was in the early stages of infection with the measles. </p><p>Appearing on <i>CBS' Face the Nation</i>, Dr Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said he expected the number of cases to go higher in the US during the current outbreak.</p><p>The best way to prevent measles, he insisted, is with vaccination.</p><p>But, he said, a over the past few years, a small, but growing number of parents have not gotten their kids vaccinated &ndash; with some still believing a discredited report from the late 1990s the vaccine causes autism &ndash; resulting in a building up of unvaccinated young adults, which he said "makes us vulnerable." </p><p>"The science is clear," Dr Frieden asserted, "study after study has shown there's no serious long-term adverse consequences from the measles vaccine."</p><p>"We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the US," he declared.</p><p>Appearing on <i>ABC's This Week</i>, Dr Frieden pointed out that children with compromised immune systems who are unable to get the measles vaccine are especially vulnerable to getting the measles. </p><p>He noted the CDC declared the measles eliminated in the US in 2000. </p><p>But people who have traveled abroad have brought measles back to the US, with those who haven't been vaccinated easily picking up the disease and spreading it to others who haven't got the shot. </p><p>Adults born between 1957 and 1971 also are vulnerable because the vaccine in the US was not very effective, so the CDC is urging those in that age group to get a booster shot. </p><p>The total number of measles in the US in 2014 was 644 in 27 states.</p><p>This article also may be read at US Capitol Capsule <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p>
