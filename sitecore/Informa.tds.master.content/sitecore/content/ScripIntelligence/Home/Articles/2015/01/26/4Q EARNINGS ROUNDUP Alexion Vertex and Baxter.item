<p>Sometimes a leadership change-up can drive a company's stock lower as investors worry about how the new chief executive will run the business, but Alexion Pharmaceuticals closed 5.8% higher at $188.05 per share on 29 January after the company said founder and CEO Leonard Bell will retire, but announced a 44% increase in annual net product sales and a 69% rise in non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS).</p><p>David Hallal will be promoted from chief operating officer to CEO effective 1 April, but Dr Bell will remain as chairman of Alexion's board of directors. Mr Hallal joined the Cheshire, Connecticut-based company in 2006 to lead commercial operations ahead of the Soliris (eculizumab) launch and he was appointed COO in 2014. Alexion said his replacement of Dr Bell was part of a planned leadership transition.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Eun Yang said in a 29 January research note that the "CEO succession internally (in the works for two years) indicates unlikely change in corporate strategy."</p><p>Soliris is approved to treat the ultra-rare diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and Alexion is enrolling patients in registrational clinical trials to support regulatory approvals for the treatment of delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplant, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and myasthenia gravis (MG). </p><p>Net sales for the $400,000-per-year biologic jumped from $1.55bn in 2013 to $2.23bn in 2014 and Alexion forecast $2.55bn to $2.6bn in 2015 sales, including a $135m hit from foreign currency exchange rates based on the rising value of the US dollar. Jefferies estimates that about $31m in sales this year will come from the company's second commercial product asfotase alfa.</p><p>Alexion submitted applications for regulatory approvals in the US, Europe and Japan in 2014 for asfotase alfa as a treatment for hypophosphatasia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASBMR-2014-Four-bone-drug-updates-including-Mercks-odanacatib-353977" target="_new">17 September</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Alexions-hypophosphatasia-drug-asfotase-alfa-under-FDA-review-355886" target="_new">30 December 2014</a>). The company has other rare disease therapies in ongoing clinical trials, but none that are close to winning US or EU approvals, including two next-generation Soliris candidates.</p><p>Alexion's 2014 non-GAAP EPS rose from $3.08 in 2013 to $5.21 in 2014 and the forecast for 2015 is $5.60 to $5.80, including a $0.30 reduction based on currency impacts.</p><p><b>Vertex shares bruised by lack of clinical updates</b></p><p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals took a beating on 29 January, closing down 5.9% at $114.14 following its fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings announcement after the market closed on 28 January. Analysts attributed the stock's weakness to the lack of data for the company's newer cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs.</p><p>Boston-based Vertex reported $124m in fourth quarter sales for the CF drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor), which was in line with analyst consensus and the company's forecast for $120m in sales that was issued earlier in the month. Total fourth quarter revenue was $145m. </p><p>Full-year 2014 revenue totaled $580.4m, including $24m from the hepatitis C therapy Incivek/Incivo (telaprevir) that Vertex stopped selling in light of competing blockbusters from Gilead Sciences, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson. </p><p>The company's 2014 revenue was half of the $1.2bn reported in 2013 due to the company's decision to wind down its hepatitis C business to focus on CF therapies, but Kalydeco sales jumped to $463.8m last year from $371.3m in 2013 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vertex-bows-out-of-hepatitis-C-race-to-focus-on-cystic-fibrosis-349667" target="_new">30 January 2014</a>).</p><p>Vertex reported a $511.2m non-GAAP net loss for 2014, or $2.17 per diluted share, compared with a 2013 net loss of $203.3m, or $0.90 per share.</p><p>The company forecast $560m to $580m in 2015 Kalydeco sales after adding CF patients in Australia, US patients with the newly approved R117H genetic mutation, patients with gating mutations in the EU, and children with G551D or other gating mutations in the US. Treatment of the latter category of patients could win US FDA approval in March (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kalydeco-expanded-in-CF-patients-with-R117H-mutation-355875" target="_new">30 December 2014</a>).</p><p>The FDA accepted Vertex's new drug application (NDA) for Kalydeco in combination with lumacaftor for CF patients age 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation; a decision is expect by 5 July. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) also is reviewing the company's marketing authorization application (MAA) for the two-drug combination. A study in children with the same mutations will be initiated during the first half 2015. </p><p>Further down the line, Vertex has a Phase II clinical trial under way for Kalydeco plus VX-661 in CF patients with two copies of the F508del mutation with results expected in the first quarter of 2015. </p><p>Investors may have been disappointed by the company's decision not to disclose the trial's results in its earnings report, but Vertex signaled its confidence in the data earlier in January when it announced plans to begin a Phase III program for the combination next month with data expected in 2016.</p><p>A three-drug combination with Kalydeco, VX-661 and a new CF drug candidate is the next treatment regimen that Vertex plans to take into clinical development.</p><p>"We expect continued gradual penetration of the worldwide market," Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote in a 29 January report, but he noted that revenue growth will be muted somewhat by potentially lower reimbursement for Vertex's CF drugs.</p><p>"Management has guided for lower reimbursement rate with [Kalydeco/lumacaftor] as payer mix evolves toward greater public payer role in the US and the international commercial infrastructure expands beyond the wealthiest nations in Europe," Dr Carr wrote.</p><p><b>Baxter revenue, earnings rise as it prepares to split company</b></p><p>Baxter International boasted 2014 financial results that "exceeded expectations," but the near tripling of fourth quarter income from $326m in 2013 to $953m in 2014 ($0.59 per share versus $1.74 per share) included a $429m after-tax gain from the $635m sale of its vaccines business to Pfizer and $209m in after-tax benefits from amortization (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-to-underappreciated-strength-Pfizer-buys-Baxter-vaccines-353116" target="_new">31 July 2014</a>). Baxter reported $2.5bn in net income for 2014, or $4.56 per diluted share.</p><p>As Baxter prepares to split its BioScience and Medical Products businesses into separate entities in mid-2015, the company reported an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue to $16.7bn in 2014. BioScience revenue jumped 7% (8% excluding foreign currency impacts) to $6.7bn and Medical Products revenue rose 15% (16% excluding foreign currency impacts) to $10bn. The Medical Products business would've increased only 2% without Baxter's $4bn purchase of Gambro (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gambro-buy-dents-Baxter-bottom-line-342317" target="_new">19 April 2013</a>).</p><p>Baxter predicted 2% to 3% sales growth for the combined company in the first quarter of 2015, but the forecast falls to a 3% to 4% drop in revenue for the year when foreign currency impacts are considered. Earnings per diluted share are expected to be $0.85 to $0.90 for the first quarter.</p><p>Future growth depends on sales gains for products approved in 2014: HyQvia (immune globulin infusion 10% (human)/recombinant human hyaluronidase) for adults with primary immunodeficiency, the recombinant factor IX Rixubis for children with hemophilia B, and Obizur [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Porcine Sequence] for adults with acquired hemophilia A (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Baxter-Halozyme-win-FDA-OK-for-HyQvia-353958" target="_new">15 September</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-expands-use-of-Baxters-Rixubis-in-children-353960" target="_new">16 September</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-24-30-October-2014-354818" target="_new">3 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The company also submitted biologics license applications (BLAs) to the FDA last year for BAX 855, an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A based on Advate [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)], and the highly purified recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) BAX111 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Baxters-BAX-855-could-compete-with-Biogens-Eloctate-next-year-353500" target="_new">22 August 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-19-December---25-December-2014-355905" target="_new">2 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Baxter does not break out individual product sales, but within the BioScience division the company reported an 8% increase for its largest franchise, hemophilia therapies, which grew to $3.7bn in 2014 versus $3.4bn in 2013.</p><p>Among deals that Baxter announced in 2014 to expand its commercial product revenue and build its development pipeline, the company agreed to market Rockwell Medical's hemodialysis products, bought ex-US rights to MM-398 (nanoliposomal irinotecan) from Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, acquired AesRx for its sickle cell drug candidate Aes-103, and purchased the gene therapy developer Chatham Therapeutics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Two-key-fires-at-Retrophin-NewLink-three-deals-and-three-financings-354298" target="_new">4 October</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Baxter-pays-100m-upfront-for-ex-US-rights-to-pancreatic-cancer-candidate-354106" target="_new">24 September</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Baxter-snags-NIH-backed-sickle-cell-drug-maker-352804" target="_new">10 July</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Halozyme-falters-Baxter-acquires-Chatham-Celgene-buys-Acceleron-shares-and-IPOs-lose-momentum-351122" target="_new">5 April 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
