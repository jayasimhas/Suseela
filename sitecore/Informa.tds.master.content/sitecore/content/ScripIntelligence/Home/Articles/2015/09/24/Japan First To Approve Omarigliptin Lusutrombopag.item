<p>The latest batch of product approvals in Japan includes the first regulatory clearances worldwide for new molecules from Merck and Shionogi, in a further sign that the country's "drug lag" is a thing of the past.</p><p>Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare formally endorsed earlier positive advisory opinions for Merck & Co. Inc.'s DPP-4 inhibitor Marizev (omarigliptin) and Shionogi & Co. Ltd.'s TPO receptor agonist Mulpleta (lusutrombopag), setting the stage for the drugs' first launches anywhere once they receive reimbursement price listing, which normally follows within several weeks. </p><p>Marizev, for which a US NDA submission is still pending but planned by the end of the year, was approved as 12.5mg and 25mg tablets for the once-weekly treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes, which number around six million in Japan.</p><p>The clearance was based on a local Phase III study conducted as part of the Merck's global O-QWEST program involving around 8,000 patients, and follows a November 2014 approval filing.</p><p>The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Mercks-once-weekly-DPP-4-to-personalize-diabetes-therapy-360509" target="_new">reported to the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting</a> earlier this month that omarigliptin 25mg was non-inferior to its existing once-daily DPP-4 inhibitor Januvia (sitagliptin) 100mg in reducing A1C levels from baseline, in patients with inadequate glycemic control on metformin.</p><p>At 24 weeks, 51% of omarigliptin patients reached an A1C goal of less than 7%, compared with 49% on Januvia (p=0.334). Baseline A1C was around 7.5% in both groups at the start of the trial.</p><p>Datamonitor predicts that while omarigliptin has the potential for more than $1bn in annual worldwide sales by 2024, "its prospects may be limited by its lack of product differentiation to standard care therapy in diabetes."</p><p>In addition, "uncertainty regarding the need for a once-weekly oral therapy in the diabetes space could limit commercial opportunities."</p><p>Constraining factors include the fact that compliance for daily oral therapies is already relatively high, and that the likely need for co-administration with other daily antidiabetics reduces the convenience factor of weekly dosing and also precludes fixed-dose combinations, Datamonitor notes.</p><p>It expects omarigliptin sales in Japan to reach a modest $73.4m in 2023.</p><p>Marizev will also enter a crowded local DDP-4 sector and will need to compete with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.'s already marketed once-weekly product Zafatek (trelagliptin), which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sovaldi-and-trelagliptin-in-latest-Japanese-approvals-357544" target="_new">approved in Japan</a> back in March as the first drug of its type worldwide.</p><p>Nevertheless, Januvia &ndash; co-marketed in Japan by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. as Glactiv &ndash; has built a leading position in Japan's DPP-4 space, being the first in the class to be launched in December 2009, which may help the US firm carve out a niche for its new option.</p><h2>Lusutrombopag</h2><p>Shionogi's Mulpleta 3mg tablet also became the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist to be approved anywhere for the improvement of thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease in patients undergoing an elective invasive procedure.</p><p>The small molecule, filed for approval in December 2014, induces proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes, which increases platelet levels. Clinical trials at 3mg once daily for seven days showed an increase in the proportion of patients who did not require platelet transfusions compared with placebo.</p><p>Platelet transfusions or platelet products have usually been used to increase platelet counts before such procedures.</p><p>An international Phase III program is ongoing with approval filings also planned in other major markets.</p><h2>Caprelsa, Other Products</h2><p>Other products approved this time by the ministry included AstraZeneca PLC's multi-kinase inhibitor Caprelsa (vandetanib) for medullary thyroid cancer, and Takeda's Copaxone (glatiramer; licensed from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.) for the first-line prevention of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Copaxone was developed following a formal 2013 request from the ministry to make the drug available, which led to a December 2014 filing that included results from a 52-week open-label trial conducted in Japan as well as existing global data.</p><p>Takeda also received approval of a new 24-week microcapsule depot formulation of LHRH agonist Leuplin PRO (leuprorelin) 22.5mg injection kit for prostate and premenopausal breast cancer.</p><p>Initially launched as a once-daily injection, the long-acting form is the first of its type globally for the breast cancer indication.</p><p>Also approved were Ecumet, a fixed-dose formulation of Novartis AG's DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin with metformin, Stiolto Respimat, Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH's long-acting combination of the anticholinergic tiotropium and olodaterol, a beta-2 agonist, for the once-daily maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Pfizer Inc.'s serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor Effexor (venlafaxine) for major depressive disorder.</p><p>Two products for pulmonary arterial hypertension were cleared: Bayer Yakuhin Ltd.'s inhaled prostacyclin analog Ventavis (iloprost; licensed from Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.), and a new pediatric formulation of Actelion's own PAH drug Tracleer (bosentan).</p><p>Japan's regulator, the PMDA, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Getting-pharma-policy-right-the-Japanese-way-357516" target="_new">has declared</a> that it is aiming to deliver review and approval times on a par with or better than other major regulatory bodies worldwide, helped by improved staffing and streamlined processes.</p><p><i>This article is also being published in</i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</i></p>
