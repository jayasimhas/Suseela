<p> The FDA may have approved the highest number of new molecular entities for 18 years in 2014 (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-2014-a-year-for-orphan-drugs-anti-PD-1s-2nd-chancers-355915">scripintelligence.com, 5 January 2015</a>), but what should we expect for 2015? Here <i>Scrip</i> has taken a look at ten of the more interesting new products set for approval in the US and EU over the coming 12 months, in a rough order of when they are due: </p> <p> <h2> Novartis's Cosentyx (secukinumab) </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; January 2015 </p> <p> EU &ndash; January 2015 </p> <p> Already approved in Japan, Novartis's anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody product is due to get the go-ahead early this year for use in psoriasis, the first of a number of indications for the product (others include rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). The product is the most advanced of this new class of anti-inflammatories, with rivals including Amgen/AstraZeneca's brodalumab and Lilly's ixekizumab. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $804m in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Amgen's T-VEC (tamilogene laherparepvec) </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; June </p> <p> EU &ndash; by end of February </p> <p> This first-in-class melanoma immunotherapy was filed first in the EU last September based on positive Phase III data presented at ASCO. While riding on the current wave for immune-based treatments for oncology &ndash; if approved, the drug will be the first oncolytic immunotherapy on the market &ndash; there is some doubt over its commercial potential in the increasingly crowded melanoma field. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $115m in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Sanofi's Toujeo (glargine U300) </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; May 2015 </p> <p> EU &ndash; between April and October </p> <p> Sanofi's follow-on to its original glargine product Lantus, which loses patent protection this year, is a more concentrated and longer lasting formulation. Toujeo is key in Sanofi's efforts to shift sales from Lantus and fight off competition from Novo Nordisk's similar offering Tresiba (insulin degludec), as it faces flattening sales in its diabetes franchise, but analysts are sceptical that its advantages are enough to secure enough sales. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $3.7bn in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Amgen/Astellas' evolocumab and Sanofi/Regeneron's alirocumab </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; August </p> <p> EU &ndash; August to February 2016 </p> <p> Amgen won the race to be first to file a cholesterol-lowering proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor in the US market, which has been accepted for a standard review by the FDA, setting 27 August PDUFA action date. Its closest rival Sanofi/Regeneron's alirocumab was due to be filed by the end of 2014 in the US and EU. Both products have shown remarkable reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels on top of statin therapy at Phase III, making it difficult to see which will ultimately triumph, and alirocumab is expected steal a march on its rival through a priority review voucher purchased from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, meaning its application will be reviewed in six rather than 10 months of acceptance. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $5.2bn for evolocumab and $5.0bn for alirocumab in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Pfizer/Amgen's palbociclib </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; April </p> <p> EU &ndash; not yet filed </p> <p> The FDA granted a priority review to Pfizer's NDA for palbociclib as a first-line therapy in combination with letrozole as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease. The highly specific, orally active, small-molecule inhibits CDK4/6, overactivated in many cancers, leading to loss of proliferative control. The product was granted Breakthrough Therapy status in in 2013. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $1.7bn in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Eisai's lenvatinib </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; April </p> <p> EU &ndash; May to November </p> <p> Eisai filed its novel targeted anticancer lenvatinib (E7080) for approval in the US, EU and Japan on the basis of its SELECT study in progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). The orphan indication is the first for lenvatinib, which is seen as a successor to Halaven (eribulin), but its major sales potential lies in liver cancer, for which filings will start in east Asia this year. Here lenvatinib will have to go up against Bayer/Amgen's Nexavar (sorafenib) which dominates first-line hepatocellular carcinoma therapy, but Eisai has been confident enough to pitch it head to head in Phase III. Eisai says the product is potentially the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the kinase activities of FGFR 1-4 as well as VEGFR 1-3. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p> <p> <h2> Roche/Exelixis's cobimetinib </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; December </p> <p> EU between August 2015 and February 2016 </p> <p> Roche US subsidiary Genentech is seeking US approval to market cobimetinib (GDC-0973, XL518) in combination with the companies' already approved drug Zelboraf (vemurafenib) for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma. Cobimetinib is a MEK inhibitor (discovered by Exelixis), while Zelboraf is a BRAF inhibitor: combining the two mechanisms of action is expected to change the standard of care in this indication, by providing more complete blockade of the MAP kinase pathway to delay the emergence of resistance. Roche's MEK/BRAF combo is set to challenge GlaxoSmithKline's similar combination of the BRAF inhibitor Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and the MEK inhibitor Mekinist (trametinib), which is already approved in the US, and came a step closer in the EU recently, with an approval for Mekinist monotherapy earlier in July (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Mekinist-approved-in-Europe-but-commercial-success-uncertain-352696">scripintelligence.com, 8 July 2014</a>). GSK had earlier been forced to pull its EU filing for the combination of the two products after the CHMP demanded more clinical data (<a target="_new" href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Surprise-setback-GSK-forced-to-pull-EU-filing-for-melanoma-combo-350893">scripintelligence.com, 26 March 2014</a>). Mekinist and Tafinlar form part of GSK's $16bn sale of its oncology division to Novartis through the mega asset swap deal announced last April (<a target="_new" href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395">scripintelligence.com, 22 April 2014</a>). </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $140m in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> GlaxoSmithKline/PDL BioPharma's Bosatria (mepolizumab) </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; November </p> <p> EU &ndash; October to April 2016 </p> <p> GlaxoSmithKline is seeking approval in the US and EU for its Interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody mepolizumab as a maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Asthma often is characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils in lung tissue, and eosinophil levels often correlate with severity and frequency of exacerbations of asthma. IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival, and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. If approved it will become the first biologic for asthma since Roche/Novartis's Xolair (omalizumab). </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p> <p> <h2> Novartis's LCZ696 </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; year-end </p> <p> EU &ndash;year-end </p> <p> This first-in-class dual inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor and neprilysin is intended for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, and has received an accelerated assessment at the EU's CHMP, taking 150 days, rather than 210 days to review. Its clinical data so far have been highly impressive, even game changing. In the PARADIGM-HF study, it led to 20% fewer cardiovascular deaths, 21% fewer hospitalizations and a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the old the ACE inhibitor therapy enalapril, the previous gold standard of treatment (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartiss-paradigm-shifting-blockbusting-heart-failure-drug-trounces-enalapril-353653">scripintelligence.com, 1 September, 2014</a>). LCZ696 combines the moieties of the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug AHU377 (sacubitril) and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan (Novartis's now off-patent Diovan) in one compound. A rolling submission in the US was due to complete by the end of 2014, with the EU filing due early this year. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: $6.0bn in 2023 </p> <p> <h2> Otsuka/Lundbeck's brexpiprazole </h2> <p> Approval due: </p> <p> US &ndash; July </p> <p> EU &ndash; not yet filed </p> <p> Otsuka and Lundbeck released promising Phase III data for their novel anti-psychotic brexpiprazole just as the US FDA has accepted their NDA for review both as a treatment for schizophrenia and as an adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder (MDD) in September. Brexpiprazole acts through a common antipsychotic mode of action, similar to the companies' blockbuster brand Abilify (aripiprazole), displaying partial agonism of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. Specifically, it is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM) that acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors at similar potency, and an antagonist at 5-HT2A and noradrenaline alpha1B/2C receptors. As an atypical antipsychotic it is following a well-trodden path as augmentation therapy in MDD; indeed, Abilify and Seroquel XR (AstraZeneca's quetiapine extended release) are both approved for this indication in the US. However, the companies have accelerated the process by filing for both indications simultaneously. </p> <p> <p> Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p>
