<p>Bayer's pharmaceutical unit produced better than expected sales for the second quarter of the year, and the business is on track to meet its above &euro;4bn sales target for five of its leading brands by the year's end. </p><p>In its second quarter earnings report on 29 July, Bayer also confidently shed light on its plans to remain a key player in the hemophilia market, outlining its staggered drug launch strategy for the next five to 10 years.</p><p>The drug maker's five newly launched products &ndash; Xarelto(rivaroxaban), Eylea (aflibercept), Stivarga (regorafenib), Xofigo (radium Ra 223 dichloride) and Adempas (riociguat) &ndash; continued to experience strong growth worldwide and collectively reached &euro;1.01bn in the second quarter of 2015 versus &euro;702m in 2Q 2014. </p><p>Group adjusted EBITDA rose to &euro;2.90bn in the second quarter, above market expectations of &euro;2.68bn, while revenue gained 18% to &euro;12.09bn, also beating the analyst consensus and up from &euro;10.23bn in 2Q 2014.</p><p>In the quarter, lead product, blood thinner Xarelto, improved its worldwide sales by 43%, hitting &euro;549m compared to &euro;381m in 2Q 2014. Bayer said it is solidly on track for its target of a 30% increase in Xarelto sales for full year 2015.</p><p>Bayer's CEO Dr Marjin Dekkers noted that Bayer had reached a 33% share of the anticoagulant market space by April this year, up from 28% market share in the same month the year prior. "Currently in the US, patients who required anticoagulants are initiated on Xarelto than all the other available anticoagulants combined," he highlighted. </p><p>The performance of Bayer's aging branded products was mixed in the quarter, however. Sales of contraceptive brand Yasmin and multiple sclerosis drug Betaferon fell 10% and 9%, respectively. </p><h2>hemophilia market strategy</h2><p>The business has a couple of late-stage pipeline products in development for hemophilia A and chair of Bayer Healthcare, Werner Baumann, noted in the firm's second quarter earnings call that despite rising competition Bayer will be able to maintain its position in the market. </p><p><b>"</b>We can certainly hold our ground and regain some of the expected market share losses, which are very minimal right now, because essentially in all major markets we [will] defend ourselves fairly well over the next years to come," Mr Baumann said. </p><p>He also mentioned that Bayer has made an "informed decision" to delay the filing of one of its pipeline hemophilia A products, a modified recombinant factor VIII known as BAY 94-9027, because the company sees "significant potential" for one of its other products, BAY 81-8973 (which is referred to by the company as Kovaltry) in the same indication. </p><p>A biologics license application for Kovaltry, also a recombinant Factor VIII compound, was accepted by the US FDA in March this year. BAY 94-9027, which has seen positive data from Phase III trials, is not slated to enter the market until 2018. Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database has granted the product a likelihood of approval rating of 63%, 3% above the average for a similar product at the same stage of development. </p><p>Mr Baumann said in light of these staggered market entry plans for two of its late-stage hemophilia drugs, "We believe that we have a very, very strong and competitive product portfolio for the remainder of the decade."</p><p>Aside from Bay 94-9027 and Kovaltry, Bayer currently has Kogenate already on the market for the treatment of hemophilia A as well as a couple of preclinical assets in development &ndash; including a gene therapy candidate being developed in partnership with Dimension Therapeutics. </p><p>Bayer has described lead new hemophilia drug Kovaltry as "an enhanced Kogenate with a number of advantages."</p><p>Mr Baumann said Kovaltry is "a product we do want to introduce in the market because it will provide some distinct patient benefit with the longer intervals for prophylactic treatment. We see that product to be absolutely at par with the longer-acting products that are out there." Worldwide sales of already marketed Kogenate have been dropping since 2013. </p><h2>FY15 expectations</h2><p>Bayer has lowered and narrowed its full year sales expectations and is now anticipating sales in the region of &euro;47bn (previously &euro;48-49bn). It said this was largely due to the exclusion of its Diabetes Care unit <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bayer-selling-Diabetes-Care-unit-for-1bn-358892?autnID=/contentstore/scripnews/codex/90096c1f-0f68-11e5-bcd2-1da435f17255.xml" target="_new">which has been sold off</a> to Japan's Panasonic Healthcare for $1.1bn (approximately &euro;91.02m). This business represented &euro;0.9m of expected revenue for 2015, the company said. </p><p>The German firm is still predicting that 2015 adjusted EBITDA will grow by "a high-teens percentage," including positive currency effects of about 5%, which it had previously put at around 8%. </p><p>Bayer noted though that earnings were held back in particular by an increase in R&D-expenses for its pharmaceuticals unit.</p><p><i>[This story was correct on 31 July 2015. It previously stated that "Bayer is also partnered with Sanofi on the development of viral gene therapy, Cogulin B, for the treatment of hemophilia B." However, Bayer is no longer a partner for this product.]</i></p><p>
