<p>Is the general uptrend in India's contract manufacturing segment sustainable, despite some sentiment-dampening run-ins with regulators over compliance concerns? </p><p>Yes, if a clutch of industry experts are to be believed. These experts also underscore that firms that "follow" clients' molecules across discovery and development all the way to manufacturing are likely the ones who have an edge.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Indian credit rating agency CARE Ratingssaid that it expected the Indian contract manufacturing segment to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 17-18% till 2018. </p><p>Navroz Mahudawala, managing director of Candle Partners, a boutique investment banking firm, told <i>Scrip</i> that the current growth rates were "definitely sustainable" for next four-five years as they are still on a low base. </p><p>He maintained that Indian firms in the space such as Dishman Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals Ltd, Syngene International Ltd and Piramal Enterprises Ltd are still generally small compared with their global counterparts and the low-base effect would make the growth sustainable. </p><p>Dishman recently disclosed that it holds a license agreement from Janssen to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Sirturo (bedaquiline).</p><p>Others like S V Veerramani, president of the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association, recently said that growing contract manufacturing industry could also provide a "burgeoning" opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises. </p><p>This comes as the Indian government is considering incentivizing firms that are compliant with Schedule M [which specifies good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements in India] to upgrade to WHO GMP compliance levels with the help of soft loans. India's department of pharmaceuticals has previously indicated that it hopes to cover around 500 medium-scale pharmaceutical enterprises through soft loans of up to INR40m per unit at a concessional rate of 5% per annum under the Pharmaceutical Technology Upgradation Assistance Scheme. The latest position on this could not immediately be ascertained, though.</p><p>CARE Rating had earlier noted that drugs worth about $85bn in potential annual sales in the US are expected to go off patent during 2014-2020, forcing a shift in focus to price competitiveness and cost-effective manufacture. This is likely to boost the prospects of Indian contract manufacturing firms, CARE then said. </p><p>It also noted that with the Indian Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) industry gradually moving up the value chain and players investing in better technology and higher capacities, manufacture of value-added products for biotech and specialty therapy areas may also be outsourced to Indian firms. </p><p>Piramal Enterprises' pharma solutions division, a key player in contract development and manufacturing, recently indicated that it hoped to become the market leader in the development and manufacturing of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) over the next five years. This, it said, was based on its focused investments at its current site in Grangemouth UK and its recent acquisition of Coldstream &ndash; a specialised ADC fill/finish site in Kentucky, US.</p><p>It also noted that despite the increase in development targets for ADCs, the global contract manufacturing sector was still "significantly under resourced" with just a handful of players with experience and even fewer with the "required regulatory accreditations."</p><h2>Integrated Services</h2><p>Experts like Mahudawala believe that integrated service models that follow clients' molecules across discovery, development and manufacturing could be critical to success, though he says that there are not too many examples of that happening as yet in the Indian context.</p><p>"The upside of this model is when the EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] margins can move towards 30-40%+. Except Divi's [Laboratories] frankly there is no Indian player who has yet managed to demonstrate sustainably these margins as yet," he said.</p><p>One such firm offering integrated services, Syngene, said that it had evolved from essentially being a pre-commercial manufacturing service provider to an integrated provider of end-to-end discovery, development and commercial manufacturing service for NMEs. </p><p>"We believe this wide scope of activities is the primary distinguisher for us. In addition, our business model allows multiple entry points for a client to engage with us across the discovery, development and manufacturing continuum and enables forward integration opportunities. This gives us the opportunity to grow long term high value strategic customer relations in alignment with their long term strategy," Peter Bains, Syngene International's CEO told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Syngene currently has "high single-digit" molecules in the late-stage clinical development phase, but if you consider early stage development, the number of molecules increases significantly, Bains said. </p><p>Syngene, the research services arm of India's Biocon which recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Syngene-Makes-Strong-Debut-On-Indian-Bourses-359915" target="_new">went public</a>, expects to evolve into a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indias-Syngene-eyes-CRAMS-role-listing-by-July-358033" target="_new">CRAMS organization</a> with commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. </p><p>Currently development and manufacturing services contribute about 38% of Syngene's revenues. </p><h2>Sentiment</h2><p>But despite the upbeat tenor, experts admit that the recent run-ins with the FDA by a few Indian firms had affected client sentiment for Indian contract manufacturing.</p><p>Mahudawala, though, noted that there have been fewer cases of issues with API units.</p><p>"Majority of the run-ins have been with formulation units and for firms that are using the sites for their own captive businesses." </p><p>Bains believes the larger issue is that the quality standards that Indian contract manufacturing companies follow has not been "rightfully projected" to the global audience. </p><p>"There are many Indian companies, including Syngene, who have consistently cleared the FDA inspections without any 483s. However these do not get reported thereby creating an imbalance in the quality projection of Indian companies," he said. </p><p>A form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioAsia-2015-FDA-bioresearch-483s-in-India-dip-356565" target="_new">An FDA official</a> commenting on the general experience concerning compliance levels and data integrity concerns against the backdrop of a spate of warning letters against Indian sites had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that the sheer number of facilities and volumes in India may be skewing the debate compared with other nations, which also had similar issues. </p>
