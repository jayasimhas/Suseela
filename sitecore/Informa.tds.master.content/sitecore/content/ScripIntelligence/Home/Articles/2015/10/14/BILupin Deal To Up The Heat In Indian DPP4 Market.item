<p>Innovator firms continue to tap into the marketing muscle of domestic companies as they vie for a bigger share of India's highly competitive dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor market.</p><p>The latest to join the trend is Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), which has formed an alliance with Lupin Ltd, the fourth largest firm in the anti-diabetes segment, for co-marketing linagliptin. Novartis already has a co-marketing deal with the Mumbai-based USV for vildagliptin, while Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd co-markets sitagliptin under its alliance with MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside of the US and Canada).</p><p>BI's alliance comes in the backdrop of linagliptin's encouraging run in India, though vildagliptin and sitagliptin continue to be the dominant DPP-4 inhibitors. </p><p>While BI will continue to sell its linagliptin as <i>Trajenta</i> (linagliptin) and <i>Trajenta Duo</i> (linagliptin/metformin) through its existing sales force and network, Lupin will now introduce linagliptin under separate brands <i>Ondero</i> (monotherapy) and <i>Ondero Met</i> (fixed-dose combination with metformin). The Indian firm will back its brands with a 400-strong dedicated diabetes specialty field force.</p><p>Sharad Tyagi, managing director, BI India, termed the deal as an "ideal partnership" where BI brings the research and scientific excellence for linagliptin, and Lupin its "marketing excellence and brand equity" amongst key clinician categories to drive and facilitate product access. </p><p>BI had earlier indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-mega-gliptins-battle-shifting-sands-359254%5d" target="_new">an alliance</a> was on the cards for linagliptin. </p><p>The pact with Lupin comes months after BI and Eli Lilly <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Boehringer-Lilly-revamp-diabetes-set-up-in-India-358579%5d" target="_new">revamped</a> the operational structure of their diabetes alliance in India. The alliance had previously jointly commercialized Trajenta and Trajenta Duo as well as contemporary injectable insulins like Humalog from the Lilly stable. </p><p>Significantly, in 2011, <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lilly-Lupin-link-revs-up-Indian-diabetes-319366" target="_new">Lilly and Lupin</a> had linked up to promote and distribute Lilly's human insulin range of products in India and Nepal, then doubling doctor reach for the products to about 45,000. </p><p>Industry experts in the know indicated that sales of the human insulin range have surged (near double, they claim) since the Lupin-Lilly alliance was set in motion, raising hopes that the deal with BI could rev things up in the DPP-4 segment.</p><p>Last year, Lupin inked a pact to introduce LG Life Sciences's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-to-market-LG-Lifes-glargine-in-India-353230" target="_new">insulin glargine</a> on the Indian market. </p><h2>Gliptin Market</h2><p>The BI-Lupin deal comes amid a seeming neck-and-neck battle between vildagliptin and sitagliptin in the Indian market, with linagliptin and saxagliptin still relatively small in the segment.</p><p>The Indian diabetes market is valued at INR76.55bn ($1.17bn), up 19.57%, as per IMS data for the 12-months to August 2015, while the DPP-4 inhibitors market is estimated at INR14.99bn (+26.55%). </p><p>May 2015 moving annual total (MAT) data from IMS' total sales audit (TSA) indicates that vildagliptin has an edge with a 44% share, but with sitagliptin close behind at 42%. Linagliptin, on the other hand, saw its share in the DPP-4 inhibitor market move up from around 4% as per IMS (MAT) TSA data in May 2013 to 8% in May 2014. It has held steady at 8% in May 2015. Saxagliptin accounts for 5% of the market.</p><p>Another gliptin &ndash; Glenmark's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-pioneers-Mitsubishis-teneligliptin-in-India-358948" target="_new">teneligliptin</a>, a cut-price version of Mitsubishi Tanabe's Tenelia- has also been launched in India and more teneligliptin versions are expected to follow suit. </p>
