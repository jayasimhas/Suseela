<p>Torrent Pharmaceuticals is acquiring the domestic firm, Zyg Pharma - a move that is expected to expand its portfolio to the niche dermatology segment in key international markets.</p><p>While the deal value has not been disclosed, investment banking sources suggest that it could be in the region of region of 15-18 times Zyg's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Torrent expects to finance the deal via internal accruals.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> had earlier <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Is-Indias-Zyg-Pharma-on-the-block-356872%5d" target="_new">reported</a> that Zyg, which is part of the privately owned Encore group, was on sale and that valuations may have been a stumbling block. Staggered payments - part of which may be linked to receipt of product approvals &ndash; were then highlighted as potentially useful approach to iron out issues pertaining to valuation differences. </p><p>Torrent said that the acquisition will help it boost its position in the niche dermatology segment, especially in the US and Europe. The firm had, in a recent investor presentation, identified portfolio diversification and an increased presence in complex generics as among the key growth drivers to move up the value chain in the US.</p><p>Zyg, which is one of the leading contract manufacturers of ''dermaceuticals'', has a range of products in the anti-acne, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-infectives space, among others. Zyg was also known to have a technical collaboration with Schering-Plough, though the latest position on this could not immediately be verified.</p><p>Zyg's facility in Pithampur in central India is approved by various regulatory authorities including the US FDA and the TGA, Australia. The company commenced exports to the US and Australia in 2012, details on its website indicated.</p><p>Analysts tracking the deal said that Zyg appeared to be a "good asset" on the face of it, more so given its FDA-approved site, though valuations would determine whether it can be termed as a great buy.</p><p>Torrent has been fairly active on deal street over the recent past. In 2013, it <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Torrent-to-pay-324m-for-Elders-branded-formulations-business-beating-fancier-rivals-348776%5d" target="_new">acquired</a> the branded domestic formulations business of the Indian firm, Elder Pharmaceuticals, for INR20bn (then $323.5m), apparently pipping fancier suitors, such as Sanofi, along the way. </p>
