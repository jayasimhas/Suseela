<p>A leaked final draft of India's national intellectual property rights (IPR) policy suggests creating an "appropriate framework" for protection of undisclosed information submitted in the drug approval process, though it does not endorse data exclusivity. </p><p>The final draft was submitted by a government-appointed IPR think tank in April and industry experts caution that it does not necessarily reflect the final contours of the proposed Indian IPR policy. The final draft was earlier circulated for inter-ministerial consultation and will need to be put up to the Union Cabinet for approval. </p><p>However, the very reference in the draft around data protection has irked some Indian industry experts. </p><p>They say that it potentially opens an opportunity to reignite the debate on the interpretation of Article 39 (3) of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Article 39 (3) broadly concerns protection of undisclosed test or other data against unfair commercial use but some foreign firms have long argued that it requires countries to create a regime of data exclusivity.</p><p>The leaked final draft, which remains unaltered in several sections when compared with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Speedy-dispute-resolution-on-Indian-IPR-policy-agenda-355866" target="_new">first draft</a> of December 2014, highlights IP aspects in some "special focus" areas/sectors of economic and socio-cultural importance such as public health, agriculture and food, "creative" industries and geographical indications. </p><p>In the area of public health, the draft suggests a clutch of measures, including the one around data protection. </p><p>"Based on the study recommended in Objective 3.6.3, an appropriate framework will be considered for protection of undisclosed information submitted in the drug approval process including digitization of the same," it notes. </p><p>The draft outlines important areas of study and research for "future policy development" such as protection of undisclosed information "not extending to data exclusivity" under sub-section 3.6.3.</p><p>Industry experts told <i>Scrip</i> that trade secrets are already protected under general law in India and there was really no need to suggest any additional protection during the regulatory process.</p><p>"Article 39 (3) is interpreted by some as meaning data exclusivity. There was no need for the reference, though I don't believe data exclusivity will really pass muster in India," one expert said.</p><p>The leaked final draft was put in public domain by the Don't Trade Our Lives Away network that strives for equitable access to medicines. <i>Scrip</i> could, however, not immediately independently confirm the veracity of the leaked draft. </p><p>A senior government official was reported in August as saying that India will unveil its new IPR policy within two months.</p><p>The leaked final draft also notes that India does not recognize patent linkage and patent term extensions. Indian industry experts had previously indicated that they were concerned that the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indias-National-IPR-policy-whats-cooking-359573" target="_new">new IPR policy</a> could usher in patent linkage via some "very cleverly worded statements" around how regulators should view second applicants of a drug. </p><p>The draft also specifies that the proposed law on utility models contemplated in the policy does not envisage inclusion of pharmaceuticals, biological material or substances.</p><p>It also mentions that attempts to treat generic drugs as spurious or counterfeit will be strongly resisted. It, though, suggests that "stringent "measures be undertaken to curb the manufacture and sale of misbranded, adulterated, spurious and counterfeit drugs.</p><p>Access to affordable medicines and other healthcare solutions is also proposed to be increased by encouraging cross-sector partnerships between public/private sector, universities and NGOs; promoting novel licensing models and developing novel technology platforms. The draft also lists a clutch of measures to back the biotechnology segment.</p>
