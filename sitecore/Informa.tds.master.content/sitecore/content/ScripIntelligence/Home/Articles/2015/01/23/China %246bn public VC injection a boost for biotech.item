<p>China has announced a CNY40bn ($6.5bn) venture capital fund injection to its strategic emerging industries (SEIs), including biotech, potentially a welcome shot in the arm for the burgeoning sector.</p><p>China's venture capital market is relatively small, but the recent State Council directive provides a significant stimulus, adding flesh to the bones of a government initiative dating back to 2010 that aims to boost sunrise industries and incubate innovative private sector involvement in areas like biotech.</p><p>It seems to be a smart move to keep the ball rolling, say analysts, even if no one is sure of where and to whom exactly the money will flow. Though critics have complained the tech sector is gobbling up the lion's share of government funds to SEIs, leaving biotech short-changed, this seems a little short-sighted.</p><p>According to the State Council's website, following a meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on 14 January: "The capital will be led by the government, combining existing funds for infrastructure construction and development of emerging industries, and there will be contributions from large companies and financial institutions." It is intended to "nurture new growth engines amid the slowest economic expansion in almost 25 years." </p><p>Fund management companies selected through public bidding will make investment decisions, while private sector investors will take priority to distribute the funds. Importantly, foreign investors will be granted wider access to the medical care industry.</p><p>The cash injection is part of the 12th Five-Year Development Plan for National Strategic Emerging Industries in 2012, including biotech, energy efficient and environmental technology among others. These sectors are estimated to increase from minimal to account for 8% of GDP by 2015 and 15% by 2020.</p><p>The fillip can energize a decelerating economy and reboot the country's industrial outlook by focusing on innovation, said Lan Qiu, researcher at the University of Macao's Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences.</p><p>"The slowing curve of the economy is the same as the rest of the world. It is the general trend. So I am glad to consider the RMB40bn as a stimulus, but we must see what the results bring," Lan told PharmAsia News in an interview.</p><p>He added the money would likely go into areas such as medical devices or materials, and smart medical diagnosis based on big data. It would function as a signal to both domestic and foreign investors that good projects would be supported, stressed the co-author of a paper on public and private R&D investment in China's pharma industry.</p><h2>Alibaba, Baiyuanshan and Private Financing</h2><p>Asked whether the government is trying to reduce the role of state enterprises and encourage venture capital investment from private companies, Lan Qiu tentatively agreed.</p><p>Since 2011 venture firms have found difficult to exit via a public listing because of a year-long freeze on initial public listing (IPO) enforced by Chinese authorities.</p><p>The anemic financing recovered in early 2014, driven by wearable devices and personalized medicines that have attracted hot money flow to healthcare sector. Chinese VC portal Zero21PO finds that fresh capital eligible for investment rose 157% in the first six months compared with the previous year.</p><p>In addition, a December rule change allowed insurance companies to invest in venture capital funds, reinforcing a government goal to give market forces a more "decisive" role in the economy. Foreign investors also received some good news when the Ministry of Commerce agreed to ease restrictions on access to the domestic market on 19 January.</p><p>That has fueled an investment rush. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba along with other investors recently invested CNY10bn into Guangzhou Baiyunshan Pharmaceutical Holdings. On 22 January, Innovent Biologics, a privately-held Chinese biopharma, announced it had raised $100m in series C financing.</p><p>Lan views the Baiyuanshan move an indication for high-tech investors to get more involved in pharma industry.</p><p>"Actually they showed their interests earlier. For example, Hony Capital, in which Lenovo is a shareholder, has been searching for opportunities in the medical industry. Baiyunshan is a very strong, large-scale company that has considerable innovation power."</p><p>This story first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>, </p><p>
