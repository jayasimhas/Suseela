<p>Biosimilar drug developer, MAbxience, has opened a new manufacturing plant in Léon, Spain &ndash; marking one of the largest investments by a Spanish group in biotech in the country.</p><p>MAbxience acquired the plant, which originally belonged to Genhelix, in May 2014 for &euro;11m and has since poured a further &euro;14m into renovation plans. Since it was founded in 2009, MAbxience has invested a total of &euro;115m in biosimilar R&D. </p><p>The plant is being described as "unique" because it offers the first "single-use" technology plant in Spain, focused solely on biosimilar monoclonal antibodies. This technology consists of using disposable bioreactors, which offer greater flexibility and enable MAbxience to save on production costs &ndash; a key part of its ability to provide its biosimilars at a higher discounted price once approved and brought to market. </p><p>Some research activities at the new plant have already begun, but MAbxience expects the unit to be fully equipped by December this year and fully functioning by January 2016. </p><p>Managing director of MAbxience, Carlos Ba&ntilde;ado, said at a press conference in Léon on Oct. 15, "We have all the ingredients to make MAbxience a successful project." However he noted that the market for biosimilars is relatively new and has many challenges &ndash; including novel and evolving regulatory guidelines.</p><p>The company's goal is to address the issue of accessibility in Spain, Europe, Latin America (where MAbxience was born), and further afield, by providing cheaper version of expensive drugs &ndash; especially in immunology and oncology indications. MAbxience predicts that biosimilars manufactured at its new site will contribute approximate savings of &euro;1.5bn for public authorities between now and 2020. </p><p>MAbxience, founded in 2009, has six biosimilars in development, the most advanced being a version of Roche Holding AG's rituximab that is already available in Argentina. The company plans to start marketing its product with at least a 30% discount in Argentina and in Europe when approved. </p><p>Ba&ntilde;ado predicts that biosimilars will take hold of at least 50% of the market share from branded, original products. He said, "We will see big discounts on the price of biosimilar products, starting around 30% and increasing, but these products will achieve a high market share in balance." In terms of longer term competitive pricing, Ba&ntilde;ado said it will depend on the number of players in the space. </p><p>MAbxience's other biosimilar products in development include versions of Roche's <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab), which is in clinical development, and preclinical programs for biosimilars of AstraZeneca PLC.'s <i>Synagis</i> (palivizumab); Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel (etanercept); AbbVie Inc.'s Humira (adalimumab); and an rFVIII product. </p>
