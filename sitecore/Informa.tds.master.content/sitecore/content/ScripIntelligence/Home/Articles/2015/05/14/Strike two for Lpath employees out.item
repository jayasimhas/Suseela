<p><p>Lpath hit another round of bad luck when its lipid-targeted eye drug failed to show a statistically significant benefit in a Phase II study of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, forcing the company to cut costs and employees. </p><p>The San Diego biotech announced 20 May that iSONEP failed to improve visual clarity for the 158 wet AMD patients in the study, all of whom had failed on other therapies like Lucentis, Avastin and Eylea. </p><p>The study was divided into four treatment groups with approximately 39 patients each; those patients given only an anti-VEGF treatment responded best. </p><p>At the 120 day mark, patients who received 4.0mg of iSONEP alone lost a mean of 3.17 letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), while those on a combination of 0.5 mg iSONEP and anti-VEGF therapy gained a mean of 4.22 letters, those in the combination of 4.0 mg iSONEP and anti-VEGF therapy arm gained a mean of 3.63 letters and the patients on an anti-VEGF therapy alone gained a mean of 4.34 letters.</p><p>Lpath expects to present the full study results at a conference in November. </p><h2>Cutting back</h2><p>The failure of iSONEP means Lpath is making a dash to conserve cash as investors continue to show disappointment with the company. Shares of the stock dropped dramatically, with the news pushing the stock down 79.87%, or $1.36, to linger near 34 cents per share. </p><p>Lpath is cutting its workforce and reevaluating its R&D programs to conserve cash. Lpath expects to be able to fund operations through June 2016. </p><p>"The company expects that the reduction in workforce together with planned reductions or delays in other expenditures will decrease annualized cash expenditures significantly," the biotech said in a statement. </p><p>The company has three other drugs in its pipeline, but don't expect investors to be too thrilled with those opportunities. Lpath's ASONEP failed to show statistically significant improvement in renal cell carcinoma patients in March. Shares of the company <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Lpath-plummets-on-Asonep-RCC-failure-357490" target="_new">dropped 25%</a> on the news. </p><p>The biotech's big pharma partners have been pulling out left and right &ndash; Merck KGaA opted not to fund further development of ASONEP after paying for a Phase I trial in 2008. Pfizer <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Trevena-MacroGenics-BioMarin-Kythera-Lpath-The-Medicines-CompanyAlnylam-347201" target="_new">dropped rights</a> to ASONEP and iSONEP in October 2013. </p><p>Lpath has also has a Phase I-ready drug for neuropathic pain and a preclinical compound that is being studied in inflammatory programs. </p><p><p><p>
