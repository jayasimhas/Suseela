<p> Industry pleas for the Australian government to reconsider its plans for biosimilar substitution may have paid off, after a parliamentary committee said that concerns over safety expressed by industry, patients and health professionals needed to be addressed before any such move went ahead. </p> <p> On 23 June, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee recommended that a &quot;broad and transparent&quot; public consultation involving all stakeholders be carried out with a view to producing guidance on how and in what circumstances biosimilar substitution should be allowed. </p> <p> The committee also urged the government to give &quot;close and careful consideration&quot; to the role of the medicines regulatory body, the TGA, &quot;with a view to ensuring that its role offers reassurance to the industry, clinicians and patient organizations that the safety of patients would not be compromised by the process for determining whether a biosimilar is suitable for substitution at pharmacy level&quot;. </p> <p> The concept of biosimilar substitution in Australia is being pursued by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), which recommends medicines for listing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australia-moves-ahead-with-biosimilar-substitution-358614" target="_new">recently published</a> the criteria for selecting products for pharmacy substitution (or &quot;a&quot;-flagging). Substitution is also part of the broader PBS Access and Sustainability Package to which the generics industry body the GMiA signed up last month. </p> <p> Promoting pharmacist substitution is a bold move: other countries have for now opted for biosimilar switching with the oversight of the prescriber, with even the generics industry urging caution until more experience has been gained with biosimilars. </p> <p> A number of stakeholders have expressed alarm over the apparent speed with which the PBAC is pursuing substitution, and over the possible safety implications. They made their feelings known at a 18 June hearing of the Senate committee, either in person or via written submissions. The committee produced a report on 23 June explaining the positions of the various parties and making some recommendations. </p> <p> The hearing was held to discuss the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015, which is part of the Access and Sustainability Package and includes a range of provisions affecting the pharmaceutical and pharmacy sector, like selected price cuts, tightening of price disclosure arrangements, and a pharmacy discount for PBS drugs. </p> <p> But it was the question of biosimilar substitution that generated most of the heat at the hearing. Schedule 2 of the bill would, as of 1 November 2015, allow the health minister to determine that specific brands of medicines (including biosimilars) are equivalent for the purposes of substitution. It also says that the minister should consider any advice from the PBAC or the TGA &ndash; submissions from sponsors can include evidence in support of bioequivalence or biosimilarity between products. </p> <p> The amendments in the bill give the minister decision-making power on equivalence decisions and the PBAC the function of providing advice to the minister on such matters &ndash; but while the amendments are not specific to biosimilars, concerns were expressed by some witnesses that they would &quot;in effect allow biosimilars to be treated in the same way as generic medicines&quot;, the committee said. </p> <p> Tim James, chief executive of the R&amp;D-based industry body Medicines Australia, for example, told the committee that while the association's members supported the &quot;effective, safe and successful entry of biosimilars into the Australian market&quot;, it did not believe the arrangements being proposed for substitution at the pharmacy level would achieve this. </p> <p> Medicines Australia was in favour of clinician-led substitution, and would back pharmacy-level substitution provided there was a transparent decision-making process &quot;supported by appropriate evidence, not absence of evidence to the contrary&quot;, Mr James said. He added that &quot;notions of safety first, of do no harm and of putting into practice the precautionary principle should always come first&quot;. </p> <p> The GMiA, representing generics manufacturers, said the issue at stake was not whether biosimilars were being adequately assessed for quality, safety and efficacy, &quot;but rather whether they would be adequately assessed as safe and effective for substitution&quot;. </p> <h2> Switching issues </h2> <p> Caution was also urged by the Consumer Health Forum of Australia, which welcomed the potential savings represented by biosimilars but had &quot;strong concerns about the safety implications of pharmacy-level substitution&quot;, according to the committee. &quot;We believe that any switching should only be done with the informed consent of the consumer and the prescribing doctor,&quot; the forum said. &quot;We know this is a complex issue, but the key point is there is not sufficient evidence of the safety of switching patients. Any move to do so would lead to an unnecessary and unacceptable increased risk of adverse outcomes for Australian patients.&quot; </p> <p> A health professional group, the Australian Rheumatology Association, said treatment decisions needed to be taken by the treating doctor and an informed patient. &quot;If switching at the pharmacy is permitted, what happens if something goes wrong? How will the pharmacovigilance be managed? it asked. &quot;If people are being swapped from month to month, from prescription to prescription without their doctor knowing, how will it be possible to know which agent is to blame if there is a problem?&quot; </p> <p> Some worries were expressed that the arrangements being proposed could impinge on the responsibilities of the TGA. Medicines Australia said the TGA's primary role was to assess quality, safety and efficacy, and that while the PBAC does this to some extent, at least where safety and efficacy are concerned, its primary remit is cost effectiveness. </p> <p> &quot;We believe, because of the significant potential safety considerations, that the role of the Therapeutic Goods Administration should not be usurped and that the primary advice should be from that organisation in terms of determining the suitability of substitution,&quot; the association remarked. </p> <p> It said that the government's policy &quot;diminishes the TGA's role in safeguarding the health of Australians and raises concerns regarding the quality of decision making and ultimately patient safety&quot;, adding that the TGA was &quot;the appropriate body to be the primary source of advice on whether the higher standard of substitutability has been established and Medicines Australia is concerned that the present proposal fails to recognise and support this critical role for the TGA&quot;. </p> <p> Some stakeholders contrasted Australia's proposal with the approach taken in other jurisdictions around the world. The international industry body IFPMA said the plan could &quot;put Australia out of step with the rest of the world which has taken a more considered approach to the issues of substitution of biosimilars and patient safety&quot;. Other countries, it said, had &quot;emphasized in their regulatory, clinical and health technology assessment guidance that such decisions to switch a given patient's therapy should be made with the involvement of the treating physician.&quot; </p> <h2> PBAC's default position </h2> <p> A key issue in all of this is that the PBAC has stated that the &quot;a-flagging&quot; (substitutability) of biosimilars would be its default position provided the data were &quot;supportive of this position&quot;. These data would include the absence of any evidence suggesting differences in the efficacy or safety of the biosimilar compared with the originator, and the availability of data to support substitution. </p> <p> Some witnesses argued that substitution should require data demonstrating safety and efficacy, rather than simply an absence of adverse data. Medicines Australia was concerned that the PBAC's default position will be that &quot;if there is no evidence that substitution is unsafe then it would recommend substitution&quot;. The association suggested that the default position should instead be that, until evidence of safety was provided, substitution should not be permitted. </p> <p> The committee noted the PBAC's recent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Biosimilars-are-safe-Australian-government-tells-the-public-359060" target="_new">statement</a> reassuring the public that biosimilars are safe, and outlining the proposed process for recommending listing a biosimilar as substitutable. Any biosimilar approved by the TGA as &quot;safe and equally effective&quot; to another medicine would be eligible for listing on the PBS, and the PBAC would also consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether it should be listed to allow substitution by a doctor or pharmacist. </p> <p> Belinda Wood, CEO of the GMiA, observed that the proposed amendment in the bill was a technical one that &quot;does not legislate that there will be a free-for-all substitution. It actually provides the mechanism for the PBAC should they determine down the track that there is evidence to support substitution. The technical amendment provides that mechanism for them,&quot; she noted. </p> <h2> View from the DoH </h2> <p> The Department of Health said that the concerns expressed by stakeholders essentially related to &quot;a matter of administrative practice as distinct from a legislative issue&quot;. In other words, the legislation &quot;made it possible for the minister to make a decision about the pharmacy-level substitutability of a biosimilar, and for the PBAC to provide advice on such matters, but it by no means mandated listing of biosimilars as substitutable&quot;. </p> <p> Deputy secretary Andrew Stuart, who heads up the DoH's medical benefits group, had some words of warning about making any legislative changes that might prevent substitution even where it is desirable. &quot;The legislation makes something possible but certainly does not mandate it, so I would say that, if you are contemplating amendments to the legislation, be very careful about making something impossible which most of the stakeholders wish to be possible under the right and controlled conditions. The debate is about what the right and controlled conditions are, and I would say that is an administrative matter, not a legislative matter.&quot; </p> <p> Medicines Australia's Mr James was of a similar mind, noting that his association had been working with the government and was &quot;seeking to work through this in such a way that it might deliver an outcome that was non-legislative&quot;. </p> <p> The DoH also explained that the ultimate choice of whether to receive a biosimilar would remain with the patient and was keen to dispel any impression that it would be mandatory: &quot;There have been concerns raised here today that because the PBAC may be of a mind to recommend substitution of a biosimilar that would somehow compel a patient to use that biosimilar. The same processes that we have for allowing clinicians to make that decision&mdash;that is, that brand substitution is not permitted&mdash;would apply to the choice of the consumer not to have that biosimilar dispensed to them. Those policy parameters are still in place just as they are for generics.&quot; </p> <h2> Recommendations </h2> <p> Summing up, the Senate committee said that the concerns expressed by stakeholders should be addressed by improving the administrative process that produces advice to the minister, rather than via legislation. It said it endorsed Medicines Australia's recommendation for a &quot;broad and transparent public consultation across all stakeholders, including industry, clinicians and patient organizations, with the aim of producing informed guidance on how and under what circumstances 'a'-flagging of biosimilar medicines could occur&quot;. </p> <p> It also recommended that the government look more closely at the role of the TGA in offering assurance that patient safety would not be compromised by the process for determining whether a biosimilar is suitable for substitution. </p> <p> As for the bill itself (more details of which will be covered in a separate article), the committee recommended that it be passed, as long as the government took steps to resolve concerns about the biosimilar substitution process. </p> <p> This article also appears in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>. </p>
