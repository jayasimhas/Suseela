<p>The pharmaceutical industry in the UK will be invited to have its say in a project that will explore concerns by England's chief medical officer that high-profile media debates over certain drugs have damaged trust in clinical researchers, drug companies and doctors. </p><p>Requesting the review, Professor Dame Sally Davies said there seemed to be a view that doctors over-medicate and are therefore hard to trust and that clinical scientists are "beset by conflicts of interest from industry funding" and are therefore untrustworthy too. </p><p>The project is being conducted by the Academy of Medical Sciences. It will look into how evidence that originates from different sources (eg randomized clinical trials and observational data) are used to make decisions about the safety and efficacy of drugs and medical interventions. </p><p>The project will start on 17 June 2015. Its findings are expected to be published shortly after December, a spokesman for the academy told <i>Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>. While drug companies will not be involved in the initial stages of the project, industry will be able to take part as the initiative progresses. The UK drug industry association, the ABPI, told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>SRA</i> that it had "spoken to the AMS about this project and we hope to be able to feed into this report and discussion". The association said that the AMS was "exploring issues that ABPI and its members have also been raising, about how evidence about medicines is established and understood across stakeholders in the context of adaptive pathways, real world evidence and precision medicine." </p><h2>Concerns</h2><p>Dame Sally wrote to the AMS in February of her concerns over the debates over certain drugs in the media and the effect they might be having. In her letter, a copy of which has been seen by <i>SRA</i>, she said was "very concerned" about the lack of resolution of the statins and side effects issues in both the medical and general press. "Coming on top of the debate about Tamiflu and the response to the ONS [Office for National Statistics] study on medication levels, there seems to be a view that doctors over-medicate so it is difficult to trust them and that clinical scientists are all beset by conflicts of interest from industry funding and are therefore untrustworthy too," Dame Sally said. </p><p>The CMO said she was "reluctantly" calling for an "authoritative independent" report looking at how society should judge the safety and efficacy of drugs as an intervention and asked the AMS to consider preparing the report. </p><p>The academy said that its fellows were also concerned by the high profile media debates on how society should judge the safety and efficacy of drugs such as statins. The academy's council "agreed that an Academy project exploring how we evaluate different sources of evidence would make a useful contribution to the debate".</p><p>The AMS project, called "Evaluating evidence", will use statins as the main case study, but may consider other examples such as infectious diseases (such as Ebola) and rare cancers. The BBC, which broke the news of the AMS review, reports that the review will also consider the risk:benefit profile of Boehringer Ingelheim's stroke drug, Actilyse (alteplase). The first stage of the project will involve small meetings on 17 June to discuss the scope of the review and to identify key questions that the project will aim to address. </p><p>At this stage, industry will not be involved. The initial meeting will involve only academy fellows, and representatives from research funders, medical royal colleges, regulators, learned societies and academic institutions. However, the AMS said it would be expanding this group to take input and evidence from other organizations and individuals as the project progresses. </p><p>The academy spokesman said there would be an "open call for evidence so any organisation or individual can contribute". He confirmed that any call for evidence would include the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p>Dame Sally's letter was addressed to AMS president Professor Sir John Tooke and copied to several individuals, including Dr David Haslam, chair of UK health technology assessment body NICE, and Professor Sir Mike Rawlins, chair of the medicines regulator, the MHRA. &ldquo;We wish to support the AMS review, and are currently clarifying with AMS the exact role we will play,&rdquo; an MHRA spokesperson told <i>SRA</i>.</p><h2>Review 'mixed news', says AllTrials founder</h2><p>Ben Goldacre, <i>Bad Science</i> author and a founder of the AllTrials campaign for transparency in clinical trials, said the initiative was "mixed news". </p><p>"On the one hand, there are many clear structural shortcomings in our efforts to implement the basic principles of evidence based medicine: from the prioritisation of research, to the running of trials, and on to evidence synthesis, dissemination, and implementation," Dr Goldacre said. "There is a huge amount of good quality evidence on these shortcomings. There are also several positive, practical things that could be done to make medicine better.Â  A good overview of this area &ndash; showing leadership and support for innovative solutions &ndash; would be great," he told <i>SRA</i>.</p><p>But there is a risk, Dr Goldacre warned. "If the output is seen to be just clumsily throwing cold water on legitimate concerns, then that will make the problem of public trust even greater, and could even hold back efforts to fix these widespread shortcomings."</p><p>Dr Goldacre said it was "particularly worrying that the Academy of Medical Sciences is now the only major professional body in the UK that has declined to sign up to the AllTrials.net campaign, which asks for only a very basic commitment, on the single biggest problem facing evidence based medicine today."</p><p>The academy's spokesman told <i>SRA</i> while it supported the principles underpinning the AllTrials petition, "our long-standing policy, affirmed by our Council, is that as a Fellowship organisation, we cannot sign up to campaigns or petitions on behalf of all Fellows. He added: "Given the importance of transparency of clinical research we drew our 1000+ Fellows' attention to the petition and encourage them to sign up in a personal capacity."</p><h2>Alteplase also in MHRA spotlight</h2><p>Boehringer Ingelhem's alteplase is also the subject of a review by the MHRA. In a statement, the company said that while the MHRA believed "the benefits of Alteplase outweigh the risks", the agency was "currently looking again at the clinical evidence". BI says it is "working closely with the MHRA on the review and we have always worked with specialists from right across the stroke community, as we continue to invest in R&D that increases the body of knowledge that helps us treat stroke better".</p><p>The BBC says the MHRA will publish the findings before the end of the year. </p><p>BI refers to news reports leading up to a BBC program due to be broadcast on 16 June that "focus on claims which suggest that the benefits of using Alteplase may be outweighed by the risk of fatal brain haemorrhage" and said alteplase played a vital role in the treatment of acute strokes. </p><p>"We are confident in our data, which is supported by the experience of clinicians who have been using our medicine to treat their patients for more than a decade," it said. "We are incredibly proud of the contribution our medicine makes to patient care at this critical time."</p><p>The company denies reports accusing it "of not being transparent with our data". "This is not the case. All our evidence which supported registration in the European Union &ndash; and confirms the positive benefit / risk profile &ndash; for our medicine is available to researchers and doctors through our transparency initiative. Information on this is available through our website here: <a href="http://tiny.cc/aehgzx" target="_new">http://tiny.cc/aehgzx</a>."</p><p>BI added: "We fully support the initiative of Dame Sally Davies&#8230; to restore public confidence in the valuable work of the research and medical communities by producing a report looking at how society should judge the safety and efficacy of medicines."</p><p><i>This article has also been published in</i><a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>.</p><p>
