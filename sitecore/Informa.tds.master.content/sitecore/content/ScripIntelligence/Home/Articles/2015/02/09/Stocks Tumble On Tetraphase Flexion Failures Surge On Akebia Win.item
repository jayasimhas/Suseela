<p>Antibiotic developer Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Inc. and arthritis pain drug maker Flexion Therapeutics Inc. were battered in after-hours trading on Sept. 8 after the companies said their lead drug candidates failed to reach statistical significance in late-stage clinical trials, but investors rewarded Akebia Therapeutics Inc. for positive mid-stage results for its anemia drug after the stock market closed.</p><p>Tetraphase had the biggest swing in stock price of the three late-day data reporting companies, falling 78.7% to $9.53 per share from its end-of-day value of $44.78, slicing about $1.3bn from the company's market cap. Flexion plunged 38.1% from its $29 close to $17.95 in after-hours trading. The bright spot was Akebia with a 68.4% jump to $13.15 after the market closed versus $7.81 at the end of the trading day, boosting its market cap from $225.6m to $379.8m.</p><p><b>Tetraphase Tanks After First Phase III Study</b></p><p>Tetraphase's antibiotic eravacycline missed the primary endpoint in the drug's second Phase III clinical trial, because it was not statistically non-inferior to levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). The result was particularly disappointing, since eravacycline was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Tetraphases-antibiotic-as-good-as-Mercks-in-Phase-III-355735" target="_new">superior to Merck & Co.'s Invanz (ertapenem)</a> in the Phase III IGNITE1 trial for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).</p><p>However, individuals in IGNITE1 were treated solely with an intravenous (IV) formulation of the antibiotic, while people treated with eravacycline in the 908-patient IGNITE2 study were given IV and oral doses of the antibiotic. Tetraphase will reveal the path forward for eravacycline after the company shares its IGNITE2 results with global regulatory agencies. </p><p>The primary endpoints required by the US FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) varied slightly &ndash; the FDA focused on clinical cure plus microbiological response, while the EMA only required a measure of microbiological response &ndash; but both agencies wanted to see a 10% non-inferiority margin at the post-treatment visit, which occurred six to eight days after patients completed antibiotic therapy. </p><p>Eravacycline did not meet either regulator's primary endpoint requirement, but president and CEO Guy Macdonald said in a statement from Tetraphase that the company still believes "eravacycline can benefit patients with serious infections, particularly those caused by difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria." </p><p>Sagient Research noted in a BioMedTracker analysis that "superiority over levofloxacin was demonstrated in a pre-specified subset of patients with quinolone-resistant pathogens" in IGNITE2, but "there was no indication that this subgroup analysis was sufficient for any continued development in this indication." It's unknown whether regulators will consider approval of eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI based on the IGNITE1 data or if a confirmatory Phase III study will be required.</p><p><b>Flexion Flounders In Knee Pain Study</b></p><p>Flexion's FX006, an intra-articular injection of a sustained-release steroid, did not provide a statistically significant improvement in osteoarthritis (OA) knee pain compared with placebo (p=0.0821), which was the primary endpoint of the company's 310-patient Phase IIb clinical trial. However, the difference between FX006 and placebo was improved (p=0.042) when patients who discontinued treatment were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Burlington, Massachusetts-based Flexion noted statistically significant improvements for the 40mg dose of FX006 versus placebo on average when pain was assessed weekly during weeks one through 12 and during weeks one through 24, which were secondary endpoints. In fact, the company said the 40mg dose of FX006 performed better than placebo each week between weeks one and 13, except for at week 12 for the primary endpoint assessment. </p><p>The 40mg dose performed better and provided a more durable improvement in knee pain than the 20mg dose, but adverse event rates were similar between the 20mg, 40mg and placebo arms of the study. There were no serious side effects and no drug-related adverse events, but the frequency of potentially drug-related events was highest in the placebo arm.</p><p>President and CEO Michael Clayman said in a statement from Flexion that the company is confident in the 40mg dose of FX006 and it plans to seek FDA approval based on all of the available data for the drug, including results from the ongoing pivotal Phase III study and a prior <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Flexions-FX006-relieves-arthritis-knee-pain-in-Phase-IIb-344430" target="_new">Phase IIb dose-finding study</a>. </p><p><b>Akebia's Anemia Drug Rebounds From Safety Concerns</b></p><p>Akebia still has a ways to go to bring its share price back from the deep dive it took in October after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Akebia-dives-following-safety-concerns-for-lead-drug-in-Phase-IIb-354715" target="_new">three people died</a> during a Phase IIb clinical trial in dialysis-independent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, the company's stock came closer to its $17 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biotech-IPOs-ride-stock-market-rollercoaster-350821" target="_new">initial public offering</a> price from March 2014 and its post-IPO high of $29.17 in June 2014 after Akebia revealed positive results with no deaths and no drug-related serious adverse events in a Phase II trial with 94 dialysis-dependent CKD patients.</p><p>Vadadustat (AKB-6548), an oral hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer, achieved the mid-stage study's primary objective, which was maintenance of stable hemoglobin (HGB) levels during a 16-week treatment window that started after conversion from injectable recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. </p><p>The primary endpoint was achieved in all three treatment arms &ndash; once-daily vadadustat starting at 300mg, once-daily vadadustat starting at 450mg, or three times weekly vadadustat starting with a 450mg dose &ndash; showing that dosing could be effective with less frequent dosing delivered at the time of dialysis treatments scheduled three times per week.</p><p>Planning already is under way for a Phase III clinical trial program in the treatment of CKD patients with anemia who are not undergoing dialysis. </p><p>Akebia president and CEO John Butler said in a statement that the company is "confident in the potential of vadadustat to treat anemia in a broad array of patients with CKD."</p><p><p><p><p>
