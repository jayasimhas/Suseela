<p><p>Just because Perrigo sees Mylan as a bad deal, doesn't mean the generic drugmaker is opposed to M&A completely. </p><p>Perrigo CEO Joe Papa touted the company's M&A record in a Sept. 17 call with shareholders. Noting that Perrigo has integrated 27 acquisitions over the last nine years. </p><p>"They all have one thing in common, we create value for the Perrigo shareholders. With that in mind, I would be surprised, as I said in the call, in a year, if Perrigo is not bigger, better and more valuable," the exec said. </p><p>Papa added, that as a public company, Perrigo has not ruled out a sale or said not at any price. "So I think it's important to say we're open for all different scenarios, but this is all about this particular transaction, the Mylan transaction that we believe is a bad deal," he added. </p><p>Four of the 27 deals Perrigo has completed have been conducted since the launch of Mylan's bid and Papa insists that, if Perrigo remains a standalone company, it will "do more" M&A. </p><p><b>Just Say No</b></p><p>Mylan is "trying to steal" Perrigo from shareholders, accuses the target's management. Perrigo pleaded with shareholders on Sept. 17 to "just say no" to Mylan's attempts to take over the company and to avoid tendering their shares. </p><p>In a conference call with investors, Perrigo CEO Joe Papa, along with the company's CFO Judy Brown, laid out arguments against the deal &ndash; arguments that Papa has been making publicly since Mylan announced its original offer of $205 per share in April. </p><p>"Yesterday's closing price at $49.01 from Mylan makes the final offer on the table $187.72 per share, again, significantly below the initial offer," said Papa on the call. "In fact, our Board's independent advisors and I all believe that the current offer on the table is not even in the right ZIP code, when compared to Perrigo's stand-alone value."</p><p>Mylan began its tender offer for Perrigo on Sept. 14. </p><p>Papa told shareholders not to be fooled by Mylan's fear tactics and coercions, while presenting the drawbacks of being included under the Mylan umbrella. He laid out an argument that showed Mylan's "disregard for shareholders", its shirking of its fiduciary duties and "litany of other questionable actions."</p><p>Mylan took several steps to protect itself from being acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals, including enacting its own poison pill and stitching. Perrigo says Mylan has destroyed more than $14bn in shareholder value through these moves. </p><p>"We think it is important for all Perrigo shareholders to understand the culture of the Mylan board and management team," he added. </p><p>As expressed in previous pleas to shareholders, Perrigo noted that Mylan's promises of $800m in synergies are overly optimistic and may be completely unrealistic. Mylan has admitted that the deal would not be accretive to earnings until year three &ndash; Perrigo argues that it may not be accretive at all. </p><p>Papa begs shareholders not to hitch their fortunes to a company that doesn't have strong growth potential.</p><p><p>
