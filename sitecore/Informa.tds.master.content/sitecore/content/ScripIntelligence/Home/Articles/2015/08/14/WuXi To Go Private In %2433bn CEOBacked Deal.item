<p>Eight years after WuXi PharmaTech went public on the US stock market, the Shanghai-based clinical research organization (CRO) will become a private company again in a $3.3bn acquisition proposed by various private equity investors and WuXi executives, including chairman and CEO Ge Li.</p><p>New WuXi Life Science Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary WuXi Merger Limited will pay $5.75 per ordinary share and $46 per American depository share (ADS) to acquire WuXi Pharmatech. The deal values the CRO at 16.5% above its ADS value of $39.50 on April 29. WuXi's US shares gained 6.2% on Aug. 14 to close at $43.86 per ADS after the company's buyout was announced.</p><p>The buyers are a consortium that includes new investors Ally Bridge Group Capital Partners, Boyu Capital, Temasek Life Sciences Private Limited and Ping An Insurance, and existing shareholder Hillhouse Fund II. They are joined by WuXi founders and executives that will roll their shares of the company into the new ownership group: Li; executive vice president and director Xiaozhong Liu; senior vice president, domestic marketing head and director Zhaohui Zhang; and senior vice president, human resources head and director Ning Zhao.</p><p>"We do not believe the management-led buyer group is getting the company cheap," Jefferies analyst David Windley said in an Aug. 14 report.</p><p>WuXi "is building a very, very diverse growth business. We believe that diversity, further complicated by the exchange volatility, makes finding an ample public investor audience difficult," Windley wrote.</p><p>He noted that the company has committed to diversifying its operations through businesses that are characterized by slow growth, such as genomic analysis and cancer diagnostics, so public market investors seeking significant value increases in relatively short periods of time are dissuaded.</p><p>Current WuXi shareholders and ADS owners will receive cash for their shares. The buyers will finance the cash payouts with debt and equity. A special committee of independent members of WuXi's board of directors negotiated the agreement and recommended its approval to the board, which voted unanimously to approve the transaction. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015.</p><p>WuXi confirmed on April 30 that it received a buyout offer of $46 per ADS to make the company private again. WuXi CEO Li and Ally's founder and CEO Frank Yu said in an April 29 letter to the company's board that the deal would "provide superior value to the company's shareholders," but offered no justification for why WuXi's stock owners would obtain greater benefit from selling their stakes in the CRO. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Wuxi-completes-212.3-million-IPO-36046" target="_new">WuXi went public</a> at $14 per share in Aug. 2007, so the CRO was trading at more than three times its ADS value on Aug. 14 when the acquisition and privatization of the company was announced. </p><p>WuXi has grown through various acquisitions, including the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/WuXi-mastering-genomic-analysis-market-with-NextCODE-buy-356125" target="_new">$65m acquisition</a> of genomic analysis firm NextCODE Health in January, and through construction of new research and manufacturing facilities, such as a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/WuXi-eases-CAR-T-manufacturing-burden-with-new-US-plant-357290" target="_new">cell therapy manufacturing site</a> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that was announced in March.</p><p><p><p><p>
