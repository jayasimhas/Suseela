<p>Novartis AG has been granted European approval for two products it picked up via a $20bn mega deal transaction with GlaxoSmithKline plc, a deal which closed in March this year. </p><p><i>Tafinlar</i> (dabrafenib) and <i>Mekinist</i> (trametinib) both former GSK products, have been approved by the European Commission for use in combination to treat adults with metastatic melanoma. </p><p>While around 200,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed globally each year, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-to-face-PD1-competition-for-Mekinist-and-Tafinlar-combo-359618" target="_new">not predicting a transformative sales impact</a> following the approval of Novartis's new therapy considering pricing pressures on oncological drugs and competition from newer anti-PD1 (programmed death 1) treatments.</p><p>Tafinlar and Mekinist won a green light from the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), back in July as combination treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.</p><p>Novartis believes that Tafinlar and Mekinist, which are both already approved as monotherapies, are potential blockbusters. However, Datamonitor does not think the new combo indication will bring more than a modest boost to sales of the two drugs.</p><p>The combination therapy has already been granted approval in the US, Australia, Canada and several other countries.</p><p>Marketing authorization in Europe is based on results from the Phase III COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies, in which the Tafinlar/Mekinist combination demonstrated overall survival (OS) benefit compared to Tafinlar and Daiichi-Sankyo's Zelboraf (vemurafenib) monotherapies respectively in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p>
