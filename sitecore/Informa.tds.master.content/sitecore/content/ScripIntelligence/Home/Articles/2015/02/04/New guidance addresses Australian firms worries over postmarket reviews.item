<p> A new version of the Australian framework for post-market reviews, which are used to monitor marketed medicines in order to improve the quality of their use and help ensure the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, is expected to be published soon following its adoption by the government and the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p> The updated guidance, which was produced by the industry/government Access to Medicines Working Group, addresses a number of concerns that had been expressed by the pharmaceutical industry, relating mainly to processes, timelines and opportunity for input into post-market reviews. </p><p> Martin Cross, chair of Medicines Australia, welcomed the new framework, saying the industry had grown &quot;increasingly frustrated over recent years with the ad-hoc approach to post-market reviews&quot;, and that while there had been gradual process improvements, until now there had been no agreed overarching framework and only limited transparency in terms of how reviews were conducted. </p><p> Health minister Sussan Ley said the AMWG, which was set up by the Department of Health and the industry body Medicines Australia in 2006 to look at issues regarding timely and appropriate access to new medicines via the PBS, had produced a &quot;significantly improved&quot; version of the framework. </p><p> &quot;Post-market reviews are important,&quot; Ms Ley said. &quot;By looking at how medicines are being used once they are listed on the PBS, we can ensure the quality use of medicines and the ongoing sustainability of the PBS.&quot; She said the new framework was regarded by the government as the first milestone to be achieved by the group since it was revamped recently as a forum for the discussion of PBS policies with the pharmaceutical industry. </p><h2> Collaborative approach </h2><p> Both parties stressed the importance of collaboration in producing the desired result. Ms Ley pointed to &quot;the successful outcomes that can be achieved when government and industry work together to solve a joint area of concern&quot;, while Dr Cross said the reinvigorated AMWG had shown it was a successful format and had established a &quot;strong process for working together to achieve mutual goals&quot;. </p><p> &quot;Medicines Australia has consistently shown over recent years that it can work constructively with the government to ensure the sustainability of the PBS,&quot; Dr Cross declared, although he cautioned that it was now vital to continue the momentum gained through the AMWG to ensure medicines were quickly listed on the PBS. </p><p> The post-market review process is a mechanism for medicines to be considered in their prevailing treatment context, including actual utilization, comparative efficacy, treatment guidelines, and health outcomes, and to provide for measures addressing any concerns arising, such as better education on medicines or revised restrictions on their use. </p><p> The reviews are intended to reach a better understanding of adverse events, ensure targeted medicines usage and avoid waste, improve cost-effectiveness through better management of clinical and economic uncertainty, and maintain &quot;a responsible and viable medicines industry&quot;, the government says. Reviews of cost-effectiveness ensure that the cost of medicines to the PBS appropriately reflects the health outcomes expected and subsequently produced, the government says. </p><p> The main drivers for post-market reviews are recommendations by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) or issues identified by the PBAC's drug utilization subcommittee during routine monitoring. Reviews can be triggered by a range of factors such as concerns over quality use of a medicine, cost- or clinical effectiveness, or higher than expected utilization. </p><h2> Other priority areas for AMWG </h2><p> The AMWG is working on a number of other areas relating to the PBS where concerns have been raised by industry, including early access to new drugs through a managed access program and the interpretation of Section 99ACB of the National Health Act, which provides for a mandatory 16% price cut on new bioequivalent or biosimilar brands of PBS-listed drugs. </p><p> At its meeting last December, the group reported that &quot;substantive progress&quot; had been made on developing a workable framework for the proposed managed access program, and that the aim was to put a final proposed framework to the PBAC for consideration at its meeting in March. </p><p> The program has evolved out of the earlier managed entry scheme that was introduced in 2011 for drugs with a high clinical need but where a PBS listing price had not yet been established, in order to allow some drugs to have an earlier PBS listing. Under this scheme, the PBAC could recommend coverage of a drug at a price justified by existing evidence pending the submission of more conclusive evidence on cost-effectiveness that could justify a higher price in future. </p><p> However, the industry had numerous concerns about the managed entry schemes &ndash; such as uncertainty about the mechanisms for sponsors to be able to renegotiate a price that reflected the value of their drug &ndash; and so companies tended to be reluctant to use it. Details of how the new scheme might represent an improvement over its predecessor are thin on the ground, but things should become clearer once the PBAC releases the final proposed framework. </p><h2> Section 99ACB price reductions </h2><p> Section 99ACB says that a new brand of a pharmaceutical product that is bioequivalent or biosimilar to an existing brand of an existing pharmaceutical product with the same active ingredient and mode of administration that is listed on the PBS will have to be priced 16% below the existing product. </p><p> According to Medicines Australia, the provision was established to allow the government to benefit financially when generic medicines are launched, to provide headroom for new innovative drugs on Formulary F1 (those that have only one brand of each form and strength and are not part of a therapeutic group with multiple brands), and to allow for single-brand medicines to be protected from unsustainable pricing actions before generic competition kicks in. </p><p> However, it says that the Department of Health has been interpreting Section 99ACB in a way that erodes the basis of the F1 Formulary by treating new presentations of branded products as generic competitors, even though these often bring an improvement in the delivery of the medicine or are a response to safety concerns or changes in technology. </p><p> A while back, it claimed that some member companies had considered not launching certain new presentations because their listing &ndash; for example in the case of an auto-injector pen for a single branded medicine &ndash; would incur a &quot;commercially unviable 16% statutory price reduction&quot;, even though the new product was not facing generic competition, did not impose any additional cost to the PBS and did not extend the patent. It said that action was needed to reach a solution whereby incremental technology improvements and innovations did not trigger unreasonable price penalties. </p><p> Tripartite meetings between the Generic Medicines Industry Association, Medicines Australia and the DoH took place on 14 November and 1 December last year to discuss industry's concerns about how the provision is working, at which the parties said that agreement was needed on the intent of any future legislation on this matter, and that things should be resolved by the time of the AMWG's March meeting. However, the AMWG warned that &quot;substantial progress&quot; would have to be made in early 2015 if this deadline was to be met. </p>
