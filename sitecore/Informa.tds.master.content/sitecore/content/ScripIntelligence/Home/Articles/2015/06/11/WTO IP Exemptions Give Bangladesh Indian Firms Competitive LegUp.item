<p>The WTO Council's recent decision permitting least-developed country (LDC) members a 17-year exemption from implementing intellectual property (IP) provisions, such as patents, on medicines is expected to give Bangladesh's up-and-coming pharm industry valuable buffer time to catch up with and possibly take on some peers in the region. </p><p>The extension for LDCs, some experts say, could also potentially serve as a useful window of opportunity for Indian generic firms if stymied by newer treaties such as the recent Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). </p><p>Dr Shawkat Haider, general manager (business development) at Bangladesh's Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, said that although the Bangladesh industry has been producing some of the old and conventional active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) on a commercial scale, it is "far from" synthesizing new and patented drugs, and meeting growing demand. </p><p>"Lack of sufficient backward integration into APIs remains a major challenge. The API constitutes a significant percentage of the total cost in medicine production and the competitiveness in the generic drug industry largely depends on API backward linkage," Haider told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Bangladesh industry, he explained, also requires, among others, infrastructure such as a central bioequivalence centre, state-of-the-art drug testing labs and an "FDA-like" regulatory agency. </p><p>"There is still a long way to go for the Bangladesh industry to operate across the pharma value chain and to establish itself as a strong technological base. This additional 17-year IP waiver would definitely help industry address many of these challenges and equip itself to be more competitive in the future in order to provide affordable medicines," said Haider.</p><p>The WTO Council recently extended until January 2033 the period during which key provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement do not apply to pharmaceutical products in LDCs. LDCs can choose whether or not to protect pharmaceutical patents and clinical trial data before 2033. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/LDCs-open-ended-waiver-of-WTO-IPRs-drug-prices-poverty-and-more-357051" target="_new">Bangladesh</a> had earlier led the LDC charge seeking an extension of the transitional period to enforce IP rights on medicines. </p><h2>Cost Advantage</h2><p>Haider also expects Bangladesh's cost advantage to be a big draw for alliances as the local industry scales and matures; an uptick in outsourcing to Bangladesh once it fully develops its API-linkage segment is predicted.</p><p>"The cost of production is at least three-four times lower than that in China or India and a fraction of the cost in developed countries. We are confident that as the industry progresses maintaining a high degree of compliance and quality standards, with increasing number of international accreditations, we will see more partnerships/alliance in the coming years." </p><p>There are already some examples of the Bangladesh industry's prowess and cost benefits it can offer. </p><p>For example, cholesterol lowering drug Crestor 10mg (rosuvastatin) tablet costs around $7.25 in the US versus a comparable Bangladeshi generic price of $0.25 while diabetes drug Januvia 50mg (sitagliptin) is priced at $11.25 against the local generic price of $0.25, previous data from Bangladesh indicated.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshi-Firms-Roll-Out-12-13-Harvoni-Generic-360279" target="_new">Bangladeshi firms</a> have also launched generic versions of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni at a fraction of the innovator product and the WTO extension is expected further to facilitate such efforts. </p><p>"For a poor country like Bangladesh, it would be impossible to afford such expensive medicines had they not been manufactured in the country. Like these revolutionary drugs, there are a number of patented biological drugs for chronic diseases and cancer which may be produced in the country and made accessible to the people," Haider said.</p><p>Like its Asian neighbour India, bulk of Bangladesh's 160m population pays for medical treatment out of their own pockets. The poverty rate in Bangladesh was over 26% in 2013, with nearly 25 million people living in extreme poverty. </p><p>MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res has previously said that only a 17 year exemption for LDCs on implementing IP for pharmaceuticals is essentially "kicking the can down the road", forcing this difficult debate to resurface. The NGO believes that these nations must be granted an exemption until they graduate from their status as LDCs.</p><h2>Indian Generics</h2><p>Significantly, some industry experts believe there may be something to gain for large Indian firms as well from the LDC extension, especially once the "real hit" of pacts such as the TPP set in.</p><p>"It's certainly a great opportunity for firms in Bangladesh and in some African nations. But it could also present a small counter strategy, if Indian firms want to build on an opportunity as they take on the full impact of the TPP," Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic firms, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The full text of the 12-nation <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/TPPs-Details-On-Patent-Linkage-Reimbursement-Revealed-361402" target="_new">TPP agreement</a> was recently revealed and US consumer watchdog Public Citizen claimed that the transparency annex's provisions in the pact favour drug and device makers over consumers. </p><p>Shah believes that Indian firms could explore setting up greenfield sites or collaborating with local firms in LDCs to cash in on certain opportunities, though clearly these can't compensate for business in the bigger markets. India's top ranked firm Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd already has a site in Bangladesh.</p><p>In addition to LDC-to-LDC supplies, Shah says such facilities may prove useful when making supplies for "government use" in some nations or in the case of countries not covered in the broad patent sweep of brand name firms.</p><p>Typically large brand name firms tend to pursue patents in around 50 or so key markets, he indicated.</p><p>Other experts pointed to medium term gains in setting up sites in LDCs. </p><p>Cipla's chairman, Dr Yusuf Hamied, said that some of the LDCs would have matured by the time of the transition period provided by the WTO and before patented products actually become available there, potentially making them interesting domestic markets.</p><p>"Markets like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and Bangladesh could be examples," Hamied told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The WTO's General Council is also expected to extend an existing waiver for LDCs concerning exclusive marketing rights for pharmaceuticals, and to agree to a new waiver for LDCs regarding "mailbox" measures for receiving patent applications in this field. These two waivers will "complement and buttress" the effect of the decision to exclude obligations concerning pharmaceutical patenting, and will also run until 2033, a WTO statement said.</p>
