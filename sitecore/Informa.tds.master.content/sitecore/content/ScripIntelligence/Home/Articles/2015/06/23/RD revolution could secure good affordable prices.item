<p>Companies that want to offer payers a more attractive price to secure market access for their new innovations should try a whole new approach to R&D. Step away from the randomized control trial, consult with patients and exploit data already out there, says Stuart Dollow, chief executive and founder of Vermilion Life Sciences, and you could potentially afford more flexibility on price. </p><p>Companies are facing an increasingly uphill and complex struggle to convince payers to stump up for their expensive innovations. High prices, they say, are the only way to make a return on their investments and shoulder high costs of both the failures and successes of R&D. But if companies change the way they do their R&D to save time and money, they could lower their prices and still recoup investments, says Dr Dollow.</p><p>The Reengineering Medicines Development model, driven by the UK's pharmaceutical industry association, the ABPI, and Vermilion Life Sciences, aims to inspire companies to embrace the change. It puts forward a more "phased" approach to late-stage R&D that staggers access to a medicine over time based on ongoing research and regulatory assessments. It allows companies to de-risk and get an earlier return on their investments. Drug candidates can "fail fast or file fast," making the R&D process more efficient because companies can free up time and money by rapidly dropping failures and earn a quicker return on successful candidates. Dr Dollow says it could cut the cost of a Phase III study up to 25% in terms of time and cash saved. This approach is also less risky as it does not "open the floodgates" to lots of patients before any label changes or restrictions are necessary, says Dr Dollow. </p><p>The approach may well sound familiar as the principle is similar to that of adaptive pathways and conditional licensing. What makes this model different is that it reduces reliance on randomized control trials, puts a greater emphasis on real-world evidence and takes a "more upfront patient consultative approach" that identifies value drivers for patients, explains Dr Dollow.</p><p>Letting patients help shape late-stage R&D programs can help companies determine measures that are relevant to them beyond the standard regulatory or health economic measures. Dr Dollow points to diabetes patients who care about standard regulatory measures like their blood glucose levels, but who also care very deeply about the day-to-day peripheral neuropathy that stops them walking, leaving the house or going to work. Gathering data on measures important to patients can help a company gauge the value of the product and whether it is worth continuing with. It also arms the company with quality of life data that can assure payers and regulators about the product's value and impact on patients. </p><p>The model also advocates a blended approach to research based both on observational studies and RCTs, using real-world evidence from existing databases like the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, the English NHS observational data and interventional research service, designed to exploit anonymized NHS clinical data and link it to different types of observational research). These databases allow companies to produce a "bespoke" trial design based on the disease, the available comparators and the available measures, says Dr Dollow. For example, a company developing a PCSK9 inhibitor likely to be used in patients who do not benefit from statins may find a wealth of statin non-responders in general practice or health insurer databases who could be used as comparators receiving standard of care. Such an approach could evaluate the new product's relative effectiveness against a number of clinically relevant comparators while new launches can be incorporated into the trial. In addition, companies can save on recruitment time and costs.</p><p>Another important element is stratifying patients to identify specific populations with more favorable benefit-risk profiles. Not only does this increase the drug's efficacy, but it also limits potential safety issues and ineffective use. This in turn proves attractive to payers who can save money while the drug's limited use opens greater possibilities for a better unit price. Stratification can also make initially less promising products more viable to develop. Dr Dollow also points out that companies don't necessarily have to rely on biomarkers or genomics to stratify successfully. Other methods based on demographics are available too, for example using age, race, sex and disease history.</p><p>For the approach to be successful, health technology appraisal bodies and payers need to come to the table early to assess the "headroom" for value and the impact that price may have on cost-effectiveness, says Dr Dollow. A "value indicator scale" which would identify the expected health value that the product would generate should be agreed in advance, he says.</p><p><p>
