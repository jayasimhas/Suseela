<p>After a stormy year in China, GlaxoSmithKline has gone through major changes including the global transfer of its oncology assets to Novartis. But the underlying broader reasons for the company's newly reported layoffs in China could be more deep-rooted and far-reaching.</p><p>GSK is in the process of downsizing its operations in China with plans to let go roughly 1,000 people, local media have reported.</p><p>The plans include the laying off of 450 people in the first quarter and more in the second quarter, noted the Chinese economy and finance magazine Caixin, citing multiple sources. The affected employees are waiting for details of compensation, Caixin added. GSK China currently notes that it has around 7,000 employees in total in China.</p><p>Amid the aftermath of a compliance probe and a large fine, the UK drug maker has drastically revamped its compensation mechanisms, terminating sales reps that are said to be non-compliant with company rules and delinking sales reps' pay from sales performance.</p><p>But some dismissed reps, unsatisfied with the decisions, have filed complaints with local Chinese courts, according to local media reports.</p><p>GSK has not responded to requests for comments despite multiple attempts.</p><p>Company chief scientific officer and president of ViiV Healthcare David Redfern said on 14 January that the company had "bounced back in China," but provided no details about the outlook for 2015 during a Q&A session with investors at the recent JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco.</p><p>But largely affected by the $485m fine and lingering impact from the compliance probe in China, GSK revenues in this market were largely under water for the first half of 2014, plunging by 20%. Although sales stabilized in the third quarter, rising by 1%, GSK's established products fell across the board, by 14%.</p><p>GSK's reported move to cut staff in China comes amid predictions of a general economic slowdown in the country and hot on the heels of Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has recently confirmed that it's shrinking its local operations.</p><h2>oncology assets to Novartis</h2><p>One major change for GSK in 2014 was a multi-billion deal with Novartis in which the Swiss firm will acquire GSK's oncology portfolio.</p><p>As both GSK and Novartis are highly visible in China, the deal has received mixed reviews locally. More broadly, the oncology divestment caught analysts by surprise. "Exiting oncology always looks surprising in the current world that favors specialty care so much," wrote Bryan Garnier analyst Eric Le Berrigaud in an April note to investors.</p><p>GSK's anticancer portfolio in China includes the oral supportive anti-emetic therapy Zofran (ondansetron) and chemotherapies Hycamtin (topotecan), promoted by local partner Eddingpharm International Holdings Ltd., andLeukeran (chlorambucil). GSK has also out-licensed the China rights to breast cancer drug Tykerb (lapatinib) to Eddingpharm.</p><p>Hit by domestic competition and price cuts, Zofran sales have been sluggish, but Hycamtin will add strength to Novartis as a quickly growing cancer therapy, noted director of Research Works George Baeder in an earlier interview with Scrip's sister publication PharmAsia News. </p><p>Compared to Zofran's CNY2.25m ($363,000), Hycamtin sold CNY18m in 2013, according to IMS Health data.</p><h2>unprecedented pressures</h2><p>Besides the divested oncology products, GSK in China markets the respiratory therapy Seretide (fluticasone/salmeterol), anti-infectives such as Heptodin (lamivudine) and Hepsera (adefovir dipivoxil), and skin disorder treatments.</p><p>However, except for Tykerb, which was launched in 2013 for breast cancer, GSK hasn't launched new products to the Chinese market. Its large-selling human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Cervarix is also still waiting for a regulatory approval from the China FDA.</p><p>As China is reforming drug pricing mechanisms, relinquishing pricing powers from regulators to payers and hospitals, the pressure on off-patent originator products from multinationals could also be mounting, providing another possible source of stress on GSK's business.</p><p>Without supplementary policies to eliminate current drug sale markups and provide hospitals additional funding, hospitals are inclined to bargain with suppliers for a lower drug price.</p><p>Combining that with other cost-control measures such as global budgeting, and emerging harsh price-cutting tender pilots such as that in Sanming, Fujian province, the price pressure on branded generic products in particular could be unprecedented. </p><p>Squeezed by the lack of new products coming through and rising costs, multinationals are therefore moving to slim down their operations in China and focus on core strengths, industry insiders say.</p><p>"The challenge for most multinationals is that their coverage is reaching its maximum. This issue is coming from the limitation on how many more sales people you can add in the field," then MSD-Simcere Joint Venture chief operating officer Renuad Sermondade told PharmAsia News in an earlier interview. Mr Sermondade is now vice-president of Sanofi China.</p><p>"This is reinforced by the fact that the prices of mature products are under a lot of pressure and are frequently being reduced, while the cost of a sales team and other expenses are going up."</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
