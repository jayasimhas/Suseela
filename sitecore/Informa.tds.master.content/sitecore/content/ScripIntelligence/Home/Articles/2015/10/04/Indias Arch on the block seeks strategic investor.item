<p>The Indian intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) manufacturing firm, Arch Pharmalabs, is on the block &ndash; apparently coming full circle from the heady days when it drew significant private equity interest to when it saw key investor Japan's Mitsui & Co quietly exit, apparently for a song.</p><p>Arch's chairman and managing director Ajit Kamath confirmed to <i>Scrip</i> that a mandate had been given to Avendus Capital for the proposed divestment and that the company was keen to "rediscover value."</p><p>However, he maintained that he'd prefer a strategic investor who came in with a minority stake at this stage and noted the firm's "track record" in terms of site approvals. Four of Arch's facilities are FDA approved, Mr Kamath said.</p><p>One of the approved sites is said to be located in Dombivli, near Mumbai &ndash; a unit acquired from Watson Pharma in 2009. Arch has a total of 11 manufacturing facilities, its website said.</p><p>While Arch's revenues have slid from a peak of around INR19bn ($305m) some years ago to around INR5bn currently, its debt stands at around INR28bn. The company was reported to have approached the corporate debt restructuring cell in April 2013 and a restructuring package had been subsequently approved later that year. The current status of the implementation of the CDR effort could not immediately be ascertained.</p><p>Tarun Shah, founder of MP Advisors, an Indian strategic business advisory firm, told <i>Scrip</i> that firms like Arch, predominantly in the API and intermediates business, which received US FDA approval once again in April 2015 for two plants, could potentially draw valuations in the region of INR11bn.</p><p>"This, of course, is way below the hey days when Arch was backed by private equity firms and strategic investors such as Mitsui & Co," Mr Shah said.</p><p>Arch was previously backed by private equity investors - ICICI Venture, IL&FS and SwissTec Ventures, who now hold a residual holding of around 8%.</p><p>However, some experts were less upbeat on the firm's sale and valuation prospects and believe piecemeal divestments of Arch sites that hold regulatory approvals may probably be the viable option.</p><p>"The acquisition of an FDA-approved site may make sense for an Indian firm that is looking at de-risking its business, given the spate of regulatory issues over the past in India," one investment banker told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Details on Arch's latest plant approvals could not immediately be verified by <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Last year the Japanese trading to investment to services conglomerate, Mitsui & Co, confirmed <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mitsui-exits-Indias-Arch-for-a-song-352702%5d" target="_new">exiting</a> Arch. The divestment that came less than two years since Mitsui substantially raised its holding in Arch, though the Japanese group did not state the reason for its exit or the financial details for the sell-back to Arch's promoter group. Industry sources had then claimed that the deal was done at a significant "haircut."</p><p>Mitsui, which began using Arch to provide contract manufacturing services to Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers in 2005, had in 2010 acquired a 5.25% stake in Arch by subscribing to a third party allocation of its shares, though this holding dipped to 4.67% after Arch increased its capital. In January 2013, Mitsui acquired an additional 27.29% of the shares of Arch for INR3.7bn (about &yen;5.9bn then) raising its stake in the firm to 31.96%.</p>
