<p>Japanese major Daiichi-Sankyo is preparing to cut up to 1,200 mainly sales positions in the US ahead of the loss of exclusivity for blockbuster antihypertensive Benicar, and amid a shift in its business model away from primary care and toward specialty products.</p><p><p>Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. has unveiled plans to cut at least 1,000 and potentially up to 1,200 positions from its commercial operations in the US, in what the company said is part of a strategic effort to move away from a maturing primary care business to "a differentiated specialty portfolio." </p><p><p>Although it did not mention Benicar (olmesartan) by name &ndash; referring only to the upcoming loss of exclusivity of "our largest product" &ndash; the move is clearly in preparation for the generic sales hit to the angiotensin II antagonist antihypertensive.</p><p><p>The main single product, which is also sold in various fixed-dose combinations, will see its first loss of exclusivity in the US in around a year's time, in October 2016.</p><p><p>The impact is likely to be substantial. Daiichi Sankyo is currently forecasting US sales of Benicar and Benicar HCT (with hydrochlorothiazide) of $608m in the current fiscal year, which accounts for around 8% of the company's total projected global revenues for the period.</p><p><p>There is no potential blockbuster successor in place and the portfolio and pipeline is geared much more towards smaller specialty indications away from primary care, such as antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents, pain management and oncology.</p><p><p>US commercial president Ken Keller said in a statement that the restructuring aimed to create a "smaller, highly targeted and efficient" operation with greater emphasis on customer-facing roles.</p><p><p>US commercial operations will bear the brunt of the cuts, mainly affecting the main sales office in Parsippany, New Jersey and other sales offices nationwide. Job losses will be through both voluntary and involuntary redundancies and the elimination of open positions, with those affected to receive outplacement services and other support.</p><p><p>US R&D and manufacturing functions, concentrated in Edison, New Jersey and Bethlehem, Philadelphia, will escape unscathed.</p><p><p>Daiichi Sankyo's Japanese headquarters told PharmAsia News that there was no particular target for total expense reduction in the US, and no current plans for workforce reductions in other countries, which in some cases have already undergone separate restructuring moves over the past few years. </p><p><p>However, the firm's current mid-term business plan does call for selling, general and administrative expenses to be cut from 59% of net sales in fiscal 2012 to 48% in fiscal 2017.</p><p><p>The company said it would disclose the overall impact of the new US program on its financial guidance at a later date.</p><p><h2>Cliff Ahead</h2><p><p>Following the 2016 US patent expiry, Datamonitor is predicting that US sales of olmesartan will fall to $283m in calendar 2017, when expiries will also hit sales in other major markets. Daiichi Sankyo has at least successfully defended against a pre-expiry generic challenge from Mylan Laboratories Ltd., meaning that no generic launches are expected before the actual expiry, Datamonitor notes. </p><p><p>Benicar currently dominates Daiichi Sankyo Inc.'s business in the US, with olmesartan-containing products as a whole making up around 60% of the subsidiary's revenues in the fiscal first quarter ended June 30. But US local currency sales of Benicar/HCT are already beginning to feel the pressure, falling 12% in the period amid same class generic competition.</p><p><p>The company seems to have been preparing the ground for the patent cliff for some time under its expenses reduction program. A <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Olmesartan-expiry-in-mind-as-Daiichi-Sankyo-shakes-up-356956" target="_new">fundamental structural shakeup</a> and streamlining focusing on its Japanese operations was implemented in February, and around 500 people in the country have applied for an early retirement scheme. </p><p><p>Elsewhere, it has taken a modest step to shore up the US primary care business through <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AZ-Daiichi-Sankyo-sign-US-Movantik-deal-357406" target="_new">an agreement</a> earlier this year to co-promote AstraZeneca's novel drug for opioid-induced constipation, Movantik (naloxegol). </p><p><p>The disastrous foray into generics through the Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. acquisition has also been concluded with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Daiichi-set-for-3.6bn-cash-out-of-Sun-357965" target="_new">final sale of the Indian firm</a> to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.</p><p><h2>Specialty Care</h2><p><p>As well as already US-marketed products Effient (prasugrel) and Savaysa (edoxaban), Daiichi Sankyo's move towards specialty care in the US includes the development of mirogabalin in Phase III for fibromyalgia, and the opioid-mu regulator CL-108 (licensed from Charleston Laboratories Inc.) in Phase III for acute pain.</p><p><p>A portfolio of oncology products has also come with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/410m-Ambit-deal-bolsters-Daiichi-Sankyos-oncology-presence-354176" target="_new">$410m acquisition last year of Ambit</a>, in a strategic push into this high-growth sector.</p><p><p>The Japanese firm has previously said it will seek further alliances, internal R&D and acquisitions to bolster its realigned US presence.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.
