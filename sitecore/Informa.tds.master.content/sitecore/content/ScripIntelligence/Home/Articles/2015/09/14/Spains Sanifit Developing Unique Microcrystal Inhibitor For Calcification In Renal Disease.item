<p>Spain's fledgling life sciences biotech company Laboratoris Sanifit SL is developing a drug for vascular calcification that has a unique mode of action; it acts to inhibit pathological crystallization processes rather than targeting a receptor, enzyme or protein.</p><p>"Our target is crystal formation in the vessel wall, a process that is not targeted by other agents," said founder and CEO Joan Perello. "The lack of effective therapies is the reason why cardiovascular diseases linked to calcification continue to be an unmet medical need," he added in an interview.</p><p>Patients with end-stage renal disease being treated with dialysis have high levels of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality linked to cardiovascular calcification, particularly of the blood vessels of the heart. Around 4% of patients progress to develop calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriopathy), a rare and devastating condition with a median life expectancy of around one year.</p><p>Although phosphate binders and calcimimetics are already available to treat ESRD patients and indirectly reduce calcification by reducing phosphate and calcium blood levels, they do not target crystal formation, Perello noted. Sanifit's compound inhibits the growth of calcium phosphate (calcium hydroxyapatite) microcrystals in soft tissue. It only affects growing crystals and not established crystals, so they are not expected to adversely affect bone, he added.</p><p>Around one million patients in the US, Europe and Japan have ESRD, and Sanifit estimates the market opportunity for its microcrystal inhibitor to be worth more than &euro;2bn ($2.5bn).</p><h2>Two Indications Pursued</h2><p>Mallorca-based Sanifit will pursue two indications with its lead compound SNF472 (the hexasodium salt of myo-inositol hexaphosphate), the treatment of cardiovascular disease linked to calcification in ESRD, and the orphan indication, calciphylaxis.</p><p>SNF472 has been well tolerated in a Phase Ia study in healthy volunteers, and is currently being evaluated in a Phase Ib/IIa pharmacology study in hemodialysis patients.</p><p>And, with new funding that it has just raised, Sanifit intends to launch a Phase IIb study with SNF472 by the end of the year in 350-400 dialysis patients with ESRD. This will be conducted at 70-100 medical sites in Europe and the US, and will run for around three years, Perello said.</p><p>In parallel, it will conduct Phase II and Phase III studies of SNF472 in the orphan indication calciphylaxis, in the US, Germany, Spain and the UK. Taking the product further, through registration and into marketing for calciphylaxis, and a Phase III study in ESRD patients on dialysis, will likely require a development partner although plans have not been finalized, Perello said.</p><h2>Known To Chemists</h2><p>Compounds that inhibit crystallization have been known to the chemistry community since the 1930s but have not been applied to therapeutic use, and it's probably no surprise to find Perello is a chemist by training; Sanifit has patents on their medical applications.</p><p>The target's uniqueness is doubtless one of the reasons why the Spanish company has attracted funding from a consortium of international venture capital investors, many of them investing in the West European country for the first time.</p><p>Sanifit announced Sept. 8 that it had raised &euro;36.6m ($41.3m) in a Series C round led by Barcelona-based Ysios Capital, and supported by new investors including Lundbeckfond Ventures, Forbion Capital Partners, Gilde Healthcare, Edmond de Rothschild Investment Partners and Baxter Ventures.</p><p>The investment round was also backed by local Spanish business angels that have supported the company since it was spun out of the University of the Balearic Islands in 2007, where Perello is professor of analytical and clinical chemistry. It is also supported by the venture arm of "la Caixa", one of the largest retail banks in Spain. Mallorca is one of the Balearic Islands, located off the southeastern coast of Spain.</p><p>Russell Greig, previously president of the GlaxoSmithKline PLC's VC group SR One and of GSK's international pharmaceutical business, has been appointed Sanifit's chairman. The company has previously developed an oral anti-tartar dental product and has a nutraceutical SNF671 in development for osteoporosis.</p><p><i>This article is also being published in "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
