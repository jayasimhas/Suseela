<p> Before applying for an interim injunction, pharmaceutical companies may want to take note of a recent Court of Appeal ruling that upheld a &pound;27m damages award made to Krka and Consilient in compensation for delays to the launch of their generic version of AstraZeneca's Nexium (esomeprazole). </p><p> The ruling raises a number of considerations for originator firms where wrongly-issued injunctions are lifted by the courts, not least the possibility of being faced with a hefty damages bill that could more than offset the financial gains from preventing a generic launch during the injunction period. </p><p> While pharma firms have traditionally resorted to interim injunctions more or less as a matter of course when launching infringement proceedings, the possibility of substantial damages could well make them think twice before doing so. </p><p> In the case at hand, Krka and Consilient had attempted to market Krka's generic version of Nexium, Emozul capsules, in the UK in September 2010, but AstraZeneca, which held a patent that was due to expire in 2014, began infringement proceedings and obtained an interim injunction to stop the product being sold pending trial. </p><p> It is common practice in injunction cases that the applicant agrees to a cross-undertaking promising to compensate the defendant for any losses incurred if the injunction is subsequently discharged or found to have been wrongly granted. In this case, while they did not believe they were infringing the patent, Krka and Consilient (the defendants) agreed to submit to the injunction and requested a cross-undertaking, which AstraZeneca gave. </p><p> Separately, however, the Indian generics firm Ranbaxy had begun proceedings challenging the validity of the same patent. In July 2011, the High Court decided that Ranbaxy's product did not infringe the patent, and shortly afterwards the injunction on Krka was lifted. </p><p> Two days after the Ranbaxy decision, another generics firm, Arrow, and AZ launched a &quot;branded generic&quot; version, meaning that Krka and Consilient, which did not launch Emozul until September 2011, lost their &quot;first mover&quot; advantage. Moreover, Mylan introduced a generic capsule version in November and Teva a tablet form in December. All this had the effect of increasing competition for Emozul and driving down the generic price. </p><h2> Damages claim </h2><p> The defendants sought &pound;32m in damages to compensate for the delay in launching their product and the consequent loss of market share and sales. </p><p> AZ by contrast asserted that sales of Emozul were what they would have been had the product been launched as originally planned, and that because Nexium was in tablet form and Emozul in capsules, the latter's market penetration would have been relatively modest. The UK firm put the defendants' loss at nearer &pound;3-6m. </p><p> But the High Court sided with the generics companies, saying that severe cost pressures on medicines managers at primary care trusts (some of whom gave evidence in the proceedings), and the ease with which they could promote a switch to the cheaper Emozul, would have led to a high level of switching to Emozul in the period after October 2010. This in turn would have created a market for Emozul that the defendants would have been better able to protect against the launch of later generic competitors. </p><p> The judge did, however, say that medicines managers had a tendency to overestimate the success of their switching campaigns, and for this reason, and because of various uncertainties, he reduced the damages award by 20% (the &quot;uncertainty discount&quot;) to &pound;27m. Nonetheless, this was the largest award ever made in the UK in proceedings of this kind. </p><p> AZ appealed, saying among other things that too much weight was placed on the evidence as to how quickly switching to Emozul would have taken place, and that the judge's &quot;uncertainty discount&quot; was &quot;wholly inadequate&quot;. </p><p> But the Court of Appeal upheld the award, noting that the judge had &quot;made an assessment of the likely speed and degree of penetration of the market by Emozul&quot; had there been no injunction, that he had paid careful attention to all the evidence, and that various factors &quot;justified the application of a 20% discount&quot;. </p><h2> Possible ramifications </h2><p> Lawyers were quick to point out the potential ramifications for pharmaceutical companies intending to launch patent infringement proceedings. </p><p> CMS said the case &quot;highlights the potential ramifications of giving a cross-undertaking in damages, which can lead to serious financial consequences depending upon the nature of the injunction sought.&quot; </p><p> While this case is a relatively extreme example, &quot;businesses and their legal teams will need to be very careful when assessing the potential commercial and legal risks and benefits of applying for interim injunctions&quot;, CMS said. It added that &quot;it appears that sizeable damages could still be awarded if you can convince the court of the damaging effects a wrongly-granted injunction has had on your business&quot;. </p><p> Lawyers at Wragge Lawrence Graham &amp; Co noted that for several years the courts had been relatively sympathetic to requests for interim injunctions in pharmaceutical patent claims, and there seemed relatively little exposure for patentees protecting a monopoly market in a high-value pharmaceutical. But now, they said, &quot;The law, and the sympathies, have perhaps developed. Patentees can no longer take for granted profits made during the term of interim injunctive relief, irrespective of the outcome of the substantive claim.&quot; </p><p> Similarly, an article by lawyer Jane Lambert on the NIPC law blog pointed out that the risk that a claimant may have to pay out as much as &pound;27m if its application fails is likely to have a &quot;chilling effect&quot;. Interim injunctive relief will now be sought only in very strong cases, she concluded. </p>
