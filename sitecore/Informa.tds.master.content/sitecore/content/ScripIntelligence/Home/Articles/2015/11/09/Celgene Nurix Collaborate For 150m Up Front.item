<p>Celgene will pay Nurix Inc. $150m up front to develop and commercialize novel small molecules that modulate the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a deal that gives both companies multiple options for benefitting from joint oncology, inflammation and immunology programs.</p><p>Harnessing the UPS, which controls protein levels within cells, to modulate protein homeostasis could lead to new treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases and other conditions. While mutations in UPS genes drive many cancers, Nurix also notes that certain UPS genes encode key checkpoints in the immune response. Those factors make UPS genes attractive targets in immuno-oncology and for cancer drug developers like Celgene, whose top-selling product is the immunomodulatory drug <i>Revlimid</i> (lenalidomide) for multiple myeloma and other blood cancers.</p><p>Therapies with the potential to modulate the immune system obviously are very valuable to Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene, which reported $2.8bn in Revlimid sales during the first half of 2015. The company also has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-in-1-deal-Forma-grabs-225m-from-Celgene-350995" target="_new">two partnerships</a> with Forma Therapeutics, including a collaboration in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forma-and-Celgene-form-a-protein-homeostasis-deal-342610" target="_new">protein homeostasis</a>.</p><p>With expertise in the field through both approved drugs and pipeline programs, perhaps that's why Celgene was willing to give Nurix an upfront payment that is almost five times the venture capital that the San Francisco-based biotechnology firm has raised since it was founded three years ago &ndash; $6.2m in seed capital in 2012 and a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Big-bets-in-life-science-venture-capital-Chimerix-stock-offering-IPOs-and-dealmaking-abound-351992" target="_new">$25.1m Series B round</a> in 2014.</p><p>"Celgene is an ideal partner for us," Nurix CEO Arthur Sands told <i>Scrip</i>. He noted recent findings that Celgene's immunomodulatory agents work through the UPS.</p><p>Celgene's president of global research and early development Thomas Daniel said in a statement that the Nurix collaboration is "consistent with our deep and competitive position in the arena of protein homeostasis" and the biotech firm's approach is a "highly complementary effort addressing important targets in oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases."</p><p><b>Flexible Deal Terms</b></p><p>Consistent with Celgene's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Celgenes-head-dealmaker-strikes-a-fair-balance-356314" target="_new">reputation for flexible dealmaking</a> with smaller biotech companies, the new partners negotiated terms that leave both Celgene and Nurix with a lot of flexibility.</p><p>"Celgene has a great deal philosophy to foster innovation through its partnerships, and in order to do that it requires a high degree of freedom for the innovator biotech company, and [our deal] structure reflects that," Sands said.</p><p>Celgene will make an undisclosed equity investment in Nurix, on top of the $150m upfront payment, in exchange for an option to license future programs. Nurix may focus on E3 ubiquitin ligases and E2 conjugating enzymes during the option term to identify the best drug discovery programs for oncology or inflammation and immunology indications. Nurix will control the drug discovery process and remain responsible for development through the end of Phase I clinical trials. </p><p>Celgene may pay up to $405m in option and milestone fees per drug candidate if the company exercises its option for a global development and commercialization license. Nurix also will earn tiered single-digit to low double-digit royalties on global sales. Sands said there is no limit on the number of drug candidates that may be created under the collaboration.</p><p>However, Nurix will retain US rights for certain candidates, including a right to co-develop and co-commercialize up to two programs in the US through a 50-50 profit/loss split with Celgene. The larger company would retain ex-US rights, but pay Nurix undisclosed option and milestone fees plus royalties on foreign sales. </p><p>Nurix will retain all rights to drug candidates that Celgene chooses not to license.</p><p><b>Non-Celgene Programs</b></p><p>Its collaboration with Celgene precludes Nurix from developing oncology, inflammation or immunology drug candidates on its own, but the biotech firm has ongoing proof-of-concept programs in other therapeutic areas.</p><p>"Currently, we're wholly focused on these [Celgene] programs. However, we do hope to expand in other therapeutic areas," Sands said, including Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. </p><p>As for when its prioritized programs with Celgene will go into the clinic, he said that's the "$405m question for us. We would obviously like to move into the clinic as soon as possible."</p><p><p><p><p><p>
