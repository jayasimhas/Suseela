<p>Parallel exports of medicines from Bulgaria to other EU markets are expected to increase after the Constitutional Court ruled that some aspects of the export notification system introduced in 2014 were unconstitutional.</p><p>The notification regime, which was brought in at the beginning of last year by amendments to the Bulgarian Medicines Act, allowed the Bulgarian Drug Agency (BDA) to prevent parallel exports of specific medicines to avoid potential shortages on the domestic market. </p><p>But in its ruling, which was published in the <i>Bulgarian Official Gazette</i> on 13 February and comes into effect on 17 February, the court said that the grounds on which the BDA could object to exports ran contrary to the principles of equal treatment of market players and of proportionality, according to law firm Kinstellar. </p><p>Dessislava Fessenko, counsel in Kinstellar's Bulgarian office in Sofia, said the ruling meant that levels of parallel exports were expected to return to the levels prior to the introduction of the notification regime. "It is for the time being unclear how the government will address situations of shortages, as no official statements on that have been made," she said. </p><p>It's also not clear exactly how far export levels might now rise. Official statistics put the value of Bulgarian parallel exports of medicines to higher-priced markets at around &euro;150m in 2012. </p><h2>The notification system</h2><p>Under the 2014 amendments, wholesalers intending to export medicines included on the positive drug reimbursement list were required to notify the BDA of each planned export, with details including the product name, pharmaceutical form, the number of units, and the destination country. </p><p>The BDA had 30 days to object to the planned export, and could do so if it could show that the quantities of product on the market at the time were insufficient to meet domestic demand, if the export could lead to a temporary shortage, or if a shortage could pose a serious threat to patients' health. If the wholesaler had not heard back within 30 days, it could go ahead.</p><p>In order to determine whether an export could risk shortages of a product, the BDA was able to collect supply and consumption data for the product for the past six months from the national health insurance fund, the ministry of health, and the marketing authorization holder, according to the Bulgarian pharmaceutical services company PharmDedict. </p><p>The BDA could ban the export in certain circumstances, for example where there was a risk of temporary shortages and the shortage could cause a serious risk to human health and life, PharmDedict said. If the wholesaler failed to notify the export, fines of &euro;25,000-100,000 could be applied.</p><p>However, it was never quite clear how the BDA should go about determining whether supply was sufficient to meet demand or when a shortage was to be declared. Moreover, there were complaints that the system might infringe EU rules on the free movement of goods: several other member states, including Greece, Spain and Italy, have been caught up in disputes with the European Commission over their systems for limiting parallel exports in the past. </p><p>According to Ms Fessenko, opponents of the Bulgarian system "asserted that it ran contrary to the EU free movement rules because in fact it represented a trade restriction, which was not objectively justifiable on grounds of public health considerations". The matter was referred to the Constitutional Court by members of the Bulgarian parliament, she said, noting that "MPs are among the few entitled under the Bulgarian Constitution to file constitutional complaints". </p><h2>Lack of clear criteria</h2><p>In its ruling, which cannot be appealed, the court took issue with the lack of specific and quantifiable criteria for establishing 'insufficiency' and 'temporary shortage' of the quantities of product available locally in each case, Kinstellar said. </p><p>The court said that on the one hand this could result in arbitrary approvals or objections to planned exports and, therefore, to unequal treatment of similar situations, the law firm noted. "On the other hand, the court harboured serious doubts as to whether such a regime was a proportionate enough measure aimed at ensuring the security and sufficiency of local supplies. A ban on an export of a drug would have been admissible only in extreme situations, when no viable original or generic alternative of the exported product existed on the Bulgarian market and the demand for treatment indeed could not be met."</p><p>These flaws, the court ruled, effectively made the notification system operate as a licensing regime, according to Kinstellar, which added that the court only "marginally" addressed the question of whether the notification system may have infringed EU freedom of movement rules, and did not come to any specific conclusion on this aspect.</p><p>The court's ruling was not unanimous, though. Three judges dissented, saying that the notification system was "admissible and justified as a means of guaranteeing sufficient supplies of socially significant medicinal treatment and safeguarding public health, and that the grounds for opposing exports were not discretional", the law firm noted.</p><p>Technically speaking, the ruling affects only those provisions allowing the BDA to allow or object to planned exports, and leaves intact the requirement to notify each case of planned export. "However, the annulment of the grounds for opposing exports in effect prevents the Drug Agency from blocking them, and thus reduces the entire mechanism for control over the resale of drugs abroad to a reporting exercise," Kinstellar added.</p><p>It remains to be seen, it said, whether and how the government will address the situation and try to overcome the deficiencies of the amendments to the medicines act while still complying with the constitution and the EU rules on the free movement of goods.</p>
