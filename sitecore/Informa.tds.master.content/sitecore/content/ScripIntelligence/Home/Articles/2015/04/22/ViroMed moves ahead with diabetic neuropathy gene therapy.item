<p>Amid challenges elsewhere for gene therapies, South Korea's ViroMed has taken a step further into the US market for its biologics with the recent approval from the FDA to start a Phase III clinical study with its gene therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).</p><p>As US venture Celladon reels from the Phase IIb failure of its gene therapy for heart failure Mydicar, South Korea's ViroMed is moving ahead with plans to conduct a Phase III double-blind US study with its therapy, VM202-DPN, in a total of 477 painful diabetic neuropathy patients.</p><p>Evaluation of efficacy will be conducted through comparison with a randomized placebo group, and the company plans to start enrollment late this year and begin dosing next year, said a company spokesperson.</p><p>"We expect to begin commercialization in 2019, but the timing could change depending on the Phase III study," ViroMed added. After finishing the trial, the company is likely to seek a partnership with a multinational pharma firm to advance into the US market, and possibly to expand into other markets.</p><p>VM202-DPN is a DNA-based therapy that when injected into patients it produces hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) protein that induces angiogenesis and acts as a neurotrophic factor, which leads to formation of new microvasculature and regenerates nerve cells. HGF protein has been shown to work on the intense pain that can be felt by diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients.</p><p>DPN is a neuronal disorder caused by abnormally high levels of glucose, mostly occurring in lower limbs. This can be toxic and damaging to microvasculature, which in turn damages nerve cells due to a lack of supply of nutrients.</p><p>These damaged nerve cells send out abnormal signals, causing the patients to feel progressive pain. Patients with painful DPN, the most extreme form of the disease, feel extreme pain with only a slight graze or touch. ViroMed noted there are currently no fundamental treatments for the disease and maintaining blood glucose levels through strict diet is the only known therapy.</p><p>Pfizer's Lyrica (pregabalin) and Neurontin (gabapentin) as well as Lilly's Cymbalta (duloxetine) are currently prescribed as adjuvant therapy to patients to temporarily alleviate pain, but these drugs are known for having side-effects and are not effective for all patients.</p><h2>promising results</h2><p>The efficacy of VM202-DPN has already been confirmed by Phase I and II clinical trials conducted in the US and South Korea. Results from the Phase II study showed that the therapy, administered only twice with a two-week interval, induced a high level of pain reduction for three to nine months.</p><p>The results showed signs of recovery in damaged neurons with almost no adverse effects associated with the drug.</p><p>The new FDA trial approval was made based on the Phase II study, which was supported by South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p><p>In 2014, there were 387 million diabetes patients worldwide and the number is forecast to rise to about 590 million in 2035. In the US, there are 26 million diabetes patients and of these, 5% to 20 % suffer from painful neuropathy. ViroMed estimated the DPN pain therapy market to be worth KRW3.5 trillion ($3.24bn) to KRW4 trillion.</p><h2>State Support</h2><p><p>The South Korean government is seeking to support gene therapy and stem cell ventures to help them advance into a global market where no clear leader has yet emerged.</p><p>Four ministries, including the Ministry of Science, ICT [information and communications technology] and Future Planning, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, jointly announced in March that the government would invest a total of KRW340bn in 2015 to support and nurture stem cell and gene therapy firms.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/27/viromed-moves-ahead-with-diabetic-neuropathy-gene-therapy?elsca1=pan&elsca2=newsltr" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
