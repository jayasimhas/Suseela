<p><i>Scrip</i> caught up with several biopharma executives on Sept. 18 during the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) and International Congress of Chemotherapy and Infection (ICC) in San Diego to discuss the status of their anti-infective drug development programs.</p><p>For instance, Cidara Therapeutics Inc. will report its first human data for the antifungal CD101 this year; MerLion Pharmaceuticals GmbH is seeking Phase III funding or a partner for its antibiotic finafloxacin after a successful Phase II clinical trial; and Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc. anticipates its first set of Phase III results for omadacycline by mid-2016. The ICAAC/ICC conference was co-hosted by the American Society for Microbiology and the International Society of Chemotherapy.</p><p><b>Cidara Shares Preclinical, Prepares For Clinical Data</b></p><p>San Diego-based Cidara's lead antifungal drug candidate is on a fast track similar to president and CEO Jeff Stein's prior company Trius Therapeutics, which Cubist Pharmaceuticals <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Two-for-the-price-of-two-Cubist-fronts-1.24b-for-Trius-Optimer-345397" target="_new">acquired for up to $818m in 2013</a> before Merck & Co. agreed to buy <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mercks-9.5bn-Cubist-buy-overshadowed-by-court-decision-355511" target="_new">Cubist for $9.5bn at the end of 2014</a>. Like Cidara, Trius also moved quickly from its Series A venture capital to its public market debut to fund clinical trials for the antibiotic <i>Sivextro</i> (tedizolid), which won <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Cubists-Sivextro-another-antibiotic-GAIN-352461" target="_new">US FDA approval in mid-2014</a>.</p><p>Cidara was founded in January 2014, completed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cidara-CEO-Stein-brings-Trius-gang-biotech-vets-together-352587" target="_new">$32m Series A round in July 2014</a> and closed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Laguna-raises-30m-as-2015-VC-funding-momentum-continues-356799" target="_new">$42m Series B financing in February</a> of this year before the company completed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Spring-heats-up-the-IPO-market-357946" target="_new">$77m initial public offering in April</a>. The capital allowed Cidara to advance its antifungal drug CD101 into human clinical trials that should yield single-ascending dose data before the end of 2015 with multiple ascending dose data expected early in 2016. </p><p>"We're getting into a period that's catalyst-rich," Stein said.</p><p>Yet despite the company's fast pace, Cidara is trading below its $16 IPO share price, closing at $14.36 on Sept. 21. Cidara's market cap is $196.4m.</p><p>The FDA granted fast track status for Cidara's intravenous formulation of CD101 and granted a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation in May for the novel echinocandin antifungal in the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The company also is developing subcutaneous and topical formulations of CD101 and clinical trials for the topical drug are expected to begin in 2016. </p><p>Stein said there have been three nearly identical echinocandin antifungals on the market for several years, but Cidara made a minor chemical modification to stabilize CD101 so that it can be dosed less frequently and without a breakdown product that causes toxicities associated with the breakdown of approved echinocandins in the body. Less frequent dosing could mean shorter hospital stays for patients, he noted.</p><p>CD101 could fill a void in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and recurrent VVC (rVVC) for which the standard of care is the fungistatic drug fluconazole, which treats fungal infections, but doesn't kill the fungus. The Cidara drug is a fungicidal, or fungus-killing, agent that may be dosed topically without causing adverse interactions with oral contraceptives or associated severe fetal abnormalities. </p><p>Stein said Cidara always intended to go public to finance the company's rapid antifungal drug development, because "it's tough to raise venture capital money to do Phase III trials."</p><p><b>MerLion Preps Phase III For Investors, Partners</b></p><p>MerLion managing director Andreas Vente said that the company is looking to raise money, engage a partner or both to progress the fluoroquinolone antibiotic finafloxacin into Phase III clinical trials based on positive Phase II results in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) that the Singapore-headquartered company presented during the ICAAC/ICC meeting. </p><p>The Phase II trial enrolled 225 patients with cUTI and acute pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) who received a once-daily intravenous or oral 800mg dose of finafloxacin for five days or 10 days, or twice-daily doses of ciprofloxacin administered as 400mg intravenously or 500mg orally for 10 days. Patients in all arms of the study could switch from intravenous to oral dosing on day three.</p><p>"In theory, you could give a finafloxacin infusion on day one and then send the patient home with the oral or just give them the oral without keeping patients in the hospital," Vente said.</p><p>The Phase II primary endpoint was the "test of cure" &ndash; the combined microbiological eradication and resolution of clinical symptoms for at least 17 days. Finafloxacin was more effective than ciprofloxacin, which is the standard of care for cUTI. The test of cure rates were 70% for finafloxacin dosed for five days and 68% when dosed for 10 days versus 57% for 10 days of ciprofloxacin treatment. </p><p>"We have started preparations for Phase III. We can base it on the protocol from Phase II," Vente said. "The protocol is ready, but we need to insure funding."</p><p>The company owns <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/MerLions-finafloxacin-progresses-for-severe-infections-after-positive-IV-results-336957" target="_new">full rights to finafloxacin</a>, which it licensed from Bayer in 2006 as a preclinical project, except for topical formulations to treat ear infections in the US. Novartis's Alcon business unit won US FDA approval for <i>Xtoro</i> (finafloxacin otic suspension) in December for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-12-December---18-December-2014-355756" target="_new">treatment of swimmer's ears</a>.</p><p><b>Paratek Has Funding Through Phase III</b></p><p>Boston-based Paratek launched in 1996 to develop oral tetracycline antibiotics and the company's lead product candidate omadacycline &ndash; an intravenously and orally administered tetracycline derivative &ndash; is now under evaluation in two Phase III clinical trials. </p><p>Paratek president and chief medical officer Evan Loh said the company is focused on developing oral antibiotics that are just as effective as their intravenous versions with the goal of getting patients switched to oral drugs faster so that people can go home from the hospital sooner. Highly effective oral antibiotics also should keep patients from going into the hospital into the first place, Loh noted.</p><p>Paratek began its first Phase III clinical trial for omadacycline in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) in June and the company plans to report initial data before the end of the second quarter of 2016. The 650-patient, IV-to-oral clinical trial is testing omadacycline versus Zyvox (linezolid).</p><p>A 750-patient Phase III trial, which will evaluate omadacycline in moderate to severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), is expected to begin before the end of 2015 with results expected during the second half of 2017.</p><p>"It's enriched for more severe patients to make it more relevant for Europe," Loh said.</p><p>Paratek also has a narrow spectrum antibiotic called sarecycline in Phase III development as a treatment for inflammatory acne under a US partnership with Warner Chilcott, which is now part of Allergan. The program's two 1,000-patient Phase III trials and a longer-term safety extension study are being conducted by Allergan. The first Phase III sarecycline results are expected in 2016 followed by the submission of marketing applications in 2017 and a drug launch by 2018.</p><p>Paratek owns worldwide rights to omadacycline and ex-US rights to sarecycline, and the company expects to engage partners for ex-US development of both drugs.</p><p>"We think both products make sense for Asia partnerships right away," Loh said. "In other markets, it makes sense to partner them together outside of the US." </p><p>As for the continued development of omadacycline, Paratek has enough cash on hand to wait until after Phase III data are available to seek ex-US partners, including $79m from financing activities associated with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Paratek-slips-into-public-market-with-Transcept-buy-352616" target="_new">the company's reverse merger</a> with Transcept Pharmaceuticals in mid-2014. Paratek also grossed $71.5m from a secondary offering in May, giving the company $150m in cash and no debt as of June 30.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
