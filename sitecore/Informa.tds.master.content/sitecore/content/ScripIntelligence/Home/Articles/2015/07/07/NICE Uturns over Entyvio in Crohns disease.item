<p>NICE has changed its mind over vedolizumab (Takeda's Entyvio) in Crohn's disease. Having refused to recommend it in earlier draft guidance as the evidence for the drug was "too uncertain," the HTA body for England and Wales is now recommending it be available on the NHS in final draft guidance. </p><p>Takeda's new CEO Christophe Weber <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Takeda-looks-up-as-it-hits-bottom-358460" target="_new">recently highlighted</a> Entyvio as a key product in the Japanese company's strategy to return to growth this fiscal year. The drug saw sales of JPY27.8bn in the 12 months ending 31 March 2015 in its initial indications of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, with the company's global peak target set at over $2bn.</p><p>"After considering further information, NICE is happy to be able to recommend vedolizumab as a treatment option for those with Crohn&rsquo;s disease," said Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre.</p><p>She had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Takeda-struggles-to-get-Entyvio-over-NICE-hurdles-355845" target="_new">previously</a> said the company had not provided enough information to show how well the drug worked when compared to other treatments. </p><p>The current standard of care for Crohn's disease is treatment with AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) or Janssen's Remicade (infliximab) &ndash; both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors.</p><p>Vedolizumab is recommended as an option for treating moderately to severely active Crohn&rsquo;s disease if a TNF alpha inhibitor has failed or a TNF alpha inhibitor cannot be tolerated or is contra-indicated. NICE is only recommending Vedolizumab if the company provides it with the (confidential) discount agreed in the patient access scheme.</p><p>The latest draft guidance also states that patients receiving vedolizumab for Crohn's disease should be reassessed after 12 months and that treatment should only continue if it is still justified as both clinically and cost effective.</p><p>NICE's concerns also included the economic model the company had used for the drug. Takeda submitted a third model as new evidence in response to the appraisal consultation document, in which it provided base-case results incorporating the updated vedolizumab patient access scheme for the population in whom a TNF alpha inhibitor had failed. The deterministic ICER for vedolizumab compared with conventional non biological therapy was &pound;21,620 per QALY gained and the probabilistic ICER was &pound;27,428 per QALY gained. The probability of vedolizumab being cost effective compared with conventional non biological therapy at a maximum acceptable ICER of &pound;30,000 was 61%. </p><p>Vedolizumab is not considered cost effective compared with TNF alpha inhibitors for treating moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the population who have not had a TNF alpha inhibitor before</p><p>Final guidance on the use of vedolizumab as a treatment option for those with severely active Crohn's disease is expected to be published by NICE later this year.</p><p><b>ulcerative colitis</b></p><p>NICE recently published final guidance approving the use of vedolizumab on the NHS as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. Takeda had been wrangling with NICE over the product's full reimbursement in the UK, without patient population restrictions, for some months but finally gained approval after agreeing a price discount for the product under a patient access scheme. In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Takedas-Entyvio-gains-lukewarm-NICE-yes-355307" target="_new">previous NICE guidance</a>, Entyvio's use had been restricted to patients who were na&iuml;ve to TNF-alpha inhibitors. It is now approved for use on the NHS in all adult patients. </p><p>
