<p>The promise of cell and gene therapies is great, but there's a lot of work to be done between selecting a clinical candidate and eventually selling an approved product, and companies have learned that commercial scale manufacturing is a challenge that has to be addressed early on in development.</p><p>Cell and gene therapy developers, from biotechnology startups to global big pharma firms, discussed the manufacturing hurdles that they've had to clear even before taking treatments into clinical trials during the Stem Cell Meeting on the Mesa from Oct. 7 to 9 in San Diego. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cell-And-Gene-Therapy-Clinical-Milestones-Highlight-Reimbursement-Challenges-360908" target="_new">conference was co-sponsored by the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine</a> (ARM), the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine.</p><p>"The challenge with very early-stage technologies is the field's reluctance to start from the end," i.e. with manufacturing processes at commercial scale, said Anthony Davies, acting chief technology officer at 4D Molecular Therapeutics, during an Oct. 7 panel discussion titled "Innovation in Process Development & Manufacturing of Gene Therapeutics."</p><p>Much of the value of cell and gene therapies, on top of their potentially curative efficacy, is in their complicated and specialized manufacturing and distribution processes. Drug developers looking for partners or acquirers can add quite a bit of value to their companies or therapeutic products if they have a manufacturing site designed and distribution plan in place.</p><p><b>In-House Versus CMO</b></p><p>"I think many of these products aren't going to require huge manufacturing plants," WuXi AppTec's Alan Moore, vice president of strategic accounts and cell manufacturing for the contract manufacturing organization (CMO), said during the gene therapy manufacturing panel.</p><p>Abeona Therapeutics will begin its first-ever clinical trials in late 2015 for the gene therapies ABO-101 in the treatment of Sanfilippo type B and ABO-102 for Sanfilippo type A [mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIB and IIIA] with bio-potency data expected by the end of the first quarter of 2016. Abeona will use a CMO to start, but even with its therapies still in preclinical development the company has designed and is preparing to build its own manufacturing facility.</p><p>"We're making sure the manufacturing can be scaled up enough so that we can produce a commercial product eventually," Abeona president and CEO Timothy Miller said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Cleveland, Ohio-based gene therapy developer, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Deals-Deals-Deals-358230" target="_new">completed a reverse merger</a> earlier this year to become a public company, has about $40m in cash to pursue its Sanfilippo program and other clinical trials and to fulfill its manufacturing plans.</p><p>"When you start looking at it in terms of the capital commitment, the CMOs available, and your control of the manufacturing, there's an inflection point where it makes more sense to keep it in-house," Miller said. </p><p>Cell and gene therapy developers are putting into practice a variety of manufacturing processes and distribution practices tailored to their therapies' and their patients' needs.</p><p><b>Tailoring Manufacturing To Therapies</b></p><p>Celyad, formerly Cardio3 BioSciences in Belgium, developed cryopreservation technology early on so that the company can ship its cell therapies from a single manufacturing site in the US and one in Europe to keep treatment costs down, CEO Christian Homsy told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>But Novartis, which is heavily invested in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-calls-Dendreon-an-enabler-not-a-failure-355048" target="_new">acquired a cell therapy manufacturing plant</a> in Morris Plains, New Jersey from Dendreon to produce its CAR-T cancer treatments.</p><p>"The manufacturing science piece is a critical piece that's moving now," Novartis global head of cell and gene therapies Usman Azam said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>. "It was a cottage industry in academia in terms of raw materials, but that's changing because of the companies here [at the Stem Cell Meeting]. Novartis has made a big investment. We're making sizeable investments in process optimization to get it to patients around the world."</p><p>Because companies are making such big bets early on in the research and development process, Azam noted that cell and gene therapies are likely to get to market within seven or eight years instead of after 14 or 15 years of development.</p><p><b>Experts Needed</b></p><p>One things that may hold up those manufacturing and process investments is expertise. </p><p>David Smith, vice president of global business development for the CMO Lonza, said during an Oct. 8 panel titled "Exploring Japan's New Regenerative Medicine Regulatory Framework" that there is a lack of pharma-quality manufacturing supervisors for cell therapy production at CMOs in Japan.</p><p>"It's an issue globally, but maybe more so in Japan, because of the regulatory requirements," added Firman Ghouze, cell therapy technologies market development leader at GE Healthcare.</p><p>However, Smith said of Lonza's efforts to build cell therapy CMO capabilities in partnership with Nikon that "we think some of the regenerative medicine technology that we are bringing to Japan will make manufacturing cost-effective worldwide."</p><p><p><i>For further insights from the Stem Cell Meeting on the Mesa, follow @ScripMandy on Twitter to see Mandy Jackson's tweets from the conference with the hashtag #Mesa15.</i></p><p><p><p><p>
