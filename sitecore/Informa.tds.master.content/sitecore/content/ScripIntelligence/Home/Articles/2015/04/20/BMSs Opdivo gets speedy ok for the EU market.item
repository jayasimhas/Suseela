<p>The EU's CHMP has granted a positive opinion to Bristol-Myers Squibb's immune-oncology agent Opdivo (nivolumab) in melanoma after an accelerated assessment. </p><p>The committee has given the thumbs up to the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor for use in both first-line and previously treated patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma. This is the first positive opinion given by the CHMP for a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, BMS notes. </p><p>In the EU, accelerated assessments are used for "products of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the view point of therapeutic innovation". </p><p>The CHMP said that the benefits obtained with Opdivo are an increase in overall survival over dacarbazine (HR = 0.42; 99.79%CI: 0.25, 0.73; p-value < 0.0001)="" in="" patients="" with="" advanced="" (unresectable="" or="" metastatic)="" melanoma="" in="" adults="" who="" have="" not="" received="" prior="" therapy="" and="" an="" improvement="" in="" overall="" response="" rate="" for="" nivolumab="" compared="" to="" investigator's="" choice="" of="" treatment="" (31.7%="" versus="" 10.6%,="" respectively)="" in="" adults="" who="" had="" received="" previous="" therapy.=""></p><p>The opinion is based on the results of two Phase III trials CheckMate-066 and -037.</p><p>Opdivo was first approved in July 2014 in Japan where it is marketed by Ono Pharmaceutical. In the US it was first approved in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab) and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. </p><p>On 5 March 2015, Opdivo received its second FDA approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. It has also recently shown <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Another-quick-lung-cancer-approval-in-Opdivos-future-357947" target="_new">overwhelming efficacy in the CheckMate-057 trial</a> because it showed better overall survival over Genentech's standard of care Taxotere (docetaxel). </p><p>Opdivo is competing with Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which is awaiting EU approval for melanoma (filed last June), and which has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Keytruda-filing-comes-early-as-data-shine-at-the-AACR-357963" target="_new">just been filed for use in NSCLC</a> in the US. </p><p><p><p>
