<p>London-based Celsus Therapeutics went public in the US 13 months ago to fund a Phase II clinical trial for MRX-6 in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema) and the company's stock sank 81.4% to $1.15 per share on 17 February after the topical cream failed to beat placebo in the mid-stage trial.</p><p>Celsus reported that there was no difference between MRX-6 and a vehicle control for 73 pediatric patients with mild to moderate eczema in terms of the mean change from baseline to 28 days in Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores. The mean IGA change was -0.8 (+0.92) for MRX-6 and -0.8 (+0.72) for placebo (p=0.729) and the mean percentage changes were -27.9% and -29.4%, respectively (p=0920), meaning that the company's topical treatment did slightly worse than the vehicle control.</p><p>The Phase II results wiped out $27.9m worth of Celsus's value, dropping the company's US market cap from $34.3m to $6.4m. Celsus listed its American depository shares (ADS) on the Nasdaq exchange on 6 January 2014 at $6 per ADS (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Insys-TetraLogic-Corcept-Mallinckrodt-Celsus-348749" target="_new">13 December 2013</a>).</p><p>CEO Gur Roshwalb said the company was disappointed by the MRX-6 results and will provide an update on plans for the drug candidate after Celsus completes an internal review of the data.</p><p><p><p><p>
