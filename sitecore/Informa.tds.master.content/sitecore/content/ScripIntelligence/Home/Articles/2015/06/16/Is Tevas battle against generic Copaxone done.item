<p>With the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on 18 June invalidating the last remaining patent on the 20mg once-daily dosage of Teva's big moneymaker multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) &ndash; the second time the court had done so &ndash; Novartis unit Sandoz and its partner Momenta Pharmaceuticals said they were immediately moving forward with launching their recently approved generic competitor.</p><p>But the legal saga, which has been ongoing since 2008, may not be over, with Teva vowing it may still pursue another appellate review, even though Wall Street analysts insisted there's not much to be gained in that strategy, given the patent, known as '808, was already set to expire in less than two months.</p><p>Plus, Teva already has switched more than two-thirds of Copaxone patients to the 40mg formulation, which has patent protection until 2030.</p><p>Sandoz and Momenta gained <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SandozMomenta-nab-1st-US-generic-Copaxone-launch-unclear-357920" target="_new">US approval in April</a> of the first generic form of the 20mg once-daily dosage of Copaxone, which is being sold as Glatopa to treat multiple sclerosis.</p><p>They've priced the drug at $173.13 per injection, or $63,000 annually, which analysts noted is only a 3% discount to Copaxone 20mg daily, but is a 15% discount to the 40mg three times per week dosage.</p><p>But the FDA would not permit Glatopa 20mg/mL to be interchangeable with the 40mg/mL dose of brand-name Copaxone.</p><p>With Teva setting its 40mg drug at an 18% discount to the 20mg Copaxone, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat had predicted Sandoz and Momenta would need to go well below the branded 40mg to gain market share. </p><p>This past January, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270" target="_new">sided with Teva</a> in its lawsuit against the generics. But that ruling was looking at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Copaxone-decision-could-decide-balance-of-power-354512" target="_new">standard</a> the appeals court used when it invalidated the last remaining patent on Copaxone, not on the validity of the patent itself.</p><p>The Supreme Court, which ruled 7-2 in Teva's favor, remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit, which said Teva's claim for its patent '808 were invalid for indefiniteness.</p><p>Mylan and Natco also are pursuing copycats of Copaxone.</p><p>"We have stated all along that the '808 patent on Copaxone is invalid," said Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, who said the court has "put this matter to rest." </p><p>Ms Bresch said her company continued to remain "very confident" in its application for its generic version of Copaxone in the US.</p><p>She also said the Federal Circuit's ruling "underscores concerns with Teva's ongoing financial prospects," given the Copaxone franchise has "historically" been that firm's largest and most significant revenue driver.</p><p>Shares of Teva, Momenta and Mylan all lost value on 19 June.</p><p>Shares of Teva closed at $60, down 33 cents, while Momenta's stock finished the day at $23.78, down 64 cents. Mylan's shares closed $71.62, a loss of 93 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
