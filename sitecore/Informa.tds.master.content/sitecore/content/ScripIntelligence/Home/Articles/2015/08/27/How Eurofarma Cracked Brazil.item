<p>Firms that want to succeed in Brazil could learn a few things from Eurofarma, the country's fourth biggest company. A very big and highly prized sales force, large reinvestments and a broad portfolio are some of the reasons behind the home grown firm's success, explained Martha Novelli Penna, vice-president of strategy and innovation, and Maria del Pilar, director of sustainability and new business. And now with Brazil sewn up, the company is focusing on conquering the rest of Latin America.</p><p>In 2014, Eurofarma's sales reached R$2.1bn ($590m) and over the past decade, the firm has grown an average of 17% each year in sales, exceeding market growth in Brazil. Eurofarma is responsible for 4.6% of the prescriptions issued in Brazil, coming second behind local rival Ache and ahead of Sanofi and Merck.</p><p>Much of its success is down to its long held strategy to reinvest in the company. "Shareholders withdraw 0.5% of annual sales and reinvest all surplus value in operations," says Penna. Between 2011 and 2014 it has reinvested some R$423m, equivalent to R$106m each year, back into the company, which represents about 80% of its liquid income generated over that period, says del Pilar. This is a large sum for a local company; Eurofarma's peers on average reinvest 1% of their liquid income. According to del Pilar, the money has largely gone into M&A, fostering innovation and expanding and modernizing its facilities. </p><p>Consistently high investment in the firm has meant that it was able to successfully cater for the needs of a new middle class that has emerged over the past ten years. "We were able to offer a wide and diversified range of products that are good quality and fairly priced. The challenge is to keep growing from such a big base that we have today and continue to launch products that have a competitive differential and that offer some degree of innovation," according to del Pilar.</p><p>The firm offers a broad portfolio of 186 molecules across the hospital and retail sectors, including OTCs. Its biggest selling products are hormones, oncology drugs and antibiotics. However, the company's biggest selling product (a contraceptive, ethinylestradiol plus gestodene) generates just 3% of sales. "This means the company is not financially dependent on any one product," says Penna. </p><p>Traditionally, most of the company's sales have come from generics, about 15-20% from "pure generics" and about 50% from branded generics, known in Brazil as <i>similares. </i>These are a different category of generic medicine that are bioequivalent to the originator. Unlike pure generics, they are branded and cannot be substituted at the point of sale. They have better profit margins than pure generics, which are generally cheaper. </p><p>However, Penna says that the mix has to change and that the firm needs to get more of its income from drugs that can be patented. "This is something that is going to differentiate us, especially in the near and long-term future," she says. The firm currently invests 6% of its sales in R&D (both in incremental and radical innovation) and expects this figure to reach 12% by 2020. Some home grown, in-house innovation could be on the cards. The company has in the past conducted preclinical stage research, but discontinued it after a development strategy review. Now the company looks set to move forward again and has selected new projects that are "worthy of early stages of development," according to Penna.</p><p>Eurofarma is already bringing innovative products to Brazil through licensing deals. Around 11-12% of its products were in-licensed in 2014, but Penna expects that this figure will grow significantly in the next few years. Most recently it has signed a deal with the US firm Melinta Therapeutics to commercialize its antibiotic, delafloxacin, an investigational fluoroquinolone. Eurofarma will obtain authorization and then market and distribute the drug for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. In return Melinta received $15m up front and can look forward to milestones and royalties on future sales. Also as part of the deal, Eurofarma acquired equity in Melinta.</p><p>Co-development is also part of the firm's plan for sustained long term growth, mainly in Phase II and III trials. It has good relations with the national regulator, ANVISA, which helps setting up and running trials. It has struck an agreement with the South Korean company, Dong-A, to develop its diabetes drug Evogliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor. Eurofarma will conduct a bridging study for Brazilian patients and market the drug in 17 other Latin American countries.</p><p>The firm is also working on bringing two new monoclonal antibodies developed in Cuba at the Center for Molecular Oncology to the market. The first, racotumomab, is a therapeutic vaccine for non-small cell lung cancer, already launched in Argentina and Cuba. Eurofarma is conducting a further Phase III study necessary for approval in Brazil. The firm is also conducting trials for nimotuzumab in glioblastoma patients. </p><p>Regardless of the product, Eurofarma has a not so secret weapon to get it to Brazilian patients. Its 2,000 strong salesforce is the biggest in Brazil and has a very wide reach with access to 95% of the country's doctors. It makes some 400,000 visits a month and has very good relationships with the medical community, says Penna. This is no small matter in the world's fifth largest country, both by population and geographical spread. The company is able to penetrate deeper than the average multinational, which tends to focus on top level physicians, says Penna. In addition, reps focus on building deep and lasting relations with healthcare professionals, she says. The success of its sales force is probably down to Eurofarma's commitment to keeping its staff happy. The firm offers its employees a meritocratic environment with opportunities for promotion, good training, and of course good benefits, which helps keep staff turnover extremely low, says Penna.</p><p>Meanwhile, internationalization is a top priority for the firm. By the end of 2015, it hopes to cover 90% of the Latin American market, up from 68% today. Aside from Brazil, which is responsible for 45% of the firm's business, the company has operations in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Central America. The firm's strategy for penetration includes acquiring SMEs ripe for development through investment in facilities, staff and new products. Licensing, promotion and distribution are also important part of its expansion and the company is on the lookout for partners who do not operate in the region, who need help with promotion or who want to deploy a second brand (when a manufacturer launches a second, cheaper version of its patented innovator in order to quickly win a bigger market share), says del Pilar. However, the exact strategy depends on the market. In Colombia, for example, Eurofarma bought production facilities from Merck, and struck a production and distribution agreement with the firm. Over the next few years it started its own commercial operations, focused on promoting and distributing Eurofarma's own products and those licensed in from other companies. To build business, the company is always on the lookout for further product acquisitions.</p><p>Eurofarma is now evaluating greenfield investment opportunities in Mexico and Venezuela. Access to these markets would enable the company to hit its goal of covering 90% of the region. Both markets also offer an attractive private market, says del Pilar.</p><p><p>
