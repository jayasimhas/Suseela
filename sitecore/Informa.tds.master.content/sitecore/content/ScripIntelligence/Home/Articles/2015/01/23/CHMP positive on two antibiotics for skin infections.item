<p>Europe's CHMP has given the green light for two new antibiotics to be approved in ABSSSI (acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections): Obactiv (oritavancin) from The Medicines Company, and Cubist's Sivextro (tedizolid phosphate).</p><h2>Orbactiv</h2><p>Orbactiv is a lipoglycopeptide, and the third in this class to enter the global market after Theravance's Vibativ (telavancin) and Durata Therapeutics/RaQualia Pharma's Dalvance/Xydalba (dalbavancin). The CHMP noted that its benefits are "its ability to effectuate cure of ABSSSI with a single intravenous dose."</p><p>Datamonitor analyst Dr Emad Al Muti said that Orbactiv has a therapeutic advantage over Vibativ and Dalvance "due to its wider spectrum of activity." In addition, the drug has an exceptionally long half-life, which enables its one-dose regimen. Dalvance, which gained the CHMP's positive opinion in December (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/CHMP-positive-opinions-for-two-antibiotics-355762" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 19 December 2014), is dosed once-weekly.</p><p>However, notes Dr Al Muti, this is something of a double-edged sword, since physicians have concerns about the safety and efficacy of the long half-life. "Of particular importance are the potentially serious adverse effects stemming from allergic reactions," he said. "Such serious complications will extend for longer periods of time, and will require prolonged &ndash; and possibly intensive &ndash; medical attention until the levels of the drug within the body decrease significantly."</p><p>Orbactiv was approved in the US in August last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medicines-single-dose-ABSSSI-drug-Orbactiv-OKd-353227" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 7 August 2014).</p><h2>Sivextro</h2><p>Cubist's Siextro is a second-generation oxazolidinone antibacterial, and the second to gain approval for ABSSSI following Pfizer's Zyvox (linezolid). The CHMP commented on that its benefits are "its ability to be active against important Gram-positive pathogens that are common aetiological agents of ABSSSI, including methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (including linezolid-resistant strains), as well as pathogenic streptococci."</p><p>Dr Al Muti said that although Zyvox is a strong market contender, Sivextro has some advantages which should allow it to compete, "especially in cases associated with MRSA." As well as having a dosing advantage, requiring a lower-dose six-day regimen rather than Zyvox's 10-14 day regimen, Sivextro demonstrated clinical superiority in <i>in vitro </i>development. </p><p>"<i>In vitro</i> studies have indicated that Sivextro exhibits enhanced potency over Zyvox against different <i>Staphylococcal</i> and <i>Enterococcal</i> bacterial isolates," said Dr Al Muti. "Bacterial isolates also demonstrated a lower potential to develop resistance to Sivextro, which retained its efficacy against bacterial strains resistant to Zyvox."</p><p>He added: "These attributes can enable the positioning of Sivextro as an enhanced treatment option for ABSSSI. They can also allow the drug to compete for Zyvox's share in this market." </p><p>Despite this, Sivextro could be threatened by Zyvox's imminent patent expiry, which could happen as early as 2015. This would make it vulnerable to generic competition. Dr Al Muti said that as such, the drug needs to achieve clear efficacy differentiation in order to stay competitive.</p><p>Sivextro was approved in the US in June last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Cubists-Sivextro-another-antibiotic-GAIN-352461" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 20 June 2014).</p><h2>Generics &ndash; the real competition</h2><p>While the world is crying out for new antibiotics, making these recommendations cause for celebration, Dr Al Muti notes that for the companies the ABSSSI market can still be a tricky place to operate given physicians' apparent preference for generic products.</p><p>In a survey conducted by Datamonitor Healthcare of around 200 infectious disease specialists in the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK, it was clear that physicians still tend to adopt generic antibacterial agents as opposed to the more expensive branded counterparts as first options when treating patients with ABSSSI. </p><p>"One factor that may feed into this can be attributed to the clinical trial design for new drugs targeting this indication," said Dr Al Muti. Where physicians want to see superiority in the new antibiotics, the trials are instead designed to show non-inferiority. "The lack of clear superiority indicators puts new drugs at a clear price-disadvantage in comparison to their generic counterparts," he said, adding, "Some drugs are trying to compete based on dosing frequency and formulation, but that does not seem to present a clear advantage to physicians."</p>
