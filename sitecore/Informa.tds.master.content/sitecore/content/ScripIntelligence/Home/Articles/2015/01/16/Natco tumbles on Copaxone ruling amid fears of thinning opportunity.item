<p>Natco Pharma fell sharply on Indian bourses after the US Supreme Court on 20 January ruled in favour of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and remanded a case concerning the Israeli firm's money-spinning multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), back to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>The court ruled 7-2 in Teva's favour, declaring that the appeals court had failed to use the proper standard when it invalidated Teva's last remaining patent on Copaxone <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 January 2015)</a>. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had invalidated Teva's patent '808, which covers a manufacturing method and expires on 1 September 2015. Eight other patents expired last May.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruling comes even as the FDA had earlier, for the seventh time, denied a citizen petition from Teva requesting US regulators not approve an ANDA that references Copaxone unless certain conditions were satisfied <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-denies-Tevas-7th-petition-to-stop-generic-Copaxone-355356%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 2 December 2014)</a>.</p><p>News of the 20 January court order hit Natco, which has partnered with Mylan for generic Copaxone. On 21 January Natco's shares declined by 5.9% to close at INR1,432.10 ($23.20) on the Bombay Stock Exchange. </p><p>A Natco statement to the bourse, however, underscored that the Supreme Court made ''no finding'' as to the validity of the '808 patent but instead sent the case back to the Federal Circuit to consider the matter ''in view of the modified standard''. </p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, however, believes that generic Copaxone launch timelines had now been pushed forward to September, with an at-risk launch looking less likely, unless Mylan had something planned. </p><p>''Any upside for Natco is now pushed forward to September. But a September launch could see more players, potentially Synthon and even Dr Reddy's Laboratories, thereby diluting the opportunity'' Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Analysts at ICICI Securities had earlier listed three launch scenarios for generic Copaxone, assigning probabilities to each for valuation purposes, wherein they cited a 75% probability of an "at risk" launch of generic Copaxone sometime soon in the US by Mylan <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Natco-stock-rides-Copaxone-generic-probability-wave-352451%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 June 2014)</a>. </p><p>Mylan, in its reaction to the 20 January court order, said that it continued to believe that the '808 patent was invalid as ''indefinite'' and would address that issue with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. ''Nevertheless, Mylan's global platform has consistently demonstrated that our success is not about any one product. With that said, we look forward to bringing our generic version of Copaxone to market," the US firm added.</p><p>Mr Mehta, however, also referred to another worrying factor for generic players &ndash; the rapid switching to the 40 mg/mL thrice weekly version of Copaxone by patients. At the end of 2Q14, Teva had seen a 51% conversion rate of patients from the older product to the newly launched option. Teva then said it was targeting a conversion rate of 65% of patients from the old Copaxone to the new longer-acting formulation by 31 December 2014.</p><p>Teva's top brass had also noted, at the time of the Q2 earnings call last year, that the 65% conversion target stood regardless of the possibility of a Copaxone generic entering the market <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/2Q-EARNINGS-Teva-raises-expectations-despite-possible-Copaxone-generics-353138%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 31 July 2014)</a>. </p><p>Teva launched the 40 mg/mL version in the US in January 2014. </p><p>Teva had previously warned that it will aggressively defend it intellectual property and seek all available damages, including damages to both the 20mg and 40mg products for their full life. The 40mg version is patent protected till 2030. "Any company launching at risk faces significant potential exposure &ndash; in the billions of dollars, before trebling," Teva had said at the time of its first quarter results. </p><p>The Israeli firm had earlier filed a suit in the US against Momenta/Sandoz and Mylan/Natco for infringement of multiple patents covering the chemical composition of Copaxone, methods of using the product and processes for manufacturing the product.</p>
