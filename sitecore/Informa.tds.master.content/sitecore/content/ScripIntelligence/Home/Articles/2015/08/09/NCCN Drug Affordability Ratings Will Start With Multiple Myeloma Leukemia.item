<p><p>The US National Comprehensive Cancer Network will begin presenting information on drug affordability in its clinical practice guidelines in mid-October, with an initial focus on treatments for multiple myeloma and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).</p><p><p>The organization decided to lead off with the two diseases because "there are a lot of discussions going on now, specifically looking at the new agents for multiple myeloma and the newer and older agents for CML, and what the trade-offs are in those various regimens," NCCN CEO Robert Carlson explained in an interview.</p><p><p>"There also are sort of a limited number of [treatment] options" for the two diseases, "so we wanted to start with something where we expected to see differences but we also wanted a limited playing field so we could get it done," Carlson added.</p><p><p>Multiple myeloma has been a fertile area for drug development in recent years, but advances have prompted concerns about unsustainable costs. In the treatment of CML, high drug costs have been tied to adverse patient outcomes.</p><p><p>Cancer drug affordability will be one of five measures in a new rating feature that will be added to the NCCN guidelines to expand upon the information traditionally presented in existing recommendations. Ratings will also be presented on: efficacy, safety, quantity/quality of available data and the consistency of available data.</p><p><p>The NCCN guidelines lay out recommendations for evidence-based, consensus-driven management decisions and interventions involved in treating cancer, organized by cancer type. They are widely consulted by physicians, patients and payers to help determine appropriate treatment and are developed and updated regularly by NCCN expert panels drawn from member organizations.</p><p><p>The multiple myeloma and CML guidelines will be unveiled at the NCCN Annual Congress on Hematologic Malignancies, which will be held in San Francisco Oct. 16-17.</p><p><p>NCCN is also planning to add the new ratings feature to clinical guidelines covering high-incidence solid tumors, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, by the end of the year, Carlson said.</p><p><p>Each of the five evidence domains in the new feature will be rated on a scale of one to five, with five being "good" and one being "not so good," said Carlson. Members of the expert panels that work on the guidelines are asked to independently score each measure and then the individual scores are collated to derive a set of five average scores for each drug. Panelists are not asked to compare one regimen to another.</p><p><p>Scores will be presented in a graph with vertical columns ("blocks") representing each domain and the higher the column, the better the rating. The columns will also be shaded to indicate the strength of the scores. "The more color [users] see, the better the scores in each of these measures," Carlson noted.</p><p><h2>Affordability Reflects Range Of Costs</h2><p><p>The affordability measure will reflect a range of costs associated with drug treatment. It will start with acquisition costs for the drug itself but then also include the cost of administration, supportive care (such as anti-emetics or growth factors), toxicity monitoring, hospitalization for administration, if needed, and hospitalization for management of toxicity as a result of treatment, if needed.</p><p><p>"We&rsquo;ve gone beyond [average sales price] because we think that looking at ASP for the chemotherapeutic agent is not adequate," Carlson explained. "There are so many other considerations that you really have to factor in." The cost metric will not take into account patient cost-sharing because that can be so variable, depending on insurance coverage, he added.</p><p><p>Information on drug costs will come from panelists' own clinical experience. "The panel members individually have access to that information should they choose to look at it," Carlson pointed out. He added that "pretty much all of the physicians on our panel are sub-specialists, so they already have a pretty good idea about what the cost of the specific agents actually are and they're instructed to include that cost in their overall assessment of the regimen."</p><p><p>NCCN does not provide any price benchmarks to help panelists score cost. "We&rsquo;re not saying a regimen that costs $100,000 to $125,000 a month should be scored in this box. It's really their overall professional estimate about what the expense would be," Carlson said.</p><p><p>Carlson also noted that so far the scores, though calculated by panelists independently, have shown a "tremendous amount of agreement across multiple different experts."</p><p><h2>Considering All Available Data, Off-Label Uses</h2><p><p>Information used to rate efficacy and safety includes "the universe of data that exists at that specific decision point" and is not limited to randomized clinical trials, Carlson said. "Whatever data our panels have reviewed or considered in putting the recommendations into the guidelines is the sort of data that the panels will be considering in making the evidence for the evidence blocks."</p><p><p>In addition, NCCN's guidelines already indicate when the level of available data on a particular treatment is high versus low "and that should also be reflected in the evidence blocks, in terms of the data quantity/quality and the consistency of the data," he pointed out.</p><p><p>Treatments considered will include both FDA-approved indications and off-label uses, as is already the practice in the guidelines, he added. "Our guidelines currently include almost all FDA on-label indications" and "also include a number of recommendations that are off-label indications, and the evidence blocks will be associated with both the on-label and the off-label uses that are included in our guidelines."</p><p><h2>Differences From ASCO Value Framework</h2><p><p>NCCN's approach to considering the cost of treatment is different in several respects from the approach proposed by the American Society for Clinical Oncology in its recently released draft framework for valuing cancer drugs, Carlson noted. In the ASCO framework, cost is juxtaposed with a "net health benefit" score to help patients and physicians determine the overall value of a drug.</p><p><p>In considering cost, for example, ASCO's framework focuses on the acquisition cost for the drug alone and does not take into account the cost of associated care, as NCCN's guidelines will do. The ASCO draft also includes patient cost-sharing, unlike the NCCN approach.</p><p><p>ASCO's framework generates a net health benefit score for drugs using only randomized clinical trials and focuses solely on on-label indications, while NCCN is adopting a broader approach to data collection.</p><p><p>ASCO has also engaged in a stakeholder consultation process that has included a defined period of public comment for the draft version of the framework, whereas the NCCN approach has not been as formalized. However, Carlson maintained the NCCN process has not been closed to stakeholder input.</p><p><p>"This is a concept and a process that has been discussed pretty extensively for a long period of time," he said. "We have, over the last year or so, presented the concept and some of the examples to a number of stakeholders for feedback and input."</p><p><p>He also pointed out that unlike the ASCO process, "NCCN&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement is a 365-day a year process. &#8230; We don't consider that each of the guidelines have a 30-day review and comment period, rather we actually consider that all of our guidelines and initiatives all of the time are open for review and comment."</p><p><h2>Stakeholder Engagement</h2><p><p>Carlson said NCCN has heard from three stakeholder groups "rather extensively." They include providers, who "very much look forward to more detailed information about why our panels are recommending specific therapies and &#8230; how [treatments] differ from one another."</p><p><p>Stakeholders also include patient advocates and individual patients, who "are the most enthusiastic of any of our stakeholder groups about this initiative. They look at the evidence blocks as a great way for them to understand the trade-offs and the different options that are available to them," he pointed out.</p><p><p>The "third group we've heard a lot from is industry, the pharmaceutical industry specifically," Carlson commented. "And I think it would be fair to say that almost 100% of their questions, comments and concerns relate to the affordability measure."</p><p><p>However, he maintained, "I'm not sure why they are concerned about that. We are providing no more information than is already publicly available. We're not providing more information than the payers already know at least as well as [drug firms] do. All we're doing is making that information more transparent."</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in 'The Pink Sheet' DAILY.
