<p> AMAG Pharmaceuticals will increase its focus on women and maternal health with its $700m purchase of Cord Blood Registry (CBR) nine months after it acquired Lumara Health, the maker of pre-term labor drug Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection) for up to $1bn. </p> <p> Waltham, Massachusetts-based AMAG's stock dipped 4.6% to $67.14 per share on 29 June after the company said it would buy CBR, the largest service provider for families that choose to collect and store stem cells from umbilical cord blood. The stock fell on a day when the US stock market declined generally based on concerns about Greece's debt situation. However, AMAG's share price has more than doubled since the Lumara deal in late September, based on sales projections for Makena and the rest of the company's portfolio, which includes Feraheme (ferumoxytol; Rienso in the EU) for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). </p> <p> AMAG's stock soared 139.2% between 29 September and 26 June, despite the US FDA's rejection of single-dose vials of Makena in May and Takeda Pharmaceutical's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-AMAGs-single-dose-vial-Makena-358648" target="_new">decision</a> to return its ex-US rights to Feraheme in December. </p> <p> Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a 29 June research note that &quot;CBR's acquisition marks another step in AMAG's growth [and] diversification strategy focused on high-margin specialty products, particularly in maternal health.&quot; Mr Schwartz noted that the deal could boost Makena sales, since AMAG &quot;management expects 75 Makena sales reps to work in parallel with 47 CBR reps in order to maximize revenue potential for the two businesses.&quot; </p> <p> AMAG notes that CBR generated $126m in 2014 revenue and the stem cell storage company typically has double-digit revenue growth. AMAG is projecting 2015 revenue from CBR that is in line or slightly above 2014's total, but the company expects marketing efforts for CBR to boost Makena's sales, which are estimated to reach $260m to $285m in 2015. AMAG reported $55.5m in first quarter sales, which was 85% higher than Makena's $30.1m total during the first quarter of 2014. </p> <p> &quot;CBR is a strong strategic fit for our maternal health business and will advance our <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Heiden-seeks-The-new-AMAG-CEO-outlines-a-strategy-of-cost-reduction-and-acquisition-332844" target="_new">strategy</a> to pursue differentiated products in growing specialty markets,&quot; AMAG CEO William Heiden said in a statement from the company. &quot;CBR's sophisticated, consumer-driven marketing capabilities offer a compelling opportunity to reach a broader population of expectant mothers who may benefit from our product offerings in the maternal health space, including Makena.&quot; </p> <p> The CBR acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015. Jefferies Finance and Barclays Capital are providing $800m in debt financing, which AMAG will use to fund the transaction and repay a prior senior secured loan. </p> <p> The company's investments in maternal health appear to be more fruitful than its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AMAG-rises-as-Feraheme-prospects-broaden-327823" target="_new">long-running investment</a> in Feraheme. AMAG has been working for several years to expand its IDA indication beyond CKD patients, which could double the drug's market. The FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/AMAG-slides-on-FDA-rejection-of-Feraheme-label-expansion-349533" target="_new">rejected</a> the company's latest proposal to expand the label in January 2014. </p> <p> AMAG expects Feraheme and MuGard sales to total $90m to $100m in 2015. AMAG licensed the oral rinse <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amag-licenses-oral-rinse-for-cancer-patients-from-Access-Pharma-343947" target="_new">MuGard</a> from Access Pharmaceuticals in 2013. </p> <p><p><p><p>
