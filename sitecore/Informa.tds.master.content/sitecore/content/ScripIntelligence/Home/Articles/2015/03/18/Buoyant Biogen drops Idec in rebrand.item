<p>Biogen Idec has dropped the second part of its name and will be known henceforth simply as Biogen. In a corporate rebranding exercise which has also seen it drop its old logo (of a rectangular frame with corners alternately extended and truncated around the name) in favor of a new, rounded blue and green spherical motif with a reinstated capital 'B' in Biogen, the firm wants to "acknowledge our heritage" while creating "a new image to reflect our new reality", according to a letter from CEO George Scangos. </p><p>Biogen merged with IDEC Pharmaceuticals in 2003, in a transaction that was worth around $6-7bn and was aimed at achieving synergies and broadening the pipeline. </p><p>Each company brought a blockbuster to the deal: Idec came with the anti-CD20 antibody Rituxan (rituximab, partnered with Genentech and at the time approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with subsequent approvals including leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis), while Biogen brought multiple sclerosis treatment Avonex (interferon beta 1-a). Rituxan booked $7.5bn in global sales in 2014, but the great majority went to Roche/Genentech. Ex-US patent expiries began in 2013, with the significant US patents covering the drug set to expire in 2015-18. Avonex looks set to be superseded by Biogen's newer MS therapies Tecfidera and Tysabri as the group's best-selling drug in the near future (it booked $3bn in 2014 sales, versus $2.9bn for Tecfidera and $2.0bn for Tysabri). </p><p>"The old Biogen and the old IDEC each contributed meaningfully to our current success, but today we are a new company, distinct from either parent, and we hope not only to carry on our heritage of excellence, but to forge new ground," wrote Dr Scangos. In 2014, Tecfidera helped push Biogen's sales up 40%. The company is also making a play in hemophilia, and recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogens-high-risk-bet-on-Alzheimers-a-potential-game-changer-357421" target="_new">reported encouraging early-stage results in the tricky but potentially rewarding area of Alzheimer's disease</a>.</p><p>Biogen has also launched a new website, www.biogen.com.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-the-pharma-name-game-355506" target="_new">Playing the pharma name game</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">Actavis will become Allergan to emphasize branded pharma focus</a></p>
