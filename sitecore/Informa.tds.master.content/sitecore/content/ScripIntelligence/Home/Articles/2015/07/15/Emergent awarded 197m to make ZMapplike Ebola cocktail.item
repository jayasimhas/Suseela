<p>Emergent BioSolutions snagged a $19.7m contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to develop and manufacture three Ebola monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are the same as those used to make Mapp Biopharmaceuticals' ZMapp &ndash; a drug that gained quick fame last year at the height of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</p><p>But while ZMapp is made using tobacco plants, known as <i>Nicotiana</i>, the three mAbs Emergent will manufacture will be made in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells lines at a 2000 liter scale.</p><p>Emergent's contract is the first task order by a so-called Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (CIADM), which were created by Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide core services for private partners to speed development, manufacturing and availability of drugs, vaccines and medical devices and diagnostic tests. </p><p>The CIADMs, established in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak, are a component of BARDA's National Medical Countermeasures Response Infrastructure.</p><p>Emergent's Baltimore, Maryland facility was designated by HHS a CIADM in 2012 under a partnership with BARDA, which allows the company to contract with the US government through task order requests for requirements, such as operational readiness, development and manufacturing of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear products, warm-base maintenance, surge manufacturing, and workforce development. </p><p>Emergent has manufactured product candidates for the company's pipeline at the Baltimore facility and for ongoing collaborations, including most recently the MVA-EBOZ Ebola vaccine candidate, which currently is being evaluated in a Phase I study.</p><p>Under its BARDA contract, Emergent is tasked with transferring manufacturing processes and materials from the early-stage development work of other companies on the experimental mAbs to the CIADM to begin advanced development, HHS said. </p><p>Emergent will then manufacture the mAb cocktail similar to ZMapp for use in nonclinical and clinical studies and will conduct the work necessary to scale up production to commercial volumes if studies prove successful, the US health agency said.</p><p>"Because large quantities of cell-based monoclonal antibodies can be produced more quickly than tobacco-based monoclonal antibodies, this CIADM project will provide more product for clinical studies and, if clinical studies are successful, for potential stockpiling," HHS said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapps-moment-of-truth-efficacy-trial-starts-356995" target="_new">testing of ZMapp</a> by the National Institutes of Health in West Africa remains ongoing.</p><p>The three-mAb cocktail <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tiny-biotech-Mapps-Ebola-drug-thrust-into-spotlight-353192" target="_new">entered the public spotlight</a> last August when it was used in humans for the first time to treat two Ebola-infected American aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were volunteering in Liberia when they came down with the disease.</p><p>The drug &ndash; the tiny amount that previously was available &ndash; also was used in other patients, although <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-modern-techniques-too-late-to-save-doctor-355108" target="_new">not always with successful outcomes</a>.</p><p>Last year, BARDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-gambles-24.9m-to-speed-Ebola-drug-ZMapp-353682" target="_new">awarded Mapp $24.9m</a> to speed the development of ZMapp. The contract ultimately could be worth $42.3m for tiny San Diego-based Mapp.</p><p>Kentucky Bioprocessing has been doing the work of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">growing ZMapp</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
