<p>After a dramatic exit from Novo Nordisk last week, its former COO Kåre Schultz has been named CEO of Lundbeck. </p><p>Mr Schultz spent 26 years at Novo and was slated to take on the job of CEO at the company as early as 2016. However, managerial changes at Novo announced during the company's first quarter results on 30 April saw him squeezed out of his chief operating officer position.</p><p>He hasn't had to look far for his next role though, the Danish pharma exec will officially join Lundbeck as chief on 20 May. Commenting on his new position Mr Schultz said, "Lundbeck stands out in the industry as a company focused on brain diseases. I'm motivated and inspired by Lundbeck's vision and excited to bring my business background to lead Lundbeck to the next phase of its development."</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies said the appointment of "high caliber" figure Mr Schultz is "a coup for Lundbeck." Mr Schultz &ndash; who is currently chair of the board of Royal Unibrew and on the board of Lego &ndash; brings "significant pharma experience to Lundbeck, in our view, both commercial and operational, plus we are encouraged by prior suggestions he may perhaps have been considered Novo's future CEO," Jefferies analysts said. </p><p>Håkan Björklund, chair of Lundbeck's board of directors said, "With his unique experience from an impressive career in the pharmaceutical industry, Kåre Schultz has all the qualifications to handle the challenges Lundbeck faces."</p><p>Lundbeck has been headed by chair Mr Björklund since November last year when its old CEO Ulf Wiinberg was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lundbeck-CEO-resigns-6-key-questions-answered-355241" target="_new">forced to resign</a> for failing to disclose shares he had received in another company, which left him in breach of Lundbeck's code of conduct. </p><p>Lundbeck said at the time it expected to have a new chief exec in place by August 2015. The company said it wasn't expressly seeking a Danish leader, but "the person must have worked in the pharmaceutical industry and have significant international experience."</p><h2>1Q profits down</h2><p>Mr Schultz joins Lundbeck at a time when the company is experiencing genericization of certain lead brands, including depression and anxiety drug Cipralex and Alzheimer's therapy Ebixa. The company posted a quarterly net loss for the three months through to 31 March of DKK81m ($12.3m), compared with a net profit of DKK331m in the year-earlier period.</p><p>However in its 1Q 2015 earnings announcement, Lundbeck highlighted that revenue from its strategic core products grew by 229% to DKK691m in the quarter; representing close to 20% of total revenue. </p><p>The core products, outlined as Abilify Maintena, Brintellix, Northera, Onfi and Selincro, saw combined sales of DKK691m in the quarter, well ahead of consensus DKK578m. This was largely driven by a much stronger than expected performance for epilepsy product Onfi (clobazam). </p><p>Gross profit for the quarter reached DKK2.38bn, beating consensus expectations of DKK2.22bn, but was down from the DKK3.59bn seen in 1Q 2014. The company said that it is experiencing unusually high uncertainty as it invests in the launch and late-stage development of new products.</p><p>As such Lundbeck said its outlook for full year 2015 remains unchanged after the first quarter at DKK13.2-13.7bn in core revenue and around DKK0 in core EBIT.</p>
