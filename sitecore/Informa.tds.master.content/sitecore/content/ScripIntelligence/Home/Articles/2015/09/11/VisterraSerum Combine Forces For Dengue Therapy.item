<p>US biotech, Visterra, has joined hands with vaccine giant, Serum Institute of India, to take its early stage monoclonal antibody product candidate (VIS513) for dengue forward.</p><p>Earlier this year, Visterra formed a collaboration with Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) for VIS513 and the alliance with Serum is specific to the Indian subcontinent.</p><p>There is currently no specific treatment for dengue and prevention essentially depends on effective vector control measures, though there has been considerable activity in the area. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofi-eyes-India-for-dengue-vaccine-Phase-III-study-354874" target="_new">Sanofi's late-stage dengue vaccine</a> has made considerable progress, while <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/US-site-closures-as-Takeda-restructures-vaccines-business-358726" target="_new">Takeda</a> has a tetravalent dengue vaccine TAK-003 (ex-Inviragen) in Phase II. The Washington, DC-based <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/60-Degrees-Takes-Dengue-Treatments-Forward-Saying-Vaccines-Are-An-Imperfect-Solution-360064" target="_new">60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals</a> recently outlined plans for a Phase II trial for its dengue fever candidates. </p><p>In preclinical studies, Visterra's VIS513 has demonstrated that it potently neutralized all four serotypes of dengue virus and protected animals challenged with a lethal dose of dengue virus. It is currently being developed as a single administration for the treatment of dengue virus infection. </p><p>Serum will receive an exclusive license to VIS513 for the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka. The Indian firm will fund and be responsible for the clinical development of VIS513 in the licensed territories, including the filing of regulatory applications. It will also handle commercialization in these territories.</p><p>Serum will make a $5m upfront payment to the US clinical-stage biotech and up to $34m based on the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones. Visterra will be entitled to tiered, double-digit royalties based on net sales in the licensed territories once VIS513 is commercialized.</p><p>Brian JG Pereira, president and CEO of Visterra, noted that Serum has a proven track record in developing novel biological products and expansive commercialization capabilities in the Indian subcontinent, making it an ideal partner. The Pune-based Serum is the world's largest vaccine manufacturer in terms of number of doses made and supplied.</p><p>Visterra's deal with A*STAR, announced in May this year, will see the partners also work together with infectious disease experts at Duke-National University of Singapore to generate additional data required to initiate clinical trials of VIS513.</p>
