<p>Asceneuron, a startup biotech company with ambitions to take the lead in neurodegeneration drug development, has managed to secure CHF30m (US$30.6m) to advance its tauopathy drug. Investors have clearly seen potential in the company despite a lack of clarity on the relationship between the tau protein and neurodegeneration.</p><p>Asceneuron is captained by CEO Dr. Dirk Beher and chief operating officer Dr. Christoph Wiessner. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the biotech is about to celebrate its third birthday after being created in October 2012 under Merck Serono's Entrepreneur Partnership Program. Its current largest investor is Sofinnova Partners, which participated in the recent series A financing round. Other investors include founding financiers MS Ventures; and new participants SR One, Kurma Partners and Johnson & Johnson Innovation (known as JJDC, Inc.). </p><p>Proceeds from this financing round will support the development of Asceneuron's lead product, an orally bioavailable O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, ASN-561, up to the completion of a pivotal proof-of-concept trial in the orphan tauopathy disease progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). ASN-561 is the most advanced of Asceneuron's pipeline candidates, but the company is also investigating O-GlcNAcase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and primary age-related tauopathy. </p><p>Beher says he is looking forward to creating "a leading company in the field of neurodegeneration."</p><p>The CEO told <i>Scrip</i> that the company is in the IND enabling phase for ASN-561 and anticipates the start of a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers in 2017. </p><p>"The funding will support all work including a proof-of-concept trial in PSP, which if all goes well could be sufficient for submitting a marketing authorization," Beher said. </p><h2>New Approach</h2><p>Asceneuron appears to have the only O-GlcNAcase inhibitor currently in development. </p><p>Targeting tau pathology is an attractive strategy as it has broader implications in neurodegeneration, potentially opening up Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as other dementias &ndash; potentially allowing access to huge markets.</p><p>However, it's early days and Asceneuron has yet to jump the major hurdle of clinical testing, no small matter particularly as it has not yet been proven that targeting tau translates into a clinical effect in patients with any neurodegenerative disease. One company developing tau-based therapies, TauRx, has managed to get a drug into large Phase III trials. However, the evidence supporting these trials is generally seen as hand-picked observations, rather than a robust clinical finding.</p><p>Nevertheless, Beher noted: "We have had exciting data in a preclinical tau mouse model and a translatable target engagement biomarker," he said. </p><h2>Investing In People</h2><p>Asceneuron's chief added: "We should not forget that investors invest in people. We are a team of seasoned drug hunters and neurodegeneration experts." </p><p>Beher comes from the Alzheimer's disease team at Merck Serono. He also managed the <i>in vitro</i> pharmacology team and oversaw a diverse CNS portfolio as a management team member in the neuroscience department at Amgen Inc. </p><p>Meanwhile, Asceneuron's COO and vice-president of R&D, Wiessner, was a director in neurodegenerative diseases at Merck Serono from 2008-2012. From 1996-2008 he worked in the CNS department at Novartis, ultimately heading the CNS target and lead discovery unit as a director. </p><p>The firm's scientific advisory board also includes prominent European neurology figures: Professor Christian Haass, head of the department of metabolic biochemistry at the Adolf-Butenandt Institute at LMU Munich; Professor Adam Boxer, an associate professor of neurology and the Vera and John Graziadio Scholar in Alzheimer's disease research at UCSF; and Professor Günter U. Höglinger, head of the Institute for Translational Neurodegeneration of the DZNE (German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases) and a consultant senior neurologist in the department of neurology at the Klinikum rechts der Isar of the Technical University Munich, Germany.</p><p>In conjunction with the series A round Henrijette Richter of Sofinnova Partners, Deborah Harland of SR One, Vanessa Malier of Kurma Partners and Hakan Goker of MS Ventures will join the company's board of directors, along with a yet to be named representative of JJDC.</p><p>
