<p><p>After $100m second offering that gave the antibody company a $1bn valuation, Adimab is inking a new partnership with big biotech Celgene to develop light chain libraries that will help it develop antibodies against multiple targets. </p><p>According to the deal, announced 07 May, Adimab will receive an undisclosed upfront payment, as well as clinical milestones and royalties on any products that result from the collaboration. The initial timeline for the deal is two years, with Celgene having the option to extend the agreement another two years. </p><p>The two companies will develop light chain libraries that will be used by the smaller biotech to develop fully human antibodies against multiple targets. Celgene has the right to research any of the antibodies generated and the option to license them for development and commercialization. </p><p>This isn't the first time the pair has worked together; Celgene inked a collaboration with Adimab in August 2013. Under the original agreement, Adimab used its yeast-based discovery platform to generate antibodies for Celgene. The companies would not reveal the progress of that collaboration. </p><p>Celgene certainly isn't Adimab's only big name partner; the biotech has a laundry list of high profile partners including Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, Gilead, Biogen, Pfizer and Novartis. All in all, Adimab has more than 30 partnership agreements. </p><p>Its litany of partners has allowed the company to bring a good deal of cash -- $100m in a secondary offering of shares to Fidelity Investments and Mithril, the hedge fund co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel. Mithril contributed $30m, while Fidelity put in $70m for a combined stake in the company of 9%. While secondary offerings typically dilute the shares of existing investors, Adimab had enough income from its existing partnership to buyback $100m in shares from existing investors &ndash; giving several early investors like Google Ventures and several angel investors from Dartmouth an exit, without an exit. The privately-held company also started paying dividends to limited partners.</p><p><p>
