<p>While it may appear at first glance the FDA's review of Amgen's proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab) mirrors in many ways what the agency said late last week about Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' experimental drug in the same class, Praluent (alirocumab), regulators have identified some differences &ndash; mostly notably around the dosing of the products.</p><p>But it was apparent Dr James Smith, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products, enjoyed the benefits of "copy and paste" in putting together his briefing memo for the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) about Repatha because the regulator already had said many of the same comments about Praluent a few days earlier.</p><p>Like Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' PCSK9, the FDA reviewers said Amgen's drug appeared to be very effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p><p>The central question the FDA has about Repatha, Dr Smith said &ndash; in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Heart-of-FDAs-1st-PCSK9-review-population-ditching-statins-358772" target="_new">word-for-word duplicate</a> of what he remarked about Praluent &ndash; was in what population does the LDL-C-lowering benefit of the drug exceed its risks to support US approval.</p><p>Also like Praluent, Dr Smith raised the concern about the potential for patients to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Heart-of-FDAs-1st-PCSK9-review-population-ditching-statins-358772" target="_new">prematurely stop taking statins</a> in favor of Repatha, which currently lacks long-term safety and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data.</p><p>Amgen is seeking to market Repatha as a therapy to reduce LDL-C, as well as changes in other lipid parameters, in adults with primary hyperlipidemia &ndash; heterozygous familial and nonfamilial &ndash; or mixed dyslipidemia in combination with a statin; in combination with a statin plus other lipid lowering therapies; as monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant; and as monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients for whom a statin is not considered clinically appropriate. </p><p>The firm also wants to sell the drug as a treatment to reduce LDL-C, as well as to reduce other lipid parameters, in adults and adolescents 12 years or older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in combination with other lipid lowering therapies, like statins and LDL apheresis.</p><p>HoFH is a rare severe form of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition caused by genetic mutations which lead to high levels of LDL-C at an early age.</p><p>Patients with HoFH have increased CV risk because of highly elevated LDL-C from birth, even with aggressive statin therapy, Amgen said. </p><p>"Thus, there remains a substantial unmet medical need for additional lipid-lowering therapies in these populations," the Thousand Oaks, California biotech giant said.</p><p>The FDA is awaiting CV outcomes trial (CVOT) data for both anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, which are not expected to be available until 2017.</p><p>Amgen said on 5 June it had fully enrolled its FOURIER CVOT study, with about 27,500 patients now in the trial.</p><p>Sanofi&rsquo;s and Regeneron's CVOT is an 18,000-patient study.</p><p>The FDA noted that the goal of LDL-C-lowering therapy is to reduce the risk for CV disease.</p><p>Historically, regulators said, a change in LDL-C has been considered sufficient to establish the effectiveness of a lipid-altering drug intended for use to reduce CV risk without any regulatory requirement to demonstrate evidence for benefit in a CVOT &ndash; provided the reduction is sufficiently robust and the product, or its class, does not have safety issues that raise concern that risk exceeds benefit.</p><p>Without the CVOTs for Repatha and Praluent, the FDA must decide whether the LDL-C lowering seen with both drugs is sufficient to substitute for demonstrating an effect on clinical outcomes in certain patients, like those with different degrees of CV risk, familial versus non-familial etiologies of hyperlipidemia and use with or without concomitant statins.</p><p>So the agency is seeking EMDAC's advice about what to do. The committee will examine Praluent's biologics license application (BLA) on 9 June and mull over Repatha's on 10 June.</p><p>The drugs are in a neck-and-neck race to be the first PCSK9 on the US market.</p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron have an earlier <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date of 24 July, versus Amgen's 27 August PDUFA, but the FDA has been known to give its blessing to medicines ahead of their goal dates and so the agency could wind up doing side-by-side approvals, depending on whether regulators still have questions after the EMDAC meetings.</p><p><b>Dosing questions</b></p><p>Documents posted on the FDA's website on 8 June reveal that because of its proposed dosing, regulators have more questions about Amgen's drug for the EMDAC than for Sanofi&rsquo;s and Regeneron&rsquo;s product, although the agency's reviewers also had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Heart-of-FDAs-1st-PCSK9-review-population-ditching-statins-358772" target="_new">raised some issues</a> about Praluent's proposed high and low dosing options &ndash; which was supposed to be its advantage over Repatha.</p><p>Amgen has proposed two dosage regimens for Repatha, which were selected to appeal to patient preference considerations related to procedure and frequency, rather than to provide doses intended to allow titration with respect to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering, regulators said.</p><p>"Healthcare providers who are uncomfortable with very low levels of LDL-C would either have to down titrate other lipid-altering drugs," such as a statin, or discontinue Repatha, the FDA said. </p><p>So the agency wants the EMDAC to discuss whether there are any concerns with Repatha not being labeled with dosage regimens that provide varying degrees of LDL-C lowering if the FDA approves the drug.</p><p>Amgen also has proposed a dosage for the HoFH population of either 420mg once monthly or 420mg every 2 weeks (Q2W). </p><p>But FDA clinical reviewer Dr Eileen Craig said the limited amount of safety and efficacy data for the 420mg Q2W dosage "are problematic," especially because that regimen could potentially be used in adolescents as young as 12 years. </p><p>The FDA plans to ask its EMDAC advisers whether Amgen has provided adequate data to characterize the efficacy and safety of the 420mg Q2W dosage in HoFH population.</p><p>In asking the EMDAC to vote on approval of Repatha, the FDA has separated out the question on HoFH for a thumbs up or down from the committee.</p><p>The proposed dosage of the drug in the primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia indication is 140mg every two weeks or 420mg once monthly.</p><p><b>Safety concerns</b></p><p>Dr Craig had pointed to some safety concerns with Repatha, including an observed imbalance of pancreatitis; an imbalance of serious renal disorders and proteinuria in statin-intolerant and diabetic subjects; the possible increased incidence of new onset diabetes in patients with baseline impaired fasting glucose; musculoskeletal adverse events and creatine kinase elevations, particularly with concomitant use of statins; transaminase elevations and possible drug-induced hepatotoxicity, particularly with concomitant use of statins; a potential for neurocognitive adverse events with long-term use; hypersensitivity and skin-related adverse reactions; injection site adverse reactions, as well as any adverse reactions that may be related to chronic, extremely low levels of LDL-C induced by a drug that have yet to be identified.</p><p>But in the FDA's briefing documents, Dr Craig also said she thought those safety issues could "adequately" be addressed in labeling and by appropriate monitoring and treatment by healthcare providers. </p><p>In an addendum to the Repatha documents, the FDA said an update it was provided about the preliminary data from Amgen's FOURIER CVOT study revealed that serious hepatic adverse events were about evenly split between the drug and placebo.</p><p>Amgen did not submit narratives for cases in which the patients were found to be allocated to placebo, so regulators said they were unable to comment on what extent the serious hepatic adverse events in the placebo group were similar in nature to those in the Repatha group. </p><p>But, the agency said, &ldquo;at least at this preliminary stage,&rdquo; it was "reassuring" the event counts of hepatic adverse events identified as serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions were essentially identical in each treatment group. </p><p>"Because this trial is still ongoing, these events are still in the process of being investigated," the FDA said, adding that a full picture of the safety profile from the CVOT would require evaluation of the Repatha and placebo groups at the trial's conclusion.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
