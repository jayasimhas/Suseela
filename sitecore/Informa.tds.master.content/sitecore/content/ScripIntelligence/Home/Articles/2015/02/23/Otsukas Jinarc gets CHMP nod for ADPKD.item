<p>The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has given the green light to Otsuka's orphan drug Jinarc (tolvaptan) for treating autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the committee also recommends additional monitoring of the risk of liver damage.</p><p>Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and failing kidney function in adults with ADPKD, a chronic and progressive kidney disease that causes cyst growth in the kidneys. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin-2-receptor antagonist and acts by blocking receptors in the kidneys to which vasopressin, a hormone, attaches. This regulates the level of water and sodium in the body. In ADPKD, it is thought that kidney cells do not respond normally to vasopressin, leading to the formation of fluid-filled cysts, so by blocking vasopressin receptors in the kidneys, Jinarc can slow down cyst formation.</p><p>The CHMP's recommendation is based on the Phase III randomized, double blind and placebo controlled TEMPO 3:4 trial. With 1,445 ADPKD patients, this is the largest clinical study to be conducted in the disease, according to the firm. In the study, tolvaptan met its primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 49% in the annual increase in total kidney volume versus placebo(p<0.001). it="" was="" also="" shown="" to="" reduce="" the="" decline="" in="" kidney="" function="" by="" 30%="" versus="" placebo=""></0.001).><></p><p>However, the study also found a greater number of people with serious liver adverse effects when taking the drug (2.3%, 22/961) compared with placebo (1.0%, 5/483). No cases of liver failure were found in the study, but there were concerns that in a larger patient population tolvaptan could cause liver injury that could lead to liver failure. In light of these concerns, the CHMP recommended additional monitoring to keep an eye on the risk of liver damage and proposed that that the drug be prescribed in the context of a registry. This will allow additional monitoring, including blood tests to check liver function before beginning treatment and every months for the following 18 months, then every three months thereafter. Additional safety profiling to further assess the risk of liver injury associated with Jinarc is to be carried out in a post-authorization study. </p><p>Treatment with Jinarc must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians with expertise in managing ADPKD and a full understanding of the risks of tolvaptan therapy including liver damage, and monitoring requirements.</p><p>Tolvaptan won orphan designation in Europe in 2013 for ADPKD. The product won regulatory approval in Japan in 2014 and in Canada earlier this month for the disease.</p><p>There are thought to be 205,000 patients in Europe.</p><p>Formal approval from the European Commission is likely to follow soon. An approval would be good news for the Japanese firm, but it will not be nearly enough to fill the hole left by the impending patent expiry of its biggest product, the antipsychotic Abilify (aripiprazole). The US patent is set to expire this year, which will prompt US sales for the drug to fall by more than $1bn (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Abilify-delivers-but-patent-cliff-looms-for-Otsuka-355164" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 20 November, 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p>
