<p>Before the FDA can start the negotiation process with the drug industry on what the parties want from each other in the next round of the agency's user fee program, regulators must seek the public's input.</p><p>And on 15 July, the FDA plans to do that &ndash; announcing in a 13 May <i>Federal Register</i> notice it will convene a public meeting at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which it is required by Congress to do.</p><p>Regulators also have opened a docket to receive comments from the public about their views on the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA), whose fifth round expires on 30 September 2017 and must be renewed by Congress for the FDA to continue collecting the fees.</p><p>The intent of PDUFA, regulators said, is to provide additional revenues to the FDA so it can hire more staff, improve systems and establish a better managed drug review process to make therapies available to patients sooner without compromising review quality or the agency's standards for safety, efficacy and quality. </p><p>In exchange for the fees, the FDA agrees to certain performance goals involving its drug reviews.</p><p>The FDA wants the public to weigh in at the meeting and in comments about the overall performance of PDUFA V and what features, if any, the agency should reduce, discontinue or add to ensure the continued efficiency and effectiveness of the drug review process. </p><p>Without legislation to authorize PDUFA VI, which would run from the beginning of fiscal year 2018 through 2022, the FDA would no longer be able to collect user fees.</p><p>PDUFA was originally enacted in 1992 and reauthorized for the first time in 1997 when Congress passed the <i>FDA Modernization Act</i>.</p><p>Lawmakers have renewed the law every five years after that &ndash; most recently in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">2012</a>, which was one of the smoothest processes in the law's history.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
