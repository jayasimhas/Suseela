<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb's daclatasvir-based combinations became the latest target of the FDA's move to take back its breakthrough therapy designations for drugs in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) space.</p><p>But it ultimately may be a moot point for BMS and its current HCV pipeline.</p><p>The company told <i>Scrip</i> it had been notified by the FDA on 5 February that the agency intended to rescind two breakthrough therapy designations awarded to the regimens related to daclatasvir, blaming it on "the &ldquo;evolving HCV treatment landscape."</p><p>This follows Merck's revelation on 4 February it had received a similar notice from the FDA for that company's HCV combination product grazoprevir/elbasvir (MK-5172/MK-8742) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">4 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Merck said the FDA had cited the availability of other recently approved treatments for genotype 1 patients.</p><p>Gilead Sciences and AbbVie both recently brought new HCV combination drugs to the US market, which have essentially provided a cure for the disease &ndash; Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) and Viekira Pak (paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">10 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>).</p><p>BMS emphasized any action the FDA is taking on the two breakthrough therapy designations granted to the company would "not impact our current submission/resubmission timetable of the new drug application for daclatasvir in combination with other antiviral agents for the treatment of hepatitis C."</p><p>This past November, the FDA hit BMS with a complete response letter for its application pursuing approval of daclatasvir in HCV (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-HCV-drug-daclatasvir-snubbed-by-FDA-355285" target="_new">27 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The company initially submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in April 2014 for daclatasvir in combination with the firm's asunaprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-seeks-US-OK-for-daclatasvirasunaprevir-in-HCV-351139" target="_new">07 April 2014</a>).</p><p>But BMS abandoned development of asunaprevir in October 2014 &ndash; withdrawing its NDA for the drug (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-abandons-breakthrough-HCV-combo-354338" target="_new">08 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Analysts said the daclatasvir/asunaprevir combo regimen likely would not have sold well anyway, given its lower efficacy relative to Gilead's and AbbVie's drugs.</p><p>But BMS insisted the dual daclatasvir/asunaprevir regimen was developed to meet the distinct need of the Japanese patient population.</p><p>Given the withdrawal of asunaprevir, the firm said the FDA told the company in November the agency wanted additional data for daclatasvir in combination with other antivirals before making a decision on approval.</p><p>In a 5 February statement to <i>Scrip</i>, BMS said it was "dedicated to the ongoing clinical development program for daclatasvir," a potent, pan-genotypic NS5A complex inhibitor, which the firm said is currently being investigated globally in "multiple treatment regimens for HCV patients with high unmet need."</p><p>The company said it continues to progress its daclatasvir clinical trial program focused on patients with high unmet needs, including pre- and post-liver transplant (ALLY-1), HCV patients co-infected with HIV (ALLY-2) and patients with genotype 3 (ALLY-3).</p><p>The firm&rsquo;s immediate focus now is meeting its current daclatasvir resubmission timetable in the US. </p><p>It&rsquo;s separately evaluating global regulatory plans for its all-oral 3DAA regimen. </p><p>BMS received breakthrough therapy for its all-oral 3DAA (daclatasvir/asunaprevir/BMS-791325) and its dual daclatasvir-based regimens in late 2013 and early 2014, respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-wins-breakthrough-status-for-daclatasvirasunaprevir-dual-regimen-in-HCV-350230" target="_new">25 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The breakthrough therapies designation was created under the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act</i> to speed the development and review processes for medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">10 July 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-more-cha-ching-will-PDUFA-V-satisfy-on-the-ba-bling-332986" target="_new">19 July 2012</a>).</p><p>To gain the breakthrough therapy designation, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">30 May 2014</a>). </p><p>As of 23 January &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 66 of the 227 requests for the breakthrough designation it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 112.</p><p>As of 31 January, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least nine of the 46 requests it has received for breakthrough status, denying at least 31.</p><p>At least two breakthrough therapy designations have been withdrawn after being granted.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
