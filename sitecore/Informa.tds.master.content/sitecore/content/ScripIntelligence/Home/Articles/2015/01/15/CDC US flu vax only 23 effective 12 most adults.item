<p>An analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed the 2014-15 flu vaccines have been only 23% effective against the A and B virus strains currently circulating in the US &ndash; one of the lowest rates in recent years.</p><p>Generally, the flu vaccines fall into a 60%-70% effectiveness range.</p><p>For the 2013-14 flu vaccine, the CDC's mid-season VE estimate was 61% for all age groups (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-Flu-vaccines-providing-solid-protection-but-young-adults-hit-hard-350167" target="_new">21 February 2014</a>).</p><p>But the 23% for 2014-15 is for the overall population. It runs much lower for most Americans, with the vaccine being only 12% effective at keeping adults 18-49 years from going to the doctor with the flu and 14% for adults 50 years or older.</p><p>Children 6 months to 17 years have had the best protection &ndash; although still very low, at 26%. </p><p>By 3 January, 46 states were experiencing widespread flu activity, with predominance of influenza A (H3N2) virus.</p><p>The low vaccine effectiveness for the 2014-15 product likely reflects the fact that more than two-thirds of circulating H3N2 viruses are antigenically and genetically different, or drifted, from the H3N2 vaccine component of 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines, the CDC said.</p><p>Vaccines licensed by the FDA for the current season include CSL's Afluria; GlaxoSmithKline's Fluarix trivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval trivalent and FluLaval Quadrivalent; MedImmune's FluMist Quadrivalent; Novartis' Fluvirin and Flucelvax; Protein Sciences' Flublok; and Sanofi's Fluzone trivalent and Fluzone Quadrivalent.</p><p>The CDC began broadly warning the public in early December about the poor match of this season's flu vaccines, although the agency had known for several months it would likely be ineffective &ndash; something it declared too late in the season for anything to be done (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/H3N2-flu-drift-alarm-too-late-for-vaccine-355430" target="_new">05 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-shot-less-effective-this-season-355412" target="_new">04 December 2014</a>).</p><p>On 3 December, the CDC said influenza viral characterization data indicated that 48% of the H3N2 viruses collected and analyzed in the US from 1 October through 22 November were antigenically "like" vaccine component against that strain, but that 52% were antigenically different, or drifted</p><p>By late December, the CDC had declared the flu an epidemic in the US &ndash; noting it had reached that threshold much earlier in the season than is typical (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Flu-at-epidemic-levels-vaccine-efficacy-plunges-355888" target="_new">30 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Last week, the CDC reported that its influenza viral characterization data indicated that 31.6% of the influenza H3N2 viruses collected and analyzed in the US since 1 October 2014 were antigenically "like" the 2014-15 vaccine H3N2 component, or A/Texas/50/2012. But 68.4% were antigenically different, or drifted, from the H3N2 vaccine virus (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Antivirals-underused-against-nasty-H3N2-flu-356062" target="_new">09 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Among viruses that showed reduced titers with antiserum raised against A/Texas/50/2012, most were antigenically similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 &ndash; the H3N2 virus selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. </p><p>The A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 strain is related to, but antigenically and genetically distinguishable, from the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. </p><p>The CDC admitted the A/Switzerland-like H3N2 viruses were first detected in the US in March 2014 &ndash; shortly after the strains were selected for the 2014-15 vaccine &ndash; and began to increase through the spring and summer.</p><p>With the flu vaccine lacking good protection against the virus in the current season, US health officials have been strongly urging the use of antivirals to treat people who have caught the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Antivirals-underused-against-nasty-H3N2-flu-356062" target="_new">09 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vaccine-failure-more-apparent-as-flu-spreads-355937" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-warns-severe-flu-season-urges-Tamiflu-Relenza-use-355433" target="_new">5 December 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
