<p>In addition to supporting resubmission of the new drug application (NDA) for Shire PLC's dry-eye disease candidate lifitegrast, the specialty pharma is emphasizing that the just-completed OPUS-3 trial shows that lifitegrast is the first drug ever to demonstrate symptom improvement over consecutive trials in dry eye.</p><p>When Shire revealed that it received a complete response letter (CRL) on Oct. 16, it signaled to investors that it would able to respond quickly to the FDA's rejection after it had results from the ongoing Phase III OPUS-3 trial, which featured endpoints measuring symptom improvement compared to baseline. </p><p>The firm's foresight mitigated Wall Street's reaction and the CRL was barely a subject of conversation on Shire's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Says-Investors-More-Favorable-Now-To-Baxalta-Bid-361219" target="_new">quarterly earnings call</a> one week later. But having <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Shrugs-Off-Lifitegrast-CRL-Launch-Expected-In-2016-361125" target="_new">told the world what to expect</a> and then delivering on that with successful top-line data on Oct. 27, Shire now says the OPUS-3 data are groundbreaking.</p><p>"I don't think we expected this data," Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>The Pink Sheet DAILY</i>. "The history of dry-eye clinical trials is full of products that have failed. It's one of the highest hurdles in clinical medicine. We are the first company with a compound to [demonstrate] in two consecutive studies, OPUS-2 and now OPUS-3, very statistically significant relief of symptoms for dry-eye disease. That's never been done before. Many have tried and many have failed."</p><p>Top-line data from OPUS-3 show that lifitegrast provides statistically significant improvement (p=0.0007) compared to placebo in patient-reported symptoms of dry-eye disease from baseline to day 84 of treatment. Importantly, the drug also met secondary endpoints showing statistically significant improvement from baseline at day 14 and day 42 of treatment. Liftegrast is a small-molecule integrin antagonist that inhibits T-cell inflammation by blocking lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).</p><p>In an Oct. 27 note, Jefferies Equity Research analyst David Steinberg said this could be a key point of differentiation compared to Allergan PLC's blockbuster <i>Restasis</i> (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion), widely prescribed to treat dry-eye disease even though its label does not include a specific claim for the disease. There is no currently approved drug therapy to treat dry-eye disease.</p><p>"Despite modest efficacy and a high dropout rate due to a slow onset of action (about 6 months) and reported 'stinging' in many patients, Restasis is poised to exceed $1.2bn in sales this year," he wrote. "Assuming approval, lifitegrast could become the cornerstone of Shire's emerging ophthalmology franchise, with several other novel eye care pipeline candidates to follow in relatively short order."</p><p>"Implying benefit as early as within two weeks &#8230; is a key finding in that study," Ornskov said. "The FDA will take a look at that, [but] whether that will be part of the final label, it's too early to speculate about that. It's quite clear that early onset is a desired feature of any dry-eye product, but I think we should let FDA look at the database and the evidence we have, and not try to predict what the label will say. We will, of course, adapt the commercial rollout if the product is approved [with that claim]."</p><p><b>Largest Clinical Database For Dry-Eye Disease</b></p><p>OPUS-3 tested the drug in 711 patients, meaning the refiling will include efficacy and safety data from more than 2,500 patients, the largest database ever for a dry-eye disease candidate, the CEO noted.</p><p>OPUS-2 and OPUS-3 should provide adequate demonstration of symptom relief, while Shire expects data from OPUS-1 and a Phase II study to carry the day in proving efficacy in addressing signs of dry-eye disease. OPUS-1 met statistical significance for addressing signs of the disease, but fell short on symptom relief, while OPUS-2 yielded the opposite result. OPUS-3 was designed similar to OPUS-2, with an emphasis on demonstrating symptom improvement.</p><p>"When we put the first file together, we looked at the totality of the data, at the clinical readouts both on signs and symptoms across our clinical trials," Ornskov said. "We were convinced that we had met the hurdles for both signs and symptoms, but I think certainly that should be clearer with OPUS-3 [data] on symptoms. We feel that if you look at our Phase II and Phase III studies, we've also met it on signs."</p><p>Acquired in its 2013 buyout of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shire-punts-160m-on-second-eye-care-firm-SARcode-341496" target="_new">SARcode Bioscience Inc.</a>, lifitegrast is the first of several external assets added to the Shire pipeline to create an ophthalmic medicine franchise since Ornskov became CEO that same year. In August, the Dublin-headquartered firm paid $300m up front <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shire-Uses-Foresight-to-Expand-in-Ophthalmology-359754" target="_new">to acquire Foresight Biotherapeutics Inc.</a> and its Phase III-ready conjunctivitis candidate FST-100, which Ornskov predicted would offer commercial synergy with lifitegrast if both are approved.</p><p>Now, Shire hopes OPUS-3 also will put lifitegrast in position to file for approval for dry-eye disease in Europe and other markets as well.</p><p>"Outside the US, the [regulatory] path has been somewhat less clear," Ornskov said. "We have had interactions in Europe and found them very encouraging and I think with the data in OPUS-3, we will now develop a plan, put a package together and file in 2016. Then, we're looking at other markets like Canada and Japan."</p><p>The NDA resubmission should be classified as a type 2 filing, which would mean a six-month review, allowing the possibility for approval and launch by third-quarter 2016.</p><p><p>This story has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
