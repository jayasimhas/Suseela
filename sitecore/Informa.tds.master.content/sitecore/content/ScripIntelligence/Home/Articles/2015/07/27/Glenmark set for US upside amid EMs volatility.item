<p>Shares of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals spurted on Indian bourses following the firm's good showing in the first quarter of FY16 and expectations of a potential undefined "upside" in the US in the coming quarters. </p><p>Glenmark reported a 13.6% increase in revenues, excluding out-licensing income, to INR16.55bn ($261.53m) for the first quarter ended June buoyed, in general, by all-round growth, except in the rest of the world territories and the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) segment. Glenmark had received an out-licensing income of INR299.05m in the first quarter of FY2014-15.</p><p>Net profit for the quarter stood at INR1.90bn (+3.3%). </p><p>In a post results investor call early 31 July, Glenmark's top brass referred to expectations of a ramp up in US sales starting Q2 and also plans to appeal against the recent US court order concerning its ANDA for Finacea Gel (azelaic acid).</p><p>"We are still pretty hopeful that we have a good case there. We think we have a good shot in appeal," Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of Glenmark, said in response to a query from an analyst.</p><p>Earlier this week, the US Court for the District of Delaware upheld a patent covering Finacea Gel and ruled that Glenmak had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-wilts-on-US-Finacea-ruling-359658" target="_new">infringed</a> on claims therein. </p><p>Mr Saldanha also referred to certain other "potential upsides" in the US business that would start "playing out" Q2 onwards but declined to provide any details. </p><p>In the first quarter of FY16, Glenmark received final FDA approval for six products including norethindrone acetate/ethinyl estradiol, desmopressin acetate and calcipotriene cream 0.005%. During the quarter, the company also filed one ANDA application with the US FDA and expects to file 17&ndash;20 ANDAs in FY16.</p><p>Shares of Glenmark ended at INR1009.80 (+5.6%) on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 31 July.</p><p>Sales of the formulation business in India for the first quarter rose by 19.1% to INR4.72bn. </p><p>As per IMS MAT (moving annual total) data for June 2015, Glenmark moved up to 17th rank in India from 18th position for the 12-months to June 2014. The firm's market share crept up by 0.1%, exhibiting value growth of 19% ahead of the Indian pharma market growth of 14%.</p><p>Glenmark also launched <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-pioneers-Mitsubishis-teneligliptin-in-India-358948" target="_new">teneligliptin</a> during the quarter making it the only company manufacturing gliptins in India right from API to formulations. </p><p>Glenmark Europe's revenues rose 12.4% to INR1.09bn, while the Latin America and Caribbean operations vaulted 85.7% to INR 2.18bn. </p><h2>Russia</h2><p>Glenmark's rest of the world business - Africa, Asia and the CIS region &ndash; declined by 25.2% to INR1.58bn during the quarter. The API business declined 6.6% to INR1.34bn for the first quarter.</p><p>A company statement said that overall business environment in Russia continues to remain challenging and sales there were further impacted due to currency devaluation. The average rate for the Ruble to the US dollar was 52.68 in first quarter of FY16 compared to 34.95 in the first quarter of FY15. </p><p>Mr Saldanha, though, said that the firm remained "very positive" about the Russian business at constant currency but added that the "worrisome" part was the volatility in all emerging market currencies across the board.</p><p>"With the rupee remaining strong and most emerging market currencies depreciating that is the biggest concern in the short run," he said at the post results call.</p><p>As per IMS MAT (moving annual total) data for May 2015, Glenmark Russia grew by 8.8% in value versus the overall market growth of 11.6%. During the quarter Glenmark launched Oflomil nail lacquer, the first generic amorolfine in the Russian market. </p><p>The Ukraine business, though a minuscule part of the overall business, continued to be challenging, the firm added.</p>
