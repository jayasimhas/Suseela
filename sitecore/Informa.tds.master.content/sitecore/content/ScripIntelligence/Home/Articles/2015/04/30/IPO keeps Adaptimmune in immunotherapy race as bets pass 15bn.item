<p>Adaptimmune has become the latest immunotherapy company to raise a large chunk of cash on a US stock exchange, raising an estimated $175m net of expenses through a 6 May offering of American Depositary Shares on Nasdaq. In an area of huge potential but little clinically-proven differentiation, the new money may provide a sufficient financial springboard for the Oxford, UK-based company to throw cash at product development, slugging it out with well-backed US-based firms such as Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Kite Pharma and Juno Therapeutics, as well as with established competitors such as Novartis. </p><p>Following its IPO, Adaptimmune and its three flourishing US competitors, Bellicum, Kite and Juno have raised over $1.5bn from the capital markets since January 2014 (Table 1). Around a third of that ($593m), including Adaptimmune's $104m series A round in September 2014 and Juno's $310m from A and B rounds completed in 2014, came from pre-public finances. The other two-thirds came from public markets and includes Juno's massive $281m IPO and a $216m secondary offering from Kite in December 2014 after its August 2014 IPO.</p><p>That amount of money usually chases advanced clinical assets, but none of the companies involved, including Adaptimmune, has any asset that has gone beyond a Phase II trial. The Phase II trial of Kite's most advanced product, its anti-NY ESO-1 T Cell Receptor-engineered T cell, for instance, is not expected to read out until 2017 at the earliest. Juno's anti-CD19 and anti-WT1 products have a similar timescale. Bellicum is still expecting the results of the safety trials on its products in blood and prostate cancer. </p><p>Adaptimmune's own anti-NY ESO TCR programs in synovial sarcoma, multiple myeloma, melanoma, esophageal and ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer are largely in the recruitment phase and, in any case, are all partnered with GlaxoSmithKline, a company that has taken a strategic decision to put all its cancer programs in the hands of another company (Novartis) while it frolics in voluminous lagoons of consumer healthcare. Adaptimmune's wholly-owned products, including MAGE A-10 T cell receptor-engineered T cells in breast, lung and other solid tumors, are still in preclinical development.</p><p>The way is still clear, therefore, for any of these pretenders to the CAR-T cell/TCR throne or, indeed, others to register a decisive clinical strike. </p><p>As the clinical clock ticks on, the companies are looking to bolt on adjuncts to their technologies. On the day of Adaptimmune's IPO, Juno announced a four-year "strategic alliance" with Fate Therapeutics to develop small molecule modulators of Juno's genetically modified T cell products, chemical switches that can turn the T cell products on or, more likely, off (in order to address safety concerns). That addition puts Juno on a technical trajectory similar to that of Bellicum which has its own safety-switch approach in which a small molecule, rimiducid, is used to induce dimerization and activation of proto-immune agents.</p><table><h2>Table 1.
