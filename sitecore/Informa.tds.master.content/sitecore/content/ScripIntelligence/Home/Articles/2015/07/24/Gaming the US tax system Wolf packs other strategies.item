<p>In an analysis of the US tax code, a US Senate subcommittee took aim at Valeant Pharmaceuticals and its acquisitions of American companies Medicis, Salix Pharmaceuticals and Bausch & Lomb &ndash; using the Canadian firm's deals to illustrate how foreign entities are profiting by gaming the US tax system.</p><p>But it was the scorching testimony from former Allergan chairman and CEO David Pyott about the saga over the failed attempt to acquire the California company by Valeant &ndash; which teamed with investment firm Pershing Square and its activist leader Bill Ackman &ndash; that caught the attention of lawmakers at a 30 July hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI).</p><p>The move by Valeant and Pershing to "go after Allergan together," Mr Pyott said, was a "wolf pack" strategy, which he said ought to be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>"Our tax code makes it hard to be an American company and puts US workers at a disadvantage," Senator Rob Portman (Republican-Ohio), chairman of the PSI panel, declared at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Territorial-systems-patent-boxes-urged-for-US-tax-reform-359712" target="_new">30 July hearing</a>. </p><p>At a 39% combined state and federal rate, the US has the highest corporate rate in the industrialized world, "and to add insult to injury, our government taxes American businesses for the privileges of taking their overseas profits and reinvesting them here at home, which is something we should be encouraging, not discouraging," the Ohio lawmaker insisted. </p><p><b>Tangling with Valeant & Pershing</b></p><p>Mr Pyott agreed &ndash; asserting the US tax code "creates advantages that are worth billions for foreign acquirers to buy up American companies."</p><p>Allergan, which Mr Pyott ran from 1998 until earlier this year, is a "world leader" in ophthalmology medications and medical aesthetics and the maker of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), which has therapeutics and cosmetic indications, he said.</p><p>The former Allergan chief noted the firm has experienced "tremendous growth" &ndash; going from $600m in sales in 1997 to more than $7bn in 2014.</p><p>Allergan also had created "lots of jobs" over Mr Pyott's tenure &ndash; adding about 6,500 positions over the 17 years he was CEO.</p><p>"Growth was principally organic and R&D driven," Mr Pyott said.</p><p>But ultimately, he said, Allergan's sustained growth, robust research and development and $4bn in cash, most of it overseas, made the company a "very attractive target for acquisition, especially for a foreign company" &ndash; and Valeant came calling.</p><p>But, Mr Pyott said, "Valeant has a clear strategy of not investing of R&D."</p><p>The Canadian firm, however, was "too weak and laden with debt" following its $8bn acquisition of Bausch & Lomb to contemplate buying the California Botox maker on its own, he said.</p><p>So Valeant entered into a partnership with Pershing Square.</p><p>Using stock purchases and then options and derivatives, Pershing was able to accumulate about 9.7% of Allergan's shares between February and April 2014 "without making any public announcement of its actions," Mr Pyott said.</p><p>Then on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-makes-hedge-fund-assisted-play-for-Allergan-351389" target="_new">22 April</a>, Valeant made it move &ndash; bidding $47bn for Allergan, a $10bn increase, or about 25%, from the $37bn valuation when Pershing initiated its first purchases of the American drug maker's stock.</p><p>"Such a premium was enabled by the enormous tax savings available to Valeant as a foreign company, with a worldwide 3% tax rate, allied with a rapacious cost-cutting plan," Mr Pyott told the senators.</p><p>In its pitch to investors, Valeant's plan was to reduce Allergan's 26% effective tax rate to 9% &ndash; a difference of 17%, or $500m per year, he said. </p><p>"In simple terms, thinking back to the math, Allergan was worth $9bn more simply by moving to foreign domicile," Mr Pyott said.</p><p><b>Looking for a white knight</b></p><p>But Valeant's plan was to "strip Allergan," cutting overall operating expenses by 47%, slashing R&D within that from more than $1bn to just over $200m per year, along with other market-building investments, Mr Pyott asserted.</p><p>And, he said, Valeant planned to "load up Allergan up with more than $22bn in new debt, taking the debt load of the combined company to more than $50bn."</p><p>So after assessing "many" strategic alternatives, the Allergan board decided to seek out a so-called "white knight," Mr Pyott declared.</p><p>"Of the potential suitors, it was clear to me that only a foreign domicile company could be in a position to out-bid Valeant, while still creating value for their own stockholders," he said.</p><p>Foreign acquirers have lucrative tools, such as debt pushed down on the US entities by tax-advantaged foreign entities that are domiciled abroad in low tax jurisdictions, and migration of intellectual property to low-tax jurisdictions, even despite a penalty paid to the IRS shortly after the acquisition, Mr Pyott explained, noting that Valeant contemplated both.</p><p>But in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">November 2014</a>, Irish-domiciled Actavis bid $66bn for Allergan. </p><p>Similar to Valeant, Actavis could immediately reduce Allergan's effective tax rate from 26% to 15%, Mr Pyott noted.</p><p>But unlike Valeant, "Actavis was and is committed to maintaining the best of Allergan in the new combined company," he contended.</p><p>The deal with Actavis, however, was not all good news, Mr Pyott lamented &ndash; estimating that about 1,500 jobs will be gone from the legacy Allergan, mostly in California. </p><p>"The reduction in R&D, thank goodness, has been modest," he said.</p><p>"With this sale, we could salvage what we could of a great American company," Mr Pyott said, Actavis decided to adopt Allergan as the corporate name.</p><p>The new combined company earlier this week agreed to let Israeli firm Teva <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">buy its generics unit</a> for $40.5bn.</p><p><b>An SEC probe?</b></p><p>But Mr Pyott was not done telling his tale to lawmakers about his former firm's eight-and-a-half-month saga dealing with Valeant and Pershing.</p><p>The role Pershing played was "very interesting because having 10% of the vote out of the box is a powerful position," he said. "Clearly the goal was to kind of create a wolf pack behind that of firms ... to pile in, in the so-called event-driven world of hedge funds."</p><p>Mr Pyott noted that the day after Valeant's initial bid was announced, Pershing posted a profit of almost $1bn.</p><p>"Is that being investigated now?" asked Senator Claire McCaskill (Democrat-Missouri).</p><p>"I sincerely hope the SEC will investigate this novel structure regarding possible breach of the insider trading laws and other securities regulations," Mr Pyott charged.</p><p>"I have to admit, I've visited many, many senators' offices, many members of the House of Representatives doing my best to encourage whatever oversight is possible," he said. "You can tell I'm a person of principle. A lot of people in my shoes just move on. I'm afraid I feel pretty strongly about a lot of things that happened last year."</p><p>Looking back, Mr Pyott said, "I'm convinced that Allergen today would have remained an independent American company had it not been for the significant disadvantage caused by our uncompetitive US corporate tax system." </p><p>"The implications are clear, not only for the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, but extend across many industry that are global, unless Congress acts, I believe many more innovative American companies will be lost," Mr Pyott contended. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
