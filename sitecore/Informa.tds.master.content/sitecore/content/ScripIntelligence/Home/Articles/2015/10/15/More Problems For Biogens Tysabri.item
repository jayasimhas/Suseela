<p><p>The only good news coming out of Biogen recently is that it's not Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Adding to negative news of executives defecting and cuts to their workforce, the big biotech announced along with its third quarter earnings on Oct. 21 that its highly-effective multiple sclerosis drug <i>Tysabri</i> didn't work in patients with an advanced form of the disease. </p><p>Biogen said on Wednesday that the Phase III ASCEND study of Tysabri (natalizumab) in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The drug was meant to show a decrease in the progression of disability unrelated to relapses. While it did not show this, the drug did show some positive effect on upper limb function. Biogen did not release specific data, but said further results of the 889-patient, placebo-controlled trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. </p><p>Tysabri has been approved for over a decade for the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), an earlier form of the disease. SPMS is named thus because it follows RRMS. At some point, about 85% of RRMS patients go from periods of flare-up and remission to a time when the debilitating neurological disease progresses more steadily. While many of the currently available medications are able to reduce the number and severity of relapses, as well as slow progression of MS, none of the available medications halt the disease. </p><p>Due to its high efficacy, Tysabri was Biogen's best hope at developing a product that could help these more advanced patients. The firm was also studying its blockbuster oral drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) in the SPMS patient population. </p><p>The company announced during its third quarter call that it will stop development of both Tysabri and Tecfidera in SPMS, despite both being in late-stage clinical trials. </p><p>The news wasn't a total shock to investors; the company has been backing off its positive comments about its position in SPMS in recent months &ndash; potentially hinting that it didn't expect this trial to succeed. The move of Tysabri into SPMS was meant to be a lifecycle management play that would allow the drug to better compete with some of the new therapies entering the market and expand its patient population. </p><p>Tysabri, which initially hit the market in 2004, has long been thought as the most effective therapy for MS available. Yet, major safety complications that arose early on have limited the sales of the drug. Tysabri was pulled from the market in 2005 after several patients developed a severe, and oft-fatal, brain disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The drug was re-introduced in 2006 to a limited patient population, but did not pick steam until Biogen was able to develop a test that could show which patients had a risk of developing PML in 2014. The drug had sales of $480m in the third quarter, slightly above analysts' consensus expectations. </p><p>Biogen has been experiencing plenty of turmoil in recent weeks, but has managed to avoid some of the drug pricing drama that has plagued many of its peers like Valeant. The big biotech announced earlier in the month that its highly-touted head of global commercial operations, Tony Kingsley, would be exiting the company. Kingsley made a splash when he joined the company and Biogen was a bit of a Wall Street darling for several years. Yet, prospects for the biotech have floundered as executives have departed, pipeline failures have cropped up and safety issues have plagued its lead compound. These circumstances have prompted the company to conduct a major restructuring and cut 11% of its workforce. </p><p>
