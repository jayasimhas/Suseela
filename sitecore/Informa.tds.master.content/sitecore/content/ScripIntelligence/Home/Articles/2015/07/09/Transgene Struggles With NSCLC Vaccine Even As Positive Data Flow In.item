<p>Strasbourg, France-based Transgene has presented final overall survival data from a Phase IIb trial of its non-small cell lung cancer vaccine, TG4010, confirming that the product works &ndash; but prospects for the vaccine on a competitive lung cancer market remain questionable. </p><p>Final Phase IIb data presented for TG4010 indicate NSCLC patients with low levels of triple positive activated lymphocytes (TrPAL) at baseline showed significant differences in both progression free survival and overall survival when treated with TG4010 compared to placebo; a higher response rate and duration of response two times longer than the placebo group was also observed. </p><p>Transgene also highlighted that in a subgroup of 127 patients in the Phase IIb TIME trial with both non-squamous disease and low levels of TrPAL, 40% were still alive at 24 months in the group treated with TG4010 plus chemotherapy, compared to 19% in the control group: PFS p=0.003, OS: p=0.007. Response rates in the treatment sub-group were 39.3% versus 30.3% in placebo. Duration of response was 40.9 weeks in patients treated with Transgene's product versus 18.1 weeks in the placebo arm. </p><p>However, Transgene's stock (traded on Euronext Paris) fell 25%, or &euro;1.22, to sit around &euro;3.60 per share during the course of Sep. 9 following the announcement of the Phase IIb data at the 16th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Denver, Colorado. </p><p>Transgene has previously stated it wouldn't be taking the product into Phase III without a partner; however this may limit its options as finding a bigger pharma to back it up might take some convincing. Some analysts have suggested that in order to gauge interest of potential partners, Transgene will have to take the drug back to Phase I to provide data of its use in combination with other products to treat NSCLC.</p><p>Transgene did not comment on these suggestions but did say it was planning to "initiate exploratory trials in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors" for TG4010 in NSCLC. </p><p>Also, even if successfully approved, Transgene's product will face serious competition in the NSCLC space from immunotherapies targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Datamonitor Healthcare is predicting the vaccine will gain approval in the second quarter of 2019, should a Phase III trial go ahead.</p><p>A total of 222 patients were enrolled in the Phase IIb portion of the TIME trial. The primary objective of the Phase IIb part of the study was to analyze PFS, OS, response rate, duration of response and the safety of TG4010 in combination with chemotherapy were also assessed. </p><p>A spokesperson for Transgene said "the company plans to provide an update on its development strategy for TG4010 this fall." </p><p>In response to a question about what else Transgene was pursuing, considering its independent portfolio hinges on this vaccine product, a spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>, "At this point in time, we are focused on developing TG4010 in NSCLC."</p><p>Transgene has previously attempted to develop TG4010, its most advanced product, in several other cancer indications but according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker studies of the drug in renal cell cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer have since been suspended. </p><p>TG4010 is a recombinant vaccinia virus containing sequences coding for human MUC1 antigen and the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2). Back in 2011, Transgene partnered with Novartis on development and potential commercialization of TG4010 for the first-line treatment of NSCLC but in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-says-non-Transgene-becomes-first-megadeal-casualty-351503" target="_new">April 2014</a> Novartis announced that it would not exercise its option for the global rights to Transgene's product. Contingent upon the exercise of the option by Novartis and the achievement of successful development, regulatory and commercial milestones in various indications, Transgene had been eligible to receive up to a total of approximately &euro;700m. </p><p>Transgene has also previously partnered with diagnostic companies Ventana and Beckman Coulter in order to develop a companion test that measures the level of activated Natural Killer (aNK) cells, in order to select patients to be treated with TG4010.</p>
