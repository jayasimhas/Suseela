<p>This week, more than 150 regulatory experts and health officials were expected to attend the fourth African Regulatory Conference in Dakar, Senegal, to look at ways of strengthening and aligning regulatory systems in Africa and speeding up drug approvals across the continent. </p><p>Organized by the DIA and the international industry federation IFPMA, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank, the 27-28 April event was intended to provide a valuable forum for industry, regulators, the World Health Organization, NGOs and other stakeholders to share ideas on how best to meet patients' health needs and foster regionally harmonized regulatory systems.</p><p>On the agenda were topics such as slow approval times, wastage of resources, disparities in dossier requirements, duplication of GMP inspections, and the need for funding, training and knowledge-sharing initiatives. </p><p>Jytte Lyngvig, senior vice-president and managing director of DIA Europe, Middle East & Africa, said: "Our work in Africa gives us the opportunity to bring together a diverse and yet similar group of colleagues to promote networking and knowledge sharing between all stakeholders working towards the advancement of regulatory harmonization and access safe medicines regionally through our regional conferences and local training."</p><p>Strong representation was expected from across Africa, as well as from countries elsewhere, said Paul Dearden of IFPMA member company AbbVie. The aim of holding the conference in Senegal was to make it easier for regulators in West Africa to attend, Mr Dearden told <i>Scrip</i>, noting that some of these authorities are at an earlier stage of harmonization discussions.</p><p>His impression was that there was a strong willingness among African regulators to pursue collaboration and convergence, and that the event would provide a good opportunity for agencies to share their experiences and expertise. Specific issues to be raised with regard to speeding up drug approvals, he said, included the possibility of expedited reviews, readier acceptance of dossiers for drugs already approved by agencies in other countries, and rationalizing GMP inspections. </p><p>IFPMA director general Eduardo Pisani said that his federation was "committed to regulatory system strengthening", with a "particular emphasis on regulatory harmonization and capacity building efforts". Already this year, he said, the IFPMA, together with the DIA, had organized a regulatory conference in Chinese Taipei, which together with this event in Senegal provided "a platform both in Asia and Africa for exchange among key regulatory stakeholders".</p><p>A report on the outcome of the African conference will be published in <i>Scrip</i> in due course.</p>
