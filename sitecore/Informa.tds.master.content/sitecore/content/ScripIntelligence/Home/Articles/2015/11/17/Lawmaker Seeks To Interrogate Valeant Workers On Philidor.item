<p>Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wants to talk to the Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. employees who reportedly helped set up Philidor Rx Services Inc., the specialty pharmacy the drug company recently broke ties with after some questionable business practices came to light.</p><p>Cummings, who already has been investigating Valeant for its drug pricing practices, said he wants to talk specifically to the drug company's employees Garry Tanner, Bijal Patel and Alison Pritchet and also has requested contact information for a former worker, Laizer Kornwasser. </p><p>The lawmaker gave Valeant CEO Michael Pearson until Nov. 20 to respond.</p><p>Cummings said he wants to look into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">allegations</a> Valeant's relationship with Philidor included using "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">phantom" pharmacy accounts</a> to mask the pharmaceutical firm's price increases and circumvent the traditional insurance reimbursement process. </p><p>But Cummings said he also was troubled by the latest assertions that Valeant employees were instrumental in launching Philidor's business in 2013 and have remained involved in the specialty pharmacy's daily operations. </p><p>"These allegations suggest that Valeant employees may have been personally involved in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-Else-Dont-We-Know-May-Spread-Beyond-Valeant-361194" target="_new">questionable billing</a> practices that led Valeant to cut ties with Philidor last month," the Maryland Democrat charged.</p><p>"Valeant employees reportedly attempted to mask their connections to Valeant by creating fake email identities to conduct their internal Philidor correspondence," Cummings said &ndash; noting the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">aliases that were uncovered</a> included Peter Parker, Spider-Man's alter ego.</p><p>Cummings together with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is running for US president, had opened an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">investigation</a> into Valeant earlier this year. </p><p>The lawmakers also have authored <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">legislation</a> aimed at reining in drug prices.</p><p>Cummings also led a group of Democrats to form a new <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">task force</a> focused on combating "skyrocketing" costs of medicines.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
