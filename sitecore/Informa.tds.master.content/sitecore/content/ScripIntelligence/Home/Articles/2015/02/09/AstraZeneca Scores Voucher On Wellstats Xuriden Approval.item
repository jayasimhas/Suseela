<p>The FDA's approval on Sept. 4 of Wellstat Therapeutics' hereditary orotic aciduria (HOA) treatment Xuriden (uridine triacetate) means AstraZeneca has gained a coveted rare pediatric disease priority review voucher &ndash; a deal the two firms made last year, long before the so-called golden tickets were being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>The companies did not disclose the financial details under their agreement, which the firms inked in September 2014, so it's not known publicly whether Gaithersburg, MD-based Wellstat made out OK on the deal or is now kicking itself for acting too quickly on the PRV voucher.</p><p>When Congress created the PRV program, which initially was intended to encourage the development of new medicines to prevent and treat neglected tropical diseases and later expanded to include pediatric rare diseases, lawmakers decided to make the vouchers transferrable &ndash; meaning firms could sell them.</p><p>And sell them they have.</p><p>Indeed, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals was the first to make cash off its PRV &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">hauling in $67.5m in July 2014</a> from Sanofi and Regeneron, which used the voucher to gain a swifter approval of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab), which was the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitor cleared for the US market.</p><p>Gilead Sciences followed in November 2014 by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-pays-unprecedented-125m-for-Knight-priority-voucher-355151" target="_new">paying $125m</a> for Knight Therapeutics' tropical disease PRV.</p><p>Then this past May, Sanofi bought Retrophin's rare disease pediatric <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-paying-big-for-FDA-voucher-Retrophin-snags-245m-358627" target="_new">PRV for $245m</a>.</p><p>And last month, AbbVie <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVieUnited-Therapeutics-350m-Voucher-Deal-Smart-Move-360034" target="_new">laid down $350m</a> for United Therapeutics' rare pediatric PRV &ndash; paying the highest known amount to date for a voucher.</p><p>Wellstat could have snagged a higher amount, or it could be now lamenting the AstraZeneca deal &ndash; something both firms are remaining mum about.</p><p>The PRVs are awarded by the FDA on the approval of designated applications and can be used on applications that otherwise would not have qualified for a priority review or the companies can sell them, like Wellstat did.</p><p>The vouchers are valuable because the bearers can shave off at least four months of the time it takes the FDA to examine a marketing application, which means a product can get to the US market much faster, banking cash for the drug maker.</p><p>To use the voucher, however, the holder must pay a special user fee, which currently is just over $2.5m.</p><p><b>First HOA Treatment</b></p><p>Xuriden is the first FDA-approved treatment for HOA, an extremely rare, potentially life-threatening, genetic disorder in which patients cannot synthesize adequate amounts of uridine and consequently can experience hematologic abnormalities, failure to thrive, a range of developmental delays and episodes of crystalluria leading to obstructive uropathy.</p><p>So the FDA's approval of Xuriden "is an important breakthrough for patients" with the disease, said Michael Bamat, vice president of research and development at Wellstat.</p><p>The FDA said HOA affects only 20 people worldwide.</p><p>Wellstat said it anticipates having Xuriden commercially available in early 2016. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
