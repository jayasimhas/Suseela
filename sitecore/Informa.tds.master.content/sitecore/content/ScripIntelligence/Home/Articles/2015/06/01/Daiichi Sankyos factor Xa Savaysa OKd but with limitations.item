<p>Daiichi Sankyo won approval from the FDA to market Savaysa (edoxaban), an oral factor Xa inhibitor, as treatment to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), although US regulators set some limitations on that indication. </p><p>The agency also granted its blessing for the company to market Savaysa to treat deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who have already been treated with an anti-clotting drug administered by injection or infusion for five to ten days.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had given Daiichi's drug an 88% chance the FDA would permit the firm to market the drug, which was 4% above the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Savaysa's approval comes after the FDA's Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) endorsed the drug at a meeting this past October, voting 9-1 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Daiichi-Sankyos-anti-stroke-drug-edoxaban-354760" target="_new">31 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-reviewers-advise-limited-use-Daiichi-Sankyos-edoxaban-354726" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>).</p><p>But the CRDAC panelists also raised concerns about the differences in renal function in patients treated with the 60mg dose of the drug in Daiichi's ENGAGE AF trial. </p><p>While Savaysa 60mg was markedly superior in the primary safety analysis to warfarin in mildly renally impaired patients, it was almost significantly worse in patients with normal renal function.</p><p>In Daiichi's study, NVAF patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) greater than 95mL/min had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with the 60mg once-daily dosage, versus those treated with warfarin.</p><p>So the FDA imposed a black-box warning on Savaysa's labeling alerting prescribers the drug may be less effective in that population, and therefore, should not be used in those patients. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/206316lbl.pdf" target="_new">labeling</a> advises prescribers to assess creatinine clearance before initiating therapy with Savaysa, which comes in three strengths: 60mg, 30mg and 15mg.</p><p>Prescribers are recommended to reduce the dose of Savaysa to 30mg once daily in patients with CrCL 15-50mL/min.</p><p>The boxed warning also alerts prescribers and patients that premature discontinuation of Savaysa increases the risk of ischemic events. </p><p>In addition, the black box includes a warning that epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with Savaysa who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. </p><p>Savaysa must be dispensed with a patient-friendly medication guide, which provides instructions on its use and includes drug safety information. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
