<p><p>Johnson & Johnson's Innovation Hub is on a dealmaking spree, announcing 17 collaborations across a variety of therapeutic spaces and geographic regions &ndash; fostering a new set of deals that the big pharma is watching for partnership down the line. </p><p>J&J Innovation is a standalone business development group of the big pharma that is meant to help forward early technology and research in areas of interest to the company. Set up in 2013, the Innovation Centers are located in London, Shanghai, Boston and Menlo Park, CA. The Innovation Centers sit alongside the company&rsquo;s corporate venture arm, Johnson & Johnson Development Corp (JJDC), which provides equity to the projects and financial expertise, and Janssen Labs, the J&J incubator.</p><p>The Innovation Centers don&rsquo;t focus solely on academic partnerships &ndash; like many of its other big pharma counterparts &ndash; but, instead, serve as a vehicle where new companies can be formed and entrepreneurs are given the tools they need to launch new biotechs, including lab space and funding.</p><p>The recent spate of deals, announced 11 June, brings the total number of deals the Centers have brokered since they were established to 200. </p><p>Among the deals established, J&J is launching its latest Innovation Center in at the Karolinska Institutet to help further collaborations in the Nordic region, as well as a broad collaboration with WuXi AppTec to help incubate early biotechs in China and an alliance with the Lead Discovery Center in Germany to further innovation in that area of the world. </p><p>Two of the deals are in the area of drug discovery and development; Janssen Biotech is teaming up with Emulate to deploy its organs-on-chips platform technology and HiFiBIO to evaluate the company's single-cell technology discovery platform. Organs-on-chips is a cell culture that can simulate the reaction of a specific organ and help make drugs safer by predicting toxicity issues. </p><p>One of the major deals in the slate is a pair up with Novo Nordisk on one of its mid-stage non-diabetes assets -- NNC-0142-0002, a monoclonal antibody that could be a first-in-class treatment for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. </p><p>Other collaborations will focus on research for ankylosing spondylitis, asthma, dengue fever, hepatitis B and type 1 diabetes. </p><p><p>
