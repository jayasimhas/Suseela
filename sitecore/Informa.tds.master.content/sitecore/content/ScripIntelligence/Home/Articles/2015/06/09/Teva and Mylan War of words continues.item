<p>Teva and Mylan continue to exchange strongly worded correspondence. On 8 June, Teva's chairman Yitzhak Peterburg and CEO Erez Vigodman issued an open letter to Mylan's executive chairman Robert Coury repeating Teva's $40bn offer for the company and claiming that a combination would add value to both companies. However, they also claimed that Mylan's management was making "grossly incorrect" statements to mislead its stockholders and deprive them of a transparent analysis of Teva's proposal. </p><p>"We wholeheartedly agree with you that Mylan's stockholders deserve a fair and fully-informed opportunity to weigh the Teva proposal, which offers a substantial premium, immediate cash value and significant upside potential in a financially and commercially stronger company, as compared to the proposed Perrigo transaction," wrote the Teva executives.</p><p>While Mylan fends off the unwanted Teva approach, it in turn has been chasing an unwilling Perrigo, a transaction which Teva is firmly against.</p><p>"You are asking your stockholders to vote on the Perrigo transaction with a lack of transparency, depriving them of a fair and honest financial analysis of the Teva proposal as compared to the proposed Perrigo transaction. At the same time, you continue to make confounding statements about wanting to be acquired by Novartis or Pfizer," they added.</p><p>Allegations have also been thrown about that Teva is in breach of US antitrust laws in the way it has built up its 2.2% stake in Mylan. The Teva executives were scathing. "We have conferred with the US antitrust authorities and have been given no reason to believe that our purchases violate the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or any other US antitrust laws. In the meantime, we note that you have been saying you are a Dutch company when you believe it helps you create unprecedented governance structures, a UK company when it helps you lower your US taxes and a US company when you believe it helps you prevent Teva from purchasing Mylan shares."</p><p>It took mere hours for Mylan to make public its response to Teva's latest missive, and it was rather shorter than Teva's dispatch. </p><p>Mylan's Robert Coury said that Teva's letter did not answer "any of the key questions" and left Mylan and its stakeholders "with great uncertainty" regarding Teva's intentions. Mr Coury asked for "straightforward answers to [two] straightforward questions. 1. Is Teva planning to quickly make a legally binding exchange offer to acquire Mylan in order to provide clarity to our Board of Directors, Mylan, and its stakeholders? 2. If Teva is committed to making a legally binding exchange offer, will it contain a 'hell or high water' provision whereby Teva will agree to whatever the US FTC requires in order to clear the transaction under the HSR rules?"</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Perrigo-acquires-GSK-products-as-Mylan-hovers-358705" target="_new">Perrigo acquires GSK products as Mylan hovers</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Rejections-All-Around-Mylan-to-Teva-Perrigo-to-Mylan-357994" target="_new">Rejections All Around: Mylan to Teva, Perrigo to Mylan</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-defends-its-deal-plans-for-Mylan-358207" target="_new">Teva defends its deal plans for Mylan</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-not-seeing-the-value-in-Mylan-offer-358127" target="_new">Perrigo not seeing the value in Mylan offer</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-to-Teva-we-dont-want-your-problems-358077" target="_new">Mylan to Teva: we don't want your problems</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylans-Coury-on-Teva-deal-without-logic-357962" target="_new">Mylan's Coury on Teva: deal 'without logic'</a></p><p>
