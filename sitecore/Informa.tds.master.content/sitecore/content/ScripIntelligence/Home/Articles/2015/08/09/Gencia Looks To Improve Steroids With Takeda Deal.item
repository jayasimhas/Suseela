<p><p>With its first collaboration on the books, Gencia CEO Allen Cunningham says the biotech is putting all its focus into developing those compounds and will look to ink further collaborations at a later date. </p><p>Gencia announced a deal with Takeda Pharmaceuticals on Sept. 10 that could be worth as much as $500m for the tiny biotech. </p><p>The company is focused on discovering mitochondrial targeted therapeutics and is using its discovery engine to produce two preclinical compounds for the Japanese pharma that will target cancer and diseases of inflammation. </p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Gencia will receive an undisclosed upfront payment as well as preclinical and clinical milestones, as well as royalties on the sales of any products that result. Takeda will handle all clinical development and commercialization. </p><p>Cunningham said in an interview that the deal took about 10 months from first meeting the company and called it "a very positive process."</p><p>"As a small biotech, you hope it can happen yesterday, but we are very excited about the deal," he said. "From the outset, it was clear that it was a good fit for what we were doing and what they were looking for."</p><p>While Cunningham wouldn't reveal the diseases that will initially be targeted, he noted that the collaboration will likely begin testing the resulting compounds in hematological cancers and then it will be up to Takeda to decide how to develop the drugs form there. Gencia expects to begin work immediately and hopes to select compounds within a year. </p><p>The compounds developed during the collaboration will be mitochondrial agonists of the glucocorticoid receptors. The drugs are expected to act much like currently-marketed steroids, but are intended to have fewer side effects. Patients are also less likely to develop resistance to these drugs like they often do on steroids. Gencia hopes its compounds will allow patients to avoid side effects like steroidal diabetes, weight gain and puffiness. </p><p>Cunningham said that Gencia will turn all of its focus to this collaboration at the moment and will later look to ink other big pharma partnerships for its technology. </p><p><p>
