<p><p>Horizon Pharma is making concessions in its offer for Depomed, but the hostile acquirer is being clear that the value of its target is finite and that Depomed doesn't really have any leverage. </p><p>Horizon furthered the dialogue between the two companies on Aug. 13 with a public letter from CEO Tim Walbert that stood firm on its all-stock offer of $33 per share, but made the concession that Horizon would consider a mixed cash/stock offer with a few caveats &ndash; including a lower price of $32.50 per share.</p><p>The Aug. 13 letter notes that a deal with a 25% cash consideration is a possibility, but would have to be at the slightly lower price point to account for added risk and costs that Horizon would have to take on, including financing commitment costs associated with a cash offer of about $2m a month and $38m in breakage costs associated with Depomed's current convertible bonds. </p><p>Horizon has been chasing Depomed and its pain drug <i>Nucynta</i> (tapentadol) since late May when it made a private offer of $29.95 per share. It took that offer public in late July and increased the value to $33 per share in all Horizon stock. Depomed has consistently said that the offer undervalues the company and fails to take into account its relaunch of Nucynta since purchasing the drug from <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-paying-1.05bn-for-Janssens-US-Nucynta-rights-356173" target="_new">Johnson & Johnson</a> for $1.05bn in January. Depomed has also contended that an all-stock offer is too risky and doesn&rsquo;t retain value for its shareholders. </p><p>Walbert noted in his letter that Depomed, as an acquisition target, loses value of about $50m every three months the deal is delayed due to the patent term of Nucynta.</p><p>"Further, Depomed is not investing in internal research capable of discovering new clinical candidates and is therefore dependent upon acquiring additional medicines to build future value," said Walbert, who noted Depomed's funds are limited.</p><p>For Horizon, the only draw of Depomed is Nucynta; almost begging the question, why didn't Horizon skip the middle man and pick up the asset directly from J&J when the cost was a bit cheaper?</p><p>The fact that Horizon really only wants the pain drug leaves Depomed with very little negotiating power and the more it plays hard to get, the less attractive it seems as a takeout target. Walbert <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Can-Depomed-get-more-value-out-of-Horizon-offer-359293" target="_new">already stated</a> publicly during the company's second quarter earnings call in early July that the company has plenty of options and is keeping those options wide open when it considers potential assets to acquire. </p><p>He noted that Horizon is looking at as many as 40 different assets at any one time and that the company intends to be active in the M&A space. </p><p>In response to the letter, Depomed issued a statement further rejecting the Horizon bid and reiterating its stance that Depomed shareholders should receive a stake in the company that is consistent with the amount of value Depomed (i.e. Nucynta) contributes to the overall bottom line. </p><p>Investors seem unenthused with the back and forth between the companies at this point; Depomed's shares barely budged, closing down slightly at $31.65. Meanwhile Horizon was down a bit as well, dropping 92 cents to close at $31.56.</p><p><p>
