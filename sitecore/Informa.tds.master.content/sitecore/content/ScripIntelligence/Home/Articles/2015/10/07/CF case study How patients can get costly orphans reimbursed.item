<p> Companies that want to secure reimbursement for their expensive orphans could learn much from what happened in Ireland with Vertex' cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor). When the local health technology assessment recoiled at its &euro;234,000 price tag, patients stepped in to show the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics the drug's true value. </p> <p> It seems Vertex initially failed to back up its price by showing the difference that Kalydeco made to patients. In 2013 the NCP said that the breakthrough drug would make too big a dent in its new drugs budget and would not therefore be cost effective. So it looked as though the 120 CF patients eligible to receive it would have to forgo treatment. However, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, a patient organization representing CF patients, took it upon itself to show the NCP what the drug meant to patients, explained Katie Murphy, a CF patient receiving Kalydeco and R&amp;D officer for CF Ireland, at the eyeforpharma Patient Summit in London in June. </p> <p> The intervention was simple but very effective. &quot;What we learned from working with the NCP is that all they can assess is the evidence they are given,&quot; Ms Murphy told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview. Vertex gave the NCP all the clinical data on scientific measures such as lung function, but what the NCP didn't have was evidence of the drug's effect on patient lives and its psycho-social impact. CF Ireland put that right by contacting patients who had taken part in the Irish Kalydeco trials and asking them to write down what the drug had done for them. The organization put together a booklet of the patients' testimonies and submitted it to the NCP. There was a subsequent (confidential) price negotiation, but Ms Murphy believes that CF Ireland's intervention was a big factor in influencing the NCP to fund access to the drug. </p> <p> Aside from significant health improvements, patients fed back that day-to-day life was drastically enhanced: patients for example, were able to hold down a job, pursue education, become independent and socialise with friends . &quot;No one asks patients how they are feeling, the difference to their social lives, their professional life, their education status,&quot; said Ms Murphy. </p> <p> Vertex could have done this from the start by collating and analysing patient-relevant outcomes. Ms Murphy's brother took part in the trial, and reported that he frequently spent up to three hours with researchers, during which time such things were discussed, but nothing was recorded. &quot;They just took down the scientific measures. There is an opportunity to record outcomes that make sense to patients,&quot; said Ms Murphy. </p> <p> It is unclear whether a collection of patient testimonies submitted by Vertex would have had the same impact as that submitted by CF Ireland due to the perception of bias. However, a similar approach could prove important in securing funding for its newest CF offering, Orkambi (ivacaftor plus lumacaftor). Under regulatory review in the EU and approved recently in the US, it is too late for Vertex to incorporate new patient-relevant outcomes into trials supporting Orkambi. Its US price is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orkambi-OKd-Vertex-prices-new-CF-drug-at-259k-359235" target="_new">$259,000, higher than analysts had expected</a>. Once approved in the EU it will come under the scrutiny of HTAs that are increasingly interested in patient-related outcomes. </p> <h2> price </h2> <p> Despite her enthusiasm for Kalydeco, Ms Murphy was critical of its price. &quot;Companies have to recoup costs, and obviously small patient populations will increase the cost per patient, but there are no real details to why they come to a specific price or where the figures come from. It is important to see that; it's a very high price. And then there is room for negotiation as well.&quot; </p> <p> CF Ireland was keen to keep a healthy distance from Vertex during the Kalydeco reimbursement proceedings and show its support for continued price negotiations. &quot;This was very difficult as there were a lot of patients that wanted us to shout about getting access to therapies. We weren't prepared to do this. It was very important to show that we appreciate that this is an enormous amount of money,&quot; said Ms Murphy. </p> <p> Vertex has another CF candidate VX-661, in Phase II development. Other companies, including Galapagos/AbbVie, ConCERT Pharmaceuticals and Flatley Discovery Lab are also developing treatments. </p>
