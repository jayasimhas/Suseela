<p>Biopharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions more than doubled from $75bn in 2013 to $220bn in 2014 and big pharma played a larger role with $90bn in transactions last year aimed at boosting dwindling sales growth, but specialty pharmaceutical companies outspent their larger counterparts with $130bn in M&A deals with the goal of building portfolios that can compete on a global scale.</p><p>In its "Firepower Index and Growth Gap Report 2015: Firepower Fireworks" released on 12 January &ndash; the opening day of the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference &ndash; Ernst & Young (EY) said that biopharma M&A is likely to continue to boom this year. Dealmaking certainly will be a hot topic as JP Morgan's annual conference for investors in pharma, biotech, medical technology and other health care-related companies kicks off in San Francisco. </p><p>Yet despite big pharma's efforts to step up M&A activity, it remains to be seen if the likes of Pfizer and AbbVie can compete with specialty pharma and big biotech companies, such as Actavis and Celgene, whose product sales and "firepower" are growing at a greater rate, giving those firms more resources to acquire companies and assets that boost their valuations even higher.</p><p>EY defines firepower as a company's ability to do M&A based on its market capitalization, cash balance and debt capacity. A lot of firepower is needed to reduce big pharma's $100bn growth gap &ndash; that's the amount of revenue that the world's top drug companies are expected to generate relative to the amount of pharma sales expected by IMS Health through 2017. </p><p>The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics expects prescription drug sales to reach about $1.2 trillion in 2017 and $1.3 trillion by 2018 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-IMS-Institute-forecasts-1.3T-in-2018-drug-spending-355180" target="_new">21 November 2014</a>).</p><p><b>Outspending, out-growing big pharma</b></p><p>Big pharma spent less than $20bn on M&A in 2013 to lower the growth gap, while specialty pharma spent about $50bn that year. So with four times the M&A investment in 2014, big pharmas made a concerted effort to boost their portfolios last year, including Merck & Co with its pending $9.5bn acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals and Novartis with its acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline's oncology portfolio for up to $16bn (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mercks-9.5bn-Cubist-buy-overshadowed-by-court-decision-355511" target="_new">9 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">22 April 2014</a>).</p><p>Threats to big pharma's ability to close the growth gap include more of the same in 2015 and beyond, i.e. target company valuations rising to unobtainable levels as specialty pharma beats big pharma more often than not in the competitive M&A marketplace. </p><p>"Some of the more likely candidates have been acquired already. And from a big pharma perspective, there's even more competition right now," EY global life science transactions advisory services leader Jeffrey Greene told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>In addition to specialty pharma, big biotech companies like Celgene, which has been more active in licensing deals than M&A, could use their considerably large firepower to buy the few remaining target companies with assets worth acquiring. </p><p>For instance, among the biggest questions that investors have for Gilead Sciences during the JP Morgan conference will be how it plans to use the $7.7bn in cash and investments that the company had on its balance sheet as of 30 October. Perhaps Gilead offered a glimpse of its capital strategy during the first week of January: the company said it will pay up to $470m to buy a portfolio of small molecules from Phenex Pharmaceuticals (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-buying-another-NASH-program-for-up-to-470m-355961" target="_new">7 January 2014</a>).</p><p>EY calculates that big pharma has about $800bn in firepower to acquire companies &ndash; almost twice as much as the $325bn in big biotech and $125bn in specialty pharma firepower in 2014. However, because of high sales growth and large stock price boosts due to M&A activity, firepower increased in 2014 by 30% for big biotech and 42% for specialty pharma compared with only 12% for big pharma.</p><p>"If you look at the size and power of specialty pharma and big biotech companies, the firepower of both has increased even more than big pharma. The target companies are relatively more expensive and the potential competitors with pharma have more financial wherewithal than ever before," Mr Greene said.</p><p><b>M&A strategies in 2015 and beyond</b></p><p>To put its considerable firepower to use, EY says that big pharma needs to become better dealmakers &ndash; to be creative about transaction structures, realistic about deal valuations and successful in merger execution, i.e. realizing cost savings after acquisitions close that were promised when the transactions were announced.</p><p>"If you look at how investors reward M&A, you see higher values [for dealmakers] than for those that didn't do strategic deals, so there will continue to be more scrutiny of those deals. It has to make economic sense; they have to be more thorough on extracting value," Mr Greene said.</p><p>EY also notes that in the absence of large transformative deals and in light of high target company valuations, big pharma should focus on "bolt-on" transactions to add assets that build on companies' strengths. Big pharma also should continue to dispose of portfolios where their strength is lacking and buy assets that improve their dominance in specific therapeutic areas.</p><p>"In 2014, a lot of the dealmaking was among big pharma selling off parts of their portfolio to each other. They looked at what businesses they wanted to grow in to be major players and have global scale. [For businesses where they couldn't be dominant players,] they put it in someone's hands that can do that and they redeployed capital somewhere else. That strategy's probably not done yet," EY global life sciences leader Glen Giovannetti told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Novartis and GSK asset swap is a prime example of the latter strategy. While Novartis bought GSK's cancer drugs, GSK agreed to pay $5.25bn and up to $1.8bn in milestone fees for Novartis's vaccine business (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-NovartisGSKLilly-swapping-extravaganza-explained-351569" target="_new">20 May 2014</a>). At the same time, the two companies agreed to create an over-the-counter and consumer health joint venture, and Eli Lilly bought Novartis's animal health business for $5.4bn.</p><p><b>Activists have a new M&A role</b></p><p>A potential complication for big and specialty pharma and big biotech companies alike is the insistence of activist investors that publicly traded corporations do deals. </p><p>Although Pershing Square Capital Management was not successful in its effort to make Allergan accept a $54bn offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals &ndash; Valeant lost out to Actavis, which will pay $66bn for Allergan &ndash; EY expects other major shareholders to explore strategies that may force drug makers to do M&A deals this year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>).</p><p>"I think every board and every executive team at the largest companies are all proactively thinking about [investor activism]," Mr Greene said. "We did a survey recently where we asked whether the board room agenda had been rearranged by shareholder activism, which included about 100 executives in life sciences. It was true across the sector and across all industries by about 90%. More than 70% thought there'd be more M&A in 2014 and more than 60% expected to see more activist-led M&A."</p><p>CEOs and boards of directors have to ask themselves if their strategy is really maximizing shareholder value, he said, and determine whether their value creation strategy is more compelling than a strategy proposed by an activist investor or other outsider.</p><p><p><p><p>
