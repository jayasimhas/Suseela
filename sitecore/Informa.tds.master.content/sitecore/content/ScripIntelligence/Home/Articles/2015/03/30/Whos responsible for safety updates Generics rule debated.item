<p>At an all-day FDA meeting on 27 March, where regulators heard five-minute testimonies from about 40 people, it was the pharmaceutical industry versus patients who claimed they were injured from drugs with inadequate warnings.</p><p>But mostly, it was a spate of lawyers arguing on both sides of whether the FDA should finalize its proposed rule that would permit generic manufacturers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes &ndash; just like brand-name companies do already &ndash; or instead implement an alternative approach recommended by two industry lobbying groups.</p><p>It was unlikely the FDA heard anything it hadn't beforehand, given it previously had received a slew of written comments on its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">November 2013 proposal</a> &ndash; with many of those statements coming from several of the same people who testified at the 27 March "listening session."</p><p>But Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said the agency was obligated to convene the public meeting in light of receiving a number of recommendations for alternative approaches, including from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Generics Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) &ndash; which often are at loggerheads, but have joined together on objecting to the FDA's proposed generic drug labeling rule.</p><p>"This whole issue is complicated," Dr Woodcock said," so we wanted to hear from stakeholders."</p><p>At stake for the generic firms is they could be exposed to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">liability</a> involving claims of injury blamed on labeling that fails to warn &ndash; something those companies currently are protected against under two ruling by the US Supreme Court, known as <i>Pliva v Mensing</i> and <i>Mutual Pharmaceutical v Bartlett</i>.</p><p>In <i>Pliva</i>, the high court ruled 5-4 in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Supreme-Court-to-weigh-generic-drug-liability-patent-burden-of-proof-standards-313148" target="_new">June 2011</a> that generic drug makers do not have the same obligations as brand-name manufacturers to update product labeling when new risks come to light </p><p>In <i>Mutual</i>, the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-FDA-OK-preempts-state-flawed-design-liability-laws-344350" target="_new">June 2013</a>, also in a 5-4 ruling, said state law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under the Pliva decision </p><p>Before the <i>Pliva</i> and <i>Mutual</i> cases, however, there was <i>Wyeth v Diana Levine</i>, in which the Supreme Court in March 2009 voted 6-3 to uphold a jury verdict of $6.7m to a Vermont woman who claimed she lost her hand and forearm from adverse events tied to the company's nausea and motion sickness drug Phenergan (promethazine). </p><p>Wyeth, now part of Pfizer, argued the FDA's approval of Phenergan preempted the right of a consumer to sue a manufacturer in state court if a drug or device later causes injury.</p><p>"Wyeth was claiming I had no right to hold them accountable for insufficient warning label that hadn't been changed and updated," Ms Levine said during the 27 March FDA meeting. "But I was fighting for the right of all citizens to hold companies accountable for a poor warning label. I&rsquo;m fiercely committed to this."</p><p>The Supreme Court sided with her and declared that Congress never intended to prevent injured patients from seeking compensation for injuries in state court when the federal lawmakers granted the FDA the authority to regulate medicines.</p><p>The high court in <i>Levine</i> had put the responsibility for safety on the manufacturer, not the FDA &ndash; an agency the justices noted has limited resources with which to monitor drugs once they are on the market. </p><p>But as far as the labeling for generic drugs was concerned, the precedent set by Ms Levine's court victory was undone by <i>Pliva</i>, she lamented.</p><p><b>Innovator v generic requirements</b></p><p>Even though all drug makers must inform the FDA about all adverse event reports the firms receive, currently only brand-name companies are permitted to independently revise their safety information in drug labeling on their own by submitting a so-called changes being effected (CBE) supplement to the FDA, Dr Woodcock explained. </p><p>The CBE changes are a narrow exception to the general rule that labeling changes require the FDA's approval before implementation.</p><p>If regulators sign off on CBE safety updates, then generic drug makers are required to include the same revisions in their labeling.</p><p>But when a generic company becomes aware of a potential risk, it cannot update its product labeling without first submitting supporting information to the FDA, which then determines if the labeling should be revised for those medicines and the innovator drugs.</p><p>Such a process, Dr Woodcock said, may result in a delay of safety information for generic drugs reaching patients.</p><p>If the FDA's proposed rule is finalized, she said, it would reduce the time for generics to make safety changes in labeling.</p><p>But PhRMA and GPhA argued the FDA's proposed rule would result in safety information varying among agents with the same active ingredients &ndash; ultimately <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GPhA-Survey-evidence-FDA-generics-rule-would-confuse-prescribers-352415" target="_new">confusing</a> doctors and patients </p><p>David Gaugh, senior vice president for sciences and regulatory affairs at GPhA, insisted the FDA's proposal also exceeds the agency's authority and contradicts sameness requirement of the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act</i>, which requires generic drugs to be materially identical to their brand-name counterpart, including the labeling. </p><p>PhRMA and GPhA suggested the FDA use an "expedited agency review" (EAR) for all safety-related labeling changes, regardless of whether the requests come from innovators or makers of copycat medicines.</p><p>Under the PhRMA-GPhA plan, innovators or generic makers who believe data they submit to the FDA may constitute new safety information could request an EAR or the agency could begin the process on its own initiative based on information it posses from its sources. </p><p>If a drug maker requests an EAR, the FDA must make a decision on the appropriateness of a labeling change within certain number days or even sooner if regulators determine the circumstances warrant a more expedited action. </p><p>Once the agency has made a decision to implement a new safety labeling change &ndash; whether the EAR was initiated by the FDA or a manufacturer &ndash; drug makers would be given 30 days to follow through, unless regulators determine an action is required sooner, explained Jeffrey Francer, vice president and senior counsel at PhRMA.</p><p>The two drug lobbying groups said implementation of their proposal should be facilitated through electronic labeling to speed the availability of accurate, real-time and consistent labeling of marketed products. </p><p>But Joanne Doroshow, executive director adjunct professor at the Center for Justice and Democracy at the New York Law School, said PhRMA and GPhA were simply trying to shift the responsibility from manufacturers to the FDA of ensuring labeling contains updated safety information &ndash; alleviating drug makers of any liability.</p><p>But others insisted the responsibility of updating labeling should rest solely with the FDA.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
