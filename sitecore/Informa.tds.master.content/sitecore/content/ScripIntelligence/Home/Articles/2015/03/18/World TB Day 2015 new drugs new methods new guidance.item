<p> World TB Day, which takes place each year on 24 March, is the event at which bodies like the World Health Organization and the Stop TB Partnership report on progress with efforts to fight TB and exhort governments, civil society groups, healthcare providers and others to speed up those efforts. </p> <p> This year those partners have a few new achievements to celebrate, not least the approval last year of two new drugs for the multi-drug resistant form of TB, the start of a Phase I study of a promising new drug candidate in February, and the development of a new tool from the US Critical Path Institute that should help in assessing the potential efficacy of new drugs and combination regimens. </p> <p> First, a few facts, as updated by the WHO for World TB Day 2015. In 2013, 9 million people contracted TB and 1.5 million died from the disease, which predominantly affects low- and middle-income countries. TB is second only to HIV/AIDS as the greatest killer worldwide due to a single infectious agent, and it causes a quarter of all HIV-related deaths. In 2013, some 550,000 children fell ill with TB, and 80,000 HIV-negative children died of the disease. </p> <p> Rates of infection very markedly among countries, with most new cases in 2013 seen in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions, accounting for 50% of new cases globally. Africa still carried the greatest proportion of cases per head of population, with 280 infections per 100,000 people in 2013. </p> <p> Moreover, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is still a major problem, with some 480,000 people developing this form of the disease in 2013, more than half of them in India, China and the Russian federation. </p> <p> On a brighter note, the number of people getting TB each year is on the wane (although the decline is very slow), and the TB death rate fell by 45% between 1990 and 2013, with an estimated 37 million lives saved by TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2013. Brazil and China are among 22 countries showing a sustained decline in prevalance over the past 20 years. </p> <p> The WHO says that &quot;tremendous progress&quot; has been made in recent years in tackling TB, and that the world is &quot;on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of reversing the spread of TB by 2015&quot;. But it says that &quot;this is not enough&quot; and &quot;clearly, we all need to do more&quot;. </p> <p> It declared: &quot;On World TB Day 2015, WHO calls on governments, affected communities, civil society organizations, health-care providers, and international partners to join the drive to roll out this strategy and to reach, treat and cure all those who are ill today. 24 March 2015 &ndash; the day to change gear and speed up global efforts to end TB altogether.&quot; </p> <h2> Positive steps forward </h2> <p> Some significant steps have been taken recently. Last year, for instance, two novel treatments were approved for TB, one of them with a novel mechanism of action. </p> <p> In March 2014 Janssen's Sirturo (bedaquiline) was granted conditional approval in the EU, and accelerated approval in the US, for use as part of a combination regimen for MDR-TB in adults, on the back of 24-week data from the Phase II clinical development program which included a controlled, randomized trial evaluating safety and efficacy of Sirturo versus placebo in patients with MDR-TB in combination with a background regiment and an open-label study. The product acts by inhibiting mycobacterial ATP synthase, which is essential for the generation of energy in <i>Mycobaterium tuberculosis</i>. Bedaquiline is the first new TB drug with a novel mechanism of action to be made available for more than 40 years. </p> <p> The second product was Otsuka's Deltyba (delamanid), which also received a conditional EU approval last year, in April, based primarily on a two-month, Phase II study involving 481 people with MDR-TB and XDR-TB (extensively drug resistant TB). Deltyba is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adult patients when an effective treatment regimen cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability. The recommended dose for adults is 100mg twice daily for 24 weeks. The product is now in a Phase III trial, with preliminary results expected towards the end of this year, and full results by 2016. </p> <p> But it's one thing getting a drug approved, and often quite another getting it to the people who need it. Earlier this month, a number of medical organizations announced they were joining forces to provide access to bedaquiline and delamanid to 2,600 MDR-TB patients in 16 countries. </p> <p> The organizations &ndash; MÃ©decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Partners in Health, Interactive Research and Development, and their partner UNITAID &ndash; said that while the two drugs had been approved for more than a year, they had &quot;scarcely been used&quot;. Access in countries with a high MDR-TB burden had been ensured almost exclusively through compassionate-use programs, requiring case-by-case authorization from the manufacturer for patients with no other treatment options, and to date it is thought that fewer than 1,000 patients have received the products. </p> <p> Dr Aamir Khan of IRD said the main obstacle was that there was limited knowledge about these products. &quot;Many of the countries where the patients in need live are not in the position to provide the enhanced safety monitoring that is still needed for their use,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, in most of countries bedaquiline and delamanid are not licensed. And even in countries where they are registered, drug procurement mechanisms are today extremely long and complicated.&quot; </p> <p> The organizations said that next month they planned to start the &quot;endTB&quot; project, a partnership that was &quot;aimed at radically changing the management of MDR-TB&quot; and laying the groundwork for appropriate delivery of the two new drugs to hundreds of thousands of patients suffering from MDR-TB. The project will use the drugs according to WHO recommendations in a closely monitored group of patients, and it will also run a new clinical trial testing &quot;completely novel&quot; MDR-TB treatment regimens in another 600 patients. </p> <p> &ldquo;These drugs bring a renewed hope for patients, and for caregivers. But drugs alone are a half-victory&rdquo;, said Dr Francis Varaine, endTB project leader at MSF. &ldquo;We need to gather more evidence on the safety, the efficacy and the effectiveness of those drugs when they are combined with other drugs, as well as the ideal length of the treatment and the associated side effects, amongst others parameters,&quot; Dr Varaine said. &quot;Only then we will really be able to change the game in the fight against MDR-TB.&quot; </p> <p> Lelio Marmora, executive director of UNITAID, said the endTB project would help to make MDR-TB treatment &quot;more effective and easier tobear, thereby helping to halt the disease's spread. This new investment is part of our broader portfolio that introduces innovations for a more effective global TB response.&quot; </p> <h2> Products in development </h2> <p> A number of new drugs/combinations are in clinical development for TB, including the following in Phase II trials, according to the Stop TB Partnership: </p> <ul> <li>Sutezolid (PNU-100480), an oxazolidinone from Sequella. It has shown promising activity in combination with other new TB drugs including SQ109 and bedaquiline. </li> <li>SQ109, an ethylenediamine from Sequella/NIH. It is being evaluated in a study of newly diagnosed drug-sensitive TB in regimens including two doses of rifampin and moxifloxacin. </li> <li>AZD5847, an oxazolidinone from AstraZeneca. It binds 50S ribosymal unit and blocks the initiation of protein synthesis. It is aimed at patients with HIV and TB co-infection. </li> <li>Bedaquiline/pretomanid/pyrazinamide (BPaZ), from the TB Alliance. This is an oral regimen with the potential to reduce TB treatment time to as little as three months. </li> </ul> <p> A combination of pretomanid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide (PaMZ), developed by the TB Alliance, is in the Phase III STAND (Shortening Treatments by Advancing Novel Drugs) trial. </p> <h2> New candidate in Phase I </h2> <p> Earlier in development, in February this year the TB Alliance announced that a new drug candidate, TBA-354, had entered a Phase I trial, the first such candidate to do so since 2009. TBA-3545 is a nitroimidazole, a class that also contains the experimental drug pretomanid (formerly PA-824), which is being tested with other novel regimens in multiple clinical trials. </p> <p> TBA-354 emerged from studies intended to identify a next-generation nitroimidazole, which were conducted by the TB Alliance in collaboration with the universities of Auckland and Illinois-Chicago. The TB Alliance, which is now the sponsor of the TBA-354 study, said that recruitment is under way to enroll nearly 50 US volunteers for the randomized, double-blind Phase I trial, which will evaluate the product's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and dosing. </p> <p> In December 2014, Sanofi announced that the FDA had approved its Priftin (rifapentine) in combination with isoniazid for a new indication: the treatment of latent TB infection in patients aged two and up at high risk of progression to TB disease. </p> <h2> EMA qualifies C-Path tool </h2> <p> In a development that could help accelerate the development of new drugs for TB, the US Critical Path Institute (C-Path) announced last month that the European Medicines Agency had given a positive qualification opinion on its Hollow Fiber System for Tuberculosis (HFS-TB) tool. This tool, which provides essential pharmacological and microbiological information, helps researchers to determine which drugs to use in combination, and at what doses, to best tackle MDR-TB, C-Path said. The qualification opinion from the EMA should accelerate the tool's adoption by drug developers, which will be confident that European regulatory bodies will accept supportive data from research using this new method, it added. </p> <p> The HFS-TB tool allows researchers to understand how TB drugs move through the body and exert their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects, and represents a significant advance in the development of effective treatments, as current testing models do not always predict appropriate dosages for human testing, according to C-Path. </p> <p> The effort to gain EMA qualification of HFS-TB was led by the Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens (CPTR) program, a collaboration of industry civil society, government and regulatory officials looking at formal regulatory review methods for the development of new TB drug combinations. The CPTR is currently putting together a laboratory manual to allow greater usability of the new tool by researchers. </p> <h2> Revised EMA guidance </h2> <p> The EMA itself is taking steps to revise its guidance on the clinical development of new TB agents. Last November it launched a public consultation on a &quot;concept paper&quot; intended to update an existing addendum to the general guideline on drugs for bacterial infections. Comments were due in by the end of February. </p> <p> The agency says that the TB addendum was developed in 2008-2010 when anti-TB agents under development were mainly intended for use in shortened regimens for fully susceptible TB or for addition to optimized background regimens for MDR-TB and XTR-TB. Developments in the field since that time, it says, have highlighted the need to consider several other types of drug development programs, such as those intended to lead to the approval of entire new regimens, and to re-evaluate the feasibility of some types of studies suggested in the current version of the addendum in view of the recent approval of some new TB products. </p> <p> For this reason the EMA plans to revise the guidance to clarify the EU regulatory expectations with regard to the data that should be generated to support the approval of individual new agents and/or new regimens comprising wholly novel or a mixture of novel and licensed agents that may be used at doses differing from those currently approved. </p> <h2> US NIH funding </h2> <p> It was also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ignored-in-Ebolas-shadow-NIH-gives-TB-new-focus-356885" target="_new">announced last month</a> that the US National Institutes of Health is to invest $105.3m in its tuberculosis research units over the next seven years in order to promote innovation in the field. The funds will be used to integrate epidemiology, immunology and microbiology by four institutions that will work together to look at how the TB bacterium interacts with the human host and the immune system to cause disease. </p> <p> Related content: </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Infographic-the-TB-landscape-in-2015-357440" target="_new">Infographic: the TB landscape in 2015</a> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/5-questions-for-Janssen-Indias-boss-on-TB-research-and-Sirturo-357435" target="_new">5 questions for Janssen India's boss on TB research and Sirturo</a> </p>
