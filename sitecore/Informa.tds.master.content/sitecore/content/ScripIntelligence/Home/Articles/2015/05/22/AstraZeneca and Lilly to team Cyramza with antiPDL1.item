<p>AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly have entered into a clinical trial collaboration to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of AstraZeneca's investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in combination with Lilly's VEGF receptor 2 inhibitor Cyramza (ramucirumab) in a Phase I study advanced solid tumors. The alliance is one of a growing number looking at combining immune-oncology products with other more established targeted anticancers. "The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been one of the more exciting research advancements in recent oncology history, but it is going to be even more interesting to see how these inhibitors can be combined with other proven targeted therapies," said Dr Richard Gaynor senior vice-president, product development and medical affairs at Lilly Oncology. "This collaboration represents the next wave of immuno-oncology research by bringing together two innovative medicines."</p><p>
