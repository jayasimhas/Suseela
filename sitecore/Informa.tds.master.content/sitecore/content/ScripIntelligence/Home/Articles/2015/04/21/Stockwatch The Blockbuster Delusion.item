<p>Last week was one of changing fortunes as companies reported their first-quarter financial results. For a few days, the gloom of the previous week was lifted by the effects of growing sales of blockbuster products from Amgen and Roche by virtue of limited or in spite of exposure to the euro, respectively. However, by the end of last week we were back to doom and gloom again.</p><p>Investors are known for a number of traits, one of them being that we are never satisfied. You need only look at how lowly the earnings of Gilead Sciences are valued to see that investors are effectively saying, "Thanks for the blockbuster HIV and HCV franchises, but what else is there?" These two franchises that are worth billions of dollars in annual sales are incredibly rare but that doesn't stop almost every pharma and biotech company claiming that they have or shortly will have one. </p><p>While most companies will never have a blockbuster product, one company last week gave half of one away.</p><p>AstraZeneca reported <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AZ-beats-expectations-but-is-strategy-sustainable-358059" target="_new">first-quarter financial results</a> that just beat analysts' consensus estimates of earnings. The analysts from Jefferies were falling over their adjectives in describing AstraZeneca's results as "strong" when what they should have said was: "It was nowhere near as bad as feared, this time." </p><p>The analysts from JP Morgan, however, correctly reported the issues behind the results. Sure enough, AstraZeneca's earnings did slightly beat consensus expectations, but with sales in local currency plummeting by 3% last quarter, it was not operational excellence that drove AstraZeneca's earnings but "externalization revenues" and "other income". </p><p>AstraZeneca is expected to continue to bleed sales for at least the next two years because of patent expiries on blockbuster products such as Nexium (esomeprazole). It is ironic, then, that it has just traded half of the annual profits of one of its potential new blockbusters for a one-off gain to manipulate its otherwise anemic financial results. More ironic still is that the $450m one-off sticking plaster for next quarter's results could easily hold back the delusional $45bn sales target by 2023 that the AstraZeneca CEO promised to fend-off last year's attempted acquisition by Pfizer. The irony has not been lost on shareholders that the same CEO refused to link his pay to the $45bn sales promise and that for the second year running, a significant percentage of AstraZeneca's shareholders voted against or abstained from approving its remuneration report. As always, investors have the last word and the AstraZeneca share price, now reflecting only half a blockbuster, finished the day down 1.8%.</p><p>A 6.6% bludgeoning of the share price was also the order of the day when Biogen reported its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogens-Tecfidera-feeling-the-brunt-of-PML-case-358064" target="_new">first-quarter results</a>, missing both analysts' sales and earnings estimates. At the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January, I wondered if Biogen was dressing itself up for a sale as I sat next to a Pfizer person who was frantically scribbling notes during its presentation. This dressing up involved hyping as its new blockbuster products are an Alzheimer's disease candidate for which it only has very early results in tiny numbers of patients, and a multiple sclerosis product that is an outright failure. With Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira, the acquisition of Biogen has been firmly consigned as one of my wackier ideas. There is anyhow an alternative explanation of why Biogen would rush headlong into Phase III without even one Phase II study. It probably suspected a continued worsening of the trouble that surfaced in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Sugar-coated-earnings-ironies-354674" target="_new">previous recent quarter</a>. </p><p>Indeed, the key lowlight of Biogen's financial results was the massive miss in the sales of its blockbuster product Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) for multiple sclerosis. Once again, the sell-side were struggling to support their potential client with adjectives like "disappointing", "weak" and in Piper Jaffray's case "meh", although none of these do justice to the commercial sunset now befalling Tecfidera, caused by saturation in the US market, weak ex-US sales in dollar terms, treatment-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and at least equally efficacious oral competitors.</p><p>Tecfidera's waning brings to mind the brief life of another blockbuster, Vertex's HCV antiviral Incivek (telaprevir). That product demonstrated, probably for the first time without a patent expiry, that within two years of launch, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1Q-EARNINGS-Vertex-drops-hepatitis-C-for-cystic-fibrosis-focus-351567" target="_new">blockbuster status can be snatched away</a>. </p><p>To paraphrase Mao Zedong, all pharmaceutical power comes from the commercialization of the blockbuster. It is also unfortunately true that most companies promote their drugs in development to investors as blockbusters, although there are very few of these about. Three examples from AstraZeneca, Vertex and possibly now Biogen suggest that this status can fade away much more quickly than it took to develop.</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Amgen, Roche, Gilead Sciences, Celgene, Pfizer and Biogen.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
