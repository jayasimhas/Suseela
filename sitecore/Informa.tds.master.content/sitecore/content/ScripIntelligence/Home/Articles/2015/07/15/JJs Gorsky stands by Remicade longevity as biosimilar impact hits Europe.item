<p>Johnson & Johnson expects the biosimilar market to behave quite differently than generics, said CEO Alex Gorsky, even as international sales of Remicade (infliximab) fell 20% in the second quarter, though largely due to currency.</p><p>J&J will vigorously defend a US patent for Remicade that extends to September 2018, Mr Gorsky told investors during the company's second quarter conference call July 14, even as the expansion of biosimilars in Europe began eating into Remicade sales. </p><p>The anti-TNF agent is J&J's top-selling drug, so it is one that investors are keeping a close eye on as biosimilars expand in Europe and appear closer to reaching the US market, where most of Remicade's sales are generated.</p><p>Remicade is a popular target of biosimilar manufacturers, and biosimilar versions of infliximab from Hospira Inc.and Celltrion Inc. were the first biosimilar monoclonal antibodies to reach the market in Europe. </p><p>Celltrion's biosimilar version of Remicade is pending at FDA, but the application's June 8 user fee date passed with no comment from the South Korean biotech or Hospira, which will market it in the US. A March advisory committee meeting to discuss the application was postponed earlier this year. </p><p>However, in a positive development for biosimilars, the Patent & Trademark Office rejected some of the claims in the 2018 patent for Remicade after a reexamination was requested by an undisclosed sponsor, but J&J said it would appeal the decision.</p><p>In Europe, the impact of biosimilar entrants was initially limited, partly because the cheaper versions were only sold in a few Eastern European markets due to J&J's intellectual property protection on Remicade, but that expired in February 2015, opening the door for biosimilars to launch in most of Western Europe.</p><p>Sales of Remicade were $1.67bn in the second quarter, down 7% versus the year-ago quarter, due mostly to currency impact but also because of the biosimilars. International sales fell 20.4% to $339m, with 13.8% of the decline attributed to currency and 6.6% due to operational declines. The bulk of Remicade's sales are generated in the US, however.</p><p>"Biosimilars are not generics," Mr Gorsky reminded the call. "We expect the biosimilar market to behave quite differently than the market typically has for the introduction of a generic.</p><p>"More than 2.2 million people have been treated with Remicade and about 70% of the current patients are receiving sustained and effective treatments, so we believe their doctors are very unlikely to switch them with that level of success," he added.</p><p><b>new launches drive operational pharma growth</b></p><p>Despite lower Remicade sales, pharmaceuticals have been a sweet spot for J&J recently as its consumer and medical device businesses have faced challenges. Pharmaceutical sales nonetheless have a big hurdle to overcome this year, facing difficult comparisons against a year ago due to lower sales of the hepatitis C drug Olysio (simeprevir). Worldwide pharmaceutical sales fell 6.6% to $7.9 billion in the second quarter due to currency, but grew 1% operationally. </p><p>Excluding the impact of Olysio and divestitures, the pharmaceutical group grew 11% in the first half of the year, Mr Gorsky said.</p><p>Operational sales growth was driven by strong sales of new products like the SGLT-2 inhibitor Invokana (canagliflozin) for type 2 diabetes and Imbruvica (ibrutinib) for certain B-cell malignancies, as well as strong sales of Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Zytiga (abiraterone) and Stelara (ustekinumab). </p><p>Invokana launched in 2013 as the first in a new class of SGLT-2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes. Sales of Invokana were $318m in the second quarter, up from $117m a year ago and putting the drug on track to reach blockbuster status this year.</p><p>J&J reported sales of Imbruvica of $154m in the quarter, though the company only books ex-US sales of the product. The company splits global profits on sales of Imbruvica 50/50 with AbbVie, which acquired J&J's former Imbruvica partner Pharmacyclics for $21bn earlier this year. </p><p>Gorsky reaffirmed J&J's goal for its pharma unit to deliver above average industry compound annual growth over the next several years and to file 10 new products by 2019, an ambition the company laid out during an investor meeting in May.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">The Pink Sheet Daily</a>.</p><p>
