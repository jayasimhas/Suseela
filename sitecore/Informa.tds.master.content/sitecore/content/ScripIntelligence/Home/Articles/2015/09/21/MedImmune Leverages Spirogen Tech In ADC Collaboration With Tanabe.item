<p>MedImmune LLC is combining the second-generation pyrollobenzodiazepine (PBD) warheads it picked up in a 2013 buyout of Spirogen Ltd. with Tanabe Research Laboratories USA Inc.'s antibodies in a collaboration to develop mono-specific and bi-specific antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) against a set of cancer targets. </p><p>MedImmune, AstraZeneca PLC's large-molecule-focused subsidiary, is leading the way in the pharma's efforts to develop immuno-oncology drugs as well as ADCs, but it is licensing worldwide rights to PBD candidates against unnamed targets to San Diego-based Tanabe, an affiliate of Japan's Mitsubishi, for undisclosed financial terms under the deal announced Sept. 23. However, MedImmune can opt in at the end of Phase Ib to share development and commercialization rights in the US and Europe.</p><p>David Berman, MedImmune senior vice president of research and development and head of the Oncology Innovative Medicines unit (iMED), said in an interview that the transaction is a way for the company to broaden its base in ADC development, as it also is developing proprietary ADCs using both PBDs and other payloads.</p><p>"MedImmune does have an active, internal ADC pipeline, and we do have candidates that are nearing the clinic," Berman said. "We anticipate that this collaboration will enhance our efforts, providing us a virtual pipeline. This is not instead of, it's actually in addition to &ndash; the ultimate goal being to develop these ADCs to improve patients' lives, so we're trying to maximize how we do that internally, plus working externally as well."</p><p>MedImmune paid $200m up front, with the potential for up to $240m in earn-outs, to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-tables-440m-for-Spirogen-signs-ADC-deal-347315" target="_new">acquire Spirogen in October 2013</a>. Spun out of University College London in 2001, Spirogen's work focused on PBD technology using biodegradable linkers to attach potent cytotoxic warheads to cancer-targeting antibodies. </p><p>PBDs are DNA minor groove-binding agents that block the division of cancer cells without distorting the cells' DNA helix. The result is a therapeutic that is less likely to cause drug resistance than other cancer treatments, and is less toxic to the patient because the active ingredient is delivered directly to tumors, without harming surrounding healthy cells.</p><p>Berman said MedImmune's PBDs are among the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Spirogen-adds-powerful-payload-to-AstraZeneca-cancer-RandD-347322" target="_new">most potent cytotoxic payloads available</a> for inclusion in ADC therapeutics. He wouldn't give any timelines for the work being led by Tanabe, nor give a timetable for when MedImmune's first ADC might reach the clinic. </p><p>"These PBDs specifically crosslink DNA and they are more potent than the warheads that are currently being commercialized," the exec asserted. "They are among the most potent warheads out there."</p><p>Under the agreement, MedImmune receives an undisclosed upfront payment from Tanabe, and can earn development and commercial milestones, as well as single-digit royalties on sales of any resulting ADC that reaches the market. It was not made clear how the earn-outs might be affected if MedImmune opts into development and commercialization following Phase Ib.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
