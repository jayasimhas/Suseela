<p> Johnson &amp; Johnson's Janssen Biotech, Inc. has snapped up Alligator Bioscience's immuno-oncology MAb, ADC-1013, in a deal potentially worth $700m to the small Swedish drug developer. </p><p> Janssen gets an exclusive worldwide license to Alligator's ADC-1013, which is in Phase I trials. The fully human monoclonal antibody (MAb) targets CD40, an immuno-stimulatory receptor found on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells. </p><p> Janssen will develop the product initially in a number of solid tumors and hematological cancers and will assume responsibility for all additional research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities. </p><p> The big pharma company will pay an undisclosed upfront payment to Alligator for the drug candidate and Peter Benson, chair of Alligator's board of directors, said the company was &quot;very pleased with the overall deal and cash infusion into the company.&quot; </p><p> In total Alligator could receive up to $700m if the drug reaches certain pre-determined development, regulatory and commercial milestones. The collaboration was facilitated by the Johnson &amp; Johnson Innovation Center in London. </p><p> Benson told <i>Scrip</i> Alligator's business model was to develop novel antibody-based immunotherapies up to Phase I/II and then out-license the compounds. &quot;We believe Janssen was attracted [to ADC-1013] because of the extensive and very strong scientific data package presented at international immuno-oncology meetings. During the process it became evident that there was a strong fit on many levels,&quot; he said. The deal is a first for Alligator with a major pharma player. </p><p> Immuno-oncology R&amp;D is a hot area for big pharma firms currently but Benson said his company's candidate was &quot;unique in several ways.&quot; </p><p> &quot;The antibody is activating a distinct part of the immune system, the CD40 receptor on antigen-presenting cells. [Most] antibody-based immunotherapies in development and on the market preferentially target receptors on the T-cell population,&quot; he noted. &quot;In addition, ADC-1013 has the potential to become a first in class CD40-agonistic antibody,&quot; Benson said. </p><p> ADC-1013's major competitor, according to Alligator, is a compound being developed by Roche Holding AG's subsidiary Genentech. However, compared with the Roche compound &ndash; which is being tested in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma &ndash; ADC-1013 &quot;seems to have a superior tolerability profile and in addition has a dual mode of action allowing direct killing of tumors expressing the CD40 receptor,&quot; Alligator's chair claimed. &quot;ADC-1013 has also been optimized for superior function in the tumor microenvironment, a fact that may improve the risk benefit profile further.&quot; </p><p> However, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Dr. Joseph Hedden told <i>Scrip </i>that though CD40 is &quot;definitely a novel target, we have no real idea how effective ADC-1013 is.&quot; </p><p> &quot;There are few anti-CD40s in development and all are at early stages without a lot of data. It isn't appropriate to extrapolate any conclusions about efficacy from the other immune-targeting MAbs either,&quot; he noted. &quot;We will have to wait and see with CD40s.&quot; </p><p> Hedden highlighted that though there was &quot;a long way to go before we know if Alligator's drug is even effective on its own, it's reasonable to assume that if it is Janssen could look to pair it with some of its other products in the future. The one that springs to mind is <i>Zytiga</i> (abiraterone acetate), its prostate cancer blockbuster,&quot; he said. </p><p> As well as Roche, Novartis AG has an anti-CD40 product, HCD122, in Phase I/II studies across different lymphomas; Boehringer Ingelheim has a candidate in Phase I trials across a range of tumors; and AstraZeneca plc and Seattle Genetics also have early stage products targeting CD40. Separately, Bellicum is trying to create a personalized dendritic cell vaccine in prostate cancer that also utilizes CD40. </p><p> For ADC-1013, Alligator will continue development through Phase I dose escalation studies and then Janssen will assume responsibility for all future development of the drug. &quot;We expect Phase II clinical trials to start within the next 1-2 years and the compound to reach the market by 2022-2023,&quot; Benson said. </p> <p>
