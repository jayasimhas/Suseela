<p>Astellas won the FDA&rsquo;s approval to market Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate) in the US as a treatment for two rare but serious infections, invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.</p><p>Cresemba is a novel prodrug of isavuconazole, a triazole antifungal agent. The drug is approved in two forms: a hard capsule for oral administration and as a sterile, lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion after reconstitution.</p><p>In January, the FDA's Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee voted 11-0 in favor of Cresemba in treating aspergillosis, a life-threatening fungal infection seen predominantly in immune-compromised patients, such as those with leukemia, and 8-2, with one abstention, to support the use of the drug in mucormycosis, a rapidly progressing invasive fungal infection known for high morbidity and mortality (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Slam-dunk-for-Astellas-antifungal-Cresemba-at-FDA-panel-356311" target="_new">22 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Cresemba was approved in the US for patients 18 years or older.</p><p>The FDA noted that Cresemba is the sixth product approved holding the qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation, which is intended to expedite the approval of antifungals and antibacterials intended to treat serious and life-threatening infections.</p><p>Drugs with the QIDP designation, which was created under the <i>Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now</i> provision of the <i>FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012</i>, are eligible for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">10 July 2012</a>).</p><p>To date, the FDA has granted the QIDP designation at least 68 times to 46 unique molecular entities.</p><p>Cresemba also was designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.</p><p>The safety and efficacy profile of Cresemba in patients with invasive aspergillosis was demonstrated based on data from two Phase III trials: SECURE, a randomized, double-blind, active-control study of adult patients with invasive aspergillosis; and VITAL, an open-label non-comparative study of the drug in adults with invasive aspergillosis and renal impairment or in those with invasive fungal disease caused by other rare fungi.</p><p>In the SECURE study, which enrolled 516 patients, Cresemba demonstrated noninferiority to voriconazole on the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at day 42 for the treatment of adults with invasive aspergillosis or other filamentous fungi, 18% versus 20.2%, respectively. </p><p>The safety and efficacy profile of Cresemba in patients with invasive mucormycosis was demonstrated based on data from the VITAL study, which included a subpopulation of 37 patients with invasive mucormycosis. </p><p>All-cause mortality in Cresemba-treated patients was 38%. </p><p>The efficacy of the drug for the treatment of invasive mucormycosis, however, has not been evaluated in concurrent, controlled trials, Astellas pointed out. </p><p>In the SECURE study, the overall safety profile for Cresemba demonstrated similar rates of mortality and non-fatal adverse events as voriconazole. </p><p>The most frequent adverse events associated with the drug were nausea (26%), vomiting (25%), diarrhea (22%), headache (17%), elevated liver chemistry tests (17%), hypokalemia (14%), constipation (13%), dyspnea (12%), cough (12%), peripheral edema (11%) and back pain (10%).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
