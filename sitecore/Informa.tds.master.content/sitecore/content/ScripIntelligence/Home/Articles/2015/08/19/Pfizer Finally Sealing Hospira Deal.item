<p> <p> Pfizer Inc. is finally set to wrap up its acquisition of injectables and biosimilar specialist Hospira Inc., after getting the nod from US competition authorities &ndash; but conditions apply. </p><p> Pfizer said the takeover will close in early September this year, seven months after it initially agreed a price with Hospira of $17bn &ndash; which valued the latter company at $90 per share. </p><p> The US Federal Trade Commission has approved the deal but has stipulated that Pfizer must divest four US sterile injectable assets, including acetylcysteine, which is used to treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose; antibiotic product clindamycin; voriconazole, an antifungal treatment; and chemotherapy agent melphalan. </p><p> Additionally Pfizer said Brazil's Superintendency-General of CADE has published its unconditional clearance of the merger. </p><p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/EU-Demands-Pfizer-Offload-Infliximab-Biosimilar-In-Hospira-Buy-359785" target="_new">EU regulators</a> already approved the transaction earlier in august, as did antitrust agencies in Canada and Australia. However the European Commission had its own conditions before it would allow the merger to go ahead. The commission, like the US FTC, told Pfizer it must divest some sterile injectable assets &ndash; most of which are used as chemotherapies. But in Europe Pfizer must also hand off its own version of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck &amp; Co.'s <i>Remicade</i> (infliximab), which is currently under development, because of concerns Pfizer might either delay or discontinue development of this product to focus on Hospira's, which is already on the market. </p><p> The transaction will strengthen Pfizer's Global Established Pharmaceutical business, which has suffered declining sales. Hospira has a strong portfolio of acute care and oncology injectables, which Pfizer will add to its GEP unit consisting of branded off-patent anti-infectives, anti-inflammatories, and cytotoxics. </p><p> Hospira also brings to the table a strong biosimilars portfolio &ndash; including versions of infliximab (partnered with Celltrion), Epogen (epoetin), and Neupogen (filgrastim). </p><p> Pfizer is not the only large drug developer expected to include &quot;boost biosimilars offering&quot; in its wider business strategy. </p><p> Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst, Ali Al-Bazergan, said in a recent report on big pharma trends that greater competition in biosimilars is expected following the entry of more big pharma firms. He noted, &quot;Biosimilars require considerable upfront investment in manufacturing and clinical trials, thereby fitting the capabilities of companies with greater financial resources. Big pharma, with existing sales and marketing presence in therapy areas such as oncology and rheumatology, are advantaged by the underlying synergies.&quot; </p> <p>
