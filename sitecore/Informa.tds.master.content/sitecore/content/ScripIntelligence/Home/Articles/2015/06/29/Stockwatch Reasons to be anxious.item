<p>I once asked my then-toddler daughter if hearing her baby brother crying in the next room while her mother changed him made her feel as anxious as it did me. She replied that it might do if I told her what anxious meant. With stock markets either stagnant or in retreat and clinical trials failing every week there are plenty of reasons for investors to feel anxious.</p><p><p>The potential sovereign debt crises in Greece and Puerto Rico and the continued clinical failures at early-stage biotech companies seem to be finely balancing the biotech sector between the longer-term trend, probably driven by algorithmic trading, and the more human inclination towards safer and less volatile assets, like cash.</p><p><p>The long trail of clinical trial failures that will contribute to the bursting of the current biotech bubble further extended last week with Xenon Pharmaceuticals and partner Teva's report of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-failure-impact-Xenons-other-programs-359215" target="_new">failed Phase IIb study of TV-45070 in osteoarthritis</a>. While data in the press release were sketchy, both doses of TV-45070 appeared to fail against placebo, and investors inflicted a 20% share price drubbing over the week. This was despite the analysts from Jefferies holding out the hope of the efficacy of TV-45070 in another Phase IIb study in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). I believe this is a vain hope since PHN is pain resulting from a herpes zoster infection (of nerves), but where the pain extends months or years after virus can be detected in the affected nerves. This is why the approved treatments for PHN are centrally-acting agents such as the tricyclic anti-depressants and gabapentin, which is also approved to treat epilepsy and restless legs syndrome. On the tenuous aspiration that TV-45070, a topical sodium channel inhibitor specifically designed to treat peripheral pain, can demonstrate activity comparable to systemically administered, centrally acting agents approved to treat PHN, Jefferies maintained their buy recommendation to their clients.</p><p><p>The characterization of failed primary endpoints as either 'promising' or 'encouraging' by companies stuttered last week with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forget-diabetes-Vitae-looks-to-MS-drug-359170" target="_new">Vitae Pharmaceuticals reporting the failure</a> of its Phase II study of VTP-34072 in combination with metformin in 126 diabetic patients. While its investors &ndash; who sent the stock price down about 19% over the week &ndash; and its analysts at Piper Jaffray were quick to discount any value from the VTP-34072-only study arm yet to report, the tone of Vitae's statement suggested that Vitae may be preparing the 'pleased to re-acquire the rights to VTP-34072' press release. On the other hand, Evotec reported that its partner Roche had updated it on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/RocheEvotecs-Alzheimers-candidate-fails-359209" target="_new">failure of sembragiline</a> in a Phase IIb study in Alzheimer's disease, and to their credit, held out no hope of continued development of the product if it were to be returned to them.</p><p><p>Meanwhile, in an attempt to reverse the tide of statistical evidence that previously resulted in Onconova Therapeutics' rigosertib failing two Phase III studies in pancreatic cancer and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Onconova-sinks-on-2nd-Phase-III-rigosertib-bust-350146" target="_new">myelodysplastic syndromes</a> (MDS), Onconova held an analyst breakfast to discuss some <i>post hoc</i> sub-group analyses. In the failed study, 299 MDS patients were randomised 2:1 to rigosertib or best supportive care (<i>p</i>=0.33 in the primary endpoint). The data from some subgroups with 117 and 93 rigosertib-treated patients but different randomizations from the failed ITT protocol were found to be so "provocative" by the analysts from Piper Jaffray that they doubled their share price target to $6 and upgraded their recommendation to investors to overweight Onconova in their portfolios. Clearly, Piper Jaffray believes its clients to be less discerning that Onconova's former partner <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Onconova-sinks-as-Baxter-backs-away-from-oral-rigosertib-356526" target="_new">Baxter, who backed away</a> from the partnership earlier this year. Coincidentally, the upgrade came from the same analyst who recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-biotech-stock-propagandists-beware-359154" target="_new">congratulated Alcobra on the failure</a> of its clinical study (<i>p</i>=0.21). As Mr T would say, I pity the fool who believes that research.</p><p><p>In a timely report from the analysts at Cowen entitled "Is There A Bubble In Biotech Stocks?", a comprehensive review of the sector's six-year bull market provided everything except a 'yes' or 'no' answer to the question of the moment. The analysts initially focused on the large capitalization stratum where sales and earnings growth from products such as Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) have driven the outperformance of this group compared with more sedate sectors. Like the Chinese authorities who last week wrongly blamed short sellers as the cause of the drastic month-long bursting of the Chinese stock market bubble, the Cowen analysts ignored the obvious overvaluation of early-stage but multiple billion dollar market capitalization companies that have no sales or earnings (and most are likely never to have any), and where the clinical trial failure rate has, and will continue to be, concentrated.</p><p><p>With money pouring out of the Chinese stock market and Greek banks, and biotech balanced on the edge of a similar deflation, the focus of supporters appears either to be on the wrong culprit or on denial, respectively. It feels like both governments and investment bank analysts are, like King Canute, trying to reverse the tide just because they command it. This is easily enough to make me feel anxious.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
