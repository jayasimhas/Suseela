<p>The FDA on Aug. 18 made history by granting approval of the first drug aimed at boosting a woman's libido, Sprout Pharmaceuticals' Addyi (flibanserin) &ndash; although that nod came with several restrictions imposed on the product's use.</p><p>Specifically, Addyi is indicated as a once-daily treatment for premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is not a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, problems within the relationship or the effects of a medication or other drug substance.</p><p>Sprout's CEO Cindy Whitehead told <i>Scrip</i> the company has not yet priced Addyi, but expects to do so by next month ahead of the product's Oct. 17 launch.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, earlier had put the likelihood that Addyi would gain the FDA's blessing at 92%, which was 3% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said that because of a potentially serious interaction with alcohol, Addyi would only be available through a restricted program, in which health care professionals and pharmacies must be certified.</p><p>Alcohol use is in fact contraindicated in patients taking Addyi. </p><p>"Health care professionals must assess the likelihood of the patient reliably abstaining from alcohol before prescribing Addyi," the FDA warned.</p><p>Regulators noted that Addyi can cause severe low blood pressure and fainting &ndash; risks that are increased and more severe when patients drink alcohol or take the drug with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which interfere with the breakdown of Sprout's product in the body. </p><p>Because of those adverse events, the FDA has required a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), which includes elements to assure safe use. Addyi must be dispensed with a patient-friendly medication guide.</p><p>The drug's labeling also comes with a black-box warning alerting prescribers about the risks of using alcohol with Addyi.</p><p>The FDA is additionally requiring Sprout to conduct three "well-designed" studies of Addyi in women "to better understand the known serious risks of the interaction" between the drug and alcohol.</p><p>The FDA noted the mechanism by which Addyi, a serotonin 1A receptor agonist and a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist, improves sexual desire and related distress is not known. </p><p>Addyi, which is considered a new molecular entity, had previously been twice-rejected &ndash; first in 2010 when Boehringer Ingelheim owned the drug, and in 2013, after Sprout took over development of the product.</p><p>"It's a long time people have been waiting to see the first-ever treatment" for HSDD, Sprout's Whitehead said.</p><p>FDA's Woodcock, who insisted her agency "strives to protect and advance the health of women," said the decision on Addyi provides women "distressed by their low sexual desire" with an approved treatment option.</p><p>The FDA's Aug. 18 verdict came after the agency's panel of outside experts at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-female-sex-pill-but-multiple-caveats-358749" target="_new">June 4 meeting</a> voted 18-6 in backing Addyi's approval, although with certain restrictions imposed on the product's marketing, including a REMS plan, to ensure adverse effects, most notably fainting, are properly managed.</p><p>But several on the panel also acknowledged Addyi's efficacy was "modest" at best.</p><p>"I think that puts it in good company with other approved drugs," panelist Walid Gellad, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said at the advisory committee meeting &ndash; a remark that brought an explosion of laughter.</p><p>Several women at that meeting pleaded with the FDA committee to back approval of Addyi &ndash; insisting patients with HSDD, which affects about 7% of premenopausal women in the US, are desperate for a pharmaceutical therapy, given there are no drugs on the American market for female sexual dysfunction.</p><p>But others at the meeting accused Sprout of engaging in underhanded tactics to get its drug on the market through disseminating misinformation and engaging in anti-FDA campaigns on Capitol Hill and elsewhere declaring the agency was "gender biased." </p><p>Sprout's Whitehead insisted the firm's marketing campaign for Addyi would center around educating prescribers about the drug's benefit-risk profile.</p><p>"No one is incented more than we are as a company to set realistic expectations in the marketplace," she said in an interview, adding that Sprout has "always had a spirit of cooperation with the FDA in terms of how we do that."</p><p>"There are a number of different tools we will use to ensure good education," Whitehead added.</p><p>She said prescribers will be encouraged to use a screening tool, called the <a href="http://www.addyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Decreased-Sexual-Desire-Screener-2.pdf" target="_new">Decreased Sexual Desire Screener</a>, which lays out certain questions to help properly diagnose HSDD, such as whether the woman is bothered by her low libido.</p><p>"If you weren't concerned about it you wouldn't be an appropriate candidate for medical treatment," Whitehead declared.</p><p>The Sprout CEO said she wants to see Addyi become the game changer for female sexual health that Pfizer's Viagra (sildenafil) did for men after being approved in 1998 &ndash; which she said triggered interest in men's health "well beyond the bedroom."</p><p>"One of our greatest legacies in opening this door," Whitehead said, "would be hopefully to bring a lot of innovation and research into this space."</p><p>"Aspirationally, I hope there will be a ripple effect across women's health care in general, beyond women's sexual health," she said. </p><p>Women's sexual health, Whitehead insisted, has been "relatively stagnant" since the birth control pill was first approved by the FDA as a contraceptive in 1960.</p><p>"And in a day and age where we are talking about more women in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Sex-drugs-and-equality-more-than-flibanserin-358776" target="_new">clinical trials</a>, studying the female rodent model in early clinical work, the fact that we have studied this in uniquely in and for women, I'm really proud of," Whitehead said, pointing out Addyi has been studied in 11,000 women.</p><p>What she didn't point out, however, was the fact that in the alcohol interaction study the FDA requested to be conducted with Addyi, only two of the 25 participants were women.</p><p>Whitehead acknowledged her firm has its work cut out for it in confronting the critics of Addyi &ndash; arguing there's been a lot of misinformation about the drug and HSDD.</p><p>She praised the FDA for holding a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm401167.htm" target="_new">two-day meeting</a> last October and "assembling panels of patients and letting them tell us what it's like to live with this, what the impact is and what their own definition of success could be." </p><p>"The FDA has recognized for some time the challenges involved in developing treatments for female sexual dysfunction," regulators said. "The FDA continues to encourage drug development in this area."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
