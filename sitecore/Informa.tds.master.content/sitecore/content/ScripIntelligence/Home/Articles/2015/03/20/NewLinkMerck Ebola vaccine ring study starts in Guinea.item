<p>A Phase III trial testing an experimental recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) Ebola vaccine from NewLink Genetics and its partner Merck using a "ring" vaccination strategy got underway this week in Coyah prefecture, Guinea, the World Health Organization (WHO), which is sponsoring the study, said on 25 March.</p><p>The strategy consists of identifying recently infected patients and vaccinating all their contacts, thereby creating a "ring of immunity" around them to stop the virus from spreading, WHO said. </p><p>"This very same strategy was a key contribution to eradicating smallpox in the 1970's and allows us to vaccinate all those at greatest risk," explained Dr Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, WHO's coordinator for the Guinea vaccine trial.??</p><p>WHO noted that Dr Donald Henderson, who led the WHO smallpox eradication effort, helped design the Ebola ring vaccination trial.</p><p>The study is seeking to enroll up to 10,000 adults at high risk of infection in 190 rings within a 6-8 week period. The volunteers will be followed for three months. </p><p>The results could be available as early as July, WHO said.</p><p>The start of the ring vaccination trial in Guinea is "one of the most important milestones we have achieved in seeking a modern line of defense against Ebola," said Dr Jean-Marie Dangou, WHO's representative in that nation. </p><p>WHO is partnering in the Phase III trial with the Guinea government, Doctors without Borders/Medecins sans Fronti&egrave;res, Epicentre and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.</p><p>The trial is being funded by MSF, the Research Council of Norway, the Canadian government and the Wellcome Trust. </p><p>WHO earlier had launched a Phase II study testing the NewLink/Merck vaccine, which was initially developed by the Canadian government, in front-line healthcare workers. </p><p>A study being run by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing the same vaccine in Sierra Leone, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">STRIVE</a>, is expected to get underway next week, Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the agency's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, said during a 25 March House hearing. </p><p>Another study, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">PREVAIL</a>, testing rVSV and an experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline, got underway in Liberia on 2 February.</p><p>The Phase II/III PREVAIL trial was designed to enroll 27,000 adults 18 years or older &ndash; some healthy subjects and others healthcare workers or those at high risk of contracting Ebola.</p><p>But the NIH is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">considering moving</a> the next stage of the PREVAIL trial to potentially Guinea or Sierra Leone because the number of Ebola cases in Liberia have subsided in recent weeks. </p><p>Ebola has infected about 25,000 people in the current outbreak, killing more than 10,300.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
