<p>Novavax revealed on 12 February that it has started testing its Ebola glycoprotein (GP) recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate in healthy human volunteers to determine if it is safe. </p><p>The news gave the firm's shares a 3% boost in morning trading, before closing at 8.40, up 16 cents, or 2%.</p><p>The vaccine is intended to protect people against Makona, which is the mutated form of the Zaire strain that has caused the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p><p>Novavax is well behind other companies in developing an Ebola vaccine, with GlaxoSmithKline and its partner the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and NewLink and its collaborator Merck already evaluating their product in an efficacy trial in Liberia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Johnson & Johnson's and Bavarian Nordic's prime-boost Ebola vaccine is in Phase I testing and is expected to soon start efficacy trials (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Oxford-tests-JnJBavarian-Nordic-prime-boost-Ebola-vaccine-355965" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p><p>But Novavax said its Ebola vaccine could be rapidly scaled-up to produce millions of doses if necessary. </p><p>Novavax's randomized, observer-blinded, dose-ranging Phase I trial, which is being conducted in Australia, will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine, with and without the firm's Matrix-M adjuvant, in 230 healthy adults 18-50 years.</p><p>The immunogenicity will be measured by concentrations of serum IgG antibodies to the Ebola Makona strain glycoprotein. </p><p>Secondary study endpoints include epitope-specific immune responses to the Ebola GP antigen as measured by serum titers in a competitive ELISA assay using known-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as well as serum Ebola virus neutralizing antibody reciprocal titers.</p><p>Each study participant will receive two intramuscular injections &ndash; one each on study days 0 and 21. </p><p>Novavax said its product was the first subunit Ebola GP-based vaccine to provide protection in non-human primates. </p><p>In that study, 100% of the immunized animals were protected. </p><p>"The strong immune responses observed in our animal immunogenicity models and the protection observed in the non-human primate challenge models, confirm that our Ebola GP Vaccine is an important candidate for consideration," said Dr Gregory Glenn, senior vice president of research and development at Novavax.</p><p>The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based biotech also is developing a vaccine against the A/H7N9 influenza strain. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
