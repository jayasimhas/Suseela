<p>As Scottish poet Robert Burns and American author John Steinbeck might have warned Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management &ndash; the hedge fund manager the biopharmaceutical industry loves to hate &ndash; even the best-laid schemes can go awry.</p><p>And that seems to be the case for Bass, who so far has failed to persuade the US Patent & Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to institute any trials on the <i>inter partes review</i> (IPR) petitions he has filed through his self-created Coalition for Affordable Drugs.</p><p>Last week, the PTAB said it would not take up a trial for Bass' IPR petition challenging a patent held by Biogen on its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate).</p><p>A week earlier, the PTAB <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bass-Denied-Trials-In-Acorda-Patent-Challenges-Shares-Soar-360093" target="_new">refused to institute a trial</a> on the hedge fund manager's IPR petitions seeking to invalidate two patents held by Acorda Therapeutics on its MS medicine Ampyra (dalfampridine).</p><p>Now, in an unusual move, the PTAB wants to know whether the IPR petitions filed by Bass and his coalition challenging a patent, known as 7,056,886, owned by NPS Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Shire in February, covering gastrointestinal drugs Lialda (delayed-release mesalamine) and Gattex (teduglutide), should be dismissed for "abuse of process."</p><p>"The PTAB never says a word until they've decided whether to institute a trial," Washington lawyer Eleanor Yost, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The IPR reviews, created in 2011 under the <i>American Invents Act</i> (AIA), are trial proceedings conducted by the PTAB intended to be a faster and more affordable way for third parties to challenge patents than going through the American court system.</p><p>Bass has been using the IPR system in a mission to bring down what he's called "invalid" patents that "contain no meaningful innovations" held by a "small minority" of drug makers, which he <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-reform-its-all-about-the-trolls-no-Bass-358182" target="_new">asserted in a letter this past spring</a> to the Republican and Democratic chiefs of the House Judiciary Committee are "abusing the patent system" to "maintain their own anti-competitive, high-price monopoly, harming Americans suffering from illnesses."</p><p>"Our IPR petitions fulfill and define the purpose of the IPR process and address very specific patents that we believe, unlike the vast majority of legitimate patents, do not represent true innovation or invention," Bass said in the letter.</p><p>The "sheer ridiculousness," he said, of "simple concepts" that are claimed to be "novel" in certain biopharma patents, like "siliconized rubber stoppers" and "exclusive pharmacy" using "exclusive databases," taking an old drug for "at least two weeks" for a chronic condition, taking an old oral contraceptive for "24 days" instead of 21 days, and certain others, "keep these few drug companies' monopolies on old products alive." </p><p>"These abuses of the patent system are taxes on the U.S. economy, public welfare and every citizen afflicted by diseases that range from multiple sclerosis to narcolepsy and a number of other conditions," Bass said. "If nothing novel is disclosed, a patent owner should not be rewarded with a government grant of a 20-year monopoly."</p><p>The number of IPR petitions involving biopharmaceutical patents has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Patent-Challenge-Landscape-Shifting-Inter-Partes-Reviews-Climb-360075" target="_new">more than doubled</a> in the past year to 9% from the 4% the two previous years &ndash; with Bass likely a factor in that increase.</p><p>Indeed, Bass has filed close to 30 IPR petitions so far, Goodwin Procter's Yost noted.</p><p>But Yost said Bass is not helping his cause any by openly criticizing the PTAB in public &ndash; last week repeatedly calling the board a "kangaroo court." </p><p>"Insulting judges is not a great way to go," she said.</p><p>Companies like Celgene and AbbVie have filed motions for sanction with the PTAB asking the board to dismiss the IPR petitions filed by Bass on the grounds of abuse of process and improper use of the proceedings.</p><p>But after the PTAB got a look at NPS' and Shire's patent owner's preliminary responses (PPORs), the board, for the first time, called for the parties to provide additional briefings addressing four questions on whether it should dismiss Bass' IPR petitions challenging the firms' patent:</p><p>? the standing requirement for challenging the validity of that patent in an IPR review under the AIA;</p><p>? to what extent, if any, the business objective or intent of the petitioner should be considered in reaching a determination of abuse of process;</p><p>? the intent of Congress to provide an alternative to litigation and to provide a mechanism to increase patent quality by allowing expedited administrative patent challenges; and</p><p>? the resulting social costs/benefits associated with a decision to address the merits of the petitions, versus a decision to dismiss the petitions for abuse of process without reaching the merits of the IPRs.</p><p>Shire and NPS are expected to submit their briefing by the end of this week, while Bass will have time after that to respond.</p><p>But Yost said she doubted the PTAB would act anytime soon on those briefings &ndash; pointing out the ruling on whether to institute a trial is not expected until Oct. 24.</p><p>In fact, she anticipated a decision first from the board to act on Celgene's and AbbVie's motions for sanction.</p><p>"So it's going to be a little bit of hurry up and wait again," Yost said.</p><p>"I really think the board would have a tough time saying the coalition doesn't have standing, because the statute basically says any person can bring one of these proceedings," she said.</p><p>The real question, Yost said, is whether the PTAB has the ability under the AIA to exercise its discretion to decline based on the motives of the IPR filers.</p><p>The request for the briefings, in which the PTAB made clear a response from the parties is not mandatory, may simply be that the board wants to consider all information, Yost said.</p><p>But she anticipated that if the board makes any type of ruling on the abuse of process question, it would be an "exceedingly narrow" decision, "because they would have to be careful not to exclude groups that have a particular public interest at heart," rather than parties that are seeking to derive profit from the IPR filings.</p><p>"They would need to be very careful about laying down broad proclamations that would impact organizations that themselves might want to bring proceedings for more altruistic reasons," Yost said.</p><p>Nonetheless, she said she expected to see more PPORs include requests for dismissal of IPRs for abuse of process and suggest the PTAB judges make the same type of request as the panel did in the Bass petition challenging NPS' and Shire's patent.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
