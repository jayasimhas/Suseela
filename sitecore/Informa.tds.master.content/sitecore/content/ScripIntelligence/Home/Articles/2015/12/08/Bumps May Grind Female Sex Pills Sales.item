<p>While privately held Sprout Pharmaceuticals has insisted one in every 10 American women have hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) &ndash; meaning there could potentially be several million eligible for the firm's newly approved female sex pill Addyi (flibanserin) &ndash; the roadblocks the FDA has thrown up in front of the product could potentially damage its sales, no matter how much hype has revolved around it.</p><p>Because of the drug's serious risks of hypotension, or low blood pressure, and fainting, which get severely worse with alcohol use, the FDA has imposed a strict risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan on the drug, which includes elements to assure safe use. </p><p>The FDA, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Embraces-Sex-Pill-For-Women-Restrictions-Apply-360015" target="_new">approved</a> Sprout's drug on Aug. 18, is requiring prescribers to be certified in the Addyi REMS program, which involves enrolling in and completing training. Doctors also must counsel patients about the drug's risks of hypotension and fainting and warn them off of alcohol during Addyi treatment &ndash; getting them to sign off on an agreement form attesting they understand those risks and conditions.</p><p>The drug's labeling also carries a black-box warning alerting prescribers about the risks of severe hypotension and fainting in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with Addyi, in those who also use moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in those who have liver impairment. </p><p>All of that could be a deterrent for doctors to prescribe Addyi.</p><p>Additionally, only pharmacies that are certified under the Addyi REMS program may dispense the drug. They also are required to counsel patients about not drinking alcohol while taking Sprout's product, making it likely some pharmacies may not want to carry Addyi.</p><p>The FDA is requiring Sprout to conduct three postmarketing studies in women to better understand the known serious risks of the interaction between Addyi and alcohol.</p><p>Sprout CEO Cindy Whitehead told <i>Scrip</i> her company had anticipated a REMS &ndash; even insisting the firm had suggested the idea itself &ndash; and had been "proactively" discussing the idea with the FDA for the past few months, ironing out the details.</p><p>An FDA panel of advisers in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-female-sex-pill-but-multiple-caveats-358749" target="_new">June</a> had backed Addyi's approval in an 18-6 vote, but only with a REMS.</p><p><b>Pricing</b></p><p>Whitehead said Sprout has not yet priced Addyi because the Raleigh, N.C.-based company is still in conversations with payers and "understanding their temperament toward covering the drug in line with how they are treating the male sexual health drugs and what ranges they're in."</p><p>"There's been no other drug like this today, but we know there are lessons to be learned from the male sexual health drugs," Whitehead said.</p><p>She said Sprout is anticipating insurers to make Addyi a second- or third-tier drug, with co-pays for patients ranging from $30 to $75, which she said would be similar to what men pay for drugs like Pfizer's Viagra (sildenafil) and other PDE5 inhibitors.</p><p>"At launch, we would offset some of that out-of-pocket expense with some co-pay assistance cards," Whitehead said.</p><p>She said Sprout's analysis has shown that about 70% of men with insurance coverage get reimbursed for one of the PDE5 inhibitors. </p><p>Whitehead said the company expects to have the pricing worked out by Addyi's Oct. 17 anticipated launch &ndash; a date she said Sprout was on track to meet.</p><p>She said Sprout plans to build a specialty sales organization "that really focuses on physicians with expertise in female sexual dysfunction," such as OB-GYNs and potentially some primary care physicians and psychiatrists.</p><p><b>Competition</b></p><p>Whitehead said her firm does not fear potential competitors, such as Cranbury, N.J.-based Palatin Technologies, which is developing its own sexual dysfunction drug, although its experimental product, bremelanotide, a melanocortin agonist, is a synthetic peptide analog of the naturally occurring hormone alpha-MSH, is intended to be subcutaneously administered.</p><p>"Addyi is not going to work for all women. No one drug ever does," she said. "It would be my hope that women would have a variety of treatment options."</p><p>On news of Addyi's approval, shares of Palatin rocketed 37%, or 35 cents, in after-hours trading on Aug. 18.</p><p>Palatin, whose investigational product is in Phase III trials, which are expected to be completed later next year, praised the FDA's approval of Addyi &ndash; declaring the action "marks a long-awaited milestone in healthcare for women."</p><p>Like Addyi, bremelanotide works in the brain to create a sexual response. </p><p>But unlike Sprout's drug, which is taken daily, bremelanotide is intended to be an as-needed, centrally mediated medication and not for chronic use.</p><p>Palatin said its studies have shown that bremelanotide starts working within 30 to 60 minutes of administration and remains effective for about eight hours, "providing women with greater control and flexibility in their treatment as well as a quick response." </p><p>Nonetheless, the firm said that differing dose frequencies and routes of administration "could provide a robust set of treatment options for women suffering from HSDD."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
