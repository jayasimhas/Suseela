<p> Dr Vas Narasimhan, a self-proclaimed history geek, is the current head of global development for Novartis Pharmaceuticals but he still considers himself a physician first when it comes to decision making. </p> <p> <img alt="Dr Vas Narasimhan" title="Dr Vas Narasimhan" src="-/media/BA40EBA4BD2B4395A5175207550EE17E.ashx"> </p> <p> In his current position Dr Narasimhan leads more than 7,000 associates focused on the development and delivery of innovative therapies and he is also a member of the Novartis pharma executive committee, the commercial leadership team and chair of the innovation management board. But in his spare time, Dr Narasimhan can be found swimming lengths or counting up miles on a run as he trains for his next triathlon event. </p> <p> In the latest instalment of <i>Scrip</i>'s executive profile series, Dr Narasmhan talks us through his journey into the pharma world, his biggest influences both personally and professionally, and his toughest moment facing the US Congress during the 2009 H1N1 flu crisis. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: You have risen to a leadership position in your field. What key aspect of your personality do you think got you here?</b> </p> <p> <b>Vas Narasimhan</b>: Resilience built up over time being involved in so many different parts of Novartis and working in medicine both in the developing world and in the US. Also a willingness to take risks. I don't have an aversion to taking risks for something I believe in and it's something that I have always tried to do. But probably the biggest element of my personality that got me here is that I'm very purpose-driven. I'm a physician who believes very deeply that our medications have a big impact on the world. I consider myself a physician first and foremost and I have that mind set for everything I do. Being purpose-driven gives you a lot of energy to keep tackling new challenges. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What are your own long term aspirations?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>Longer term I would like to continue to grow and leader bigger and broader healthcare organizations focused on having a dramatic impact on healthcare. Novartis has been a tremendous platform for that: the company has moved me through many different roles, broader and broader in their scope of responsibility. I have worked both in commercial and in R&amp;D and I think all of that has helped me increase the impact I can have. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What are the key things that shaped you when growing up?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>I am a son of immigrant parents to the US. My family came from villages in India and worked their way up to the United States. So I grew up with a very keen sense of gratitude that I have been given the opportunities that I have been granted. I was always taught that given that you have these opportunities you have to maximize the impact you can have on the world. Another element of my upbringing was an exposure to India, Africa, lots of different parts of the world which let me understand how diverse the people are and the challenges they face, as well as the differences in culture. The third component is that my parents are scientists. I was raised with a love of science and that is something I have taken with me through everything I have worked on over the last few years. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>My parents. They shaped my values and what I believe matters in the world and my conviction that people can make a big difference in the lives of others. </p> <p> The other big influence on my life is my wife. My wife is a physician and scientist herself who has sacrificed a lot to take care of our children and move around the world with me as Novartis has moved me to different opportunities. She has always been extremely supportive and has always pushed me to get better; she asks the tough questions to make sure I'm focused on what I really want to be doing. </p> <p> [One prominent occasion,] after working in the US developing pediatric vaccines for a number of years, I took on the challenge of leading our biosimilars unit in the Sandoz Division. I was thrilled to be leading a group of people to completely change an industry by enhancing the delivery of biologicals. However, shortly after taking on this challenge and moving my family to Germany, I was asked by the company to take on my current role as global head of pharmaceutical development. It was a difficult time professionally as I was invested in the important work I was doing at Sandoz and personally it would mean moving again and taking on my third leadership role in a span of five months. Ultimately, the opportunity to revolutionize the development and practice of medicine proved too compelling and as a family we decided to make the move. We ended up living in three countries and three homes in just a few months. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Who do you admire in the industry, and why?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>The person I really admire within the industry is a scientist that maybe not everyone will have heard of. His name is Maurice Hilleman. Maurice was one of the most important scientists at Merck's Vaccine Laboratory and over the course of his life he developed eight vaccines that led to probably the greatest reductions in child mortality in the US and indeed around the world. He was a scientist who felt strongly that industry has a leadership role in shaping not just the products but also healthcare policy and regulations. He always stood up for innovation and the fight to make these products available to as many people as possible. It's an incredible story of how one man can have such a dramatic impact for generations of children around the world. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Tell us something surprising about you.</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>I'm a lifelong, strict vegetarian. I've actually never eaten meat in my entire life and it's partly because of my religious upbringing. I was raised a Hindu and it's a big part of who I am, being in touch with spiritual beliefs. </p> <p> Another thing, I train for triathlons, which also keeps me sane in lots of ways. I get up at five in the morning and work on my swimming, running and cycling almost every day. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: If you weren't a pharma executive, what would you be?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>A conservation biologist. I'm very passionate about the problems of the environment and the conservation of species that are challenged with extinction. Part of it is that I grew up doing a lot of hiking and developed a great love of nature. Now I have my own children and I worry that they're not going to be able to see all of these beautiful places simply because of the impact we are having on the world. Conservation biology gives us the chance to really look at the science of what is happening and how we can improve things for the future. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What has your proudest moment been?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>The approvals of our meningitis vaccines at Novartis are up there. I started working on these vaccines in 2006 with the goal of ensuring that every child in the world would have the opportunity to be protected from this disease, which can lead to death or disability. Now we have successfully licensed meningitis vaccines, most recently Bexsero, for all of the different types of meningitis across all age groups. So that vision of enabling a meningitis-free world now can be a reality. </p> <p> [More recently though] in the span of just a few months last year we released data that is poised to transform the treatment of four diseases: heart failure with LCZ696 and psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis with Cosentyx (secukinumab).&nbsp;In all my years working in drug development, I cannot remember having the potential to impact more patients with such compelling data in such a short amount of time. In our world, it is so hard to succeed with even one new medicine, so to succeed with two medicines across four diseases is something pretty remarkable. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: And what about your most difficult moment?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>Testifying in front of the US congress on our pandemic response to enable the US population, as well as populations around the world, to have access to H1N1 vaccines during the 2009 crisis. I was in charge of leading that effort at Novartis and we didn't know at the start if this virus was going to have a devastating impact globally. So at that point in time the pressure of trying to get these vaccines developed, get them scaled up in manufacturing, and having to explain that to US government officials and under oath was definitely a high pressure situation but one that I learned a lot from. Ultimately we were able to deliver 250 million doses of vaccine to the world. So it ended up being a great success. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What is one change you have effected in your organization that you believe was invaluable?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>I think that would be maintenance of a culture of collaboration and one that remains focused. In an innovation industry like ours it's so difficult to develop even one drug or one vaccine and having a culture which enables people to fail and still be purposeful and be guided by our mission to keep getting back up and trying, that's important. </p> <p> For example, we are currently working on having a seamless transition from the research stage to full-scale development of a product. In so many cases, not just in our company but in others too, it is a source of so much friction. [At Novartis] we have implemented joint teams, joint conversations, to ensure we drive strong alignment early. Our molecules, while they are still being evaluated at early stages, are already starting to be discussed in late-stage development, so they seamlessly move across the pipeline. I think this idea will have a really big impact along the line. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What was your first ever job?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>My first job was cleaning laboratory supplies in an immunology laboratory at the University of Chicago where I was trying to break into one of the big labs and one of the investigators told me that I had to start at the bottom. So cleaning the supplies, mixing the solutions, making sure that the bacteria broth was growing; those are the kinds of things that I had to do. </p> <p> But my first biotech job was actually working on the portfolio prioritization for Novartis. I had been a physician working in the World Health Organization, I moved to McKinsey &amp; Company where I worked as a consultant, and then I came into Novartis where I was charged with trying to rank all of pipeline programs across Novartis development. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: So you were at McKinsey before Novartis: what did you learn there?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>I learned how to analyze problems extremely quickly with limited information but come to a hypothesis that you could try to test. I learned to be able to make a recommendation even when the data is not all there and you don't have 100% surety that you have the right answer. That is a skill you need in higher levels of management because you simply don't always have all the information. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What was your favorite subject at school?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN:</b> Ancient history. I was fascinated by the times of the Greeks and the Romans. I studied ancient Greek texts, Aristotle and Plato, and I became very interested in Herodotus's writings. I'm a closet historian. I love reading books about ancient history or even in more recent times, accounts of wars or current events. I'm not into fiction but I'm very much into history. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What is the one gadget that you can't leave home or office without?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>I wish I had a more interesting answer but it's got to be the iPad. I rely on my iPad for everything and it's not just work things: while I'm travelling constantly I often rely on FaceTime to speak to my kids so that they can keep me up to speed with what is going on. I have two little boys aged seven and five, so FaceTime is very critical for me given the heavy travel schedule. </p> <p> But more and more we can do so much of our work on the iPad. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What are you reading at the moment?</b> </p> <p> <b>VN: </b>A book called <i>The Sixth Extinction</i> [by Elizabeth Kolbert] about the great extinctions that have happened since life appeared on earth a billion years ago. It turns out that we have gone through five great extinctions, the last being when the giant meteor hit earth and eliminated the dinosaurs. The question now is mankind, with the impact we are having on the environment, leading to the sixth extinction. It allows me to think about completely different things than challenges at work. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Finally, tell us one myth about the industry that you'd like to set straight.</b> </p> <p> <b>VN:</b> One thing that strikes me about our industry, that I always tell audiences, is how committed the people are across the company &ndash; specifically in R&amp;D &ndash; to medicine and advancing medicine for patients. There is still a popular belief that the drugs industry is too focused on money and profits. When I meet with my team we're all about 'Can we develop a better medicine for patients? Can we innovate a better way?' Those are the things we talk about, so I'd really like people to know that this thinking is what animates an organization like Novartis. </p>
