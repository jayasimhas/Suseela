<p>A pilot program being run by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA (RUF) and backed with funding from Pfizer is getting close to being able to let biopharmaceutical makers query "big data" to evaluate whether there is a safety problem with their products &ndash; a program the head of the FDA called impressive.</p><p>The project is part of RUF's Innovation in Medical Evidence Development and Surveillance (IMEDS) program, which aims to create resources and regulatory tools to monitor new drugs and devices in the postmarketing setting, explained Dr Troy McCall, RUF's chief implementation officer for the IMEDS program.</p><p>The IMEDS has five datasets representing 80 million lives that reside in a virtual laboratory sitting on a cloud, where researchers can access the data to develop new methods and refine existing ones, Dr McCall said on 15 May during the annual public meeting of RUF, the nonprofit public-private partnership Congress created in 2007 under the <i>FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA)</i> to serve as an independent third party to bring together various stakeholders &ndash; regulators, drug makers, academia and patient advocates &ndash; in a transparent manner to work on establishing scientific research collaborations to advance regulatory science. </p><p>"From my perspective, they are a really critical partner for us," Dr Stephen Ostroff, acting commissioner of the FDA, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>He said he was "really excited" about the variety of big data activities RUF currently is pursuing, such as the IMEDS project.</p><p><b>IMEDS-Evaluation</b></p><p>IMEDS was created to pursue continued development of methods for using the massive amounts of electronic health data that exist for safety assessments and other broader purposes and to establish a long-term research agenda and corresponding governance structure to address the methodological needs of the FDA's Sentinel system, Dr McCall said.</p><p>He said IMEDS also was established to provide researchers with hands-on training in using electronic health data for surveillance and to support broader stakeholder participation and use of national tools, such as the FDA's Sentinel, an active postmarket risk identification and analysis system that uses electronic health records representing about 178 million patients from 18 healthcare plan data partners, which retain the physical and operational control over their data, to track medical product safety issues. </p><p>The Sentinel project, which also was mandated by Congress under FDAAA, initially was launched under a pilot in September 2009, known as Mini-Sentinel, which has now been completed.</p><p>Using Sentinel data, the FDA has conducted 137 assessments of products, conditions or product-outcome pairs, which has resulted in four drug safety communications, two of which have led to labeling changes. </p><p>But, Dr McCall lamented, there's been no opportunities for non-FDA stakeholders to access the methods, tools and datasets represented by the 18 data partners that exist in Sentinel.</p><p>So, he said, RUF launched a new component of its IMEDS program under a pilot in January, dubbed IMEDS-Evaluation, which is being sponsored by Pfizer, to give industry and other non-FDA stakeholders a chance to access those same types of methods, tools and datasets that reside with Sentinel.</p><p><b>The concept</b></p><p>"There are multiple types of questions that could be responded to through the IMEDS-Evaluation," Dr McCall said.</p><p>For instance, he said, if a biopharmaceutical manufacturer thought there may be a safety issue with one of its marketed products, such as hepatic or renal failure, it could initiate a query through the IMEDS-Evaluation system to get a better understanding if there was a true safety signal that needs to be further investigated.</p><p>The IMEDS-Evaluation also could be used to better understand the safety signals the FDA has detected through Sentinel, "so there can be a closer collaboration to understanding whether or not a safety issue actually exists," Dr McCall declared.</p><p>"At the end of the day, what we're hoping to accomplish is to improve patients' lives and save patients' lives," he said. "By having these two programs working together, we believe that puts us one step closer to accomplishing that goal."</p><p>The IMEDS-Evaluation assessments will be completed using the IMEDS Distributed Database, which is intended to be a partnership between the FDA Sentinel's 18 data partners and RUF, with the activities facilitated by an operations center and overseen by an independent scientific advisory committee.</p><p>The goals of the pilot include developing end-to-end processes and policies to govern and dictate how the IMEDS-Evaluation program will operate once it's in "full production mode" and showing the system actually works by answering safety questions of interest to manufacturers and the FDA using the same types of tools as Sentinel, Dr McCall explained.</p><p>Dr McCall noted that several questions still need to be answered in developing those policies and procedures, such as at what point the FDA should be informed a company is asking a question about one of its marketed products, when should regulators be involved in the query process and the timeline by which a company needs to publicly announce the findings &ndash; positive or negative &ndash; from the results of a query.</p><p>"All of that work is ongoing," he said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr McCall said the first draft of the policies and procedures are at a stage where they "will probably work."</p><p>"We don't expect them to work in their fullest extent at this point, but we do believe they are strong enough to pressure test the system," he said.</p><p>To test the system, the IMEDS-Evaluation team will ask two specific questions, which Dr McCall said will be "important to a company and we believe to the broader universe.</p><p>He said RUF currently is finalizing a contract with Harvard Pilgrim, which is the coordinating center for the FDA for Sentinel. </p><p>"We felt it made perfectly good sense to continue using Harvard Pilgrim as our data coordinating center for purposes of saving time and money and also leveraging the vast knowledge and experience that Harvard Pilgrim has, Dr McCall said.</p><p>He said RUF also is in the process of finalizing agreements with the data partners.</p><p>It also is firming up the institutional review board protocol that will be necessary to pose the queries to the IMEDS-Evaluation system, Dr McCall added.</p><p>RUF is anticipating initiating the second phase of the pilot project this quarter and concluding it by the third quarter, he said. </p><p>"I'm very impressed," FDA's Dr Ostroff said in an interview.</p><p>"We are really looking forward to seeing continued progress, not only in these projects, but in new projects, that I think will enhance the visibility of the foundation and will enhance the value," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
