<p>Sanofi's basal insulin/GPL-1 agonist combination LixiLan (lixisenatide plus insulin glargine) has met its primary endpoint in a second Phase III study, top-line data show, keeping it on track for filings in the US in the fourth quarter and in the EU in early 2016. </p><p>If successful at the regulators, the product will go up against Novo Nordisk's <i>Xultophy</i>, a combination of insulin degludec (<i>Tresiba</i>) and liraglutide (<i>Victoza</i>), which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/First-launch-for-Novo-Nordisks-Xultophy-356258" target="_new">first launched in Switzerland</a> in January this year. But analysts say that pending the full data showing the magnitude of the benefit, and the resulting difference in hypoglycemia, it is difficult to say how well Sanofi's offering will compete. </p><p>The new study, LixiLan-L, compared the fixed ratio combination of insulin glargine 100 Units/mL and lixisenatide (which Sanofi licensed from Zealand Pharma) against treatment with insulin glargine 100 Units/mL over 30 weeks in 736 patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled on basal insulin, alone or combined with one to two oral anti-diabetic agents. Treatment with metformin, if previously taken, was continued throughout the study. </p><p>The LixiLan combo showed a statistically improved reduction in HbA1c (average blood glucose over the previous three months) compared with insulin glargine 100 Units/mL alone. Its safety profile reflected those of its two constituent products, Sanofi said. </p><p>The study top-line results follow those from the LixiLan-O study released in July. This also met its primary endpoint of superior HbA1c reduction over a 30 week period in 1,170 patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled on metformin alone or on metformin combined with a second oral anti-diabetic agent.</p><p>The idea behind the two studies is to assess its efficacy when used both before and after basal insulin in the diabetes treatment paradigm. </p><p>But analysts at Sagient's BioMedTracker say that the full data are needed to give a meaningful idea of where it could compete, and the full results of both trials have yet to be presented in a peer-reviewed arena. </p><p>They note that in its Phase IIb trial in patients also not yet on insulin, LixiLan showed a significant benefit over glargine, but the difference in HbA1c was only 0.17%, which is not clinically meaningful. "In that trial, however, glargine could be titrated to higher than the glargine component of LixiLan. If the [LixiLan-O] trial restricted titration of glargine, the difference could be larger ... Still, in Phase IIb, hypoglycemia turned out to be similar, so there is a chance that if titration of glargine was capped in the [LixiLan-O] study, LixiLan could have more hypoglycemia, which would be a disadvantage relative to competitor [Xultophy]."</p><p>They added that in the Phase IIb study, LixiLan did have a slight benefit on weight (1.5 kg), but if the glargine comparator was capped in the [LixiLan-O] study, it is possible the difference will not be as large. "Hence, it will be quite interesting to see details on these features and how much better results are than in Phase IIb."</p><p>Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk is having <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novo-Nordisk-May-Withhold-Xultophy-From-Germany-If-Price-Talks-Fail-359811" target="_new">reimbursement troubles</a> with Xultophy in Germany, and is threatening to withhold the product from the market there, as it did with the Tresiba constituent product. The news from the US for Tresiba is more encouraging however: the US <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novos-Tresiba-resubmission-accepted-in-US-357716" target="_new">FDA accepted for review</a> a Class II resubmission application for Tresiba in April, after a previous complete response letter requesting a cardiovascular outcomes trial that delayed the product there by several years. </p><p><p>
