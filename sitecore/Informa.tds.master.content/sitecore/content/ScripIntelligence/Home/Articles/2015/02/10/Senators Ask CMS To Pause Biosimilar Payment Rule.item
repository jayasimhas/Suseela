<p>A group of 20 US senators on Oct. 8 asked the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to postpone its proposed rule, which seeks to lump biosimilars referenced on the same innovator into the same Medicare Part B reimbursement rate, until after the FDA has completed its regulations and the pipeline and the market for the products are "safe and stable."</p><p>"We have heard concerns from patient and physician groups, pharmacy organizations, biosimilar manufacturers and other stakeholder organizations that reimbursement for biosimilar drugs may be important for tracking usage of these drugs for purposes of patient safety and research, medical innovation and increasing patient access to biosimilar treatments," the lawmakers said in a letter to Andy Slavitt, the current acting administrator of CMS.</p><p>The agency in July said it planned to use a single average sales price payment limit for biosimilars that are assigned to a specific healthcare common procedure coding system code &ndash; often referred to as J-codes for drugs.</p><p>"In general, this means that products that rely on a common reference product&rsquo;s biologics license application will be grouped into the same payment calculation," <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Group-Biosimilars-need-unique-CMS-reimbursement-codes-359392" target="_new">CMS said</a> in a July 15 <i>Federal Register</i> notice, which was posted online a few days earlier for public inspection.</p><p>The CMS proposal would largely affect biosimilars of Amgen's Epogen (epoetin alfa), Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Neupogen (filgrastim) &ndash; the latter of which was the reference for the very first US approval of a biosimilar, Sandoz's Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), which won the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">FDA's blessing on March 6</a>.</p><p>The senators' letter to Slavitt won quick praise from the Biosimilars Forum, which consists of a mixed bag of traditionally brand-name and generic firms &ndash; Allergan, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Coherus BioSciences, EMD Serono, Hospira, Merck, Pfizer, Samsung, Sandoz and Teva.</p><p>The group is insisting that each biosimilar of the same reference product should have its own unique Medicare claims code and payment amount.</p><p>"The House, Senate and countless stakeholders have now made their concerns clear that multiple biosimilars being grouped and issued the same J-code for Medicare reimbursement purposes could result in fewer biosimilars being introduced in the United States, and ultimately in fewer treatment options for health care professionals and patients," said Michael Werner, policy advisor for the Biosimilars Forum. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
