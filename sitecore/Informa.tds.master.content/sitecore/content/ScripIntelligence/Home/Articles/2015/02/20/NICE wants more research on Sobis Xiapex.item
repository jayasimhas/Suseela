<p>England's HTA institute NICE has revised its draft guidance on Swedish Orphan Biovitrum's Xiapex (collagenase clostridium histolyticum, CCH) for Dupuytren's disease after receiving comments from doctors and patients. Instead of declining to recommend the product altogether, NICE now wants to see more research on the product after responses to the consultation said the drug was an important new treatment option.</p><p>According to today's final appraisal determination: "Collagenase clostridium histolyticum is not recommended for treating Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, except in the context of research." NICE says this research should lead to robust evidence about the benefits of CCH compared to alternative treatments currently available: limited fasciectomy and percutaneous needle fasciotomy in people with moderate Dupuytren's contracture. Grey spots in current research include uncertainty over success rates, recurrence rates and effects on health-related quality of life, said the appraisal committee. </p><p>In November, the institute put out for consultation draft guidance saying no to the drug, claiming that CCH does not provide enough clinical benefit in relation to how much the NHS would have to pay for it. The drug costs &pound;650 per 0.9mg vial and the company estimates that a course of treatment would cost &pound;1248.00, assuming that there are 1.92 injections per patient and there is no vial sharing. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CCH compared with percutaneous needle fasciotomy was likely to be at least &pound;39,400 per QALY gained, said NICE. </p><p>However, responses to the consultation from clinicians and patients convinced NICE that the product has promise. However, because of the high levels of uncertainty about how effective the product is compared to other treatments, the institute could only recommend it in the context of research. Comments came from orthopedic surgeons, the British Association of Hand Therapists and the British Dupuytren's Society.</p><p>"The committee fully considered these comments along with their previous review of the evidence on CCH, which included evidence on the nature of Dupuytren's contracture, the views of people with the condition, those who represent them, and clinical experts. The committee understood that the condition can have a significant impact on a person's life, employment and social activities, and it acknowledged that CCH is the first pharmacological treatment to gain a marketing authorization for treating Dupuytren's contracture and that patients are keen to access new treatments," said Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE centre for health technology evaluation.</p><p>NICE expects to publish final guidance in April. The treatment is available on the Scottish NHS. In 2012 the Scottish Medicines Consortium approved it as an alternative to limited fasciectomy in adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture of moderate severity, with a palpable cord and up to two affected joints per hand, who are suitable for limited fasciectomy, but for whom percutaneous needle fasciotomy is not considered a suitable treatment option.</p><p>Dupuytren's disease occurs when collagen in the hand thickens and forms a nodule that can then form cords of tissue that can contract and pull the finger towards the palm. The fingers can become permanently bent as the disease progresses, and when fingers cannot be straightened, the condition is called Dupuytren's contracture. CCH is injected into the collagen chord and the collagenase enzymes in the treatment break down the collagen fibres that weaken the chords. A procedure to extend the finger can then be performed.</p><p>Over 2012/2013 there were some 18,000 hospital admissions for Dupuytren's contracture in England. Around 2m people in the UK have Dupuytren's disease, and most do not need treatment, says NICE.</p><p><p>
