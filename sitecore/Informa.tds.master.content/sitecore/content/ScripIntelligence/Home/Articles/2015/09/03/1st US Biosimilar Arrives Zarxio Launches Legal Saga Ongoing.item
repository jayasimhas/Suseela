<p>The day after Amgen was dealt another blow at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the company's failed attempt to keep Novartis unit Sandoz from launching its biosimilar Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the latter firm moved forward with putting the medicine on the U.S. market &ndash; the first biologic copycat available to Americans.</p><p>Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told <i>Scrip</i> the wholesale acquisition cost for Zarxio was set at $275.66 for the 300mcg dose and $438.98 for the 480mcg dose, or per single-use prefilled syringe.</p><p>"The pricing, at a 15% discount from the brand, is similar to what we've seen in Europe when the first biosimilar for a particular reference product is launched," New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Zarxio, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">approved on March 6</a> &ndash; the first biosimilar cleared by the FDA &ndash; is referenced on Amgen's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim), which was initially approved in the U.S. in 1991.</p><p>The FDA, however, last week said it wants to change Zarxio's nonproprietary name (INN) from filgrastim-sndz to filgrastim-bflm under a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-Letter-Word-FDAs-BiosimilarsBiologics-Distinction-360142" target="_new">proposed rule and new draft guidance</a>.</p><p>In fact, the FDA wants all biologics and biosimilars to carry a unique four-letter suffix as part of their INNs.</p><p>Regulators said the distinguishing "sndz" suffix designated at the time of Zarxio's licensure was "derived from the name of the license holder" &ndash; Sandoz. </p><p>The FDA said it wants the four-letter suffixes to be devoid of meaning.</p><p>Zarxio is indicated to treat patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy; those with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy; patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation; people undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy; and patients with severe chronic neutropenia &ndash; indications for which Neupogen is approved, although the brand-name drug won an additional use earlier this year as an agent to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation, or hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation syndrome.</p><p>"As the pioneer and global leader in biosimilars, Sandoz has maintained a commitment to bringing high-quality biosimilar medicines to patients and healthcare professionals around the world," said Richard Francis, global head at Sandoz. "With the launch of Zarxio, we look forward to increasing patient, prescriber and payer access to filgrastim in the U.S. by offering a high-quality, more affordable version of this important oncology medicine."</p><p>Ralph Boccia, medical director of the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders and chief medical officer for the International Oncology Network, said biosimilars can "help to fill an unmet need by providing expanded options, greater affordability and increased patient access to life-saving therapies."</p><p><b>Legal Dispute</b></p><p>Amgen has been in a legal battle with Sandoz since this past October &ndash; taking the Swiss biosimilar maker to court over what the California biotech giant said were violations of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the law that gave the FDA the clear authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>Specifically, Amgen claimed Sandoz had violated the disclosure and negotiation procedures outlined in the BPCIA &ndash; the patent dance &ndash; when it withheld its 351(k) biosimilars application and manufacturing information.</p><p>Amgen also asserted that Sandoz failed to provide proper notice that the biosimilar maker planned to launch its product as soon as it won FDA approval of Zarxio.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">On July 21</a>, a three-judge panel from the Federal Circuit, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">heard oral arguments in June</a>, ruled 2-1 that Sandoz and other biosimilar makers could opt out of the so-called patent dance and would not have to disclose their applications and manufacturing details if they chose to do so.</p><p>But in a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled in Amgen's favor, declaring that when a firm opts out of the patent dance, 180-day notice of commercial marketing under the BPCIA is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval &ndash; telling Sandoz it could not market Zarxio until after Sept. 2.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">On Aug. 20</a>, both sides submitted petitions seeking a rehearing by the full Federal Circuit, or en banc review.</p><p>Then, a week later, Amgen <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Files-Emergency-Motion-To-Block-Zarxios-Launch-360146" target="_new">filed an emergency motion</a> seeking an extension of the existing injunction, with the aim of keeping Zarxio off the market while the court considered the rehearing petitions and, if granted, issued a decision on the matter.</p><p>But the same three-judge panel that rendered the July decision <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Plea-To-Stop-Zarxio-Launch-Denied-Next-Move-360233" target="_new">denied Amgen's emergency motion on Sept. 2</a> &ndash; clearing the way for Sandoz to launch Zarxio. </p><p>Cerwinski noted that Amgen has other options &ndash; some the firm could have, but didn't, take earlier &ndash; like seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction from the district court on the grounds that Sandoz's biosimilar infringes the California biotech giant's patents covering Neupogen.</p><p>His Goodwin Procter colleague, Boston lawyer Elaine Herrmann Blais, also a partner at the firm's IP litigation group, said that with Zarxio's launch, Amgen's patent dispute against Sandoz may eventually be decided by a jury rather than by Judge Richard Seeborg of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, who in late <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-others-avoid-patent-dance-after-Sandoz-court-win-357429" target="_new">March ruled</a> the biosimilar maker did nothing wrong by not engaging in the disclosure and dispute resolution process with the innovator &ndash; declaring the Novartis firm's actions were within its rights.</p><p>The decision on whether the full Federal Circuit will rehear <i>Amgen v Sandoz</i> is pending.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
