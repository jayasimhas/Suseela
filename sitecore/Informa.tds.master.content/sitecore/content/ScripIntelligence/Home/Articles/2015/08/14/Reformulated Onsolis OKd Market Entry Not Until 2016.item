<p>There was some initial glee from investors on Aug. 13 on word the FDA had approved a reformulated version of BioDelivery Sciences International Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film) CII as a therapy to manage breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are opioid tolerant. </p><p>Shares of the company rose 3.8%, or 28 cents in morning trading.</p><p>But that excitement quickly vanished, likely because the drug won't enter the market before 2016.</p><p>Indeed, shares of the company fell as low as 9%, or 66 cents, before closing the day at $6.89, down 42 cents, or 5.75%.</p><p>BDSI gained approval of the original form of Onsolis in July 2009 &ndash; launching the drug in October of that year with its commercialization partner Meda, which initiated a full sales campaign for the drug.</p><p>But then the FDA imposed what the company called a "highly restrictive" risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) on the drug.</p><p>The Raleigh, N.C.-based firm complained later the lack of approved REMS programs for BDSI's direct competitors resulted in an unlevel playing field, which created an unfavorable selling environment for Onsolis.</p><p>The FDA in December 2011, however, imposed a class-wide REMS covering all transmucosal fentanyl products under a single risk management program, which BDSI said ended the disparity in prescribing requirements for Onsolis versus similar products and put the company's medicine in a better position to compete.</p><p>But then the FDA raised "appearance" issues with Onsolis.</p><p>Specifically, regulators identified the formation of microscopic crystals and a fading of the color in the mucoadhesive layer during the 24-month shelf life of the product. </p><p>While BDSI insisted those issues did not affect the underlying integrity, safety or performance of Onsolis, the FDA was worried the fading of the color, in particular, could potentially confuse patients.</p><p>So the firm pursued a new version of the drug.</p><p>But it's taken the company three years to get a reformulated Onsolis made and an application submitted to the FDA and finally approved &ndash; seven years after the original drug was given the agency's blessing.</p><p>In the meantime, Meda backed out of its deal with the company on Onsolis &ndash; returning the U.S. rights to BDSI this past January, along with the rights to seek marketing authorization in Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Meda, however, continues to retain the rights to the drug in the E.U., where it is marketed as Breakyl.</p><p>Onsolis is separately licensed by BDSI in Taiwan and South Korea. </p><p>Now, BDSI is searching for a new partner for Onsolis in the U.S.</p><p>"Although we have options for Onsolis, including commercializing it on our own, our current plan is to determine the value we can secure in a partnership with a company that has access to the target physician audience," said BDSI CEO Mark Sirgo.</p><p>He said the company has been engaged with a number of potential partners, "and with this approval, we can now proceed forward with those discussions in earnest." </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
