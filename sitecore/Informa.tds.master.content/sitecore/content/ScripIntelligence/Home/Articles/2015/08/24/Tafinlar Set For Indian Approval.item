<p>GlaxoSmithKline's melanoma therapy, Tafinlar (dabrafenib mesylate), appears to have inched closer to an approval in India after a key expert panel exempted it from local trial requirements. The product, though, will form part of Novartis' portfolio following the duo's global asset swap transaction last year.</p><p>Earlier this month a subject expert committee (SEC), which advises the Indian regulator on trial-related permissions as part of a layered approval process, recommended that dabrafenib mesylate be approved for import and marketing without clinical trials subject to the condition that GSK shall submit safety data in the first 20 patients post marketing to the committee for continued marketing of the product.</p><p>"The firm shall also submit the detail BRAF V600 mutational data on the 20 melanoma patients," the SEC (oncology and hematology) said at its meeting on Aug. 18.</p><p>The proposal was previously considered in early 2014, where the committee had sought data of BRAF V600 mutation in Indian patients, which the firm presented in the August meeting. </p><p>India currently follows a three-tier review process for clinical trials, under which applications are initially evaluated by specialized SECs. The recommendations of the SECs are then vetted by a technical review committee and finally cleared by an "apex committee."</p><p>GSK India told <i>Scrip</i> that dabrafenib is an orphan drug and metastatic melanoma is a rare disease in India. </p><p>"Moreover, there is no targeted therapy available in India for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Therefore, GSK had sought a clinical trial waiver for dabrafenib," the company said. </p><p>The SEC too referred to the product's orphan drug designation in the US and the fact that there is "no other option" for patients, who have this life-threatening disease, while recommending a trial waiver.</p><p>India currently provides for a waiver of clinical trials in the Indian population for new drugs, which have already been approved outside India, only in cases of "national emergency, extreme urgency, epidemics and for orphan drugs for rare diseases and drugs indicated for conditions/diseases for which there is no therapy." In case waivers are sought under any other category, the matter would be considered by the apex committee along with the recommendations of the technical committee.</p><p>GSK, though, offered no specific comment on whether the company has also sought approval of dabrafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor Mekinist (trametinib) in India. Tafinlar and Mekinist are already approved in the US and earlier this year the CHMP adopted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-to-face-PD1-competition-for-Mekinist-and-Tafinlar-combo-359618" target="_new">positive opinion</a> for the combination for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. </p><p>GSK confirmed that dabrafenib will form part of the Novartis portfolio, in line with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">global transaction</a> where Novartis is to divest its vaccines business to GSK, while GSK would transfer its oncology products to Novartis. The two companies are also to combine their over-the-counter and consumer healthcare businesses in a joint venture, though the business of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, a listed Indian subsidiary of GSK, is not to be contributed to the venture. </p><p>Last year, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indian-competition-regulator-clears-Novartis-GSK-transactions-355843" target="_new">approved</a> the GSK-Novartis transaction. The CCI order then noted that out of the 11 oncology products being acquired by Novartis, only four were currently sold in India - Tykerb (lapatinib), Revolade(eltrombopag), Votrient (pazopanib) and Hycamtin (topotecan). </p><p>India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had, earlier this month, approved GSK Consumer Private Ltd's proposal to acquire Novartis' OTC division in India.</p>
