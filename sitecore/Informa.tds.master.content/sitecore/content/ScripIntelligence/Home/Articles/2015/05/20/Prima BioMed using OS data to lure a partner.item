<p><p>Prima BioMed is hoping final overall survival data for its CVac immunotherapy will help the Australian biotech find a partner for the compound. </p><p>The company announced this week that CVac provided an overall survival benefit of 16 months in the Phase II CAN-003 trial in patients with ovarian cancer. </p><p>In a group of 20 second remission patients, those given standard of care achieved a median overall survival of 25.53 months, while those patients given CVac have not yet achieved a median overall survival after 42 months and close of the trial. </p><p>The data is consistent with the results that the company released in May 2014 showing that CVax provided a progression free survival of 12.91 months compared with 4.9 months for those on standard of care. </p><p>"The positive effect of cellular therapies and the high quality of life of treated patients support the potential for further developing CVac under license through an industry partner," said Prima's CEO Marc Voigt. </p><p>CVac was previously the lead compound of the company, but in October 2014, Prima <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Prima-acquires-French-biopharma-Immutep-354296" target="_new">acquired Immutep</a> and its lead compound IMP321. A highly potent T-cell immunostimulatory factor, IMP321, is currently in a Phase II/III trial as a treatment for breast cancer, a Phase I/II study for melanoma, and Phase I trials in pancreatic cancer and renal cell cancer.</p><p>Prima has halted development of CVac and has been shopping around for a partner to continue development since February 2015. </p><p><p><p>
