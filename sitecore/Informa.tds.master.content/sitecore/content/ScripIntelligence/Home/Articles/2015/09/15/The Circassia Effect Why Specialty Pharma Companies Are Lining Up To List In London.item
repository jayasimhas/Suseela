<p>With debate ongoing as to whether biotech stocks are in a 'bubble' that could burst imminently, or if bullish valuations of early stage assets are completely justified, two companies are gambling on the positive investment climate in the UK by announcing plans for initial public offerings (IPOs) on the London Stock Exchange. </p><p>Shield Therapeutics, which is awaiting European marketing review for its novel oral iron replacement drug <i>Feraccru</i> (ST10, ferric maltol), said a week ago that it <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shield-plans-110m-London-IPO-to-fund-Ferinject-challenger-360288" target="_new">planned to raise</a> up to &pound;110m in an IPO.</p><p>This week saw Acacia Pharma Ltd. filing its intention to float on the LSE. A source close to the deal confirmed the company wanted to raise up to &pound;150m to fund its lead supportive care products through to commercialization. </p><p>"When we established the company, the only route was a trade sale. There were no other options," Dr Julian Gilbert, CEO and founder of Acacia, told <i>Scrip</i>. "That's obviously changed over the past few years. The opportunity to raise public money has become real again, and that &ndash; alongside the development stage of our pipeline &ndash; has given us the opportunity to transform ourselves from a late-stage clinical company to a specialty pharma organization. That is fully achievable for us and now there is capital out there enabling us to do that."</p><p>Acacia is developing APD421, for the management of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which in Phase III trials with an NDA filing expected in the second half of 2016. It also has three Phase II-stage products: APD403 for the management of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), APD515 for the treatment of xerostomia in advanced cancer and APD209 for the treatment of cancer cachexia. </p><p>Acacia's story sounds very similar to that of Shield Therapeutics, whose CEO Carl Sterrit told <i>Scrip</i> that while his company had always been keen to conduct an IPO, it only became viable this year. Shield is also a specialty pharma company with assets approaching the market.</p><p>Acacia's Gilbert added: "Over last 12-24 months, probably starting with Circassia, there has been a lot of support for the sector in London, and a number of floats. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Circassia-puts-money-where-mouth-is-IPO-floats-at-top-price-350624" target="_new">Circassia demonstrated</a> that there was an opportunity to raise fairly substantial amounts of cash from a group of investors that were both generalist and specialist."</p><p>However, not everybody is convinced that the upswing in investor sentiment in London means that good assets are finally able to get the attention they deserve.</p><p>"Like last week's IPO, Acacia has an unpartnered product in Phase III. My interpretation of this recent surge is desperation, rather than bubble," said Andy Smith, chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest, and the typically forthright author of <i>Scrip's</i> regular Stockwatch column. "What the companies are saying is, 'We can't find a big pharma commercial partner (because their product is tiny and/or already has generic competition), or VCs to fund the risk to see if the product is more than a tiny permanently loss-making product, so we'll fob it off on those less sophisticated public market investors.' The problem is that there are still some generalists who might be pulled in, but with a receding US IPO and broad stock market, there are fewer by the day," he warned.</p><p>Despite seeking a listing in London, Acacia intends to establish a commercial presence to market its products in the US itself in the US, and partner them out in other territories. "For our products, the US is the largest market; from a specialty pharma perspective it is the most mature. We don't want to dilute the focus of the management team by looking at other markets, so we'll look for partners elsewhere."</p><p>JP Morgan is acting as global coordinator, sponsor and sole book runner for the potential IPO. Co-head of its EMEA healthcare group, Cathrin Petty, told <i>Scrip</i> that with a "clear, de-risked route to commercialization, [Acacia] is a straightforward story that investors will find easy to understand."</p><p>According to Petty, "Circassia broke the ceiling and showed companies that you can have ambitions to commercialize products yourself."</p><p>She believes that the recent clutch of IPOs in London is a result of the UK finally showing that it can support a fully-fledged life science business community. "The government has shown a serious commitment to support the life science sector, and investors are beginning to show a willingness to support companies on a long term basis. So with the UK creating the infrastructure, and with the right financial environment slotting into place, we are at the initial stages of building a sustainable healthcare sector in the UK, and we want to help that continue."</p>
