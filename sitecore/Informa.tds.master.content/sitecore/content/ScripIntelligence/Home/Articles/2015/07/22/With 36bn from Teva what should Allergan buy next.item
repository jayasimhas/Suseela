<p>Allergan left all options on the table in terms of the types of deals that the ever-growing company will pursue with its $36bn in after-tax proceeds from the $40.5bn sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.</p><p>Some of the money will pay down debt related to past mergers and acquisitions, but Allergan plans to spend a greater share of the money on additional M&A with a focus on expanding its seven existing therapy areas and its geographic reach, adding products in new diseases, and executing "transformational" deals. Investors sent Allergan's stock up 6.1% to close at a new all-time high of $326.98 on 27 July based on the likelihood that the company will use the influx of cash from Teva to transform itself again. </p><p>Indeed, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders noted during a conference call to discuss the Teva deal with analysts that anyone who has owned stock in the company since September 2007 when former CEO, now chairman, Paul Bisaro took the helm has seen their shares rise more than 900% in value.</p><p>Allergan's name says all one needs to know about the company's M&A strategy. The name has changed twice since 2012 when Watson bought Actavis and took the Actavis name to promote its larger global generics presence. Then Actavis bought Allergan and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">took the latter company's</a> name earlier this year to emphasize its focus on revenue growth through brand name products. </p><p>In that regard, the fact that Allergan sold its generic medicines &ndash; a business that enabled its growth through M&A &ndash; is not so unexpected. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">deal with Teva</a>, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, will substantially increase Allergan's cash reserves for building a bigger brand-name pharma company.</p><p>"We want to invest for growth &#8230; we will continue to be selective about adding R&D programs to build our long-term growth, but our main focus is going to be on accretive bolt-on and accretive transformational deals," Mr Saunders said.</p><p>Transactions primarily will focus on ophthalmology, aesthetics/dermatology, central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Womens-Health-a-priority-for-new-Allergan-357922" target="_new">women's health</a>/urology, anti-infectives and biosimilars.</p><p><b>Multitude of options</b></p><p>In a survey conducted by ISI Evercore analyst Umer Raffat, investors cited a combination with Pfizer or acquisitions of other big pharma and large biotech giants &ndash; Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline and maybe even AstraZeneca &ndash; as favored transactions for Allergan, but each of those companies seem more likely to acquire than to be acquired at the moment. However, an agreement with any of those players would qualify as a "transformational" deal.</p><p>And when it comes to Biogen, that company was punished by its investors last week for slow sales growth as well as a lack of deals to fill the development pipeline. Slow sales growth and the early stage for much of Biogen's pipeline may be deal breakers for Allergan.</p><p>BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Vertex Pharmaceuticals &ndash; also cited in the ISI Evercore investor survey &ndash; seem unlikely as well. While Allergan already markets Zenpep (pancrelipase) to treat a pancreatic condition in cystic fibrosis and other patients, the company has relatively little experience marketing therapies for orphan indications like those targeted by BioMarin, Alexion and even cystic fibrosis-focused Vertex.</p><p>Some others mentioned by investors responding to the ISI Evercore survey &ndash; Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes, Shire and Anacor Pharmaceuticals &ndash; seem like more obvious strategic fits for Allergan, including a size that makes them easier to digest than a big pharma like AbbVie or Bristol-Myers.</p><p>Acadia is working on the late-stage drug Nuplazid (pimavanserin) for Parkinson's disease psychosis, which could be marketed alongside Allergan's Namenda (memantine) for Alzheimer's disease. Perhaps Allergan could finally get the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nuplazid-NDA-delayed-again-Acadia-CEO-steps-down-357238" target="_new">long-delayed</a> new drug application (NDA) for Nuplazid in shape for submission to the US FDA.</p><p>Speaking of Allergan's CNS portfolio, growth-focused Alkermes has a stake in approved schizophrenia drugs and is <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alkermes-claims-ALKS-8700-success-third-pipeline-win-in-2015-356633" target="_new">advancing drug candidates</a> for schizophrenia and depression as well as diabetes and multiple sclerosis. </p><p>Allergan already made a recent addition to its CNS pipeline with the $560m-plus purchase of Naurex, which is developing novel NMDA receptor modulators to treat depression. The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-paying-560m-for-Naurex-stays-quiet-on-rumored-generics-sale-to-Teva-359627" target="_new">deal was announced</a> a day before Allergan revealed the Teva generics transaction.</p><p>Shire has a portfolio of specialty medicines for gastrointestinal, CNS and rare diseases. Marketed products include Intuniv for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Resolor for chronic constipation and Vyvanse for binge eating disorder. The company's pipeline includes <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-preparing-for-all-outcomes-as-it-awaits-lifitegrast-approval-359598" target="_new">lifitegrast</a> for dry eye disease, a competitor for Restasis (cyclosporine), which is one of Allergan's biggest products. Other Shire development programs are SHP465 for ADHD, SHP631 for somatic and CNS manifestations of the rare Hunter syndrome, and SHP625 for cholestatic liver disease.</p><p>Anacor recently had a big <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Anacor-wins-big-in-dermatitis-market-of-many-millions-359415" target="_new">Phase III win</a> with lead drug candidate crisaborole in atopic dermatitis, which fits into two of Allergan's preferences for M&A targets: crisaborole is 1) a late-stage program and 2) fits in Allergan's high-value dermatology/aesthetics therapeutic area anchored by the blockbuster wrinkle-reducer and migraine-preventer Botox.</p><p><b>Other suggestions</b></p><p>Not that Allergan's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Actavis-CEO-Saunders-staying-put-as-Allergan-deal-nears-close-357214" target="_new">deal-savvy CEO</a> or his prolific business development team needs any help, but here are some more suggestions for the company's M&A considerations: </p><p>*The Medicines Company's (MDCO's) anticoagulant &ndash; although soon to have <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Medicines-loses-Angiomax-patent-fight-at-Federal-Circuit-359239" target="_new">generic competition</a> &ndash; Angiomax (bivalirudin) and recently approved antiplatelet drug <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Medicines-coronary-angioplasty-drug-Kengreal-359070" target="_new">Kangreal</a> (cangrelor) could boost Allergan's position in cardiovascular disease, since the company's only CV drug is Bystolic (nebivolol) for high blood pressure. MDCO also has a portfolio of hospital-based medicines and anti-infectives, including the antibiotic <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medicines-single-dose-ABSSSI-drug-Orbactiv-OKd-353227" target="_new">Orbactiv</a> (oritavancin), the latter of which would fit in to Allergan's antibiotics portfolio that grew following the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-builds-antibiotic-presence-with-675m-Durata-deal-354319" target="_new">acquisition</a> of Durata Therapeutics in 2014.</p><p>*Depomed is fighting off an <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-poisons-Horizons-plans-359414" target="_new">unwanted buyout offer</a> from Horizon Pharma, but the company's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-paying-1.05bn-for-Janssens-US-Nucynta-rights-356173" target="_new">CNS portfolio</a> may be of interest to Allergan, which would be in a position to offer more stock than cash to Depomed shareholders.</p><p>*Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and Allergan co-market <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ironwood-raises-175m-debt-to-launch-Linzess-338873" target="_new">Linzess</a> (linaclotide) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation, so the larger company could buy the smaller firm to end profit-sharing for the drug. Ironwood has a pipeline of other IBS and constipation drugs in development, including <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Synergy-rockets-on-Phase-III-constipation-data-359029" target="_new">plecanatide</a>, whose development is being led by Synergy Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>*Antibiotics: Cempra has a macrolide antibiotic called solithromycin with Phase III data expected before the end of 2015 in community-acquired pneumonia with a second Phase III program under way in urinary tract infections. Likewise, Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals has its broad-spectrum antibiotic eravacycline in Phase III for urinary infections and intra-abdominal infections. <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novel-antibiotics-from-Tetraphase-and-Cempra-highlighted-at-ECCMID-358123" target="_new">Both drugs</a> are being tested in oral and intravenous formulations and both companies check two important boxes: 1) their assets are in late stages of development and 2) they fit in Allergan's anti-infectives therapeutic area.</p><p>*Biosimilars: Since Allergan did not sell its biosimilar business to Teva along with its small molecule generics, the company may be interested in adding programs or capabilities in this area if they don't clash too much with its <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-partners-with-Watson-to-pursue-new-biotech-frontier-of-biosimilars-325039" target="_new">biosimilar partnership</a> with Amgen. Oncobiologics just <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Oncobiologics-raises-31m-for-biosimilars-RaNA-Ra-SutroVax-add-VC-cash-359633" target="_new">raised $31m</a> to advance its biosimilars and the East Coast company has its own production facilities. Both Oncobiologics and Epirus Pharmaceuticals have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Epirus-Polpharma-partner-on-biosimilars-in-some-markets-359426" target="_new">emerging market partnerships</a> that could expand Allergan's global presence and biologic expertise.</p><p>The reality is, there are plenty of companies for Allergan to choose from and the company is just as likely to buy a small, single-asset company like Cempra as it is to buy a multi-asset player like MDCO. </p><p>And given the increasing size of its acquisitions &ndash; from Watson's Actavis buy to Actavis's Forest Laboratories and Allergan purchases to the sale of its generics business to Teva &ndash; Allergan is just as likely to execute another surprising deal, such as the acquisition of biologics developer Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>In fact, Regeneron's not such a bad idea either, since its top marketed product is the blockbuster age-related macular degeneration (AMD) therapy Eylea (ranibizumab) and it just won FDA approval for the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) &ndash; the hottest asset in the cardiovascular space. Never mind Regeneron's stratospheric stock price, a deal would boost Allergan's biologics knowledge and give the company's key ophthalmology franchise and one-drug CV portfolio an immediate surge in sales.</p><p>With $36bn in its pocket, Allergan's M&A possibilities aren't endless, but the money certainly gives the company some leeway for creative dealmaking.</p><p><p><p><p>
