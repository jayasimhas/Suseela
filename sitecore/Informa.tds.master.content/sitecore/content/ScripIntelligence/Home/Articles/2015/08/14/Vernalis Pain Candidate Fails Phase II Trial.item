<p>With the failure of Vernalis's lead product candidate from its CNS development portfolio, the UK firm is ending all investment in its new chemical entity (NCE) pipeline and is turning its focus fully towards the upcoming US launch of its extended-release codeine-based cough cold product Tuzistra XR.</p><p>Results from a Phase II proof-of-concept study of V158866, its fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for neuropathic pain, showed that it failed to meet its pain-reduction primary endpoint.</p><p>Vernalis claims that consistent with its strategy of becoming a commercial business, it will not make any further investment in V158866, but will partner the product if the opportunity arises. A search of Citeline's Pharmaprojects database revealed that there are now no longer any ongoing development programs for FAAH inhibitors.</p><p>CEO Ian Garland said: "The goal of this study was to identify a therapeutic setting for this program. Its completion ends the investment in our NCE pipeline and we aim to partner the remaining unpartnered programs to realize value where possible."</p><p>The key focus of the organization is "the transition of Vernalis to a commercial company, with the forthcoming launch of Tuzistra XR for the US prescription market, which is progressing as planned ".</p><p>In April this year, the US FDA approved Tuzistra XR, which was developed using Tris Pharma's LiquiXR technology, Tuzistra is an extended-release oral suspension combination of codeine and chlorpheniramine, and the only codeine based extended-release oral suspension cough-cold treatment in a US prescription cough cold market which sees 30-35 million prescriptions written each year and is estimated to be worth in excess of $3bn, according to Vernalis. The company believes that short-acting codeine based therapies currently available account for around 38% of the market.</p><p>Vernalis is working to get Tuzistra XR onto the US market in September this year, ahead of the 2015-16 cough cold season.</p><p>"While the market is highly fragmented and dominated by generics, we believe a significant opportunity remains to capture market share with innovative, more patient friendly, extended-release formulations and 'de-genericize' the market," said Rx Securities analysts. "We forecast the drug to achieve peak sales of $200m per annum."</p><p>Vernalis has four additional cough cold products in active development with Tris Pharma, two of which have already achieved proof-of-concept. Vernalis has US rights to Tris's extended release technology and resulting products.</p><p>With regards to the failure of V158866, the analysts said that they viewed the news "as disappointing (positive results could have led to a lucrative licensing deal), [however] we had treated the product as a free option in our valuation."</p><p>Vernalis shares slipped 4% in morning trading (Aug. 20, 2015).</p>
