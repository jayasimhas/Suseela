<p>Sanofi is pushing ahead with its sugar clinics play in India in collaboration with the Apollo group &ndash; the first such effort anywhere in the world where the French multinational is engaged with a leading healthcare provider.</p><p>Apollo Sugar Clinics Ltd (ASCL), in which Sanofi holds a stake alongside India's Apollo group, is an innovative, single specialty diabetes and endocrine healthcare service provider. </p><p>ASCL has now announced its debut in Mumbai with the opening of four neighborhood care delivery centers, taking its total tally up to 38 clinics across India. It expects to add an additional two centers shortly. </p><p>"We promise to hand-hold Mumbaikars [people of Mumbai] in managing their diabetes by delivering proven and internationally acclaimed standards of care at affordable price points, thus helping improve their quality of life by preventing and reducing complications," Gagan Bhalla, CEO, Apollo Sugar Clinics, said at a press briefing on Oct.7, in Mumbai.</p><p>Mumbai has around 1.1m diabetics and roughly half a million pre-diabetics and an estimated INR4bn ($61.6m) is spent annually on medications for diabetes in the city, Bhalla said. </p><p>ASCL claims to have interacted with more than 150,000 patients already.</p><p>Sanofi's collaboration is being tracked with interest by competition, with some industry experts calling it the "next best step" to the French multinational integrating its operations vertically to control the entire <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Why-Novo-may-need-to-watch-Sanofis-Indian-sugar-clinics-play-354320" target="_new">value chain</a> from point of diagnosis to treatment, prescription and sale of medicines, with the scope of servicing a newly diagnosed patient across their entire life. </p><p>Dr Shailesh Ayyangar, managing director, India and vice president, South Asia, Sanofi, told <i>Scrip</i> that in Apollo the company has a partner that "understands care like nobody else" and a group that comes with enormous experience &ndash; "a full spread" across the length and breadth of India and the vision to reach out to the "last person suffering from diabetes" in the country.</p><p>"If together we can make a difference in the lives of patients along with clinicians, I think it's a terrific combination. This kind of model doesn't exist anywhere in the world and it's very important for us to learn as we go along," he said. </p><p>India's Apollo group is one of the leading integrated healthcare providers in Asia. Apollo Hospitals, which started as a single 150-bed hospital, currently operates around 9,200 beds across 64 hospitals. Other companies specialize in insurance, pharmacy, consultancy, clinics and other key touch points of the ecosystem.</p><p>Ayyangar, though, clarified that physicians operating in the Apollo Sugar clinics are under "no obligation" to use any Sanofi medicines and that the decision to use a particular medication is entirely left to the judgment of the clinician.</p><p>"Sanofi medications are world class and used across the length and breadth of the country. But there is no obligation on the part of Apollo Sugar clinics to given preferential treatment to Sanofi's products," Ayyangar told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><h2>Resources</h2><p>The Sanofi India boss also indicated that there is no constraint on infusing additional resources for the sugar clinics, if required. </p><p>Last year, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared Sanofi's plans to acquire 20% of the total equity shareholding and exercise certain rights, in relation to management of Apollo Sugar Clinics. Sanofi can also raise its shareholding to 26%, an option that can be exercised during a certain period of time, CCI's approval note said.</p><p>"When it is required in the future, Apollo and Sanofi will work hand in hand to bring in any amount of resources required. We are working practically as two sides of the same coin," Ayyangar said.</p><p>He also added that Sanofi comes in with its deep knowledge on patient support programs, clinical research activities, understanding patient pathways and putting together those systems and processes that will make the patient experience unique. </p><p>"That's where our real resources are."</p><p>The partners are expected to draw on synergies of Sanofi's existing Indian patient support program, Saath 7. The program has certified ''diabetes counsellors,'' who under the instruction of treating physicians, provide personalized consultation through home visits. It is active across several Indian cities and counsellors provide care to patients in areas such as device demonstration, customized meal planning, foot care advice and even work as an ''extended hand'' of the doctor providing information on diabetes management to patients on Sanofi's Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA] injection).</p><p>Bhalla also added that ASCL is a "capital sufficient" company and is not really looking for additional capital infusion. </p><p>"Both parents &ndash;Apollo and Sanofi &ndash;have invested significantly in Apollo Sugar and we have enough capital to scale up. The velocity [of expansion] is proportional to the accuracy of the model," he said.</p><p>ASCL is also looking at expanding in the Middle East. It already has a clinic in Muscat as part of its network.</p><p>On Oct.8, Apollo Health and Lifestyle Limited (AHLL), a subsidiary of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, informed Indian bourses that it plans to invest up to INR5bn to fund the growth of the business going forward. AHLL, which operates a network of primary care and specialty care formats across India including Apollo Sugar, also said that it expects to invite private equity investors to participate in this growth opportunity.</p>
