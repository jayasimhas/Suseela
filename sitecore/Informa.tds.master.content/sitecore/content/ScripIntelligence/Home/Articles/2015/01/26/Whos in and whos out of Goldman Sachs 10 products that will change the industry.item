<p>Goldman Sachs has updated its annual list of the ten products that it believes can transform the industry, dropping six products from its 2014 list, but keeping the faith in immune-oncology as the largest opportunity for pharma. </p><p>Opdivo (nivolumab), ABT-199, palbociclib, and evolocumab remain in this year's list, and are joined by daratumumab, LCZ696, RPC1063, lampalizumab, a cystic fibrosis combo and CAR-T (see below for full details). </p><p>Out are Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab, which was approved for melanoma last year), and its high-risk BACE inhibitor, as well as Novartis serelaxin (on the back of its FDA complete response letter) and Roche's MetMab (disappointing Phase III data). Also gone, but still in focus for the analysts, are Roche's anti-PD-L1 antibody and Amgen/ UCB's osteoporosis treatment romosozumab, which are due to report key data this year and next respectively.</p><p>The analysts say: "We believe these drugs have outsized reward potential and are not adequately recognized in current consensus forecasts, owing to significant inherent risk of the development programs or under-appreciated commercial opportunities. If successful, we think these drugs could transform not only the individual stocks, but the sector as a whole."</p><p>Five of this year's products are due to launch by mid-year, they note, meaning that we will not have to wait too long for a proper insight into their commercial potential. The Swiss companies Roche and Novartis are over-represented in the table, with two products each. </p><table><h2>Goldman Sachs' Top Ten:</h2><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company(ies)</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Expected launch</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Peak sales ($bn)</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ABT-199</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AbbVie / Roche</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CLL, NHL</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2016</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Opdivo</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>daratumumab/CD38 antibody*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Genmab / Johnson & Johnson</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>multiple myeloma</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2016</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$4.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>LCZ696*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Novartis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>chronic heart failure</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3-5.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>palbociclib</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ER+/HER2- breast cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer,</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$5.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>RPC1063*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Receptos</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>relapsing multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2018 </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$4.1</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>lampalizumab*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Roche </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>dry AMD</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2017</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>evolocumab</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Amgen</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>high cholesterol </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>lumacaftor plus ivacaftor combo*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Vertex</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>cystic fibrosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2015 2Q</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>CAR-T immunotherapies*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Novartis </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ALL, CLL, DLBCL</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2016</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.0</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td colspan="5"><p>*New entries</p></td></tr><p>Source: Goldman Sachs</p></table><p><p><p>Abbott/Roche's Bcl2 inhibitor <b>ABT-199</b> has the potential to change the treatment dynamics for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the analysts say, despite Imbruvica (ibrutinib) already having established a foothold. This is based on its potential for cure , and its potential for combination use, although it may be let down by its side-effect profile. </p><p>BMS's anti-PD1 <b>Opdivo</b> is highlighted for its backbone potential in cancer immunotherapy. Despite strong competition with Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca all fielding rivals, Goldman Sachs believes, BMS has a significant lead in late-stage clinical trials with the added benefit of internal follow-on IO products that can be used in combination. </p><p>Overall, immune&ndash;oncology represents the largest opportunity for the industry, they believe, and Novartis's lead <b>CAR-T</b> cell immunotherapy is also highlighted as the current leader in this particular area. However, they note the current debates over the logistical challenged for such personalized cell therapies (with reference to the disappointment of Dendreon's Provenge) and possible safety concerns, including the risk of cytokine release syndrome. </p><p>Novartis's other offering, the neprilysin inhibitor <b>LCZ696,</b> is described as a breakthrough in chronic heart failure that is "perceived as one of the most important innovations in cardiology of the past decade" and likely to become a new standard of care. </p><p>Other novel cancer therapies on the list are Pfizer's <b>palbociclib</b> (Ibrance), a first-in-class selective inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6 kinases being developed for breast and other cancers, that has a roughly two-year head start over similar products from Lilly and Novartis. And Johnson & Johnson's fist-in-class anti-CD 38 antibody <b>daratumumab</b> which has breakthrough therapy and fast-track status that also put it a couple years ahead of its competitors in multiple myeloma &ndash; this is another product that has the potential to change the standard of care.</p><p>Minnow Receptos could have a major hit on its hand with the sphingosine-1 phosphate 1 receptor modulator <b>RPC1063</b> for relapsing multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. This product is furthest on the horizon on the Goldman Sach's list, but 2015 could be a value-creating year for the company, given expected colitis data plus the chance for partnerships. </p><p>Launch of Roche's <b>lampalizumab</b>, a monoclonal antibody against factor D, is not expected until 2017, but it is a possible first-in-class treatment for dry AMD, an unmet medical need. Questions remain though of its commercial potential but Goldman Sachs believes that the opportunity for dry AMD could be as big as wet AMD and lampalizumab could enjoy the first-mover advantage. </p><p>Amgen's evolocumab and Regeneron/Sanofi's <b>alirocumab</b> each represent a $3bn peak sales opportunity in a $6-10bn category, Goldman Sachs say. Both PCSK9 inhibitors are set for launch this year to reduce cholesterol and are likely to benefit from the results of the IMPROVE-IT study pf Merck & Co's Vytorin combination (exzetimibe plus simvastatin) which might support a broader label before outcomes studies. However, questions remain about the market size and pricing considering the availability of generic statins. </p><p>Finally, Vertex's combination of its currently marketed cystic fibrosis treatment Kalydeco (<b>ivacaftor</b>) and its investigational corrector product VX-809 (<b>lumacaftor</b>). The dual therapy is hoped to tackle a broader CF patient population than the 6-8% of patients with CFTR gating and R117H mutations addressed by Kalydeco. While the analysts say FDA approval is largely anticipated by investors, there is still some debate over pricing. </p><p>The analysts note that this list includes five products from pharma and five from biotech. "As pharma and biotech business models grow more similar, we see the sectors converging. Pharma is likely to enter a period of growth from diminishing patent cliffs and increasing revenues from high margin drugs, in our view. While expectations have clearly moved up for certain pipeline drugs (PD-1), we think analysts' estimates for many biotech drugs (housed in Pharma) remain conservative and have room for upside."</p><p><p>
