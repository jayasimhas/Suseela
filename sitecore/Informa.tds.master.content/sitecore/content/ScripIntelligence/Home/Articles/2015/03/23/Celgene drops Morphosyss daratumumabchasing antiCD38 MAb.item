<p>Less than two years after laying out more than $150m in upfront payments and stock purchase, Celgene has handed back rights to Morphosys's anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody MOR202, which is under development for multiple myeloma. Morphosys said it was committed to continuing development of the product.</p><p>Celgene <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-licenses-MorphoSys-antibody-for-up-to-818m-344433" target="_new">gained rights to MOR202 in June 2013</a>, in a deal that was potentially worth up to $818m (&euro;628m). </p><p>The German company said the ongoing Phase I/IIa trial in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, which it is sponsoring, will continue as planned, with data to be released at a medical conference this year. However, data from this trial have been promised for some time, and delivery has been delayed more than once.</p><p>As far back as the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January 2011, Morphosys had been promising the Phase I/II data on multiple myeloma would be released in 2012; but later that year it said the data would come in 2013. But, having missed the American Society of Hematology meeting in December 2013, in late 2013 it said may present the data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in the first half of 2014. However, by early 2014 Celgene was then promising the data in the second half of 2014, and both companies went on to say they expected to publish the results at the 2014 ASH conference in December. Now data are promised for 2015. </p><p>The trial contains cohorts in which treatment is combined with Celgene's lenalidomide and pomalidomide, and these combinations will remain after Celgene pulls out. "Based on preclinical data, we see significant promise in combining MOR202 with Celgene's lenalidomide and pomalidomide in clinical trials which will commence soon," commented Arndt Schottelius, Morphosys's chief development officer.</p><p>MOR202 is playing catch-up to Johnson & Johnson/Genmab's daratumumab, another anti-CD38 MAb that is in Phase III trials and which has been granted breakthrough therapy status by the US FDA. That product is in several studies both as monotherapy and in various combinations, including with lenalidomide. Earlier this year Goldman Sachs analysts nominated daratumumab as one of 10 products expected to change the industry: they predicted it would launch in 2016 and achieve peak annual sales of $4bn.</p><p>The termination of the co-development and co-promotion agreement prompted an update on Morphosys's financial guidance for 2015. Revenues will be higher than expected &ndash;&euro;101-106m instead of &euro;58-63m &ndash; because deferred revenues from the original deal will be fully recognized, and Celgene will make a one-off payment for 2015 development costs. </p><p>R&D costs on the other hand will be higher, at &euro;56-63m versus &euro;48-58m as originally envisaged, and will include MOR202 development costs for the rest of the year. Earnings before interest and tax are projected to be &euro;9-16m; previously a loss before interest and tax of &euro;20-30m had been forecast.</p>
