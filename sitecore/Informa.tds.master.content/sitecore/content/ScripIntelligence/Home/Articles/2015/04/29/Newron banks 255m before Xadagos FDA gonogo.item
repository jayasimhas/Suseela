<p>With its stock riding close to a seven-year high, and well ahead of an FDA decision on its partnered Parkinson's disease drug, Xadago (safinamide), CNS specialist Newron has raised $25.5m gross from an international group of institutional investors. That gives the Milan-based company around $23-24m to put into its unpartnered earlier-stage pipeline, assuming placing discounts of 5-8%.</p><p>Newron's timing looks good: Two years ago its stock was trading at around CHF8 ($9), a year ago at CHF15, and most recently at around CHF30. Newron sold the new tranche of stock at CHF28.80 per share, just 3% below its closing price on April 27. Its next potential major stock-revaluing date is in December 2015, the (PDUFA) date for safinamide's New Drug Application, and that is probably distant enough for the new investors not to feel that they are being hung straight over a cliff.</p><p>Most of Newron's value reflects the progress of Xadago, its most developed drug. In February 2014, the European Commission approved Xadago as an adjunct to other Parkinson's disease agents in treating uncontrolled mid- t -late-stage disease patients. </p><p>However, Newron receives only milestone and royalties on safinamide from its global commercial partner, Zambon Pharmaceuticals. When and if the drug reaches the US market, receipts to Newron will be thinner still, since Zambon needs a partner for US commercialization of the drug. The latest fundraising is designed to propel Newron beyond its dependence on safinamide and Zambon. </p><p>The net proceeds will be used to progress sarizotan, a drug that Newron has licensed from Merck KGaA, beyond phase II in patients with Rett Syndrome (a rare and serious genetic neurodevelopmental disorder), and to begin a Phase II trial of NW-3509 in schizophrenia in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>
