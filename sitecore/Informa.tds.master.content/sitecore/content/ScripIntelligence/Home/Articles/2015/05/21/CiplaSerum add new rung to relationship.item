<p>This could be read as growing pre-nuptial synergy between Cipla and the Serum Institute of India. Or maybe the duo's next step in their "relationship" is purely an extension of a previous alliance and one which will see Cipla step up its indirect interest in vaccines play to the Indian market. </p><p>Cipla, announced on 27 May that it had signed a pact to exclusively market Serum's flu vaccine Nasovac-S in India. Under the deal, Serum will develop and manufacture the vaccine, with Cipla handling the marketing.</p><p>Cipla's managing director and global CEO, Subhanu Saxena, said that the partnership was a significant step towards making preventative healthcare accessible to a large number of Indians through Cipla's strong countrywide salesforce. The Mumbai-based Cipla is known to have previously co-marketed Influvac, an influenza vaccine, with Solvay Pharmaceuticals for about year.</p><p>Last year, Cipla and Serum joined hands to provide affordable pediatric vaccines <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-Serum-ally-for-Europe-vaccine-push-355169" target="_new">in Europe</a>. However, earlier this year, a frenzy over a potential combination of the two firms broke out when Serum's chair, Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, underscored in a television interview that while Serum would never be up for sale, there may be a small chance that the firm <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-valuations-mar-Cipla-Serum-walk-down-the-aisle-356590%5d" target="_new">could merge</a> with a company like Cipla. </p><h2>Nasovac</h2><p>Nasovac-S, a trivalent vaccine that offers protection against H1N1, H3N2 and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus, is administered through the nasal route. It increases indirect protection through herd immunity and protects against drifted viruses. </p><p>The product has been developed by Serum based on the Southern Hemisphere 2015 recommendations by the World Health Organization &ndash; its constitution could change as per the WHO's recommendation each season.</p><p>Earlier this year Serum had told <i>Scrip</i> that had to destroy 184,000 doses of its trivalent vaccine against H1N1, H3N2 and B/Brisbane virus at the end of December 2014 for the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Drugs-shortage-or-not-H1N1-claims-600-lives-in-India-356819%5d" target="_new">lack of demand</a> and since the product was expiring.</p><p>India has previously urged a number of firms including Serum, Bharat Biotech, Novartis and Sanofi Pasteur, to ''take all necessary measures'' to ensure that there is adequate supply of H1N1 vaccines and the trivalent seasonal flu vaccine especially in the affected areas following a spike in deaths due to influenza A H1N1 amid allegations of short supplies of key medicine.</p>
