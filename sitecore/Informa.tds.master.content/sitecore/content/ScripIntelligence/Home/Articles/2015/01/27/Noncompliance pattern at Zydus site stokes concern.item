<p>Zydus Cadila's Moraiya facility may not be under the US FDA's glare over data integrity concerns, but the agency's reference in its audit to a ''pattern'' of non-compliance and failure to document a ''justifiable root cause'' has raised some concern about a potential impact on product approvals from the site.</p><p>It now appears that some of the observations made by the US FDA are perhaps less routine in nature including references to how written records of investigation of a drug complaint did not include the findings of the investigation and the follow-up.</p><p>The agency noted how the company failed to review and document consumer complaint investigations for all lots and products potentially affected by a problem. Zydus Cadila, it said, failed to adequately review 106 consumer complaints in 2013 and 132 in 2014. </p><p>Details in the FDA's Form 483 - a notice of the agency's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system &ndash;indicated that Zydus Cadila's failure to review and document all products potentially affected by a problem provided '' no assurance'' that the firm's recent recalls were ''all-inclusive'' for products such as warfarin 2mg, promethazine 25mg and atenolol 25mg.</p><p> ''The above deficiency appears to be a pattern of problem at your site,'' the FDA said.</p><p>Zydus had earlier recalled atenolol &ndash; previously involved in a mix-up in bottles of allergy drug promethazine and more recently recalled following a complaint by a pharmacist who indicated that certain tablets were thicker in appearance.</p><p>The FDA said that a review of consumer complaints in 2013 and 2014 revealed that the Moraiya site received nine complaints of bottles containing mixed up products. ''This is significant because in each complaint the two mixed products contained within the complaint bottle were packaged on the same line at the same facility within your site,'' the FDA said.</p><p>The FDA has also referred to the failure to document a justifiable root cause, despite evidence to show the other product in the bottle was packaged by the site on the same line.</p><p>The FDA's observations follow an inspection at the Moraiya site between 28 August and 5 September last year and Zydus Cadila had recently underscored that no issues of data integrity audit were observed during the audit <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Zydus-site-clears-data-integrity-hurdle-in-FDA-audit-356022%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>While the company did not specifically comment on any potential impact on existing or new product filings, it reiterated that some areas were identified for improvement and that it had implemented all of the ''requested observations'' and submitted its response and a corrective action detail report. </p><p>''We are currently awaiting a response and acceptance on this report from the FDA,'' Zydus Cadila reaffirmed to Scrip on 30 January.</p><p>Some analysts tracking the development, however, expressed concern over the type of the agency's observations. </p><p>''Given the nature of observations, we believe it will significantly delay approvals from that site. Cadila has filed many key products including injectables and nasals from this facility and any delay will significantly impact its future growth drivers, especially in the US market,'' Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said.</p><p>Other concerns flagged by the FDA pertain to investigations of an unexplained discrepancy and a failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specification and this not being extended to other batches of the same drug and other products that may have been associated with the specific failure or discrepancy. Again, no justified root cause had been documented, the FDA said. </p><p>With reference to an investigation into low batch yield, the agency said that the problem of not documenting all lots and products potentially affected appeared to be a pattern at the site. </p><p>The FDA also hauled up the company for not submitting a field alert report within three working days of receipt of information concerning an incident that caused a drug or its labelling to be ''mistaken for another article''.</p>
