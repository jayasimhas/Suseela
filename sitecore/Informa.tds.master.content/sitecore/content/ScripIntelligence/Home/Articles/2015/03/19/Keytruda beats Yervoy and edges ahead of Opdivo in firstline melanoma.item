<p>Merck & Co pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-006 study investigating the PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) compared to Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced melanoma has met its two primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The trial will be stopped early based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee. </p><p>"Keytruda now leads [BMS's] Opdivo (nivolumab) once again in the race towards a front-line approval," noted BioMedTracker analysts. Opdivo is similarly being evaluated against Yervoy in the CHECKMATE-067 study, which has already completed patient enrollment. </p><p>"When you consider that Yervoy was the first therapy to improve overall survival for melanoma patients in 30 years then it is very encouraging that another therapy has been shown to improve overall survival compared to Yervoy just a few years later," noted Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Dr Colin White.</p><p>Opdivo was the first PD-1 inhibitor to reach the market worldwide when it was approved for the treatment of melanoma in Japan, but in the US it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">pipped to the post by Keytruda</a>, which gained approval for melanoma in September. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">FDA go-ahead for Opdivo</a> in melanoma came in December.</p><p>In January, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">interim data from the Phase III CheckMate-017 trial</a> suggested Opdivo looks set to become the first PD-1 inhibitor to gain approval for a major lung cancer indication after improved overall survival compared with the control chemotherapy arm.</p><p>Getting to market as early as possible is key for the new wave of immune-oncology products as it will be some time before any real comparisons can be made on their relative safety and efficacy. Giving physicians time to become comfortable with using each particular product in the meantime is vital for long-term sales growth for all players.</p><p>trial details</p><p>KEYNOTE-006 is a global, open-label, randomized, pivotal Phase III study evaluating Keytruda compared to Yervoy in patients with unresectable stage III or IV advanced melanoma with no more than one prior systemic therapy. The study randomized 834 patients to receive Keytruda 10mg/kg every three weeks, Keytruda 10mg/kg every two weeks, or four cycles of Yervoy 3mg/kg every three weeks. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival; secondary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety, with an exploratory analysis for health-related quality of life (QoL). Tumor response was assessed at week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter per RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). </p><p>Quantitative details were not released but will be presented at the upcoming AACR meeting in April.</p>
