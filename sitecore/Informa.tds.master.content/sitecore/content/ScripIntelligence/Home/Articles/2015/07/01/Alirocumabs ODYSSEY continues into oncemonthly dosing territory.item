<p>Sanofi and Regeneron have announced positive top-line Phase III data for their investigational PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab when dosed every four weeks, narrowing what little gap there was between it and its main rival Amgen's evolocumab. </p><p>The data are from the first pivotal studies to look at four-weekly dosing for alirocumab and show comparable efficacy to that seen in previous Phase III studies that examined its use every two weeks. </p><p>Amgen's rival PCSK9 inhibitor has already reported data using a four-weekly dosing schedule. Both products are approaching the market with little to choose between them in terms of safety and efficacy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-inhibitors-shine-at-AHA-but-how-to-differentiate-355132" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 November 2014</a>), and now alirocumab appears to have caught up on the convenience front too. </p><p>The trials, ODYSSEY CHOICE I and CHOICE II, examine the reduction in low-density LDL-cholesterol at 24 weeks with alirocumab compared with placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The mean percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline was consistent with that seen in previous Phase III trials evaluating alirocumab dosed every other week, the companies said. The previously reported 52-week OSYSSEY Long Term study dosed alirocumab at 150mg every two weeks in 2,341 patients with hypercholesterolemia and high to very high CV risk. </p><p>ODYSSEY CHOICE I study included 803 hypercholesterolemia patients at moderate to high risk cardiovascular disease, and is comparing a 300mg dose every four weeks with placebo; 68% of patients also received statin therapy. ODYSSEY CHOICE II is smaller, with 233 patients with hypercholesterolemia with high CV risk and/or a history of intolerance to two or more statins, and is comparing a lower 150mg dose; no patients received statin therapy. </p><p>The most common adverse events in the trials were injection site reactions (which occurred more frequently with alirocumab than placebo), headache, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, nausea, sinusitis, pain in extremity, and fatigue. Full data will be presented at a future medical meeting. </p><p>Alirocumab was due to be filed at the end of 2014 in the US and EU, putting it behind evolocumab which has a PDUFA action date of 27 August. However, alirocumab is expected catch its rival up through a priority review voucher purchased from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, meaning its application will be reviewed within six rather than 10 months of acceptance.</p><p>
