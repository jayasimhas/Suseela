<p>The US has spent more than $5bn in trying to fight Ebola in West Africa &ndash; a disease with no cure, no approved vaccine and one that had some Americans in a frenzy this past fall when the virus first arrived on the nation's shores.</p><p>Yet, many parents are "turning away from sound science" and refusing to get their children vaccinated against preventable diseases, like measles, even though the vaccines have been found to be safe and highly effective, declared Senator Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee).</p><p>Indeed, at a time when the biomedical research and development community is standing on the cusp of breakthroughs never before imagined, like personalized medicine, the US has found itself "retreading old ground" in facing diseases like measles, which was thought to be gone from the nation in 2000, the lawmaker said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-chief-Must-stop-measles-from-getting-foothold-356488" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>).</p><p>But with the reemergence of the measles, which is spreading across the US &ndash; infecting at least 121 people so far in the current outbreak, although some states have reported numbers that put the total above 160 &ndash; the nation has been reminded of the importance of vaccines, he said.</p><p>"Vaccines save lives. They protect us from the ravages of awful diseases," like polio, whooping cough and diphtheria, Senator Alexander contended during a 10 February hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which he chairs.</p><p>"They take deadly, awful, ravaging diseases from horror to history," he said.</p><p>The use of vaccines in healthy people also protects the lives of those who cannot be immunized, like infants or people whose immune systems are compromised because of illness, like cancer, Senator Alexander explained.</p><p>That protection of the vulnerable through so-called "herd immunity," the Republican senator insisted, "is incredibly important."</p><p>But because some parents are not getting their children immunized &ndash; either because they think there are too many shots their kids must endure or they are still holding the debunked theory vaccines cause autism &ndash; the herd immunity system is starting to break down, said Dr Tim Jacks, an Arizona pediatrician.</p><p>Dr Jacks told the HELP Committee that he and his family have experienced the effects of the weakened herd immunity firsthand when his young daughter Maggie, who had been fully immunized, developed the blood cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which has ravaged her immune system. </p><p>Maggie and her younger 10-month-old brother Eli were both recently exposed to the measles at a local healthcare clinic and have since been under quarantine.</p><p>Dr Jacks responded by writing about it in a blog titled "To the parent of the unvaccinated child who exposed my family to measles," which immediately went viral &ndash; receiving 1.3 million shares on Facebook in less than two weeks. </p><p><b>Highly contagious </b></p><p>Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus, which spreads through the air through coughing and sneezing, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>In fact, Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the HELP Committee, measles can remain viable on surfaces and in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.</p><p>"Measles literally flies through the air," Dr Mark Sawyer, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California San Diego, declared during the 10 February hearing.</p><p>The disease spreads so easily that if one person has it, 90% of those who are unvaccinated and come into contact with an infected person are likely to get measles, Dr Schuchat explained.</p><p>Before there was an effective vaccine in the US, up to four million Americans would get the measles each year, leading to about 48,000 annual hospitalizations, with as many as 500 dying from the disease, she said. </p><p>People with measles can develop serious complications, such as pneumonia or encephalitis, Dr Schuchat pointed out. </p><p><b>Effective vaccine</b></p><p>There are two FDA-approved measles vaccines in the US &ndash; both made by Merck: M-M-R II, which is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella in individuals 12 months or older; and ProQuad, which is used to vaccinate against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox in children 12 months to 12 years. </p><p>"Simply put, these vaccines are safe and effective and serious side effects are rare," FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg said in a 10 February blog posted on the agency's website following the Senate hearing, at which she did not testify.</p><p>One dose of the measles vaccine has been shown to be 93% effective against the virus, while a second dose provides about 97% protection against the disease, Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>Dr Hamburg insisted there is no shortage of measles vaccine, and she urged everyone who has not been vaccinated to get immunized to prevent the "potentially tragic consequences of the disease." </p><p>For each dollar invested in immunizing children in the US, there are $10 in societal savings and $3 in direct medical savings, Dr Schuchat told the HELP panel.</p><p>She said the past 20 years of immunizing children in the US has prevented 322 million illnesses, 732,000 deaths and nearly $1.4tn in societal costs.</p><p>But, Dr Schuchat said, the US is a "victim of our own success," because many people have forgotten about or never lived through a time when diseases like measles were a threat to the health of the nation. </p><p>And the success of vaccinations has meant that fewer doctors and other healthcare workers practicing today have witnessed the serious and sometimes life-threatening consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, she explained.</p><p>Indeed, Dr Sawyer told the Senate committee that because of the widespread use of vaccines in the past several decades, he has never seen a case of polio, diphtheria or tetanus in his 30 years of practicing as a pediatric infectious disease doctor. </p><p>But while Dr Sawyer said his 20 medical residents have never seen a case of the measles so far, unfortunately, they are now likely to do so. </p><p>"Pediatricians are concerned that this reemergence of disease is only a signal of future, wider-scale outbreaks yet to come," Dr Sawyer warned. </p><p><b>Is halting exemptions the answer?</b></p><p>Senator Alexander noted that many states, including Dr Sawyer's home state of California, allow parents to claim "personal belief exemptions" from vaccination requirements.</p><p>In fact, the senator said, in some areas of Los Angeles, up to 70% of parents at certain schools have filed personal belief exemptions. </p><p>"In these elementary schools, vaccination rates are as low as those in Chad or south Sudan," Senator Alexander asserted. </p><p>But Dr Sawyer said it's the "philosophical" exemptions that need to be done away with, in which parents often have a bias against vaccines, generally because of misinformation, usually found on the Internet &ndash; "a dangerous place for parents looking for information about vaccines."</p><p>He noted there currently is legislation in California to get rid of the philosophical exemptions, which Dr Sawyer said he backs.</p><p>Vaccines would be better accepted by parents, he said, if communication about those products &ndash; specifically that the FDA ensures they are thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness &ndash; and science literacy in general were improved. </p><p>Senator Bill Cassidy (Republican-Louisiana) said schools also should be required to visibly post at their facilities the numbers of unimmunized children attending so parents can "beware" it is a "Petri dish for measles" &ndash; an idea for which Dr Sawyer agreed.</p><p>"If we want parents to be informed about vaccines in general, we should also want them to be informed about the environment that they are putting their children in. And there's no doubt that a school with 40% or 50% of unimmunized children is where the next outbreaks are going to occur,&rdquo; Dr Sawyer said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
