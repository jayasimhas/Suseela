<p>Allergan announced over the weekend that it agreed to pay $560m plus undisclosed milestone fees for novel depression drug developer Naurex, but the company remained quiet about the rumored sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for several billion dollars.</p><p>A spokesman said on 26 July that Allergan had no comment about speculation that the company would accept a $45bn bid for its generic medicines unit, which generated $6.7bn in sales in 2014. However, Allergan was so enthusiastic about Naurex's two lead product candidates that it agreed to acquisition terms that satisfied the entrepreneurial spirit of the private biotechnology firm's founders. </p><p>Evanston, Illinois-based Naurex will spin out its drug discovery platform into a new company with which Allergan will continue to collaborate. SpinCo, as the firm will be called until a permanent name is chosen, will retain Naurex's medicinal chemistry and related intellectual property. Allergan will not be a shareholder in the spin-out company, but will have a first right to consider licensing a predetermined number of drug candidates in specific indications.</p><p>"It's a perfect way of making sure the drugs, rapastinel (GLYX-13) and NRX-1074, are in really good hands and for the platform to remain a drug discovery platform," Naurex president and CEO Norbert Riedel told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p><b>Two clinical assets</b></p><p>Allergan, which generally eschews discovery and early clinical-stage research, is acquiring two drugs that modulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. GLYX-13 and NRX-1074 are designed to avoid the hallucinogenic and euphoric effects associated with the well-known NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which is used as an anesthetic and severe pain reliever, but also has been shown to relieve depression.</p><p>Naurex reported positive <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Naurex-presents-compelling-data-for-depression-drug-GLYX-13-355569" target="_new">Phase IIb results</a> for GLYX-13, an intravenous NMDA receptor modulator, in December that showed an almost immediate effect on patients and sustained improvement in depression symptoms with each weekly dose.</p><p>Phase II data for orally administered NRX-1074 in January showed that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Naurex-reveals-promising-data-with-oral-depression-candidate-356408" target="_new">a single dose</a> reduced depression symptoms more effectively than four to six weeks of daily dosing with most other antidepressants. </p><p>The two data sets attracted attention from multiple pharma companies, according to Dr Riedel, giving Naurex new options for funding later-stage GLYX-13 and NRX-1074 development and ongoing NMDA modulator discovery.</p><p>The company raised $80m in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Naurex-leads-VC-funding-surge-with-80-Series-C-355396" target="_new">Series C venture capital</a> late last year, on top of prior Series A and B rounds totaling $83m, to attract investors that would improve Naurex's standing in the eyes of stock market investors if it decided to pursue an initial public offering in 2015. </p><p>With Allergan buying Naurex and its two lead drug candidates, the biotech company no longer has to worry about how it will fund large Phase III clinical trials in depression for GLYX13 and NRX-1074.</p><p><b>Good fit with Allergan</b></p><p>"We decided in the end that we were better off with a large company like Allergan taking on the large Phase III program. Allergan has a commitment to mental health, a portfolio in depression and the capability to do large clinical trials. We felt our organization should remain focused on drug discovery," Dr Riedel said.</p><p>Allergan will pay $460m up front when its acquisition of Naurex closes and another $100m in January. Naurex's shareholders also stand to earn cash in the future as Allergan achieves unspecified development and sales milestones for GLYX-13 and NRX-1074.</p><p>The assets fit into Allergan's central nervous system (CNS) portfolio of brand name medicines that includes Namenda (memantine) for Alzheimer's disease, Saphris (asenapine) for dementia, and the depression drugs Fetzima (levomilnacipran) and Viibryd (vilazodone).</p><p>Allergan, when it still was known as Actavis, acquired the CNS drugs in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forests-Saunders-ropes-2nd-major-sale-boosts-personal-brand-in-Actavis-deal-350112" target="_new">$25bn purchase of Forest</a> Laboratories. The deal also brought Forest CEO Brent Saunders to Actavis, where he <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Forests-Saunders-takes-lead-role-on-Actaviss-new-leadership-team-351859" target="_new">was named CEO</a> to lead the company's acquisitive strategy. Actavis became Allergan this year when it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">purchased</a> the maker of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) and Restasis (cyclosporine) for $66bn, but the company remains active in licensing as well as acquisitions.</p><p>"Our ongoing research collaboration [with Naurex's SpinCo] will also position us to continue to leverage Naurex's innovative drug discovery platform to drive further long-term value and provide patients with needed treatment options in this important therapeutic area," Allergan president of global brands research and development David Nicholson said in a statement from the company.</p><p>The Naurex SpinCo's pipeline of drug candidates are in various stages of preclinical development. Each program represents a novel molecule, not a reformulation of a previously developed compound, Dr Riedel noted.</p><p>"Nothing is quite ready to be moved into clinical trials. We have great expectations that will occur in a reasonable amount of time," he said.</p><p><p><p><p>
