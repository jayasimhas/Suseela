<p>Celgene is known as a creative yet disciplined dealmaker, so the fact that the big biotech company is investing $1bn up front under a 10-year agreement with Juno Therapeutics shows that Celgene sees a lot of value in the early-stage, closely-watched field of chimeric antigen T-cell receptor (CAR-T) therapies.</p><p>Seattle, Washington-based Juno will receive $150m in cash up front, plus Celgene will buy more than 9.1m newly issued Juno shares at $93 each &ndash; a 100.9% premium over Juno's 29 June closing stock price of $46.30 per share. The partners will jointly develop CAR-T and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapies for cancer &ndash; Juno's initial focus and Celgene's biggest money maker &ndash; as well as autoimmune diseases, which is a growing commercial priority for Celgene and a preclinical research area for Juno.</p><p>Celgene tends to prefer partnerships over acquisitions, hence the large mostly-stock upfront investment in Juno. Celgene's ownership of Juno shares may increase over time, but its stake in the T-cell therapy specialist will be capped at 30%. </p><p>Juno will benefit from the new capital for R&D "while maintaining the independence we, our employees, partners and investors believe is so critical for true innovation," CEO Hans Bishop said.</p><p>Juno has been a company for less than two years. The firm licensed its technology from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, the Seattle Children's Research Institute, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and launched after raising a $120m <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Startup-Juno-raises-120m-for-unprecedented-immunotherapies-348529" target="_new">Series A</a> round in late 2013. The Series A grew to $176m by April 2014 and was followed by a $134m <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Junos-134m-Series-B-more-than-3-VC-deals-combined-353228" target="_new">Series B</a> round in August. </p><p>Juno grossed $304.8m from an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-Update-Juno-has-biggest-2014-offering-as-investors-chase-CAR-T-stocks-355776" target="_new">initial public offering</a> at $24 per share in December and its stock closed as high as $68.36 on 5 June. The share price spiked in after-hours trading on 29 June following the Celgene deal announcement, ending the night up 37.2% at $63.50.</p><p><b>Behind the deal scenes</b></p><p>In terms of its collaboration with Celgene, Juno chief financial officer and head of corporate development Steve Harr told <i>Scrip</i> that "there are a number of people within the senior managements of both companies who've known each other for a decade-plus. We both realized the opportunity to do something different" with targeted immunotherapies for cancer and with broader applications in autoimmune disease.</p><p>Dr Harr noted that Juno does not have clinical proof-of-concept data for its T-cell therapies in autoimmune diseases, but the company's preclinical research suggests that the technology could be used to turn down overactive T-cells in autoimmune disease. CAR-T cancer therapies boost the activity of T-cells.</p><p>Celgene has an option to be the commercial partner for essentially all of Juno's engineered T-cell therapies, including the CD19-targeting treatment <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-CAR-T-cell-therapies-generate-buzz-355536" target="_new">JCAR015</a> that has shown <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Scrips-Rough-Guide-to-Immuno-Oncology-358690" target="_new">high response rates</a> in Phase I cancer studies and won a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Junos-leukemia-drug-JCAR015-granted-FDA-breakthrough-status-355266" target="_new">breakthrough therapy</a> designation from the US FDA. </p><p>Juno and Celgene disclosed only one target that's excluded under their partnership: B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA). A BCMA-focused program is the only CAR-T asset from Bluebird Bio that Celgene didn't hand back under a recently announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-backing-off-bluebird-partnership-358728" target="_new">deal amendment</a>.</p><p>AstraZeneca's programmed cell death-1 ligand (PDL-1) inhibitor MEDI4736 also is excluded from research possibilities under Celgene's agreement with Juno. Celgene <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celgene-pays-450m-for-AZs-MEDI4736-in-blood-cancers-AZ-signs-250m-Innate-deal-358057" target="_new">agreed to pay</a> AstraZeneca $450m up front in April to license the immune checkpoint inhibitor for hematological malignancies.</p><p>However, Celgene's senior vice president of business development George Golumbeski &ndash; the company's chief deal negotiator &ndash; noted during a conference call with investors and analysts that technology and intellectual property could be added to the Juno deal beyond the current terms of the agreement.</p><p>"Both companies believe this deal will rapidly evolve," Mr Golumbeski said.</p><p>Juno is responsible for all research and development for its assets in North America and retains commercial rights in those territories. Celgene is responsible for development and commercialization in the rest of the world and will pay Juno royalties on sales outside of North America. Celgene also may select two and possibly three programs that will be subject to a global profit sharing agreement, excluding China.</p><p>Juno may opt in to co-develop and co-commercialize T-cell therapies originating from Celgene's portfolio. Juno will share 30% of the costs and profits for those programs, but Celgene will lead global development and commercialization. Juno may exercise a co-promote option in the US and certain EU territories.</p><p>"We think it's a tremendous opportunity. It allows us to concentrate on what we think we're good at, but capitalize on a broad set of opportunities," Dr Harr told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p><b>Creatively flexible</b></p><p>The flexible terms of the Juno deal reflect the hallmarks of Celgene's dealmaking philosophy. Dr Golumbeski told <i>Scrip</i> in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Celgenes-head-dealmaker-strikes-a-fair-balance-356314" target="_new">interview</a> during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January that "we are willing to build a deal structure that accommodates [our partners'] needs and expectations and our needs and expectations."</p><p>Known as a prolific dealmaker and a creative negotiator, Celgene's commercial portfolio and its research pipeline are dominated by partnered assets. Chairman and CEO Bob Hugin said during the company's joint conference call with Juno that he expects the partnership to yield revenue-generating products by 2020, which is when Celgene has said it will generate $20bn in net sales.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Juno's CAR-T and TCR programs will help Celgene meet or beat its long-term sales goals, but Celgene's big upfront investment in Juno and its broad agreement with the company show that the big biotech has a lot of faith in T-cell technology and immunotherapy's promise.</p><p><p><p><p>
