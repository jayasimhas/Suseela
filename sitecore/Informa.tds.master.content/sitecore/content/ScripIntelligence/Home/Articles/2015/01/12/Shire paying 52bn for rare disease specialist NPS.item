<p>Shire will put its $1.6bn cash breakup fee from AbbVie &ndash; and then some &ndash; to use via the Dublin-based company's $5.2bn acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The transaction is the first major deal announced to start the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference that gets under way in San Francisco on 12 January, but it has been expected since at least June when Shire was rumored to be interested in NPS's rare disease portfolio (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Does-Shire-have-its-eye-on-US-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-352105" target="_new">2 June 2014</a>). The deal announced on 11 January is Shire's first big acquisition since AbbVie decided to halt its $53bn purchase of Shire, triggering a billion-dollar-plus payment to the company (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-drops-Shire-bid-354511" target="_new">16 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Shire will pay $46 per share for Bedminster, New Jersey-based NPS in an all-cash tender offer financed with an $850m short-term bank facility, cash on hand and the company's existing $2.1bn five-year revolving credit facility. The short-term bank facility will be refinanced through new debt issuances.</p><p>The acquisition price represents a 51% premium to NPS's 16 December closing stock price of $30.47 &ndash; the day before the latest round of rumors that Shire was going to buy the company. NPS closed at $41.91 on 9 January.</p><p>The acquisition value reflects the competition for assets deemed valuable by specialty pharmaceutical companies, which have been more aggressive in their dealmaking than big pharma companies, as noted in a recent Ernst & Young report on mergers and acquisitions in 2014, which includes M&A advice for 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/REPORT-Pharma-steps-up-MandA-but-specialty-companies-dominate-356066" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Shire expects the NPS acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) beginning in 2016. Anticipated synergies, or cost savings as NPS operations are integrated into Shire, are expected to be 25% to 35% lower than Wall Street analyst consensus forecasts for the company's operating costs in 2017 and beyond.</p><p><b>NPS's top three products</b></p><p>The NPS portfolio, which had gross asset value of $282.2m and net asset value of $130.9m as of 30 September, includes:</p><p>* Gattex (teduglutide), which was approved in the US in 2012 to treat for short bowel syndrome (SBS) and is in the process of being launched in Europe under the brand name Revestive (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gattex-grabs-early-US-FDA-nod-but-NPS-investors-not-impressed-338547" target="_new">21 December 2012</a>). The treatment for SBS, which affects 6,000 to 7,000 patients in the US and a similar number in Europe, generated $67.9m in sales for the first nine months of 2014.</p><p>* Natpara (rhPTH[1-84]), which is under US FDA review for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism (HPT) with a decision on the biologic license application (BLA) expected by 24 January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NPS-hypoparathyroidism-drug-Natpara-under-FDA-review-349183" target="_new">9 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vivid-stories-help-NPS-Natpara-win-panel-support-353921" target="_new">13 September 2014</a>). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated NPS's marketing authorization application (MAA) for the biologic, to be marketed as Natpar in Europe, and the MAA is under review. About 75,000 people have HPT in the US, including 41,000 with moderate-to-severe disease, with a similar prevalence in Europe.</p><p>* NPSP795, a small molecule antagonist of the calcium-sensing receptor, which is being evaluated in a Phase IIa clinical trial for the treatment of adults with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. </p><p>"The acquisition of NPS Pharma is a significant step in advancing Shire's strategy to become a leading biotechnology company. With our global strength and expertise in both rare diseases and [gastrointestinal diseases], Shire is uniquely positioned to drive the continued success of Gattex/Revestive and, if approved, commercialize NPS Pharma's pipeline compound Natpara/Natpar," Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said in a statement from the company.</p><p>About 48% of Shire's portfolio will be comprised of treatments for rare diseases after the acquisition of NPS versus 42% before the deal.</p><p><b>Driving value</b></p><p>"We look forward to accelerating the growth of the NPS Pharma portfolio based on our proven track record of maximizing value from acquired assets and commercial execution," Mr Ornskov said.</p><p>Sales have been rocky for Gattex to date. NPS reported $17.9m in sales for the first quarter of 2014 and reduced its full-year guidance to a range of $100m to $110m versus a prior forecast of $110m to $120m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/NPSs-1Q-Gattex-sales-disappoint-2Q-rebound-under-way-351674" target="_new">8 May 2014</a>). The company reported $28.1m in Gattex revenue for the third quarter and said it expected the 2014 sales total to come in at the low end of its guidance.</p><p>"Shire shares NPS Pharma's commitment to patients with rare diseases. We believe that joining our two companies will drive value for shareholders and ensure we continue to transform the lives of patients with short bowel syndrome, hypoparathyroidism and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia worldwide," NPS president and CEO Francois Nader said in the company's joint statement with Shire.</p><p>Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry noted in an 11 January report that Gattex/Revestive's sales potential is estimated at $500m in annual sales and Natpara/Natpar's sales could top out at $575m annually. Revenue from NPS's products after synergies from cost cuts should make Shire's acquisition of the company about 8% accretive to Shire's earnings in 2016 and 13% to 14% accretive to earnings in 2017 through 2019.</p><p>"In our view, the deal is consistent with Shire's M&A strategy and benefits from very low-cost funding, but we would not be buyers of Shire ahead of the Natpara [FDA decision date] since successful outcomes (approval, label and launch) are already priced into the acquisition cost," Mr Gerberry wrote.</p><p>Shire's acquisition agreement with NPS includes a breakup fee, which Shire could elect to pay if Natpara does not win FDA approval later this month.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
