<p><p>Orexigen Therapeutics and big pharma partner Takeda Pharmaceuticals have finally managed to reach terms that please both partners. The pair teamed up in 2010 on the development of the obesity drug Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion) and have been arguing over costs and promotion for the last few years. Costs will go up for the biotech, but it still has a partner to promote its drug.</p><p>While Contrave is the most successful of the recently launch obesity drugs, the term success is relative to just how poorly these drugs are all performing. Contrave is now the market leader in the branded obesity space, but all four drugs &ndash; including offerings from Arena Pharmaceuticals, Vivus and Novo Nordisk &ndash; are performing badly. Contrave brought in sales of $16m for the second quarter &ndash; outpacing all its competitors. </p><p>"Looking at the share of Contrave in the branded market, first of all, you're all aware that Contrave is now the branded market leader after only eight months on the market. In June, Contrave grew to 34.3% share of the branded market versus 32.9% in May, and now holds a growing lead over the other agents," said Orexigen CEO Mike Narachi during the company's earnings call Aug 6.</p><p>It was the poor performance of competing drugs and the increasing delays in the launch of Contrave that pushed Takeda to pull out on some of its commitments to Orexigen. </p><p>The biotech announced Aug. 6 that agreeable terms have finally been reached between the partners. While most of the agreement didn't change, Takeda will now return its rights to market Contrave in Mexico and Canada, only retaining rights to the drug in the US. </p><p>The biggest sticking point for the companies were the post marketing requirements that FDA put in place when it approved Contrave last year. The regulatory agency determined that the ongoing LIGHT study could not be used to fulfill the post marketing requirement and that an additional cardiovascular outcomes study would have to be conducted. </p><p>According to the new terms, Takeda will be responsible for any costs left related to the LIGHT study, which the companies have chosen to discontinue. Orexigen will now be responsible for the cost of the cardiovascular outcomes study &ndash; about $200m, and $100m more than the biotech had been expecting to pay previously. Beyond the first $200m for the study, Takeda and Orexigen will split the costs equally. </p><p>The positive for Orexigen in all of this is that its deep-pocketed Japanese partner will continue to provide the same level of promotional support for the drug in the US. Contrave currently has about 900 sales reps pedaling the drug; well above the numbers competitors have detailing their respective offerings. </p><p>Just <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Is-Vivus-worth-saving-359734" target="_new">last week</a>, competitor Vivus told investors that it would be cutting its sales force in half to just 50 reps as the company continues to lose money. </p><p>Analysts agree that this is the best outcome that could&rsquo;ve been expected from the long-going dispute. "We view this outcome as a net positive for OREX: even though they did lose the dispute (they now have</p><p>to pay roughly an extra $100M for the additional share of the CVOT), they won by no longer having this overhang, which was worrisome to investors, some of who were worried about the outside possibility that Takeda could possibly walk away from the partnership altogether," wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis. "And in fairness to the Orexigen management team, it is hard to negotiate with a much larger pharma partner who has what you really need (900 sales reps) and could devastate your stock if they decided to walk away."</p><p><p>
