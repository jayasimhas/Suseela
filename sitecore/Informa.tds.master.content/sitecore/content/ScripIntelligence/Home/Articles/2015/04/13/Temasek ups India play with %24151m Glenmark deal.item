<p>Singapore government investment arm Temasek is pumping in about INR9.45bn ($151.6m) for about 3.8% in Glenmark Pharmaceuticals &ndash; funds that the Indian firm expects to use to retire debt.</p><p>The deal, which marks the deepening of Temasek's exposure in the Indian pharmaceutical space, is also perhaps the largest of its kind over the recent past and seen as a reinforcement of investor confidence in firms like Glenmark that straddle both the generics and innovation space. </p><p>Last year seen Temasek picked up 10.16% in India's Intas, facilitating the part exit of ChrysCapital, an India-focused investment firm. The pharma sector is also considered a "good proxy" for the needs of transforming economies - part of Temasek's investment themes - a statement from Intas then said.</p><p>On 17 April, Glenmark informed the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) that it planned to issue up to 10.8m equity shares of INR1 each for cash to Aranda Investments Mauritius, a wholly owned indirect arm of Temasek Holdings, on a preferential basis at INR875 per share. </p><p>The Glenmark stock, which was traded at a 52-week high of INR940 on the BSE on 15 April, ended at INR864.45 (-1.73%) on 17 April.</p><p>The Indian firm is seeking shareholder approval for the deal at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 13 May.</p><h2>Endorsement</h2><p>Glenmark is expected to use the inflow to prune its debt pile from around $420m currently to about $270m. </p><p>Some analysts suggest that the deal is perhaps a strong endorsement of the firm's growth plans, given the high valuations vis-a-vis traditional levels of 13-15 times price/earnings (P/E).</p><p>Other experts like Tarun Shah, founder of MP Advisors, an Indian strategic business advisory firm, told <i>Scrip</i> that institutional investment in Glenmark at such valuation means investors have "faith" in the R&D capability of India Pharma. </p><p>"Valuation of Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) [Sun Pharma's research arm] is in sync with the above theory," Mr Shah said.</p>
