<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb reported clinical trial data for two new HIV therapies on 25 and 26 February that support moving BMS-663068 and BMS-955176 into Phase III and Phase IIb trials.</p><p>The HIV-1 attachment inhibitor BMS-663068 had similar efficacy to Reyataz (atazanavir sulfate) plus ritonavir at 48 weeks in a Phase IIb trial and showed no dose-dependent safety signals in treatment-experienced patients, supporting initiation of a Phase III study on 23 February with individuals who have become resistant to, are intolerant of, or otherwise cannot take a standard three-course treatment regimen. BMS-955176, an HIV-1 maturation inhibitor, is expected to move into Phase IIb clinical trials during the second half of 2015 based on a positive Phase IIa trial.</p><p>Data for BMS-663068 and BMS-955176 were presented during the 2015 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) in Seattle, Washington.</p><p><b>BMS-663068 results</b></p><p>In a Phase IIb study, 254 patients were randomized for treatment with 400mg or 800mg of BMS-663068 twice-daily, 600mg or 1,200mg of BMS-663068 once-daily, or 300mg Reyataz and 100mg ritonavir once-daily. Patients in all arms of the study also received 400mg raltegravir twice-daily and 300mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate once-daily.</p><p>The study showed that 61% to 82% of patients treated with BMS-663068 had essentially undetectable HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50c/mL at 48 weeks, which was on par with 71% of patients in the Reyataz arm of the study. </p><p>Also, there were no dose-dependent safety signals, no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) and no treatment-related serious adverse events for people who received BMS-663068. The most common side effects were headache (2% of patients in the 800mg cohort) and abdominal pain (2% in the 1,200mg cohort).</p><p>"While we still need further details of the breakdown of efficacy across doses and the grade 1 AEs, the grade 2-4 AEs are less than the comparator over all doses," Sagient Research noted in a 25 February BioMedTracker analysis.</p><p>Sagient increased its likelihood of US FDA approval for BMS-663068 by 3% to 62%, which is 1% above average for antiviral therapies in Phase III development. The analyst service previously had concerns about headache and rash reported for lower doses of the drug after an open-label Phase II study, but those side effects do not appear to be a problem in Phase IIb against an active comparator.</p><p>Bristol-Myers also reported data at the CROI meeting that showed no drug-drug interactions when BMS-663068 is dosed with darunavir and ritonavir or with darunavir and ritonavir plus etravirine. Grade 1 and 2 skin rashes were reported for 28.3% of patients, but the side effect was associated with darunavir/ritonavir and etravirine, not BMS-663068.</p><p><b>BMS-955176 data</b></p><p>Bristol-Myers said that BMS-955176 demonstrated antiviral activity in a Phase IIa clinical trial against baseline HIV mutations that were not responsive to the earlier-generation maturation inhibitor bevirimat. </p><p>BMS-955176 met the trial's primary endpoint of a -1 log10 c/mL or greater reduction in HIV-1 RNA from baseline to day 11. Maximum median declines of -1.7 log10 c/mL were observed at the 40mg once-daily dose. A plateau of ~1.64 log10 c/mL was observed at 40mg, 80mg and 120mg dosed once-daily. </p><p>There were no deaths, treatment discontinuations, grade 3 or 4 AEs, or clinically relevant grade 2 through 4 laboratory abnormalities. Four patients treated with BMS-955176 reported diarrhea, but other side effects occurred at the same or greater rates in the study's placebo group: headache (42%), abnormal dreams (25%) and night sweats (8%).</p><p>"Targeting HIV-1 later in its viral lifecycle is an important progression for antiviral therapy," Dirk Schürmann of Charité Research Organisation in Berlin said in a statement from Bristol-Myers. "The need for new drug classes is growing, as patients start treatment earlier, stay on treatment longer, develop viruses that are cross-resistant to multiple classes, and face long-term safety and tolerability issues associated with some of the current HIV therapies. Early data on BMS-955176 illustrate that it is a viable maturation inhibitor candidate for further study."</p><p><p><p><p>
