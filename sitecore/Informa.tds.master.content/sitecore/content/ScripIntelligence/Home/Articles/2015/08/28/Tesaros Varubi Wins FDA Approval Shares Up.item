<p>Shares of Tesaro jumped about 10% on Sept. 2 on the news the FDA had approved the Waltham, MA firm's new drug application to market Varubi (rolapitant) to prevent delayed phase chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adults.</p><p>Specifically, the drug, which is Tesaro's first FDA-approved medicine, is indicated in the US in combination with other antiemetic agents in adults to prevent delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy. </p><p>Regulators noted that nausea and vomiting that occurs from 24 hours to up to 120 hours after the start of chemotherapy is referred to as delayed phase CINV, which can result in serious health complications in cancer patients, such as weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition, leading to hospitalization.</p><p>Richard Gralla, a professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said that while important strides in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy have been made, up to half of patients receiving emetogenic cancer chemotherapy can experience delayed CINV.</p><p>The FDA approved Varubi, a selective and competitive antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 receptors, based on the results of three Phase III trials, which demonstrated a significant reduction in episodes of vomiting or use of rescue medication during the 25-to-120-hour period following administration of highly emetogenic and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. </p><p>Patients who received Varubi reported experiencing less nausea that interfered with normal daily life and fewer episodes of vomiting or retching over multiple cycles of chemotherapy. </p><p>Shares of Varubi closed at $53.40, up $1.71, or 3.3%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
