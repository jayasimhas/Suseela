<p>Chiasma is raising capital to fund a new drug application (NDA) submission to the US FDA for oral ocreotide in the treatment of acromegaly based on Phase III results that were published on 9 February in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (JCEM).</p><p>New York and Jerusalem-based Chiasma partnered with Roche in 2013 to develop oral ocreotide (formerly Octreolin), which is designed as an alternative to injections with approved somatostatin analogs, such as Novartis's Sandostatin (ocreotide acetate) and Signifor (pasireotide). However, Roche has since dropped its interest in oral ocreotide and Chiasma plans to take the drug through FDA approval and commercialization on its own, according to CEO Roni Mamluk.</p><p>"We expect to have [the NDA submitted to the FDA] by mid-year. All of our focus is on achieving this goal," Dr Mamluk told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Chiasma is in the middle of fundraising to pay for the NDA submission and commercial preparations. Prior investors include MPM Capital, F-2 Venture Capital, Abingworth, 7 Med Health Ventures and ARCH Venture. The company raised a $38.5m Series B round in 2012 before it garnered $65m up front and the promise of up to $530m in milestone fees from Roche (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Chiasma-secures-new-funding-to-support-Phase-III-oral-octreotide-programme-333114" target="_new">24 July 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-to-pay-65-million-upfront-for-late-stage-oral-acromegaly-drug-340084" target="_new">18 February 2013</a>).</p><p>"We are a private company [with] funding from private investors and we plan to commercialize the product in the US once approved. At this stage, we are planning to continue to independently commercialize it," Dr Mamluk said.</p><p><b>Alternative to gel injectables</b></p><p>Data supporting Chiasma's NDA submission and commercial strategy showed that 62% of 151 evaluable acromegaly patients in the company's open-label Phase III clinical trial experienced disease control during a 13-month treatment period with oral ocreotide. Disease control was defined as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels at less than 1.3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and integrated growth hormone (GH) concentrations of less than 2.5ng/mL.</p><p>Acromegaly develops when a benign pituitary gland tumor produces too much growth hormone, which can lead to significant health problems and early death if untreated. Symptoms include facial changes, intense headaches, joint pain, impaired vision and enlargement of the hands, feet and tongue. Patients also may develop diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disorders. </p><p>While nearly two-third of the Phase III trial's patients achieved disease control &ndash; reduced IGF-1 and GH levels &ndash; 89% of trial patients had been responding to somatostatin analog injectables at the start of the study, which included a seven-month core treatment period and a six-month extension phase.</p><p>Dr Mamluk said the disease control rate shows there is a market for Chiasma's oral ocreotide, at least for some patients. </p><p>Individuals with acromegaly may be open to trying the oral product to see if it works for them, since the only approved somatostatins are once-monthly gel injections that can be painful and cause scarring. Also, some patients have problems with symptoms recurring before they receive their next dose.</p><p>Chiasma noted that 85% of patients who responded to oral ocreotide treatment continued to experience disease control through the end of treatment.</p><p>"Those who were controlled maintained their response," Dr Mamluk said.</p><p>Also, adverse were similar to the known disease burden of acromegaly and the safety profile of injectable somatostatin analogs with the absence of injection site reactions. Adverse events affected the gastrointestinal, nervous and musculoskeletal systems. </p><p>The most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues that resolved in less than two weeks. Nausea, diarrhea and abdominal pain were the most frequent concerns for the 23 patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events.</p><p>Chiasma and former partner Roche planned to develop oral ocreotide for neuroendocrine tumors as well as acromegaly, but development outside of acromegaly is on hold for now.</p><p>"There is definitely a potential for this drug in neuroendocrine tumors, but at this time we are focused on patients with acromegaly," Dr Mamluk said.</p><p><p><p><p>
