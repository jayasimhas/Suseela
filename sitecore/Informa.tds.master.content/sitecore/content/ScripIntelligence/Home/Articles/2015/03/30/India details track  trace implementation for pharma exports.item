<p>India has announced details for implementation of its track and trace system for pharmaceutical exports &ndash; measures that are expected to aid efforts to tackle counterfeits and enhance supply chain safety.</p><p>India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), which falls under the commerce and industry ministry, said that drugs manufactured on or after 1 April will "compulsorily" carry barcodes on tertiary and secondary packages as per a previous notification in August last year. </p><p>"With effect from 1 July 2015, all drugs with manufacturing date on or after 1April can be exported only if both the tertiary and secondary packaging carry barcoding as applicable and the relevant data as prescribed by the DGFT is uploaded on the central portal," a government notice dated 1 April said.</p><p>Drug exports with a manufacturing date prior to 1 April will be exempted for barcode labelling and data uploading requirements.</p><p>Manufacturers are required to maintain data in the "parent-child relationship" across all three levels of packaging &ndash; primary, secondary and tertiary &ndash; and their movement in the supply chain. This data is required to be uploaded on the Indian government's central portal by the manufacturer or its designated agency prior to release of the drugs for sale or distribution, the notice said.</p><p>The onus of the "correctness, completeness and timely upload of data" on the central portal will lie with the manufacturer.</p><p>The new rules will not apply to those formulation exports, where the government of the importing country has mandated a specific requirement and the exporter intends to avail the option of printing the barcodes in their format subject to certain approvals. However, the tertiary level of packaging will require additional printing of a barcode as specified by India in addition to an importing country's requirement, the notice added.</p><p>At the tertiary level, India has mandated the incorporation of a one dimensional (1D) barcode encoding unique and universal global product identification code in the format of 14 digits Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) along with the batch number, expiry date and a unique serial number [Serial Shipping Container Code] of the tertiary pack.</p><p>At the secondary level, India requires the incorporation of one or two dimensional (1D or 2D) barcode encoding unique and universal global product identification code in the format of 14 digits GTIN along with the batch number, expiry date and a unique serial number of the secondary pack.</p><p>India had implemented the requirement of affixing bar codes on tertiary level and secondary level packaging with effect from October 2011 and January 2013 respectively.</p><p>Industry experts welcomed the government's rules and suggested that it will help check baseless allegations against Indian generic exports as seen in the past when counterfeits made elsewhere were falsely labelled as being of Indian origin. </p><p>"We support any effort by the government that helps prevent counterfeiting," Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic firms, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Some years ago, Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had detained a large consignment of counterfeit generic antimalarials labelled "Made in India" but produced in China <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-protests-against-Chinese-counterfeits-in-Nigeria-146756%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 15 June 2009).</a></p><h2>Primary Level</h2><p>At the primary packaging level, India has ordered the incorporation of a two dimensional (2D) barcode encoding unique and universal global product identification code in the format of 14 digits GTIN along with the batch number, expiry date and a unique serial number of the primary pack.</p><p>The requirement of bar code labelling at the primary level is, however, "exempted" till further notification, though the details specified therein are to be printed in readable form.</p><p>Primary packaging refers to the package which is in direct physical contact with the drug while the secondary packaging is the carton containing multiple primary packs including a mono carton. </p><p>In the case of mono cartons, the Indian Drugs Manufacturers' Association (IDMA) had earlier this month urged the government to restrict the requirement of barcoding only to the outer package of these cartons.</p><p>"Since the pack in which mono cartons are packed has the bar coding for the purpose of trace and tracking, we request that the requirement of bar coding be exempted for mono cartons," IDMA president SV Veerramani said in a note dated 19 March to the commerce and industry ministry.</p><p>The requirement of affixing barcodes on mono cartons as secondary level packaging was to become effective from 26 June 2014, but had been deferred to 1 April 2015.</p>
