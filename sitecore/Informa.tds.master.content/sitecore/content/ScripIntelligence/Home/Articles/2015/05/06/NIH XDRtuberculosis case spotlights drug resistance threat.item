<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) on 8 June disclosed that a woman with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), which is particularly difficult to treat, was admitted three days earlier to the agency's Clinical Center, where she is being treated in an isolation room.</p><p>The case again brings the spotlight to the threat of drug-resistant bacteria and the diminishing arsenal of medicines the world has left to fight diseases like XDR-TB.</p><p>Just last week, the White House held a forum focused on the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and what must be done to preserve the currently available antimicrobials &ndash; a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-superbug-summit-Saving-miracle-antibiotics-358716" target="_new">superbug summit</a>.</p><p>XDR-TB is resistant to almost all drugs used to treat tuberculosis, including isoniazid and rifampin &ndash; the two best first-line medicines against the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>The disease also is resistant to the best second-line medications &ndash; fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable drugs, amikacin, kanamycin or capreomycin &ndash; leaving patients with XDR-TB few options.</p><p>Only 30% to 50% of people who have contracted XDR-TB have been cured of the disease, the CDC said.</p><p>The agency noted that XDR-TB is of particular concern for people with HIV infection or other conditions in which the immune system is weakened &ndash; putting those populations at a much higher risk of death if they develop that form of tuberculosis.</p><p>Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease, whether the patient's immune system is weakened and adherence to treatment, the CDC said.</p><p>The woman infected with XDR-TB was transported on 5 June from Chicago to the NIH via special air and ground ambulances, the biomedical research agency told Scrip. </p><p>The CDC is working with the Illinois Department of Health to try to trace the people the NIH patient may have come in contact with in the US after she arrived in Chicago from India in April, agency spokesman Tom Skinner told Scrip.</p><p>He said before being hospitalized in Chicago, the woman, whose current condition is listed as stable, had spent time in at least three US states &ndash; Illinois, Missouri and Tennessee.</p><p>She was diagnosed with XDR-TB seven weeks after arriving in the US, Mr Skinner said.</p><p>He said further drug susceptibility testing currently is underway at the CDC, which will guide the patient's treatment.</p><p>Neither the CDC nor the NIH would disclose what drugs the XDR-TB-infected patient was receiving.</p><p>More than 60 cases of XDR-TB have been reported in the US since 1993, according to the CDC.</p><p>Like typical tuberculosis, XDR-TB is spread through airborne bacteria from a person with the disease who coughs, sneezes, shouts or sings. People who breathe in the air containing the bacteria &ndash; which can float for several hours, depending on the environment &ndash; can become infected.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
