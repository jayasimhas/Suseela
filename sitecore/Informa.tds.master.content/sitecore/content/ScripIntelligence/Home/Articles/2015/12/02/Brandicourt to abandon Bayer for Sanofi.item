<p> <i>Scrip</i> was intrigued to learn of media reports suggesting Olivier Brandicourt, CEO of Bayer Healthcare, is to be named the successor to ousted Christopher Viehbacher, former CEO of Sanofi, by this weekend. While it is clear to see why he would be a frontrunner from the point of view of chairman and interim CEO Serge Weinberg &ndash;his credentials as a top-level pharma executive are impeccable (not to mention his French connections), it is less obvious why he might be tempted by the job. </p> <p> Both Sanofi and Bayer declined to comment on the speculation. </p> <p> Scrip last caught up with Dr Brandicourt in December at the 10th annual Scrip Awards, where he collected the gong on behalf of Bayer Healthcare, which won in the Best Pharma Company of the Year category. There was nothing to suggest in his acceptance speech, or his more informal interactions during the rest of the evening, that he was contemplating an exit strategy. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/E1EC5C9FB4F147B5B1870C647B1E77D4.ashx"></p> <p> <i>Dr Olivier Brandicourt, CEO, Bayer Healthcare</i> </p> <p> Dr Brandicourt has been CEO, and chairman of Bayer Healthcare's board, since 2013. His appointment was a real feather in the cap for Bayer. He was a permanent replacement for Dr Joerg Reinhardt, who decided to return to Novartis. Dr Brandicourt was recruited from Pfizer, where he spent many years in various roles, including president and general manager of the emerging markets and established products business units. </p> <p> During Sanofi's annual results presentation recently, Mr Weinberg said the board was making good progress in the search for his replacement and was talking to &quot;a limited number of candidates.&quot; Sanofi, he added, hoped to &quot;make an announcement in the course of the first quarter.&quot; </p> <p> Who these candidates might be remains undisclosed, but early contenders such as Takeda's Christophe Weber and AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot have apparently ruled themselves out. </p> <p> Meanwhile, Bayer has assured Scrip that the interview scheduled with Dr Brandicourt next week, to coincide with Bayer's annual results, is still very much on. </p>
