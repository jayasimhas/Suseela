<p>Dezima Pharma has published highly positive results of the Phase IIb TULIP study with its CETP inhibitor, TA-8995, in the <i>Lancet</i>. The potency demonstrated by Dezima's product suggests it has potential as a more cost-effective option for lowering cholesterol than the PCSK9 inhibitor approach.</p><p>The data have generated an "incredible amount of interest", study investigator and Dezima founder Professor John Kastelein told <i>Scrip</i>. The publication and the interest are timely as the next step in the product's development is a large Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial, slated to begin in the first half of 2016. Dezima is currently evaluating various options to fund the Phase III trial, for which the protocol has been finalized and discussions with regulators planned for this summer. Funding options include partnering and/or licensing the product, and going to the markets or taking out a bank loan to raise the cash, said Prof Kastelein. "The road to Phase III doesn't look all that difficult," he added.</p><p>Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition had fallen out of favor with pharma companies after two high profile failures. </p><p>Roche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CETP-arena-sees-another-major-casuality-as-Roche-drops-dalcetrapib-330242" target="_new">abandoned</a> Phase III studies of the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib in 2012 after an interim analysis of the dal-OUTCOMES study revealed a lack of clinically meaningful efficacy. </p><p>In addition, Pfizer's CETP inhibitor torcetrapib came to a very public end in late 2006, after being hit in Phase III by increased risk of death and cardiovascular events associated with raised blood pressure, altered serum electrolytes and increased aldosterone levels rather than a lack of efficacy. </p><p>These failures <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-is-a-lonely-hunter-in-CETP-field-342787" target="_new">dampened sentiment</a> for this class with just Merck & Co's anacetrapib and Lilly's evacetrapib still ongoing in Phase III.</p><p>"We are planning a Phase III trial the size of Lilly's 12,000-patient ACCELERATE evacetrapib study rather than Merck's 30,000-patient REVEAL anacetrapib study," noted Prof Kastelein. Dezima's data "has no consequence" to either of these studies as they are fully enrolled. Dezima is looking forward to the readout from both competitor trials in 2016, he added. </p><p><b>TULIP details</b></p><p>The Phase IIb TULIP study was conducted in specialized cardiovascular centers across Denmark and the Netherlands. A total of 364 individuals with dyslipidemia were randomized into nine cohorts: placebo, TA-8995 as monotherapy at different doses, or in combination with different statins. The study investigated the effects of TA-8995 on a wide range of established cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers over a three month dosing period.</p><p>The results showed potent effects on the primary endpoint, which was a composite of change from baseline in LDL-C and HDL-C. 5mg of TA-8995 reduced LDL-C by 45% and increased HDL-C by 161%. 10mg of TA-8995 in combination with statin therapy reduced LDL-C by an additional 48%. With this combination therapy nearly all patients achieved the most stringent LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/l.="" in="" addition,="" ta-8995="" boosted="" cholesterol="" efflux="" significantly.="" ta-8995="" was="" safe="" and="" well="" tolerated="" without="" any="" drug="" accumulation="" as="" has="" been="" reported="" with="" other="" cetp=""></1.8></p><p>"Cholesterol efflux represents the capacity of plasma to remove toxic cholesterol from the plaque in the coronary arteries. It has recently been established that cholesterol efflux is a strong and inverse, independent risk factor for cardiovascular events," explained Philip Barter, Professor at the University of New South Wales, Sydney and member of the scientific advisory board of Dezima. "At the 5mg dose, TA-8995 increases this capacity by over 40%, when compared to placebo. This is an unparalleled finding for any oral medication to date. Adding to the potent LDL-C reduction, this is expected to have a large, additional effect on the relative risk reduction for cardiovascular events in the Phase III program of TA-8995."</p><p>"This study clearly shows that TA-8995 is a best-in-class CETP inhibitor," added Dezima's CEO Rob de Ree. "Besides its strong differentiation within the CETP inhibitor class, we believe TA-8995 to be well positioned vis-&agrave;-vis PCSK9 antibodies in treating dyslipidemia from a perspective of efficacy, price and delivery. Besides requiring frequent injections, PCSK9 antibodies will likely be expensive and have not shown any beneficial effect on cholesterol efflux."</p><p>An editorial in the <i>Lancet</i> agrees. "The magnitude of the reduction in LDL cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) achieved by TA-8995 means that this oral compound is comparable with the potent subcutaneous PCSK9 inhibitors. This makes TA-8995 a potentially viable, and likely cheaper, oral alternative to PCSK9 inhibitors," write researchers Kausik Ray and Antonio Vallejo-Vaz.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Regeneron-faces-uphill-battle-with-Praluent-358245" target="_new">Sanofi/Regeneron</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Repatha-edges-ahead-in-the-EU-with-CHMP-nod-358578" target="_new">Amgen</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-bococizumab-will-dominate-358599" target="_new">Pfizer</a> are in a race to get competing PCSK9 inhibitors to market.</p><p>"These were quite positive lipid changes for TA-8995. The Lancet editorial pointed out that it is the most potent CETP inhibitor available based on the data," said <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts.</p><p>"LDL-c reductions for monotherapy were up to 45.3%. In combination with statins, they were up to 68.2%, and the publication noted the combination would confer an additional 39.8-50.2% above statins alone. Our calculation just based on the percent reductions were 33-42%. Some of these results approach those for the PCSK9 inhibitors (monotherapy: 48% for Praluent, up to 56.9-58.8% for Repatha; in combination with statins drops have been in the 46-60+% range). Like the PCSK9 inhibitors, TA-8995 also lowered Lipoprotein(a). Since TA-8995 is oral, if it has clinical outcomes that are close, it is likely to be used first."</p><p><i>BioMedTracker</i> noted that the mechanism still needs to be proven to lower cardiovascular outcomes, after the failure of torcetrapib and dalcetrapib. "Some have questioned whether CETP inhibitors cause dysfunctional HDL. On the other hand, torcetrapib's failure was due to off-target effects, and dalcetrapib had a more modest impact on HDL-c and did not lower LDL-c &ndash; as well as a slight increase in blood pressure. Hence there has been more hope for the current trials of anacetrapib and evacetrapib which do lower LDL-c. The current publication also noted that dalcetrapib only had modest results on a cholesterol efflux assay (an increase of 9.5%), whereas evacetrapib increased it more in a separate study (28%), and TA-8995 by an even greater amount (36.7%). TA-8995 also increased apoA-1, the HDL apolipoprotein, so it will be interesting to see if the HDL changes add anything to the LDL-c reductions for outcomes."</p><p>Dezima Pharma was founded in 2012 by Prof Kastelein, who is Professor of Medicine at the Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. It is financed by Forbion Capital Partners, BioGeneration Ventures and New Science Ventures. TA-8995 was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Additional-properties-signal-promise-of-Mitsubishi-Tanabes-out-licensed-CETP-inhibitor-339270" target="_new">in-licensed</a> from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma.</p><p>
