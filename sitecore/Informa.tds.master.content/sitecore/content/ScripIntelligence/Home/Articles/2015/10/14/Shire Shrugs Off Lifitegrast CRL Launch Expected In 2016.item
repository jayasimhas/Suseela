<p>An early warning, and preparation, helped Shire PLC to blunt the impact of a US FDA complete response letter for its dry-eye candidate lifitegrast.</p><p>The specialty firm, which indicated during its second-quarter earnings call that an FDA action letter might be expected in July, announced both the letter and its response plan on Oct. 16: additional Phase III data from OPUS-3 should be in hand before year's end, which will enable Shire to refile the new drug application (NDA) in early 2016.</p><p>The small molecule integrin antagonist, which inhibits T-cell inflammation by blocking lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), is a high profile asset for the company, which is eager to build out an ophthalmology franchise. </p><p>Shire also has SHP607 in Phase II for retinopathy of prematurity and SHP616 in Phase I for acute neuromyelitis optica, and recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shire-Uses-Foresight-to-Expand-in-Ophthalmology-359754" target="_new">paid $300m to acquire</a> Foresight Biotherapeutics and its Phase III-ready conjunctivitis candidate FST-100, which would provide a synergistic fit with the planned commercial structure for lifitegrast.</p><p>But Wall Street took the news evenhandedly, with analysts saying first-pass approval of lifitegrast seemed unlikely, but that if the results of the just completed Phase III OPUS-3 trial are successful, a quick response to FDA followed by a third quarter 2016 approval is a good bet.</p><p>In a statement Oct. 19, Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said top-line data from OPUS-3 are expected before the end of the year; analysts expect results in November. The NDA was backed by a Phase II trial that showed efficacy in both signs and symptoms of dry-eye disease, an unmet medical need, but a pair of Phase III studies, OPUS-1 and OPUS-2, produced conflicting results.</p><p>OPUS-1, conducted in patients with less severe disease, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/SARcode-Bioscience-eyes-positive-Phase-III-data-for-lead-product-336523" target="_new">demonstrated efficacy in signs of dry eye but not symptoms</a>, while OPUS-2, in moderate-to-severe patients, showed efficacy in symptoms of dry eye but not signs of the disease.</p><p>The centerpiece of Shire's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shire-punts-160m-on-second-eye-care-firm-SARcode-341496" target="_new">$160 million acquisition in 2013</a> of SARcode Bioscience Inc., as well as Ornskov's strategy to add ophthalmology to the company's core areas, lifitegrast could enable the Irish-domiciled firm to compete with Allergan PLC's Restasis (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion), which is approved for increasing tear production but not specifically for dry-eye disease. Although it posted $1.2bn in sales in 2015, Restasis generally is not seen as greatly effective.</p><p>In an Oct. 17 note on the complete response letter (CRL), ISI Evercore analyst Umer Raffat expressed optimism that OPUS-3 data would be positive and that Shire would obtain approval of lifitegrast by the third quarter of next year. However, he does not expect the drug's impact on Restasis to be substantial.</p><p>"I think lifitegrast approval may likely cap volume growth for Restasis, and there may perhaps be some volume loss, but likely not much more impact than that," Raffat said. </p><p>Modest price increases could offset the impact of new competition, the analyst added, and Allergan continues to profess that the main challenge for Restasis is not questions of its efficacy, but obtaining coverage by managed care.</p><p><b>Additional Trial Less Onerous Than Broader Request</b></p><p>UBS Investment Research analyst David Evans predicted in an Oct. 19 note that the OPUS-3 data would be successful and lead to a 2016 approval and launch with peak sales of $2bn. The CRL may not be a huge hurdle for Shire, he added, because it seeks an additional trial rather than using broader language calling for "more clinical evidence." This suggests FDA decided to hold off on approval because data from OPUS-3 are imminent, Evans posited.</p><p>OPUS-3 was designed similar to OPUS-2 in terms of accepting patients with moderate to severe dry-eye disease and requiring patients with history of artificial tear usage. It seems likely, Raffat indicated, that Shire will duplicate the results of OPUS-2 by showing efficacy in symptoms of the disease, which is FDA's main priority in approving a drug therapy for dry eye.</p><p>A randomized, 12-week study that enrolled 711 patients, OPUS-3 is evaluating lifitegrast's safety as well as efficacy as measured by patient-reported symptom improvement using the Eye Dryness Score (EDS) scale, Shire said. The results will augment the dataset comprising four randomized clinical trials in more than 1,800 patients, including a Phase II trial, two prior Phase III trials and a long-term Phase III safety study called SONATA, the company added.</p><p>The CRL also asks for additional information on product quality. Both Evans and Raffat said they believe this is a minor issue that can be addressed with ongoing chemistry, manufacturing and controls work.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">&ldquo;The Pink Sheet&rdquo; Daily</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
