<p>While investors may at first glance be right in bludgeoning Sun Pharma's shares the day after a 20 July management update painted a grim picture on FY16 earnings, some analysts are also pointing to a clutch of "momentum catalysts" to keep an eye out for despite the ongoing challenges. </p><p>Sun Pharma's stock was on a downward spiral in early trade the morning after the firm's top brass said that consolidated revenues in FY16 were likely to remain flat or decline over FY15, with profits also potentially hit due to certain "expenses/charges" arising out of the Ranbaxy integration as well as remedial actions at various sites. Sun announced in March the closure of the merger with Ranbaxy.</p><p>Sun's shares declined by 14.95% to end at INR805.3 ($12.6) on 21 July on the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p><p>But amid the general gloom, some analysts point to nuggets of seemingly undervalued elements that may just be worth pondering. </p><p>"Prima facie the market reaction is valid but there are also some serious positives," Manish Jain, a founder partner of SageOne Investment Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>While some Sun products for the US are undoubtedly under a cloud, Mr Jain referred to Sun's ramp up of its ophthalmology team in the US as well as the setting up of a dedicated team for the firm's late-stage asset for chronic plaque psoriasis, tildrakizumab (MK-3222), currently in Phase-III trials. Both underscore the firm's general confidence around the products in the segment, analysts suggest.</p><p>Some analysts also believe that things may be on the mend in terms of cGMP compliance issues and referred to the generally encouraging statements from an otherwise conservative firm, though there's still some trepidation on the overall sales outlook. </p><h2>Ophthalmology and OTC </h2><p>Sun's top brass said that the firm had strengthened its ophthalmology and OTC teams in the US. Sun expects to build on Ranbaxy's consumer healthcare business.</p><p>Sun's founder and managing director, Dilip Shanghvi, said that the firm had set up a sales and marketing group focused on the ophthalmic business. </p><p>"The idea is to launch Xelpros (latanoprost BAK-free eye drops) that we've licensed and then, subsequently, other products which are in pipeline. And we're looking at licensing a few other products. That's the broad objective for the ophthalmology business," Mr Shanghvi said in response to an analyst's query.</p><p>Earlier this year, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/SPARC-close-to-licensing-epilepsy-therapy-in-US-358907" target="_new">licensed out</a> Xelpros to a subsidiary of Sun Pharma for the US market. Last December the FDA had issued a Complete Response letter for the NDA for Xelpros, which has since been replied to and a response is awaited. SPARC had earlier said that the most important part of the CRL was that there was no additional demand for any clinical data or preclinical data on safety or efficacy.</p><p>Mr Shanghvi also described Ranbaxy's consumer product business as a high-margin, high-growth business and one that Sun intends to use as a basis for creating a global OTC business. </p><p>"So we are actually giving a lot of internal focus and importance on growing that part of the business," he said. </p><p>Sun is also looking at the possibility of launching branded products in emerging markets. </p><p>"We're also looking at developing products for regulated market with a view to not only developing a private label business, but also to use our product for branding in these markets. So all of this, I think, is with a view to creating a future potential upside. It will potentially impact our ability to grow profitability till the business becomes self-sustaining and profitable," Mr Shanghvi said.</p><p>Sun may, however, discontinue certain low-margin Ranbaxy businesses that do not have long-term strategic value. </p><h2>MK-3222</h2><p>Sun clearly remains gung-ho on the prospects of tildrakizumab, its anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody.</p><p>The firm mentioned significant market preparatory efforts. Mr Shanghvi noted how prior to a potential launch of a large biologic product, you require a "comprehensive and large organization" to ensure that by the time the product is close to launch, all relevant issues which will allow you to "make a product successful" have been addressed given that Sun will be competing with very large multinationals. </p><p>"So we are hiring people with biologics background having managed reimbursement, pricing, regulatory, medical affairs. So all of these skill sets which are specific to MK-3222 and also then look at which are the other indications that we can develop this product for. And, wherever necessary, maybe to consider initiating additional studies, so that we don't lose time on other indications going forward."</p><p>Amgen's decision to dump co-development and commercialization plans of the interleukin-17 inhibitor brodalumab with AstraZeneca had earlier seemingly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sun-gung-ho-on-psoriasis-asset-amid-brodalumab-setback-358664" target="_new">buoyed the outlook</a> for tildrakizumab. Last year Sun had acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab, Merck & Co's late-stage asset for chronic plaque psoriasis. </p><h2>Compliance issues</h2><p>While GMP compliance issues are far from resolved at Sun and Ranbaxy, Sun's top brass made some definitive statements to suggest that things may be on the mend.</p><p>Remedial measures at Sun's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sun-feels-heat-of-surprise-FDA-scrutiny-353826" target="_new">Halol</a> site had resulted in supply constraints for some of the products and Sun said that it expects the situation to continue for "some more time" till these steps are completed.</p><p>In response to an analyst's query on whether Sun may not be really constrained to supply more if it thinks it has fixed the issues at Halol, though the FDA would come back for re-inspection, Mr Shanghvi said: "I think your understanding is correct." </p><p>Sun's boss, though, added that should the FDA have observations related to the facility and if Sun wants to make changes, then that could disrupt supply for a period of time. Sun also indicated that there are products that it continues to sell out of the Halol site, while there are a few others which have supply constraints.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i> that he anticipated no major escalation in FDA-related issues at Sun's Halol site and believes things may just be a "bit more positive", going by the Sun's response at the investor call.</p><p>Sun also indicated that remedial action at Ranbaxy's Mohali, Dewas, Poanta Sahib and Toansa facilities was on track. </p><p>"We are working towards the fulfilment of the requirements of the US consent decree and will try to expedite the resolution for at least one of these facilities," a statement from Sun added.</p><p>The brokerage CLSA was earlier reported as saying that a potential resolution of compliance issues at the Mohali plant could de-risk operations at Halol and Ohm Labs (Ranbaxy's US arm).</p><p>Mr Mehta also underscored that the potential revenue impact for FY16 was perhaps along expected lines. "We had factored in sales growth of about 4% for FY16, so more or less flattish," he said.</p><p>He is also upbeat about the enhanced synergy benefits referred to by Sun. Mr Mehta claims this is significant given that it does not factor in upsides resulting from potential resolution of some plant related issues at Ranbaxy as hinted by the Sun top brass. Sun has raised its target for the synergy benefits from the Ranbaxy acquisition by 15-20% as compared to its original target of $250m by FY18.</p>
