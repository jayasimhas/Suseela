<p> The European Medicine Agency's scientific advisors group recommended on 22 May that Imbruvica (ibrutinib) should be indicated for the treatment of Waldenstr?m&rsquo;s macroglobulinaemia (WM), a very rare blood cell cancer characterized by vast overproduction of immunoglobulin M (IgM). The recent approval of ibrutinib in the US, and its imminent approval in Europe not only provide WM patients with first- and second-line treatment options, but also, says one key opinion leader in WM, will provide a focus for more productively organized patient group and physician activity. </p><p> The recommendation from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) follows the FDA's approval of ibrutinib for WM in January 2015. </p><p> If the European Commission follows CHMP's advice, ibrutinib will be the first EU-approved treatment for WM. Previous putative treatments for WM include a number of other high profile drugs such as Takeda's Velcade (bortezomib), Rituxan (rituximab), Celgene's thalidomide and lenalidomide, simvastatin and Pfizer's Viagra (sildenafil citrate). </p><p> Other clinical hopefuls over the years in WM have included GlaxoSmithKline/Genmab's Arzerra (ofatumumab), Onyx Therapeutics' oprozomib and Human Genome Sciences' Benlysta (belimumab) when it was known as LymphoStat-B. </p><p> Professor Meletios Dimopoulos, chair of Clinical Therapeutics at the University of Athens School of Medicine and a board member of the International Waldenstrom&rsquo;s Macroglobulinemia Foundation told Scrip that only one of the earlier trials on a randomized basis likely to have delivered a clear clinical outcome. That began in 2007 and compared chlorambucil and fludarabine as initial therapies for WM. However, by the time it was completed, the scientific understanding of WM had moved on, he said, and ibrutinib had emerged as a potential target-directed treatment. </p><p> Professor Dimopoulos is involved in an international phase III follow up to the phase II study that lead to ibrutinib's positive recommendation from CHMP. That trial (NCT02165397), which has been running for nearly a year, compares the use of rituxan plus ibrutinib with rituxan alone in treating around 180 WM patients. Its cross-over design allows patients to be switched to the ibrutinib arm should early results indicate that is advantageous. </p><p> Ibrutinib's success in WM can be attributed to a fit between its molecular action and the molecular pathology of the disease. Mutations prevalent in WM are known to trigger tumor cell growth through Bruton's tyrosine kinase, the molecular target of ibrutinib. </p><p> While the CHMP recommendation is clearly a boon for WM patients, the addition of the new indication will not greatly expand the market for the drug. Ibrutinib is already indicated in Europe for the more common orphan diseases chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma which between them affect around 170,000 people in the European Union. The number of new cases of Waldenstr?m&rsquo;s macroglobulinemia per year in the EU is less than 3000. </p><p> Both the US approval and the CHMP's recommendation were based on a phase II trial of 63 patients with WM that had received previous treatment. The trial showed that ibrutinib decreased median serum IgM levels 75% from 3500 mg per deciliter to around 900 mg per deciliter (still nearly three times higher than the upper limit of the normal range). More significantly, there was progression-free survival in approximately 80% of patient to at least 18 months. </p><p> A <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1501548" target="_new">recently published update to that result</a> in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> showed that there was no disease progression in nearly 70% of patients after two years. </p>
