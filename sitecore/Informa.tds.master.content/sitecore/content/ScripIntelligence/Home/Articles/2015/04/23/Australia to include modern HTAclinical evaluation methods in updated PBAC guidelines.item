<p>Australian health minister Sussan Ley has announced an in-depth review of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) guidelines, which are used by the pharmaceutical industry to prepare submissions to the PBAC for the listing of products on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</p><p>The PBAC decides which products should be funded under the PBS on the basis of clinical and health economic data submitted by manufacturers. But the submission guidelines, which were last revised in 2008, are widely acknowledged to be out of step with recent developments in areas such as health technology assessments (HTA) and clinical evaluation methods. </p><p>The PBAC, its subcommittees and the pharmaceutical industry have identified a number of significant changes in the methods used to prepare submissions that they say could be examined in the review and incorporated into an updated version of the guidelines. Areas to be addressed include clinical evaluation methods, the role of new methodologies in health economics, and the need to ensure that the PBAC assessment processes are consistent and transparent.</p><p>Tim James, CEO of the industry body Medicines Australia, welcomed the review, saying the current guidelines were significantly out of date compared with HTA guidelines elsewhere in the world and "no longer provide consistent guidance to anticipate PBAC decision making". </p><p>He said his association had been calling on the PBAC and the department to update the guidelines for the past three years. Specific requests included "updates to provide clarity on choice of comparator, short-term funding options including managed access programmes, consistency within Section E, e-submissions, or treatment of clinical evidence including progression free survival or observational data".</p><p>According to the Department of Health, the PBAC guidelines "help ensure Australians have access to safe, clinically proven and cost effective medicines as soon as possible, while safeguarding the sustainability of the PBS so it can benefit future generations". It said the review would "contribute to ensuring PBAC processes remain consistent, transparent, and evolve to address contemporary methodological issues associated with PBS access and support the government&rsquo;s deregulation agenda". </p><p>The review will be carried out by an independent contractor, with the support of the guidelines review steering committee, which consists of Australian and international experts. The department announced the tender for the review on 27 April. Once the review is completed, the revised guidelines will be presented to the PBAC for approval.</p><h2>Changes in view </h2><p>Changes are expected to be made to most of the six sections of the guidelines. Section A (details of the medicine and the main comparator) will be updated to allow the information to be presented more clearly and concisely. </p><p>For Section B (clinical evaluation), the review will look at the most recent approaches to clinical evaluation published in the literature, new methods for indirect comparisons, and updated methods for determining the "minimal clinically important difference". It will also evaluate the usefulness of including subgroup analyses in the comparative effectiveness evaluation (Section B). At present the guidelines say that subgroup analyses should be covered in Section C (adapting clinical results for economic evaluation) but it may be beneficial to include them in Section B in certain circumstances. </p><p>The review of Section B will also look at the statistical methods used to interpret overall survival where a trial allows crossover from one randomised group to another within a trial (or switching to another trial/therapeutic regimen) following a disease progression event, "or when evidence exists that equipoise may no longer be assumed". </p><p>The Section C review will include an examination of surrogate-to-final outcomes. </p><h2>New HTA methods</h2><p>Section D, on the economic evaluation, will be redrafted to ensure the content is clear and consistent with current health economic terms and with any recent policies, such as the new PBS pricing structure for chemotherapy agents. </p><p>It will also look at the possible role of new methods in health economics that could be used in cost-utility or cost-effectiveness analyses, taking account of issues currently being reviewed by the PBAC, such as discrete event simulation and the relevance to PBAC guidance of cost-utility analysis at other international HTA agencies such as NICE (England) and CADTH (Canada). </p><p>For Section E (budgetary implications), the methods used to prepare estimates of utilisation in the PBS will be reviewed, as will the 2010 "Compliance to Medicines Working Group" report, which looked at the factors influencing patient compliance with prescribed medicines and the effects of compliance on health outcomes.</p><p>No mention is made of particular changes to Section F (other information).</p>
