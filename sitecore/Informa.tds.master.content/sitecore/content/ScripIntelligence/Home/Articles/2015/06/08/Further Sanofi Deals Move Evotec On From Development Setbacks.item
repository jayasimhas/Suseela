<p>Evotec has signed two more R&D deals with French major Sanofi that it hopes will help it move on from previous R&D disappointments. </p><p>Along with its Austrian develoment partner Apeiron Biologics, Evotec signed a strategic pact on Aug. 10 to develop next-generation immuno-oncology therapies based on small molecules with Sanofi. </p><p>The move follows the Aug. 7 announcement that the two firms will jointly develop a beta cell replacement therapy to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells from stem cells for diabetic patients. </p><p>Evotec wants to evolve into an integrated multi-service biopharma company through a three-pronged strategy using a high-growth drug-discovery business, a series of pipeline options that pose no financial obligation for the German biotech, and its growing list of biotech and scientific collaborations that offer potential long-term value. </p><p>But its hopes for generating its own proprietary products have had two serious setbacks recently. After disappearance last year of its drug hope DiaPep277 due to fraud, Evotec had been looking to its Alzheimer's MAO partnership with Roche for a breakthrough. However the MAO-B inhibitor RG1577 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/RocheEvotecs-Alzheimers-candidate-fails-359209" target="_new">failed in a key Phase IIb trial</a> at the end of June. That has made Evotec's previous <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Evotec-snares-250m-in-Sanofi-discovery-deal-355395" target="_new">five-year R&D alliance</a> with Sanofi &ndash; and now the oncology and beta cell discovery alliances - even more important for the German biotech's future growth. </p><p>In the IO deal, Sanofi will support two years of research funding for Evotec and Apeiron, and pay Evotec potentially more than &euro;200m ($219m) if promising molecules are identified. Sanofi will have sole responsibility for all development, regulatory, commercial and manufacturing activities of the products that result.</p><p>"We see it as a positive that Evotec now has a foothold in such a hot trend as immunotherapy in oncology. Immuno-oncology is now considered a particularly promising field to create superior and potentially curative treatment options for many cancer patients," said analysts at German bank Oddo Seydler in reaction to the biotech's latest deal with France's biggest drug maker. </p><p>Under the diabetes pact, the German biotech could earn more than over &euro;300m ($327m). </p><p>"Just as importantly for us, this deal gives Evotec an opportunity to own resulting therapy products," the biotech's CEO Werner Lanthaler said. Evotec reports second-quarter results on Aug. 12.</p><p>Philip Larsen, Sanofi's global head of diabetes research said in a statement that the collaboration "will leverage Evotec's expertise in technology and Sanofi's extensive experience and leadership in diabetes. Our shared vision is to change how diabetes is treated in the future by developing novel therapeutic approaches to disease management."</p><p>Lanthaler said the beta cell alliance brought together two companies with complementary expertise, adding: "For us, it is a risk-free project with considerable upside, not least because it is an exclusive deal with Sanofi in the field of regenerative medicine in diabetes, and basically is a huge commitment from both sides &ndash; they go exclusively with us, and we go exclusively with them."</p><p>Evotec and Sanofi hope to develop a beta cell replacement therapy based on functional human beta cells derived from human stem cells. The duo will also use human beta cells for high-throughput drug screening to identify beta cell active small molecules or biologics.</p><p>"The big question for all diabetes players is whether or not there is a next generation treatment beyond insulin," Lanthaler said. "All big players in this field are trying to improve the way we look upon the diabetes world. There is only one mechanism that is relevant for the disease and that's beta cell function. So the question is: how can one ultimately produce an unlimited amount of beta cells and how can you regenerate beta cells in the human body? "</p><p>Evotec expertise in the area is based on its July 2010 acquisition of German metabolic disease-focused private biotech DeveloGen AG, which brought it a project targeting beta cell regeneration for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. "And that's where all our knowledge in field comes from," Lanthaler said. The German mid-cap has also been collaborating with Harvard University since March 2011 to develop new diabetes therapies targeting beta cell regeneration.</p><p>Sanofi for its part is committed to developing cell therapies for treating diabetes, which is a big reason why Evotec decided to team up with the French pharma in that area. </p><p>"Sanofi is the perfect partner for us in this area because they are number two behind Novo Nordisk AS in the field of insulin and thus highly incentivized to go forward. As the Swedes say, 'a hungry wolf is a better hunter'," Lanthaler said. Other leading diabetes players include Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH and Janssen Inc. </p><h2>IO Alliance</h2><p>The duo's latest alliance, to develop next-generation immuno-oncology therapies, builds on their decision late last year to form a five-year drug discovery collaboration focused on Evotec's small-molecule discovery platforms. That pact will see them combine their libraries of approximately 1.7 million compounds and offer them for screening to Evotec's business partners, both biotech and big pharma players. </p><p>That arrangement saw Evotec assume operational responsibility for Sanofi's troubled R&D facility in Toulouse, France. Sanofi has been ensnared in a long battle with French labor unions over whether or not it could close the plant. To placate the French government, Sanofi promised to keep the facility open until 2018, an outcome that now seems likely given its new deal with Evotec. Lanthaler said the alliance held massive promise for Evotec which, if true, could see the site operating well beyond 2018.</p><p>The oncology collaboration includes major R&D efforts to advance the small-molecule approach to treat solid and blood cancers by enhancing the anti-tumour activity of human lymphocytes. Based on Evotec's technological expertise and Apeiron Biologics' immunological know-how, the collaboration will also focus on the identification of novel small molecule hits and their targets for next-generation therapies in immuno-oncology, which are expected to complement the current offerings of checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p>"Evotec began cooperating with Apeiron in early 2013, so this partnership is now bearing fruit. The program is at an early stage, however. Also, no specific indications have been determined so far, the Oddo Seydler analysts said.</p><p><p><p>
