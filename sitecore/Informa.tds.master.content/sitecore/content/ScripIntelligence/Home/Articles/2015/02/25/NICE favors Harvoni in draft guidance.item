<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, has given the green light for Gilead's hepatitis C combination Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) to be used on the NHS, though with several restrictions.</p><p>Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: "Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir offers the possibility of a shortened course of treatment &ndash; in some cases as little as eight weeks &ndash; without the need for combination therapy with interferon. This could make it more likely that people will seek treatment for their condition. In turn this could have important benefits, not just for people with chronic hepatitis, but also in reducing transmission of the virus to people without the infection. The committee therefore acknowledged that ledipasvir-sofosbuvir is a valuable new therapy for treating chronic hepatitis C."</p><p>NICE has recommended the product for several patient groups, but has denied use in others, much as it did with Gilead's monotherapy Sovaldi (sofosbuvir; <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-recommends-hep-C-drugs-Olysio-and-Sovaldi-356170" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 16 January 2015). Datamonitor analyst Michael Haydock commented that overall, the assessment is a good outcome for Gilead, but added that "there are a few restrictions that are likely to draw criticism from patient advocate groups."</p><p><b>Table 1: NICE's Harvoni recommendations</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Patient population</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>NICE decision</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Comments</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV without cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended for eight-week treatment course, but not for 12-week course</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee highlighted that base-case incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for eight weeks and 12 weeks of Harvoni were &pound;9,000 (compared with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin) and &pound;23,000 (compared with simeprevir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained respectively.</p><p>The committee concluded that, even allowing for a potential relapse rate of approximately 10%, eight weeks of Harvoni could be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee concluded that 12 weeks of ledipasvir&ndash;sofosbuvir could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources in this population.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-naive genotype 4 HCV without cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee concluded that it could not consider 12 weeks of Harvoni in people with treatment-naive, genotype 4 HCV without cirrhosis to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-naive genotype 1 or 4 HCV with cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended as a 12-week course, but not 24-week course</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee highlighted that the ICERs were &pound;5,000 (12 weeks of treatment, compared with no treatment) and &pound;45,000 (24 weeks of treatment, compared with sofosbuvir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) per QALY gained. On balance, the committee concluded that only 12-week ledipasvir&ndash;sofosbuvir treatment could be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources in people with treatment-naive genotype 1 or 4 HCV with cirrhosis.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-experienced genotype 1 or 4 HCV without cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended as a 12-week course, but not 24-week course</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee highlighted that the ICERs were &pound;17,000 (12 weeks of treatment, compared with no treatment) and &pound;77,500 (24 weeks of treatment, compared with simeprevir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin) per QALY gained. On balance, the committee concluded that only 12-week ledipasvir&ndash;sofosbuvir treatment could be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources in people with treatment-experienced genotype 1 or 4 HCV without cirrhosis.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-experienced genotype 1 or 4 HCV with cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee noted that the ICER for 24 weeks of Harvoni was &pound;32,500 per QALY gained (compared with sofosbuvir plus peginterferon alfa and ribavirin). The committee concluded that 24-week ledipasvir&ndash;sofosbuvir treatment could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources in people with treatment-experienced genotype 1 or 4 HCV with cirrhosis.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Genotype 3 HCV</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee emphasized their concerns about the robustness of the evidence base in people with genotype 3 HCV, and recognized that the uncertainties in the methods used to estimate the relative effectiveness still applied to its decision-making for people with genotype 3 HCV. </p><p>The committee noted that all the ICERs presented for those with treatment-naive genotype 3 HCV with or without cirrhosis were over &pound;30,000 per QALY gained. It noted that the ICERs for people with treatment-experienced, genotype 3 HCV and cirrhosis for whom interferon was not suitable ranged from &pound;18,000 to &pound;30,500 per QALY gained for 24 weeks of Harvoni plus ribavirin (compared with no treatment), and agreed this may increase when accounting for the additional uncertainty associated with the evidence. </p><p>The committee concluded that ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources in people with genotype 3 HCV.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>People co-infected with HIV</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee acknowledged that the company's interim results suggested that the SVR12 (sustained virologic response at 12 weeks) in people with HCV and HIV co-infection was similar to that seen in people with HCV mono-infection. The committee concluded that it was reasonable to extend the recommendations made for the mono-infected group to those co-infected with HCV and HIV.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>People with advanced liver disease and after liver transplant</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The committee highlighted that the marketing authorisation for Harvoni recommends only 24 weeks of treatment plus ribavirin in people with advanced liver disease and after liver transplant, which the company had not explored in its cost-effectiveness analysis. The committee concluded that without cost-effectiveness estimates it was unable to make recommendations in these patients.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><h2>Sticking points</h2><p>While the overall outcome is largely positive, there are a couple of restrictions in particular which may cause controversy. For example, NICE has not recommended Harvoni for treatment-experienced GT-1 patients with cirrhosis. Mr Haydock noted: "This part of the guidance is likely to be criticized because these patients have the lowest responses to interferon-based treatment and so are arguably the patients most in need of interferon-free therapy."</p><p>He added, "They are also considered very high priority for treatment so they can't exactly wait around for other options to launch [such as AbbVie's Viekirax (ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir) and Exviera (dasabuvir) combination]. 24 weeks of Harvoni with or without RBV cured 100% of treatment-experienced patients in the ION-2 study so the decision must have been based purely on the very high cost of treatment."</p><p>
