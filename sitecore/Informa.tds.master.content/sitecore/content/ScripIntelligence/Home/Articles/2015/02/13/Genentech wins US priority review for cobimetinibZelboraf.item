<p>If all goes well, Genentech, a unit of Roche, could have a decision from the FDA by late summer on the company's drug cobimetinib (GDC-0973, XL518) in combination with its approved drug Zelboraf (vemurafenib) as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma. </p><p>The FDA granted a priority review for the combination treatment, setting 11 August as the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date on the application, which was submitted this past December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/RocheGenentech-seek-FDA-nod-for-cobimetinibZelboraf-in-melanoma-355669" target="_new">15 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Cobimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, was discovered by Exelixis, which is partnered with Genentech on the drug. </p><p>Zelboraf, a kinase inhibitor, which gained the FDA's approval in August 2011, is indicated as a treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Genentech-Plexxikon-win-US-OK-for-melanoma-Rx-companion-DX-320049" target="_new">17 August 2011</a>).</p><p>Zelboraf was co-developed under a 2006 license and collaboration agreement between Roche and Plexxikon, now part of Daiichi Sankyo.</p><p>The application for cobimetinib plus Zelboraf was based on results of the coBRIM Phase III study, which showed people who received the MEK inhibitor and the kinase inhibitor lived significantly longer without their disease worsening or death, or progression-free survival (PFS), compared with Zelboraf alone &ndash; with a median PFS of 9.9 months versus 6.2 months respectively. </p><p>The most common adverse events seen in the combination arm included diarrhea, nausea, rash, photosensitivity and lab abnormalities. </p><p>The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events in the combination arm included liver lab abnormalities, elevated creatine phosphokinase and diarrhea.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
