<p>There were few surprises in the latest damning assessment about the poor response by the World Health Organization (WHO) to the Ebola crisis in West Africa &ndash; with many of the criticisms already laid out in previous reports, including in the global health group's own internal evaluation.</p><p>But the independent panel of outside experts, which was commissioned by WHO to take a thorough look at what went wrong in the Ebola response and provide recommendations on how to fix the situation, also pointed to something the agency actually did right &ndash; coordinating the research and development efforts for vaccines and drugs to combat the disease.</p><p>Indeed, WHO played a critical role with the medical products R&D work, despite a lack of funding to carry out that mission, declared the panel of academic experts, which was led by Dame Barbara Stocking, the president of Murray Edwards College at the University of Cambridge in the UK, who also is the former CEO of the humanitarian group Oxfam.</p><p>In fact, said Dame Stocking, one of the most important things WHO did throughout the Ebola crisis was acting as a "convener" &ndash; bringing public and private sector representatives together at several meetings.</p><p>She said WHO's efforts to help get drug and vaccine development fast-tracked was vital.</p><p>The health group also has provided valuable leadership for conducting trials to test the experimental products, the committee said in its 7 July report &ndash; calling those contributions "important." </p><p>While there had been some concerns raised about whether it was WHO's role to be involved in the drug and vaccine R&D effort &ndash; activities some said were distracting the health agency from its core response duties &ndash; the panel concluded "WHO should be commended for this work, as it stepped up to fill a void at a critical stage of the outbreak." </p><p>"WHO did the right thing to get people together" on the Ebola drugs vaccines development effort, Dame Stocking told reporters during a 7 July media briefing.</p><p>In its report, the panel insisted that WHO should continue to play a "central convening role" in the future to help accelerate the development of appropriate diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics and medical and information technology. </p><p>The committee acknowledged, however, that WHO initially was slow in using its convening powers to address the West African Ebola epidemic &ndash; waiting until August 2014 before it started discussions around drug and vaccine work.</p><p>While it's necessary to undertake research while an outbreak is ongoing "when there are both patients and contacts who can potentially benefit from participation in well-designed clinical trials," the panel said policies for WHO's engagement with non-state actors should not make partnerships with the private sector impossible in such circumstances.</p><p>Among its many recommendations, the committee said R&D of drugs, vaccines and diagnostics should be an ongoing process, so scale up of those products could be easily achieved when needed.</p><p>"The panel considers that during major outbreaks and public health emergencies of international concern, it is critical that affected communities and populations have access to new medical products as soon as they become available," the committee said in its report. </p><p><b>Outbreak status</b></p><p>Also on 7 July, WHO's International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on Ebola declared the virus, which has infected more than 27,550 people and killed over 11,200, continues to be a public health emergency of international concern &ndash; a status that has been in place since <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-declares-Ebola-international-public-health-emergency-353262" target="_new">August 2014</a>.</p><p>Liberia had been declared Ebola-free on 9 May, since no new cases had been identified for 42 days after the safe burial of the last person confirmed to have been infected with the virus.</p><p>But on 29 June, a post-mortem swab taken from a 17-year-old boy who died a day earlier tested positive for Ebola.</p><p>The health ministry in that country said the boy had come into contact with about 200 people while he had symptoms.</p><p>Since then, at least two others have developed the disease.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is still waiting to start the Phase III portion of its ongoing trial testing two Ebola vaccines &ndash; the PREVAIL study &ndash; which reached its 1,500 participant <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NIH-Ebola-vaccines-trial-meets-1500-enrollment-goal-358247" target="_new">enrollment goal in May</a> for the Phase II portion.</p><p>PREVAIL is testing two experimental vaccines that are being developed under partnerships between the NIH's National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and GlaxoSmithKline and NewLink Genetics and Merck.</p><p>With the drop-off of cases in Liberia, NIH has been trying to get the study started in neighboring Guinea.</p><p>The lead US investigator of PREVAIL, Dr Cliff Lane, deputy director for clinical research at NIAID, confirmed to <i>Scrip</i> on 3 July the Phase III portion of the study has not yet started. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting its own trial, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/25m-US-funded-study-goes-beyond-testing-Ebola-vaccine-357889" target="_new">STRIVE</a>, of the NewLink-Merck Ebola vaccine in Sierra Leone, where it plans to enroll more than 8,000 healthcare and other frontline workers</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
