<p>Talk of a biotech bubble has been rampant since US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen made comments last year about valuations in the industry. The argument that the biotech sector is currently in a bubble is an easy one to make &ndash; valuations have been high, the IPO window has been wide open and news of M&A has been in the headlines constantly. Now, more than two years into these plentiful times for biotech, many are wondering if the bubble will burst.</p><p>Breathe easy; it won't. However, <i>Scrip</i>'s Mandy Jackson makes the opposite argument <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/POINT-Yes-Biotech-Is-In-A-Bubble-360238" target="_new">here</a>.</p><p>Unlike previous times when biotechs have been riding high &ndash; like the early 2000s &ndash; this time around has been different. In the early part of the century, biotechs were taking full advantage of the IPO window and were getting high valuations based on the promise of exciting science. Investors were pouring their money into biotechs because of things like the human genome project and the lure of early gene therapies. While that science held promise, there was very little data to support those valuations. </p><p>The biotech market currently looks very different than it did 15 years ago. The sector now has companies like Amgen, Biogen, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Celgene that are considered "big biotechs." Some of these companies offer dividends like their big pharma counterparts, they have strong pipelines, a range of marketed products and their stock prices are well over $100 per share &ndash; these big companies now stand as the backbone of the biotech sector.</p><p>Beyond that, the small, young biotechs entering the public market look very different as well. These companies aren't just based on sound science, but have the data to back them up. Of the 143 companies that made an initial public offering in 2013 and 2014, 81% had a lead compound that was in Phase II or later, according to EY's Beyond Borders report. </p><p>Bubble believers would point to companies like Axovant Sciences as proof that the sector is in a bubble. The company debuted on the public market in June and brought in a record-breaking haul of $315m based on its single Phase II drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease &ndash; an area that is notorious for high-profile failures. While Axovant may not seem the soundest investment, there are always market outliers. </p><p>If you look back at market history, the thing that defined a bubble in any sector was when it burst. While this market is unlikely to continue at these highs, there isn't going to be a major crash. The market has already begun to normalize a bit as more generalized investors are shifting their investments to other areas of the market &ndash; a process that that happens cyclically. Even the IPO window is less wide open than it was last year; there were 29 biotech IPOs in the first half of 2015, down from the 41 that occurred in the first six months of 2014. </p><p>Expect to see biotech stocks move back to pre-2014 levels as the year progresses, particularly as the overall market moves into more of a bear cycle, but stop waiting for the other shoe to drop. </p><p><p><p>
