<p>Is it just a coincidence that the Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore, winners of the best actor and best actress Oscars this week, both portrayed people with severe and incurable progressive disorders of the central nervous system? (Redmayne plays Professor Stephen Hawking, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Moore portrays the fictional linguistics professor Dr Alice Howland, who finds out she has early-onset Alzheimer's disease.) </p><p>ALS is a rare disease, with only 5,600 people in the US diagnosed each year. That's roughly one every hour and a half. In contrast, the Alzheimer's Association says that in the US someone develops Alzheimer's every 67 seconds. With the ageing of the population, the rate is expected to increase to a new person developing the disease every 33 seconds by mid-century. Already it is the sixth leading cause of death in the US. This is a big problem affecting lots of people.</p><p>The fact is that as more and more people are living with dementia and other CNS diseases, it is less and less easy to ignore the reality of such conditions, and more and more of us want to think deeply about them, whether artistically or indeed scientifically. </p><p>However, we need to think about them financially and economically too. Total healthcare, long-term care and hospice spending for Alzheimer's and other dementias in the US is expected to rise from $214bn in 2014 to $1.2trn in 2050. But only three new dementia drugs have made it to market in 15 years.</p><p>By comparison, the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimated that total healthcare expenditure on cancer in the US in 2011 was around $89bn. The productivity of the cancer R&D pipeline is evident in the sheer volume of new cancer drugs emerging all the time (cancer indications topped novel drug approvals in the EU and US last year by some margin), and around 30% of all clinical trials are in oncology. Global spending on cancer R&D is five times that of dementia research. </p><p>New collaborative initiatives like the IMI's EPAD (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Overcoming-the-Alzheimers-challenge-I-SPY-style-356550" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 February 2015</a>), and the UK government's newly announced &pound;300m investment into dementia are therefore welcome, and we eagerly await details of the separate multi-million pound investment scheme to fund new drug R&D. But much more is still needed.</p>
