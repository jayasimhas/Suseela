<p>European, ophthalmology-focused biotech Mitotech is hoping positive results of a Phase II study for its dry eye product Visomitin (an ophthalmic formulation of SkQ1) will help the firm get a foothold in the US. </p><p>Mitotech's product, a small molecule engineered specifically for reducing oxidative stress inside mitochondria, is already approved in eye drop form in Russia. Now Mitotech is hoping the US Phase II study will help open doors to other markets. On the back of positive results the company is anticipating the start of a Phase III trial for the product in the fourth quarter of this year. </p><p>CEO of Mitotech, Natalia Perekhvatova said, "Dry eye syndrome is a growing and hugely under-served indication and our company is now well positioned for delivering a breakthrough product in this therapeutic area."</p><p>According to Mitotech, Visomitin is the first mitochondria-targeted antioxidant to reach clinical phase of development for an ophthalmic indication. The presence of SkQ1 in mitochondrial membrane enables mitochondria to protect itself from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by breaking the chain reaction of lipid destruction. This ability of the molecule to protect cells against oxidative stress plays a role in treating patients suffering from various age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and various ophthalmic conditions, Mitotech notes. </p><p>In the Phase II 90-paitent study, which used Ora's Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE) chamber to measure dry eye patients' ability to withstand a stressful environment on the eye, Visomitin demonstrated superiority over placebo in several endpoints such as: central (p = 0.036) and total corneal (p=0.045) fluorescein staining pre- to post-CAE and grittiness (p = 0.058) pre- to post-CAE at week four.</p><p>Visomitin was comfortable, well tolerated and there were no unexpected or serious ocular adverse events, Mitotech said. Additional data from the trial will be presented at the 2015 ARVO Annual Meeting in Colorado, 3-7 May. </p><p>Ms Perekhvatova said that now a "roadmap" has been laid out for the dry eye product: Mitotech is seeking potential partners to help speed up the process of getting to market in other regions outside of Russia. </p><p>Visomitin is Mitotech's most advanced product and only clinical asset. Its pipeline otherwise includes preclinical programs in the areas of uveitis, inflammation and neurodegeneration. </p><h2>competitive field</h2><p>It is estimated that about 8.3 million women and 4.1 million men in the US have moderate or severe symptoms of dry eye syndrome. As such dry eye is an indication which has garnered more attention from drug developers recently; while the ophthalmologic field as a whole has seen boosted investment. </p><p>According to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, there are currently four products targeting dry eye in Phase III development, 13 in Phase II, and two in Phase I. The main players include Novartis, which has five products in Phase II, Actavis, Valeant, Acuccela, Eleven and Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Meanwhile, Shire has recently filed a new drug application (NDA) in the US for its dry eye therapy lifitegrast. Earlier this month the product was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Shires-dry-eye-drug-lifitegrast-granted-speedy-review-357751?refid=RSSLATEST" target="_new">granted a priority review</a> from the FDA; a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date was set for 25 October 2015. </p>
