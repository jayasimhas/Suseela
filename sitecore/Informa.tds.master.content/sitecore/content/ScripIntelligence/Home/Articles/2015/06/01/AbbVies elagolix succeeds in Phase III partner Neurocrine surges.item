<p>The endometriosis drug candidate elagolix from AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences significantly reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with the uterine condition versus placebo in the first of two ongoing Phase III clinical trials and the partners hinted at a safety advantage over approved gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor inhibitors.</p><p>AbbVie gained 1.1% to close at $67.63 per share on 8 January after the data were announced, but its San Diego-based collaborator Neurocrine surged 25.6% to $27.48 &ndash; a new one-year high. Both the 150mg and 200mg doses of elagolix met the 872-patient Phase III trial's co-primary endpoints of reducing non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) and menstrual pain (dysmenorrheal) at three and six months as measured by the Daily Assessment of Endometriosis Pain scale (p<></p><p>Endometriosis occurs when tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus. In addition to severe pelvic pain, the condition can lead to infertility. It affects about 176m women worldwide, according to the World Endometriosis Research Foundation. </p><p>AbbVie's and Neurocrine's first Phase III study enrolled women between with ages of 18 and 49 who experience moderate-to-severe endometriosis-associated pain. The women will be followed for post-treatment evaluation or stay on treatment for a six-month extension period. </p><p>Data from the partners' similarly designed second Phase III study are expected in late 2015. A Phase IIb trial for women with uterine fibroids is ongoing. </p><p>Few details about safety findings in the first Phase III endometriosis clinical trial were reported, but AbbVie said the safety profile of elagolix was consistent with observations from prior studies. The trial's discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 5.9% for placebo, 6.4% for 150mg of elagolix once-daily and 9.7% for 200mg of elagolix twice daily.</p><p>The most common side effects were hot flush, headache, nausea and fatigue. Most of the adverse events were similar across drug and placebo treatment groups, but the occurrence of hot flush and bone mineral density (BMD) loss was dose-dependent. </p><p><b>Bone density loss</b></p><p>"Current therapy for endometriosis patients who fail oral contraceptives is generally limited to either injectables and/or drugs that result in meaningful bone loss and side effects such that the recommendation is to stop treatment after six to 12 months. Therefore, the value of a pill (oral) that appears reasonably well tolerated, that does not result in large degree of bone loss and can potentially be taken for long durations is quite meaningful," Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a 7 January note to AbbVie investors.</p><p>Detailed efficacy and safety data, including BMD loss, will be presented at a future medical conference. But by noting that the Phase III safety results were similar to Phase II findings, AbbVie hinted that elagolix &ndash; at least at the lowest dose &ndash; has a minimal effect on bone density, which could differentiate the drug from approved GnRH inhibitors. </p><p>"For the 150mg dose, in Study 603 the bone density changes for the spine and femur at six months were minimal &#8230; and the confidence intervals crossed zero or no change from baseline (suggesting that the 150mg dose possibly does not result in any bone loss at six months)," Dr Schoenebaum wrote. "But Phase II data suggest that a vast majority of patients respond well to 150mg, and we believe those efficacy results were likely reproduced in this Phase III study."</p><p>In terms of safety and tolerability, Sagient Research noted in a 7 January BioMedTracker report that elagolix does not cause amenorrhea (a halt in menstruation) in all patients, unlike GnRH antagonists administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, such as AbbVie's Lupron (leuprolide acetate) and Actavis's Trelstar (triptorelin pamoate; marketed ex-US). </p><p>"We are interested in whether patients who receive a cycle of elagolix treatment maintain endometriosis symptom control following treatment discontinuation. If effects are longer-lasting, patients could be cycled on and off elagolix to minimize potential bone density reductions. [AbbVie] stated that bone density reduction was dose-dependent, so lower dosages and treatment holidays could reduce long-term impact," Sagient said in its BioMedTracker analysis.</p><p>Sagient increased the likelihood of US FDA approval for elagolix by 1% to 68%, which is 6% above average for drugs in similar stages of development.</p><p>There are no other drugs in Phase III for endometriosis, according to the BioMedTracker database, and there's only one drug in Phase II &ndash; the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) Proellex (telapristone acetate) from Repros Therapeutics and Gedeon Richter.</p><p><p><p><p>
