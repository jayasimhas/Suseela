<p>One should not rule out Pfizer Inc. selling off more biosimilars than required under antitrust rules in its acquisition of Hospira Inc. All five biosimilars in Pfizer's clinical pipeline overlap with those in Hospira's, but even though only infliximab is required to be divested, the others could also be sold off to reach cost-saving targets.</p><p>Pfizer is divesting one candidate, its biosimilar to Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (infliximab), but could retain rights to commercialize it in the US.</p><p>The European Commission required Pfizer to divest the biosimilar within the European Economic Area as a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/EU-Demands-Pfizer-Offload-Infliximab-Biosimilar-In-Hospira-Buy-359785" target="_new">condition for approving</a> the Hospira acquisition. In its agreement with the EC, Pfizer committed to full divestment of the development, manufacturing and marketing rights of its infliximab biosimilar while keeping marketing rights outside Europe. </p><p>A Pfizer spokesperson explained that since the development program is global it has to divest the program. However, it could keep rights to sell the drug outside Europe in a deal with the buyer. As for who might acquire the program, the spokesperson said "we're currently exploring our options." </p><p>In Europe, Hospira and partner Celltrion Inc. are the only companies selling infliximab (Hospira sells it under the brand name Inflectra while Celltrion sells it as Remsima in some markets). </p><p>Two other companies, Pifzer and Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd., have biosimilars in advanced stages of development. The EC said it was concerned that following the merger, Pfizer would be likely to either delay or discontinue development of its infliximab in order to focus on Hospira's marketed product or hand back Hospira's product to its developer, Celltrion.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission did not find that the overlap between Hospira's and Pfizer's infliximab biosimilars would be anticompetitive. It noted that three other companies, Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd., Epirus Biopharmaceuticals Inc. and Amgen Inc., have infliximab biosimilars in clinical trials in the US.</p><p>Pfizer's infliximab biosimilar is in Phase III clinical trials. Celltrion submitted its biologics license application to FDA in August 2014 and FDA accepted it for review in October. An FDA advisory committee was scheduled to review it in March but the meeting was postponed due to what FDA described as "information requests pending with the sponsor" and it has not been rescheduled. The application's June 8 user fee deadline passed with no approval announcement from FDA or any comments from Celltrion and Hospira.</p><p>Pfizer said there was no new information on the application.</p><h2>Pfizer's Other Four Biosimilars Overlap With Hospira's Portfolio</h2><p>The biosimilar products that had been Hospira's will now belong to Pfizer, including those Hospira has developed and co-marketed with Celltrion. </p><p>Prior to the merger, Pfizer had five biosimilar candidates in clinical trials while Hospira had six in clinical development and two pending approval at FDA, a biosimiar to Epogen (epoetin alfa) submitted in January, and infliximab. </p><p>All the biosimilars in Pfizer's clinical pipeline overlap with those in Hospira's pipeline. As of July 28, all five of Pfizer's candidates were in Phase III, including biosimilars to </p><p>?Roche's Herceptin (trastuzumab)</p><p>?Genentech Inc./Biogen's Rituxan/MabThera (rituximab) </p><p>?AbbVie Inc.'s Humira (adalimumab)</p><p>?Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) and </p><p>?J&J's Remicade. </p><p>Hospira is partnered with Celltrion in developing biosimilars to all of these products.</p><p>Asked if Pfizer would continue to develop parallel products or sell them, Pfizer said it has not decided what to do with the portfolio.</p><h2>$800m Per Year In Cost Synergies</h2><p>Pfizer announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizer-Finally-Sealing-Hospira-Deal-360105" target="_new">completion of the Hospira acquisition</a> Sept. 3. </p><p>"Pfizer and Hospira are now one unified team providing patients with access to one of the broadest and most diverse portfolios of difficult-to-manufacture, life-saving sterile injectable products in the industry," John Young, group president of the Global Established Pharmaceutical (GEP) business, said in a release. "Together, we are also a leading global biosimilars company with a robust pipeline, best-in-class development capabilities and extensive real-world commercialization experience."</p><p>Hospira has been folded into the GEP unit. It is the largest of Pfizer's three operating units, accounting for 52% of the company's $49.6bn in 2014 sales. Pfizer's other two units are Global Innovative Pharmaceutical (GIP) and Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare (VOC). The Hospira acquisition has fueled speculation that Pfizer is preparing for a spin off of the GEP business.</p><p>In 2014 Hospira had net sales of $4.5bn and R&D expenses of $344.3m. As of the end of the year, the company operated 15 primary manufacturing facilities globally and had approximately 19,000 employees. </p><p>Pfizer said it expects the acquisition will deliver $800m in annual cost synergies by 2018. Fifty percent of the cost savings are to come from selling, informational and administrative expenses, with other savings coming from manufacturing and to a lesser extent from R&D. </p><p>As for what this will mean in terms of lay-offs and other cuts, a Pfizer spokesperson said the company will "look at its overall footprint and determine how best to serve customers with a competitive cost structure."</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
