<p>Meda AB acknowledged rumors about the imminent sale of its US pharmaceutical business on Aug. 28, and while the Swedish company would not comment on the conjecture, it hinted that a transaction of some sort may be imminent.</p><p>"[B]usiness development is a natural part of the business model," Meda said in response to multiple media reports stating that the company may accept a $1bn bid for its US business. However, the company left unanswered the question of whether that transaction or another would be announced soon, noting that its business development strategy includes acquisitions, divestments, in-licensing and partnerships. </p><p>"Evaluating the US operations is one project. However, Meda's policy is not to comment on these activities," the company said in a statement released late in the day in Sweden. </p><p>Meda's admission that a sale of its US business is among options under consideration sent the company's stock 1.4% higher in Stockholm to close at SEK 129.80 per share while its US stock gained 1.6% to end the day at $15.26.</p><p>The US operations are Meda's smallest and slowest-growing geographic business group. The company's US business increased 27% year-over-year, or 2% after currency impacts, to SEK 1.6bn in the first half of 2015 versus 37% growth in Western Europe (31% after currency fluctuations) to SEK 6.2bn in sales and 74% growth in emerging markets (58% after currency hits) to SEK 1.8bn in first half 2015 sales.</p><p>Meda is a specialty pharma company that sells prescription and over-the-counter medicines plus consumer products for respiratory, dermatology, pain and inflammation indications. </p><p>Meda has been both an acquirer and an acquisition target during the past few years, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Meda-in-2.3bn-Rottapharm-acquisition-353131" target="_new">buying Italian specialty pharma</a> and consumer health company Rottapharm for SEK21.2bn (&euro;2.275bn) in July 2014. </p><p>Meda has been on the hunt for transactions since it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Meda-looking-for-acquisitions-as-Mylan-looks-on-351657" target="_new">spurned a purchase offer</a> from generic pharma specialist Mylan in May 2014. Indian drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Meda-scotches-Cipla-merger-rumor-and-cements-Cipla-deal-343822" target="_new">made an unsuccessful bid for Meda</a> in 2013.</p><p>Selling any of its business groups could help Meda raise money for additional acquisitions. The company had SEK 1.4bn in cash as of June 30 versus SEK 2.3bn at the end of 2014.</p><p><p><p><p>
