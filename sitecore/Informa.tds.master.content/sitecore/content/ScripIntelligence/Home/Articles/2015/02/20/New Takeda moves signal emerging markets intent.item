<p>Takeda is sending out renewed signals of its commitment to expansion in Asia and other emerging markets through new steps in Turkey and Singapore to expand its commercial presence and other capabilities.</p><p>In an agreement with the major Turkish pharma company neutec, Takeda Pharmaceutical has agreed to acquire neutec's group subsidiary Toplam Kalite and its portfolio of 13 branded generics. </p><p>The cash transaction is valued at TRY300m ($122m) including milestone payments and is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 (starting 1 April), subject to certain conditions.</p><p>Takeda in Japan declined to disclose the sales of Toplam, set up in 2008, or of the portfolio of acquired products, but the firm did note that this includes gastroenterology, respiratory, metabolic and musculoskeletal drugs that would complement its existing local range.</p><p>The deal will "support Takeda's growth strategy and enhance its position in Turkey", the Japanese company said in a statement. Its currently marketed range of products in the country includes the proton pump inhibitor Pantpas (pantoprazole), Actos (pioglitazone) for diabetes and the NSAID Xefo Rapid (lornoxicam). </p><p>Takeda has had a modest direct presence in Turkey for around five years and currently has around 130 employees there under local managing director Renata Campos, with the acquisition expected to add a further 100 positions or so.</p><p>Istanbul-based neutec will continue to locally manufacture the Toplam portfolio at its main production site in Adapazari.</p><p>"This is one of our largest deals with a multinational," said the Turkish firm, CEO Mahmut Bilgi&ccedil; explaining that the divestment "will allow us to reinforce our market position in core products and help enhance our R&D activities."</p><p>Sales at neutec - which specializes in branded and value-added generic formulations - have been growing at 10%-plus in recent years.</p><p>For Takeda, the attractions of expansion in Turkey seem clear. It is a "key country within the region and the largest pharmaceutical market in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, which is forecasted to grow at around 6% annually over the next five years," said area head for Near East, Middle East and Africa, Danilo Cassani.</p><p>The total Turkish market grew by around 9% last year in local currency, to TRY14.6bn, led by alimentary tract and metabolism products. </p><h2>Singapore consolidation</h2><p>In a separate but related move to strengthen its commercial position and development capabilities both in the Asia-Pacific region and the broader emerging markets, Takeda has just inaugurated a new consolidated and expanded office in Singapore's Biopolis biomedical cluster.</p><p>The firm first set up a direct presence in Singapore in 2008, and the city-state is already an important management hub for its ex-Japan Asian business.</p><p>The new site brings together a number of key international functions including the relocated headquarters of the company's emerging markets business unit (which includes Asia-Pacific), its vaccine business unit and the Asia regional R&D center.</p><p>A major corporate restructuring last year under new Takeda president Christophe Weber saw the formation of five regional business units, including that for emerging markets, the separation of the Japan and North Asia businesses and the establishment of vaccines as a specialty unit. </p><p>In a sign of the emphasis being given to Asian and emerging markets, the Singapore inauguration event was attended by Weber, with Takeda characterizing the expanded office as indicative of its commitment to accelerating growth in this increasingly important part of its business.</p><p>"Expansion in Asia is a core component of Takeda's long-term growth strategies," stressed the firm, which now has around 1,700 staff in 10 countries across the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Its plans for India continue to be the subject of speculation however, with <i>PharmAsia News</i> reporting last year that further concrete steps may be in the offing.</p><p>The company's total emerging market sales rose by 8% to JPY223.3bn ($1.88bn) in constant currencies in the nine months ended 31 December, with double-digit growth in China, Brazil and Russia. Asian sales were 18% higher at JPY75.1bn and China grew by 26% in local currency in the period.</p><p>Giles Platford, president of the emerging markets unit, said the expanded Singapore office "gives us close-to-door access to important market information."</p><p>The new Singapore base for the vaccines specialty unit, headed by Dr Rajeev Venkayya, includes an analytical and development laboratory, with these facilities set to support Takeda's vaccine for dengue - a major problem in Asia - as it moves into Phase III trials shortly.</p><p>The clinical development function in Singapore is responsible for coordinating studies across 12 countries in the region.</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p><p>
