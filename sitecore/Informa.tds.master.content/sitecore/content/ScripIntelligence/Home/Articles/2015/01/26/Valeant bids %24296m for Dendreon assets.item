<p>Valeant has put in a bid of $296m for washed up Dendreon in the belief that purchasing prostate cancer drug Provenge (sipuleucel-T) is an economic way of entering the oncology market.</p><p>The Canadian company's bid is a "stalking horse" offer, which sets the bar for other bidders and entitles Valeant to a breakup fee should Dendreon pursue another offer. The breakup fee in this case is up to 3% of the purchase price of the acquired assets, and reimbursement of reasonable expenses up to $1m. </p><p>Dendreon, which has filed for bankruptcy, had originally intended to choose a stalking horse bidder before heading to auction, and then apparently changed its mind late last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dendreon-heads-to-auction-without-any-confirmed-bidders-355885" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 30 December 2014). The company's lawyers implied that Dendreon was wary of having to pay breakup fees.</p><p>However, Dendreon now appears to think that progressing with a stalking horse bidder will provide more value to stakeholders. Though the original stalking horse deadline of 29 December has passed, Dendreon has extended the auction; the bid deadline was 27 January, and is now 10 February. The company's lawyers said that several bidders requested the extension to the deadline, and that Dendreon granted the request to maximize value for all stakeholders. Dendreon also believed that the addition of Valeant as the stalking horse bidder would maximize value. The auction has been rescheduled for 12 February 2015. </p><p>Valeant's bid, if successful, would see the company purchase all of Dendreon's assets but none of its debt. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat called the move "financially savvy," though the stock market reacted differently sending Valeant's shares down nearly 2% in early trading, down from $161.49 to $158.57.</p><p>It is clear to see why investors would be less than thrilled about Valeant's new purchase; Dendreon's descent in bankruptcy via a catalogue of disasters with Provenge has been well-documented, and even touted as a cautionary tale by Novartis (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-calls-Dendreon-an-enabler-not-a-failure-355048" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 November 2014). Provenge, which was meant to be a blockbuster, has had flat sales of around $300m a year.</p><p>Mr Raffat, however, suggested that Valeant has several options to squeeze more value out of Provenge. He pointed out that Dendreon had yet to make any money from its European launch of Provenge. This could give Valeant an opportunity, although the drug was struggling with health technology assessments across European markets including the UK and Germany (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/IQWiG-finds-no-added-benefit-for-Dendreons-Provenge-or-Gileads-Zydelig-356055" target="_new">9 January 2015</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-refuses-Dendreons-Provenge-Celgenes-Imnovid-in-draft-guidance-354510" target="_new">16 October 2014</a>).</p><p>He also said that "a smart acquirer" would invest in R&D to try and capitalize on prostate cancer patients who fail treatment with Zytiga (abiraterone) and Xtandi (enzalutamide), both given in an earlier line. Up to 25% of patients who are given these drugs have androgen receptor variant 7 and fail to respond within a month. Mr Raffat suggests that these could be prime candidates for early initiation with Provenge. </p><p>Moreover, the purchase of Dendreon's manufacturing facilities may create potential for the company to leverage other cancer therapies, suggests Mr Raffat, possibly in the exciting CAR-T space. Valeant CEO J Michael Pearson hinted that for Valeant Provenge was merely an entry point to oncology, saying: "We believe that oncology has similar characteristics to our current therapeutic portfolios, such as strong growth, high durability, strong patient and physician loyalty, and a terrific reimbursement regime. We have not previously found an economic way to enter this market, but with the unique dynamics of this situation, we believe that this transaction will create significant shareholder value."</p><p>After its failed attempt to buy Allergan last year, Valeant had announced that it would be looking for smaller acquisition targets (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-not-seeking-a-replacement-Allergan-deal-in-2015-356061" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 9 January 2015).</p>
