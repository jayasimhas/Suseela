<p>President Barack Obama is now closer to being able to declare a major achievement in his second term with a little help from the so-called trade promotion authority (TPA), which the Senate delivered to him in a 60-38 vote on 24 June, which will help the White House seal a free-trade deal with 11 other nations &ndash; the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization have backed the TPP &ndash; which the US is negotiating with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and New Zealand &ndash; while the Generic Pharmaceutical Association has raised concerns about what it has called an "unbalanced structure," claiming the pact fails to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring expedited access to more affordable medicines.</p><p>After a successful procedural vote a day earlier, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion the Senate would adopt the TPA, which would allow the president to send negotiated trade deals, like the TPP, to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with no ability for lawmakers to amend or filibuster the agreements.</p><p>The TPA "will rightly enhance Congress' oversight over both the administration and the trade negotiation process as it moves forward, and it will also ensure our ability to scrutinize and render a verdict on any trade deal inked by this administration or the next one," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Republican-Kentucky), who called the 24 June vote by his chamber "another bipartisan achievement for the new Congress."</p><p>The House passed the measure last week in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Re-worked-strategy-gives-fast-track-new-life-for-now-359038" target="_new">218-208 vote</a> &ndash; barely squeaking by &ndash; so it now goes to President Obama for his signature.</p><p>The last TPA, often called fast-track authority, expired in 2007. The new TPA requires any trade deals to be posted for public view for 60 days before Congress can vote on it. </p><p>To get fast track, President Obama has had to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-plays-hardball-on-trade-insists-Dem-opponents-wrong-357996" target="_new">break with a majority</a> of his own party, including some of his closest allies &ndash; most notably House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Democrat-California) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat-Massachusetts) &ndash; who oppose the TPP. </p><p>Representative Pelosi led her colleagues earlier this month in an effort to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Caution-biopharma-wacky-Washington-wild-ride-ahead-358932" target="_new">derail</a> the TPA by bringing down a measure coupled with it, which she actually supported &ndash; the trade adjustment assistance (TAA), which would provide US workers adversely affected by trade deals with job training, career counseling, wage supplements and other support &ndash; because she said it was the only way to slow down the fast track.</p><p>But House Speaker John Boehner (Republican-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader (Republican-Kentucky) banded together with President Obama to finagle a way to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Re-worked-strategy-gives-fast-track-new-life-for-now-359038" target="_new">separate the TAA from the TPA</a> and re-vote on the measures separately.</p><p>The Senate also passed the TAA on 24 June, so now it goes back to the House for a second vote.</p><p>After conceding defeat on the TPA, Representative Pelosi urged her colleagues this time to support the TAA &ndash; declaring it would open the door to a full debate on the TPP. </p><p>She vowed that "House Democrats will be shining a bright light on the provisions of TPP as the negotiations proceed."</p><p>Senator Warren, in particular, has objected to the TPP's proposal to create <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">investor-state dispute settlement</a> (ISDS) tribunals, which would determine if a nation's laws harmed a firm's or investor's expected future profits and if so, claim damages for actions that have been shown to reduce the value of an investment, or "indirect expropriation."</p><p>In a 23 June op-ed in the <i>Boston Globe</i>, Senator Warren said the ISDS arbitration panels could "force countries to pony up billions of dollars in compensation" to multinational corporations that don't agree with a nation's laws.</p><p>"And these awards stick: No matter how crazy or outrageous the decision, no appeals are permitted. Once the arbitration panel rules, taxpayers must pay," she asserted.</p><p>The lawmaker argued that because the ISDS awards can be costly, governments are under "enormous pressure" to avoid actions that might offend corporate interests. </p><p>Senator Warren pointed out that negotiations with Europe over another trade deal, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, have stalled in part because of objections from Germany, France and others to the creation of an ISDS tribunal system. </p><p>And India and South Africa are considering halting the use of ISDS panels.</p><p>But President Obama has insisted Senator Warren is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-closer-on-trade-but-will-biopharma-get-its-way-358580" target="_new">wrong on the ISDS issue</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
