<p>Novo Nordisk has made registration filing for turoctocog alpha in the US and EU for preventing and treating bleeding in hemophilia A patients. The move marks an important milestone in the firm's drive to expand its business in hemophilia, said Dr Anne Prener, the firm's senior vice-president of hemophilia research and development.</p><p>Turoctocog alpha is a third-generation recombinant coagulation factor VIII. While muroctocog which is commonly used for hemophilia A patients is B-domain deleted, turoctocog's B-domian and 21 B-domain amino acids are left intact. This has advantages for the purification process, which means that turoctocog is homogeneous, explained Dr Prener. "The product is always the same every time a patient gets a vial, so it is very consistent, which makes treatment predictable. This is a big advantage as other products lack homogeneity," she said. And because the product is third generation, it is highly purified and there is therefore little risk of contamination with other viruses. Furthermore, turoctocog is stable at room temperature, which means that does not have to be kept in a refrigerator.</p><p>The filings are based on the guardian 1 and guardian 3 trials. Some 213 patients took part in the guardian programme, which is the biggest ever pre-registration trial program to be conducted in hemophilia A, according to the firm. The studies showed high efficacy and in preventing and treating bleeds said Dr Prener. It also had a good safety profile, with no patients developing inhibitors. This is a very problematic in other products that prevents patients from being able to receive treatment with factor VIII. </p><p>Dr Prener expects that approval will come within the next 12-15 months. Launch will follow as soon as a price is fixed, although it is as yet too early to comment on what that might look like.</p><p>Back in 2006 Novo Nordisk decided that it would expand its hemophilia business, which largely constituted NovoSeven for some 5,000 hemophilia A and B patients who have developed antibodies to treatment. Turoctocog alpha will be the first drug to extensively broaden the company's reach in to hemophilia A. Some 500,000 patients have hemophilia A, 300,000 of whom are in need of treatment. The total hemophilia market is worth DKK 50 billion (&euro;6.7 billion) and hemophilia A makes up two thirds of that.</p><p>This summer a new recombinant factor thirteen product for congenital deficiency targeted for approximately 900 patients globally was approved in Canada and Europe. Novo Nordisk also has in development a long-acting version of turoctocog in Phase III development and NN7415 in Phase I for hemophilia A and B. The latter is a monoclonal antibody against a tissue factor pathway inhibitor, for the prophylactic treatment of hemophilia with subcutaneous administration.</p><p>
