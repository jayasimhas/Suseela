<p>At what was characterized as an event harder to get into than the "Super Bowl," scientists from multiple sectors, including academic institutions, government agencies, mobile technology and the drug and device industries, along with other stakeholders, like patient advocates, debated the direction the US should take in building a one-million person research cohort under President Barack Obama's personalized medicine initiative.</p><p>Several issues were raised on 11 February at the first day of a two-day forum being held at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, including protecting patients&rsquo; privacy and ensuring data will be secured in a time when cyber attacks are growing more ubiquitous &ndash; something Dr Dixie Baker, a senior partner at Alexandria, Virginia business development firm Martin, Blanck & Associates, said cannot be guaranteed, "and we need to make that crystal clear to everyone." </p><p>Sharon Terry, CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group the Genetic Alliance, argued patients are more concerned about trust than privacy.</p><p>"Privacy is a red herring of trust," she asserted.</p><p>Ensuring the cohort includes a diverse population also was debated.</p><p>But Dr Eric Boerwinkle, chair of the Human Genetics Center at the University of Texas Health Science Center and associate director of the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine, insisted a research cohort does not need to be representative of the entire US, as long as researchers know who's included in it.</p><p>Dr George Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, questioned whether the idea to build on existing cohorts would be a mistake and suggested perhaps the precision medicine project should start from scratch.</p><p>"It's a lot more powerful not to be saddled with the baggage of the old," said Dr Yancopoulos, who was one of the few drug company representatives at the workshop on 11 February.</p><p>"If you have for the first time a chance to build it and start on day one, are you really going to go back before you go forward?" he asked. </p><p>Dr Boerwinkle said the national research cohort would be "much more than stitching together population-based cohorts."</p><p>"It would be a mistake to think of this as a consortium of cohorts," he said. </p><p>Dr Kathy Hudson, NIH's deputy director for science, outreach and policy, acknowledged her agency, which is leading the precision medicine effort, currently has only the "barest of framework" on which to start the project.</p><p>But, she said, with the help of stakeholders and a working group, whose membership will be revealed in the next few weeks, the NIH is hoping to have a more detailed plan in place by 1 October &ndash; when Congress is expected to have decided the fiscal year 2016 budget, under which President Obama has called for $215m to back the launch of his precision medicine initiative (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Surprisingly, NIH Director Francis Collins said he wasn't made privy to what the president had in mind when he first announced the initiative during his 20 January State of the Union address to the nation &ndash; with the biomedical research agency chief saying he was only told Mr Obama might mention the topic of precision medicine (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Why now?</b></p><p>Dr Collins said he's spent "many years thinking about this kind of an enterprise."</p><p>In fact, he noted that he tried to make the case for mounting such a feat in May 2004 in a commentary published in the scientific journal <i>Nature</i>, although he had called for a cohort of half the size of what President Obama is seeking.</p><p>But, Dr Collins said, his proposal "didn't land with enthusiasm" a decade ago. </p><p>"It was considered as being unrealistic," he admitted. </p><p>Now, though, several advances in basic research, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, electronic health records, big data and m-health have made it possible to pursue a large precision medicine cohort, Dr Collins said. </p><p>There also have been dramatic changes over the past decade in the cost of sequencing the human genome &ndash; which has plummeted from $22m to about $1,000, he pointed out. </p><p>The amount of time to sequence a human genome also has dropped &ndash; down from two years to one day, said Dr Collins, who led the US government's side of the Human Genome Project.</p><p>Another advance, the adoption of mobile technology, specifically smart phones, makes it the right time to pursue a national precision medicine research cohort &ndash; with about 160 million Americans, or 58% of the nation, now owning those devices, versus only about 1 million, or 2%, a decade ago, he said. </p><p>"We are at this wonderful moment in history to see the convergence of mobile technologies," said Dr Kevin Patrick, director of the Center for Wireless and Population Health Systems at the University of California, San Diego. "It is mind-blowing to think of where we might be in three to five years with mobile technology." </p><p>But even with the many advances, Dr Collins acknowledged there's "a lot of work to do," to "take what has emerged as a nascent, compelling, exciting, promising idea and turn it into something that we can actually push forward and hold ourselves accountable and derive out of this insights into health and disease that we've waited for, for a long time."</p><p>The biggest mistake in building the cohort, said Dr Michael Gaziano, scientific director of the VA Boston Healthcare Center, is "not being bold enough."</p><p><b>A partnership</b></p><p>Importantly, Dr Collins said, "this is not supposed to be some monolithic top-down enterprise, where mindless instructions are put onto the shoulders of people to turn cranks."</p><p>Rather, he said, the precision medicine initiative will encourage creative approaches and is an opportunity for Americans to be partners in research &ndash; "a very critical part of why I think this is the right time."</p><p>Dr Collins insisted the one million people enrolled in the cohort will not be patients, but participants.</p><p>"They are partners," he declared. </p><p>Dr Pearl O'Rourke, director of human research affairs at Partners Healthcare Systems, said the cohort must be participant-centric in concept and design from start to finish.</p><p>It also must be able to collect and share structured data with participants, researchers and clinicians and be transparent in purpose, management and execution, she said. </p><p>Participants must be incorporated within activities as "true partners" to reflect their interests, expertise and responsibilities integral to the cohort's success, Dr O'Rourke said. </p><p>"This is going to be a partnership and we want to build that partnership from the very beginning," Dr Hudson remarked.</p><p>But Dr Collins said one of his greatest concerns is how to ensure the voices of "regular folks" are heard in building the cohort and are not drowned out by the "specialized" groups.</p><p>"That's a hard problem," the answer for which will take some time to flesh out, concluded Dr Eric Green, director of the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute. </p><p>The stakeholders will be back for a second day of debate on 12 February.</p><p>Dr Hudson said the workshop was just the first of what is expected to be a series of meetings over the next several months on the personalized medicine initiative. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
