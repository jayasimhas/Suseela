<p>This week Martin Shkreli and his devil-may-care attitude to price gouging has effectively taken the delicate hope for an informed public debate about how to balance society's need for medicines and its ability to pay with the R&D risks and costs and profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry, and smashed it to smithereens. </p><p>Controversy over drug pricing has approached boiling point several times in the past couple of years, with cancer drugs, new hepatitis C products and orphan disease therapies all variously generating much heat even while generic drug shortages prompting under-hand gray market price gouging and clashes over decades-old drugs being appropriated for use as cash cows (think KV Pharmaceuticals and the preterm birth agent hydroxyprogesterone caproate it branded as Makena to sell at 75 times the price it was obtainable for from a compounding pharmacy) helped to fuel the fire.</p><p>The trouble is, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">in the eyes of the public and many of their elected representatives</a>, it can all look like one big, fairly undifferentiated scandal in which greedy pharmaceutical companies will stop at nothing to profit in an outrageous and unjustifiable way from the sick. </p><p>That the truth is much more complex than that is well known in the industry. The question of appropriately pricing and incentivizing beneficial innovation is quite different from the one of policing egregious price gouging. Unfortunately, the challenge of explaining to the world at large the way the cycle of new drug development, patent protection, R&D investment and attrition and drug pricing contrasts but interlocks with the process of genericization and price cuts continues to stump the industry (and the other stakeholders in the system).</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry should identify and condemn the elements of the system that undermine the tacit understanding that drug pricing should reflect the risks and costs of R&D. If it can't communicate the difference between those who cynically exploit supply and demand dynamics to extract scandalous profits from old drugs, and innovative firms pushing the boundaries of medicine, all its members risk being lumped together with the rogue elements and vilified by society. </p><p>On this occasion, PhRMA fumbled, leaving it until after it had issued a detailed statement damning Hillary Clinton's plan to regulate medicine prices to tweet as something of an afterthought that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shkrelis-Turing-Raises-90m-Buys-Daraprim-From-Impax-359906" target="_new">Turing Pharmaceuticals</a> &ndash; the company helmed by Shkreli that with its massive price hike of the toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim provoked the Senator's response &ndash; did not represent the values of its member companies. BIO, meanwhile, issued only a <a href="http://www.biotech-now.org/health/2015/09/bio-statement-on-patient-access-to-medicines?utm_source=Feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BiotechNow+%28BIOtech+Now%29&utm_term=RSS+Subscription" target="_new">gnomic statement</a> on innovation and access for patients. It looks like industry is letting Shkreli hijack its reputation.</p><p>
