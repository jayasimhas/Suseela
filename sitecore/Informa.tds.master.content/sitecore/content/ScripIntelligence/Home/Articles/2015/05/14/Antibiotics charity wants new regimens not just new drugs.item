<p>Amid mounting concern surrounding antibiotic resistance, charity Antibiotic Research UK says new ideas are needed in this particular research space focused on keeping current drugs in use and not just on creating new products. </p><p>Set up by a group of scientists in the UK in order to "fill the hole left by big pharma companies" vacating the development area, the charity is conducting research on gram negative "antibiotic resistance breakers" &ndash; drugs given alongside currently available antibiotics to combat resistance to the original products. </p><p>Antibiotic Research UK chief executive, Professor Colin Garner told <i>Scrip, </i>"Almost everyone else in the antibiotic R&D space is focused on developing new antibiotics and that process can take years and a lot of money. Instead we think there's a possibility of reviving existing products."</p><p>Unlike pharma, the charity &ndash; which believes it is the only one of its kind &ndash; isn't driven by return on investment. "It's a not-for-profit organization so by its very nature the charity can do things pharma companies can't," Professor Garner noted. "The charity can investigate approaches to tackling AMR where intellectual property isn't associated," he said. </p><p>The charity has identified five research streams it will begin with: three are focused on antibiotic resistance breakers, specifically in gram negative bacteria. The organization will also have two programs focused on new chemical entities, which it hopes to find from universities or perhaps suspended research programs of pharma or biotech companies. </p><p>To develop these so called antibiotic resistance breakers, the charity will be looking at products that are already approved and used in a similar way in different therapy areas. "The attraction of trying to use existing products is that the time needed for testing these candidates is significantly reduced, Professor Garner said, adding that the charity aimed to develop its first antibiotic therapy by 2020."We think this five-year time frame is very realistic," he said. "And once we have one successful antibiotic resistance breaker, you can imagine a conveyor belt process of doing the same again and again with other antibiotics."</p><p>The organization's other objectives include: raising money and awarding grants for antibiotic discovery; rebuilding antibiotic discovery in universities; and rebuilding antibiotic R&D in small pharma companies. </p><p>Initially the research work will be carried out by universities in the UK. The universities in the network are: Aston, Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Kings College London, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Southampton, St George's London, Strathclyde, Warwick and York.</p><p>Specialty pharma companies and organizations involved include: Chemical Biology Ventures, Euprotec, Evotech, Garner Consulting, John Innes Research Centre, Novacta Biosystems, PA Consulting, Pharmabioquintet, Redx Pharma, Sealife Pharma, Selcia and Transcrip Partners. </p><p>Professor Garner said he would like to see the charity take its drug candidates through to a proof-of-concept stage, before the group starts looking for any other development partners &ndash; such as mid-sized to big pharma players</p><p>The charity is seeking funding through a combination of traditional fundraising, corporate sponsorship, trusts and foundations, as well as newer fundraising methods such as crowd funding. "We have raised &pound;100,000 since founding the charity last year, which I think is impressive for a new charity," Professor Garner said. "We estimate now that we will need &pound;300,000 each year for years one and two of our research program. Then we expect this to be more in the millions region for years three, four and five." </p><p>In total, the charity expects to raise &pound;30m over the next five years and it hopes to gain public attention parallel to that seen by other research charities such as Cancer Research UK. "If there are no antibiotics all those other disease research charities' treatments will face problems. Modern medicine cannot be practised without effective antibiotics. This is the message we are trying to send," Professor Garner said.</p><p>While the charity's work will be focused in the UK, Professor Garner said he hopes to see more groups like this one. "I would like to envision a global not-for-profit network of antibiotic research groups all working together. This is a global problem."</p><p>For more on antimicrobial resistant, visit <i>Scrip's </i>dedicated <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/amr/" target="_new">microsite</a>. </p>
