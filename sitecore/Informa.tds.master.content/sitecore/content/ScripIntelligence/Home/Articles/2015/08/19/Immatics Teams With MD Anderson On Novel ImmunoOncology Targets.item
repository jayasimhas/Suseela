<p>Germany's immatics biotechnologies GMBH is establishing a US subsidiary in Houston on the campus of MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the two will work together to produce new cancer immunotherapies derived from immatics' XPRESIDENT technology platform.</p><p><p>The new venture, Immatics US Inc., will start out with $60m in funding, including a nearly $20m state grant.</p><p><p>"We can bring in targets from our XPRESIDENT platform and the MD Anderson Cancer Center will brings its development expertise and its huge infrastructure for adoptive cell therapies, and together we can translate these novel targets into novel, better, safer cancer immunotherapies," immatics founder and Chief Scientific Officer Harpreet Singh told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.</p><p><p>He also will serve as CEO of the US subsidiary, which plans to bring its first candidate into clinical development in 2016.</p><p><p>Immatics US and MD Anderson will work together to develop three different approaches to adoptive cellular therapies, both autologous and allogeneic, with a goal to treat tumors with high unmet medical needs. Singh said his company had not yet disclosed any of the novel targets the work will center upon, but added that the first program would address solid tumors with high medical need and few therapeutic options, including pancreatic cancer.</p><p><p>The collaboration announced Aug. 26 will develop ACTolog candidates, which will manipulate a patient's endogenous T-cells; ACTengine candidates, which will engineer a patient's own T-cells to express novel T-cell receptors; and ACTallo candidates, which will use off-the-shelf T-cells that have been engineered to express novel T-cell receptors.</p><p><p>"We will start with the ACTalog approach, which has been pioneered by Cassian Yee at MD Anderson, and that approach will take immune cells from the patient, isolate those immune cells that specifically recognize a certain Immatics target, expand and reprogram those immune cells massively, and put them back into the patient," Singh explained. "This is called an ACTalog because it is autologous and [uses] endogenous T-cells."</p><p><p>Immatics US' parent is providing $40m in initial funding for the work, while the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas will add $19.7m in grant funding to the initiative. The German firm first announced the grant funding in March and said the work would be done in close collaboration with MD Anderson, but did not provide further details until now. Singh noted that CPRIT grant allocations require that the money be used in Texas.</p><p><p>Meeting the requirement to use the funds in Texas is no issue for Immatics, the exec said, as the company and MD Anderson see each other as a "perfect fit" for this initiative.</p><p><p>"It makes sense for us to develop this [program] very closely to MD Anderson &ndash; we will be based on the MD Anderson campus, because this is where we will treat patients &ndash; and the initial clinical trials will all take place at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, which is the largest comprehensive cancer center in the world," Singh said.</p><p><p>"We already had a plan to move to Houston and the MD Anderson campus, so it was very helpful also to get additional support from the state," he added.</p><p><h2>How It Plans To Differentiate</h2><p><p>Founded in 2000 out of the University of Tuebingen, near Munich, Immatics' platform screens candidates to create tumor-associated peptide (TUMAP) vaccines and immunotherapies. TUMAPS are derived from antigens overexpressed on cancer cells; the platform identifies the antigens directly from primary human tissue and quantifies and prioritizes them based on their immunogenicity.</p><p><p>Singh said that while the candidates coming out of the collaboration with MD Anderson may bear similarity to those being developed by Juno Therapeutics Inc., Kite Pharma Inc. or Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, a key difference is that Immatics' discovery work goes after a broad range of novel targets that no other company is working on. Finding novel targets beyond those commonly used to develop drugs for B-cell leukemia indications, such as CD19, "is one of the decisive hurdles in the field of cancer immunotherapy," Singh asserted.</p><p><p>Without offering much in the way of specifics, Singh said the collaboration would look at targets that can be categorized as neoantigens or testis antigens.</p><p><p>"What's important is that we don't have any restrictions," he said. "If you look at other companies or academic groups, they tend to pick a target that has been very well characterized in literature &ndash; we don't care about any kind of fashion in our industry, such as what kind of targets we should go after. We just look at the tumor tissue and what is expressed and presented on tumor tissue and is not presented on healthy tissue. And there's a wide range of targets that we discovered that way."</p><p><p>A November 2013 agreement with Roche that brought in a $17m upfront payment was an important validation of Immatics' technology. Roche obtained a license to develop and commercialize TUMAP vaccines and immunotherapies under that deal.</p><p><p>On Aug. 25, Immatics Germany announced a strategic alliance with MorphoSys AG under which the latter company gets access to several proprietary TUMAP candidates and Immatics gets antibodies discovered by MorphoSys against its TUMAPs, with proprietary development rights. Financial details were not disclosed other than that each company can earn milestones and sales royalties on the other's work under the partnership.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
