<p>Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell wants to bring drug manufacturers together with consumers, health care providers, employers, insurers, state and federal government officials and other stakeholders at a Nov. 20 invitation-only forum to discuss the rising costs of prescription medicines &ndash; an issue that's been at the center of debates in recent months among politicians, payers and patient advocates.</p><p>At the one-day event, panelists representing various stakeholder groups are expected to discuss the challenges and complexities involved in increasing access to prescription drugs and reducing the costs of those products, while driving innovation, strengthening incentives and promoting competition of new medicines. </p><p>Burwell also wants to hear about innovative strategies for incorporating value- and outcomes-based models into purchasing programs in the public and private sectors. </p><p>"We acknowledge this is a multifaceted problem with no one solution, but there is a significant benefit &ndash; to all of us &ndash; of working together to find a solution," HHS said on Nov. 3 in announcing the upcoming forum.</p><p>HHS took particular aim at specialty medicines &ndash; noting that while they represented only 1% of all prescriptions prescribed in 2014, they accounted for over 31% of all drug spending in the US that year.</p><p>Specialty pharmas like Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, which hiked the price by more than 5,000% of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which significantly increased the prices of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside), which jumped from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel (isoprenaline), which rocketed from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, have particularly been in the bull's-eye of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">prosecutors</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">state attorneys general</a>, Capitol Hill lawmakers and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">politicians</a> running for the White House.</p><p>In light of the heightened criticism over high drug prices, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America last week <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Payers-Choice-Death-Is-Cheap-Drugs-Add-Costs-361324" target="_new">stepped up its efforts to defend</a> the costs of prescription medications &ndash; declaring that any debate should include the costs of all health care products and services, not just biopharmaceuticals, although the lobbying group distanced itself from Turing and Valeant, insisting those firms aren't really innovators.</p><p>During the Nov. 20 HHS meeting, yet-to-be disclosed presenters are expected to discuss the impact of rising costs of prescription medicines on patients, businesses, taxpayers and state and federal budgets and the challenges of balancing innovation with affordability, HHS said.</p><p>The agency said it plans to have another panel examine the current and future drug classes that contribute to health care costs going up, while also taking a look at the impact of innovative and breakthrough therapies on patient care.</p><p>A third group, HHS said, will focus on the significant challenges involved for patients and providers in accessing drugs and discuss opportunities for how to ensure medicines are available and affordable. It also set to talk about what rewards for quality of care will drive increased value.</p><p>Later in the day, a fourth panel is slated to share approaches to innovative purchasing strategies, identify best practices within those models and discuss how those innovations could be implemented in Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>Finally, the last group is expected to identify successful elements of value- and outcomes-based purchasing strategies that can be implemented broadly. They also are expected to provide some implementation lessons learned from market leaders. </p><p>For those interested in requesting an invitation, HHS said to contact hhspharmforum@mitre.org.</p><p>The agency said it plans to webcast its pharmaceutical forum on the HHS website on the day of the event for those unable or not invited to attend.</p><p>Meanwhile, a group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Rep. Elijah Cummings (MD), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, have formed a new task force focused on taking action to combat the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The members of the so-called Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force are expected to outline their plans during a Nov. 4 Capitol Hill press conference.</p><p>Rep. Cummings pointed to the latest Kaiser Health Tracking poll, which found that rising prescription drug prices remains Americans' top health care concern.</p><p>Kaiser reported that 77% of responders to its survey said ensuring expensive medicines or chronic conditions, such as HIV, hepatitis, mental illness and cancer, are affordable for those who need them was a top priority.</p><p>Government action to lower prescription drug costs came in second as a top priority in the poll.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
