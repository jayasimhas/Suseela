<p>In the delightful surroundings of a Cambridge University College lawn at the end of last week an investment bank analyst and I were discussing what would be needed to properly deflate the current biotech bubble. Believe it or not, I was on the side of some external event like an alien invasion being the trigger whereas my fellow guest was tending towards the cumulative failures by companies.</p><p><p>If he is right, then Avalanche Biotechnologies' "positive" top-line Phase IIa study results for its gene therapy product AVA-101 in 32 wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients will be one of those failures. Following the announcement of its trial, the share price of Avalanche finished the week down 63.6%.</p><p><p>Other investment bank analysts were typically reticent to call the results a failure, even in the face of shareholders' damning indictment. The analysts from Piper Jaffray and Jefferies described the data as controversial while the analysts from Cowen suggested that the study did not define AVA-101's role in the treatment of wet AMD.</p><p><p>I should coco. It is unusual for one "positive" study to throw up so many negative findings. The issue that may have worried investors the most was the low efficacy (measured by visual acuity) of AVA-101 compared with results for Lucentis as seen in the registration studies. Visual acuity &ndash; a secondary endpoint in the study &ndash; is measured by the number of letters that can be read on an eye chart. Untreated AMD patients typically show a decline in that number over a 12-month period. While AVA-101 did indeed show an average gain of 2.2 letters, the control group, which like the AVA-101 group also received two early doses of Roche/Novartis's Lucentis (ranibizumab), demonstrated a 9.3 letter reduction. This wide margin between AVA-101 and the control group might be a cause for celebration had it not been for the recognition that Lucentis's Phase III studies in 1,323 patients showed 14.1 and 15.8 letter gains over 12 months. Investors' disappointment could be due either to the underperformance of an experimental gene therapy against the Lucentis registration data, or to doubts over the conduct of the Avalanche study, given the contrast between Lucentis's dismal (but flattering to AVA-101) performance in this single-centre, open-label Australian trial and the results of much larger, randomized, double-masked, sham- and active-controlled studies.</p><p><p>One of the other important secondary endpoints of the study, fairly critical for the single administration of a gene therapy that might be expected to result in a functional cure, was the number of injections of rescue medication (Lucentis, again) that were required to maintain visual acuity. Again, the headline was "positive" as the treatment group needed a median of two fewer rescue medications than the control group. The worrying issue, also pointed out by the analysts on Avalanche's conference call, was that the difference between the number of injections was only two. This was worrying for two reasons. Firstly, the best but most expensive standard of care in wet AMD is Regeneron and Bayer's Eyela (aflibercept), which typically requires half the number of injections of Lucentis after the first three months. Secondly, the cheapest but off-label therapy for AMD is Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab), which is administered as frequently as Lucentis. This leaves AVA-101 caught between the efficacy rock of Eylea, and the cost hard place of Avastin. The study <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01494805?term=rAAV.sFlt-1&rank=1" target="_new">protocol</a> on the clinical trials website does not state whether control group patients received a sham injection. If they did not, the actual difference in number of injections was only one per year.</p><p><p>I have two further concerns about AVA-101. Firstly the AVA-101 patients showed an average change in retinal thickness from baseline of +25 micrometres, while the control group showed a -56 micrometre change. The company was unable to explain why a therapeutic treatment should show a significant increase in retinal thickness over the control group and while most analysts suggested that this was not a good thing, I was left wondering why a significant increase in retinal thickness in the AVA-101 group did not cause the study to fail its primary safety endpoint. My second concern relates to the wide confidence intervals (CIs) associated with AVA-101's efficacy endpoints. One of the key drivers of the width of a CI is the variance in response. We have seen in exon-skipping therapies that high response variances typically mean that some patients respond well and some patients do not respond at all. One of the continuing controversies for gene therapy is that a single dose can potentially cure a patient, but that dose has to be very expensive in order to justify the multi-billion dollar valuations of its developers. If gene therapies have non-responding patients, payers won't reimburse these drugs without outcome studies and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-An-oasis-of-lipid-lowering-therapies-and-a-desert-of-reimbursement-358940" target="_new">annuity and pay-for-performance pricing</a>, in order to avoid paying for ineffective treatments. </p><p><p>Avalanche is not the first gene therapy company with an AAV vector to disappoint so far this year. At the moment it feels like gene therapy companies are reporting clinical data that is far from what investors hoped for the last time these companies raised money. It is not exactly that the gene therapy emperor has no clothes, but just think of Borat in that thong. </p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Roche, Regeneron and Bayer.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
