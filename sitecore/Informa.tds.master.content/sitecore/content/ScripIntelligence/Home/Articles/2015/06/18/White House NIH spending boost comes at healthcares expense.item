<p>While White House officials praised the proposed increases in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) included in the Republicans' House and Senate spending bills for Health and Human Services (HHS), they said those extra dollars would come at the expense of other healthcare programs, including those created under the <i>Affordable Care Act </i>(ACA), which would be defunded if the legislation is enacted.</p><p>It should not come as a surprise to anyone by now, said Aviva Aron-Dine, acting deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, that Republicans, who control both chambers on Capitol Hill, would use the appropriations bills to take another shot at killing the ACA &ndash; legislation she said President Barack Obama would not sign.</p><p>During a call with reporters, Ms Aron-Dine insisted the president also has been clear he would not sign legislation that locked in the across-the-board sequester spending cuts mandated by the <i>Budget Control Act of 2011</i> or an appropriations bill that fixes sequestration for defense but not non-defense.</p><p>In a 30-21 vote on 24 June, the House Appropriations Committee adopted its spending bill, which includes a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Spending-bill-seeks-1.1bn-NIH-boost-but-defunds-Obamacare-358984" target="_new">$1.1bn increase for the NIH</a> for fiscal year 2016. </p><p>The legislation now goes to the full House for consideration &ndash; the first time in nearly a decade a spending bill has moved out of the chamber's Appropriations Committee. </p><p>Senate appropriators will take up their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Senate-spending-bill-to-boost-NIH-funds-cut-CDCs-359094" target="_new">companion spending bill</a> on 25 June, which calls for a $2bn boost in the NIH's spending.</p><p>But Eric Schultz, White House principal deputy press secretary, said the Obama administration was "troubled" by Republicans' "misplaced priorities" in their spending bills, which he said includes proposals that would jeopardize the economic progress that's been made by the ACA.</p><p>Under the Republicans plan, Mr Shultz told reporters, millions of Americans could lose their healthcare coverage and the innovations that were put in place under the ACA aimed at slowing the growth of healthcare costs and improving quality would be blocked.</p><p>"Not one dime of federal tax dollars," declared Representative Tom Cole (Republican-Oklahoma), chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies, would be provided for "the president's deeply flawed and unpopular healthcare law."</p><p>The White House also condemned the House and Senate appropriation bills for failing to sufficiently fund the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), whose purpose is to advance the development of medical countermeasures, and the entity established to fund those products for stockpiling, known as Project BioShield.</p><p>Leaving BARDA and Project BioShield shortchanged, the Obama administration contended, could mean the US may not be able to fully respond to the next pandemic or other public health crisis. </p><p>During the nearly all-day 24 June House Appropriations Committee's markup session, Democrats complained about the Republicans' plan in the spending bill to terminate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), which conducts analyses about quality, affordability and accessibility of healthcare in the US. </p><p>Republican leaders insisted the agency's activities are "duplicative" of what is done by other departments and offices within HHS. So they want to close the office and distribute its responsibilities to the NIH and other agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>But Representative Rosa DeLauro (Democrat-Connecticut), who offered up six amendments during the 24 June markup, which were all shot down, insisted AHRQ's work is "valuable," and by shifting its activities to NIH, CDC and others &ndash; especially without to do the work &ndash; would overload those agencies.</p><p>In addition to being "rife with attacks on the ACA," Representative DeLauro also asserted the House Republicans' spending bill was "weighed down by ideological riders."</p><p>And even though it would provide the NIH with additional dollars, "the bottom line is, this bill is woefully underfunded" and "fails to meet our country's needs" &ndash; representing an "abdication of this committee's responsibility to the American people."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
