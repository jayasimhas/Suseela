<p><p>It's been a tumultuous two weeks for Genocea Biosciences. After announcing somewhat mixed but positive results for its herpes vaccine, a lack of statistical significance in a trial for its pneumococcus vaccine has left it floundering. </p><p>The biotech will now pour all its resources into its herpes program, but investors are losing confidence that Genocea can deliver a successful product from its immunotherapy platform. The biotech's stock tanked, losing nearly 30%, or $2 per share, to trade just above $5 apiece. </p><p>The company is now trading well below its <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Finance-Auspex-UniQure-Genocea-launch-IPOs-Epizyme-Halozyme-Agenus-raise-cash-Allergan-earnings-349843" target="_new">February IPO price</a> of $12 per share, which was launched at the low end of its proposed range, and is a far cry from its 52-week high of $16.18. </p><p>Genocea has never been a Wall Street darling and it's largely because the biotech has yet to prove that its immunotherapy platform will actually work. </p><p>Pushing confidence levels even further down, Genocea announced Oct. 19 that a Phase IIa trial of GEN-004 was able to reduce the rate and amount of infection compared with placebo, but that the data was not statically significant. </p><p>The study included 98 patients that were randomized to either GEN-004 or placebo and given three doses every four weeks. After the fourth dose, the patients were inoculated with pneumococcus, a gram-positive bacteria that can cause a variety of infections including meningitis. </p><p>Patients were tested at two, seven and 14 days to see the rate of infection as well as the severity of infection. GEN-004 reduced the rate of infection by 22%-25%, while patients on placebo saw a reduction of 18% to 36%. Patients in the GEN-004 arm had zero to two colony forming units, while the placebo group had zero to 11 colony forming units, a measure of the density of infection. </p><p>While the vaccine showed some activity in patients, Genocea CEO Chip Clark admitted in a statement that it "would require a change in some combination of dose, adjuvant or trial population to confirm any effect."</p><p>Genocea also concedes that it doesn't have the cash right now to waste on other trials confirming that the drug could actually work &ndash; the company had $74.6m in cash as of June 30 and raised another $50m from a public offering in August. The biotech is ditching GEN-004 for now and focusing instead on GEN-003 for genital herpes. </p><p>The biotech announced earlier this month results from a Phase II trial of GEN-003 that showed its reduced viral shedding &ndash; the primary endpoint &ndash; by 58% from baseline. While the primary endpoint results were positive, the drug did not reduce the presence of skin lesions in HSV patients as much as analysts and investors were expecting. </p><p>If GEN-003 ever makes it to market Genocea could face an <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Despite-Positive-Data-Can-Genocea-Build-A-Market-360864" target="_new">upward battle</a> trying to sell the vaccine as well. There is currently only one treatment for genital herpes &ndash; GlaxoSmithKline's <i>Valtrex</i> (valaciclovir), which is available as a generic and brought in only $254m in 2014. Genital herpes, while highly socially stigmatized, is largely medically irrelevant. More than 80% of people who have the infection ever have any idea that they are infected. </p><p><p><p>
