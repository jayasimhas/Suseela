<p>Despite a slew of competitors developing more advanced agents, Arena Pharmaceuticals saw its stock price rocket 76.2% higher on 7 January to $5.85 per share based on Phase Ib results for APD334, an orally available small molecule agonist of the sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P1) receptor.</p><p>Arena is competing against five companies that have eight different S1P1 agonists in Phase II or III development, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database, including Novartis's approved multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya (fingolimod). Still, the San Diego-based company added $557.9m to its market cap based on top-line Phase Ib results that showed dose-dependent lymphocyte lowering comparable to other S1P1-targeting therapies with no major heart, liver or pulmonary issues that have been associated with the drug class.</p><p>"Lymphocyte lowering at the level demonstrated in this trial has been shown to correlate with clinical efficacy in Phase II and Phase III trials of other S1P1 modulators in multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and ulcerative colitis," Arena chief medical officer William Shanahan said in a statement from the company. "The results of this trial support investigation of the efficacy and safety of APD334 in patients with autoimmune diseases." </p><p>Arena's Phase Ib clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of APD334 enrolled 50 healthy volunteers in five different dosing cohorts. Forty people were given APD334 and 10 received placebo for 21 days.</p><p>Arena's S1P1 agonist showed a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in patients' blood with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. The company noted that isolating lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, rather than allowing them into the peripheral blood, means that fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to cause tissue damage that occurs in autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Arena will "expedite APD334 into Phase II clinical trials for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD)" based on the positive Phase Ib results, according to company president and CEO Jack Lief.</p><p><b>Safety benefits</b></p><p>In terms of safety, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events for APD334 in Phase Ib were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea. No patients discontinued treatment based on adverse events and there were no serious adverse events during the course of the study. Arena observed no "clinically significant" heart rate, heart rhythm or pulmonary function side effects or liver enzyme elevations. </p><p>"We believe a safer, comparably effective S1P1 could realize a significant market opportunity," Jefferies analyst Thomas Wei said in a 7 January research note. </p><p>The up to 69% reduction in lymphocytes seen in the three-week treatment period for healthy volunteers in Arena's study was comparable to a 70% reduction seen in a two-week period during a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study for Gilenya, Mr Wei noted. APD334's efficacy also was similar to a Phase II/III drug candidate from Receptos and a Phase II candidate from Actelion.</p><p>"The Receptos S1P1 modulator RPC1063, currently in Phase III development in multiple sclerosis (MS), had a decrease of 65% at the highest dose being tested in Phase III. Actelion's ponesimod demonstrated a 74% decrease in lymphocytes in its MAD healthy volunteer study," Mr Wei wrote.</p><p>Gilenya, RPC1063 and ponesimod all have been associated with heart, lung and liver side effects in clinical trials. Actelion planned to advance ponesimod on its own in psoriasis, but put its MS program for the drug on hold in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Actelion-to-take-ponesimod-into-pivotal-psoriasis-studies-but-MS-can-wait-338398" target="_new">19 December 2012</a>). However, the company suspended development in psoriasis in 2013 based on safety concerns, according to the BioMedTracker database.</p><p>Between Gilenya, Novartis's second-generation drug BAF312 (siponimod) and Receptos's RPC1063, competition for S1P1 agonists in MS is fierce. BAF312 is in Phase III for MS and Phase II for dermatomyositis. RPC1063 is being evaluated in the Phase III portion of its ongoing Phase II/III clinical trial following success in the trial's Phase II portion in June (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Receptos-radiant-on-top-line-data-for-Gilenya-rival-352215" target="_new">10 June 2014</a>).</p><p>"While MS remains a possible indication for future development [of APD334], UC and CD may offer a faster data readout than MS and also less competition, as Gilenya is unlikely to have the appropriate therapeutic window to be used in either of these indications," Mr Wei wrote.</p><p>The Phase Ib results for Arena's drug gave the company's shares a needed boost on 7 January &ndash; a day after the stock sagged to a one-year low of $3.32 on 6 January. Arena has suffered from new competition and slower growth than hoped for by investors for its weight loss drug Belviq (lorcaserin), which is marketed by Eisai in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orexigen-rises-as-Contrave-launches-in-tough-obesity-market-354959" target="_new">11 November</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novos-Saxenda-bags-FDA-approval-for-weight-management-355820" target="_new">24 December 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p>
