<p><p>When Retrophin ousted its high-profile founder Martin Shkreli in October, the company didn't reveal why it had chosen to change management. Now those reasons are front and center as the biotech files suit against the former CEO, alleging a wide variety of misconduct. </p><p>The four-year-old biotech is accusing Shkreli of not only shirking his "duty of loyalty" to Retrophin, but using company funds to pay off his own debts and giving shares to friends, according to the lawsuit. Retrophin alleges that Shkreli stole $5.6m from the company and mishandled about $59m in company stock. </p><p>Retrophin believes that Shkreli is not entitled to the compensation he earned during his tenure or any post-separation compensation. The company is looking for Shkreli to pay back everything he earned on top of $65m in damages and $2.9m in shares. </p><p>According to the complaint, Shkreli was using the funds and the shares to cover some bad investments he made through his now defunct hedge fund MSMB Capital. Through the hedge fund manager-turned CEO's dealings, Retrophin ended up paying settlements to seven defrauded MSMB clients amounting in $2.8m in cash, as well as $4.5m in shares. </p><p>The biotech was also forced to into sham consulting contracts with three defrauded MSMB clients, with Retophin paying out $200,000 in cash and $17.3m worth in shares. </p><p>Shkreli, who has since founded another biotech, seemed unenthused with the allegations on his Twitter account, saying he was shorting the stock and that the "company owes me a large amount of money." </p><p>Shkreli's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shkrelis-Turing-Raises-90m-Buys-Daraprim-From-Impax-359906" target="_new">latest venture</a>, Turing Pharmaceuticals, raised $90m in Series A funding earlier in the month to fund its infectious disease programs. Shkreli made waves in the biotech world <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Tables-turn-as-hedge-fund-investor-and-activist-Shkreli-leads-rare-disease-focus-at-Retrophin-340265" target="_new">in 2011</a> when he switched gears from being a high-profile investor to founding a biotech &ndash; an area he had little experience in. </p><p><p>
