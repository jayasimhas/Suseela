<p>While there may have been basic consensus on the multi-sector Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the final detailed provisions and wording of the massive trade agreement as it pertains to data exclusivity for biologic medicines have yet to be publicly released.</p><p>This makes it frustratingly uncertain what exactly has been agreed and with whom, but it does seem clear that a minimum of five years' data exclusivity has been accepted across the board, meaning that such protection is set to apply in some countries for the first time, including Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam.</p><p>However, it does appear that the final fine wording remains under discussion and that the US is seeking an "effective" protection period for original biologics of up to eight years, but is prepared to be flexible in how this is delivered by the various regulatory, reimbursement and innovation support mechanisms in the different countries.</p><p>US Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">alluded to this in his Oct. 5 comments</a> after the breakthrough that nations will be able to use "government measures that can achieve a comparable outcome," although an eight-year period was not specifically referred to.</p><p>As the largest Asian emerging market, China is notably absent from the TPP process, but the US's hope appears to be that the prevailing standards set in the rest of the region under the trade pact will exert soft pressure on the country to adopt similar norms.</p><p>China is making efforts to develop an alternative regional free trade forum and is also pursuing the formation of a proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as part of its initiatives, but these have yet to gather significant regional momentum.</p><p><b>Australia-led Breakthrough?</b></p><p>The basic TPP data exclusivity deal means the current five-year term in Australia will remain unchanged, while the other TPP countries that already offer longer periods for biologics, notably the US (up to 12 years), Canada (eight years) and Japan (eight years), look set to maintain these levels.</p><p>The hard-won settlement for biologics - one of the last major sticking points of the whole TPP process given the US's push for 12-year terms like at home - appears to have been eased by an initial US compromise with Australia.</p><p>There was strong opposition to longer terms from Australian Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb, who before the final TPP round in Atlanta, GA ended had <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/10/1/compromises-set-to-unlock-tpp-endgame" target="_new">described any change</a> in his country's existing five-year exclusivity as "a red line issue."</p><p>Tellingly, in a statement after the TPP deal, his ministry said the Australian government had "delivered on its promise" not to change its current exclusivity terms.</p><p>The breakthrough then seemed to open the door to other bilateral and multilateral discussions on the biologics question.</p><p><b>Details, Discussions</b></p><p>Further details of the specific biologics exclusivity provisions and terms for each country, and any related flexibilities, will remain uncertain until the public release of the full text from what has been a highly secretive process all along.</p><p>In the US, the full text must be made available to the public for 60 days before a vote in Congress, although no release date has been set yet by the USTR.</p><p>The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it would begin releasing detailed TPP outcomes on its website from Oct. 6, noting: "TPP negotiating parties are now finalizing arrangements for the release of the TPP text, and it will be released well in advance of signature."</p><p>Negotiations on the fine print for biologics are understood to be still ongoing, and some other TPP countries including Chile were reported to be against offering exclusivity periods of more than five years.</p><p>In a statement after the talks concluded, the USTR gave little more away, noting only that the intellectual property (IP) chapter "includes commitments relating to the protection of undisclosed test and other data submitted to obtain marketing approval of a new pharmaceutical."</p><p>The chapter also reaffirms commitment to the 2001 World Trade Organization's TRIPS agreement and "confirms that Parties [TPP signatories] are not prevented from taking measures to protect public health, including in the case of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS," it said.</p><p>This refers to the flexibilities granted under TRIPS to allow the compulsory licensing of selected drugs in such high-need circumstances.</p><p><b>Rough Political Road Ahead?</b></p><p>While consensus may have been reached, there is also still a long way to go before relevant laws are enacted. The full TPP text must be formally reviewed, ratified and passed into law by all the individual national legislatures of the 12 participating Pacific Rim countries.</p><p>This requires the solicitation of public comment in some cases, meaning that the variety of procedures could take several months, even assuming no domestic political opposition.</p><p>While the US Congress could vote on the TPP sometime early next year, there seems no guarantee that the national political ride will there be smooth, given an apparent biologics compromise that seems to satisfy neither the groups representing the innovative industry nor health campaigners pushing for faster access to cheaper biosimilars.</p><p>Utah Republican senator and Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch warned just before the Atlanta round that "I will examine it [the TPP text] very carefully to ensure it meets [the] standards" of the bipartisan alliance that supported the trade promotion authority granted to President Barack Obama.</p><p>This "fast-track" process means that the US president need seek only a yes or no vote from Congress, which will not have the power to amend the basic TPP agreement.</p><p>However, if the final TPP text does not reflect a proper balance of US interests, "it is hard to see how it will be successfully enacted into law," Hatch cautioned.</p><p>It also seems highly likely that the innovative biologics industry in the US will exert full political pressure against any deal that they have already described as disappointing and short-sighted.</p><p><b>Australian, Other Responses</b></p><p>A number of other groups have now made their positions on the biologics issue known, expressing either disappointment in the short exclusivity term or in the fact that minimum protection was granted at all.</p><p>Medicines Australia, which represents the research-based pharma and biopharma industry in the country, described the TPP as a "disappointing outcome" and a "missed opportunity" to grow the Australian biopharmaceutical sector.</p><p>Pointing to recent declarations by new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that innovation would be central to his new government, it said the decision not to support greater data protection "sends the reverse signal."</p><p>Australia's short (five-year) data protection for biologics has already put off some drug developers, it noted, and increasing this term would have had no negative impact on medicine access and not increase prices paid through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</p><p>A globally competitive intellectual property system in Australia would in fact increase access, attract investment in R&D, and support the biotech sector, and bring economic and employment benefits, it argued.</p><p>"Australia's current five-year data exclusivity provision lags behind our global competitors and collaborators," Medicines Australia stated. "It is extremely disappointing that an unfounded, misleading scare campaign has had such a critical impact on the TPP outcomes."</p><p>However, in a statement after the TPP, trade minister Robb stressed that "importantly, the TPP will not require any changes to Australia's intellectual property laws or policies, whether in copyright, pharmaceutical patents or enforcement.</p><p>"Australia's five years of data protection for biological medicines will remain unchanged. The TPP will not increase the price of medicines in Australia."</p><p><b>'Unprecedented Assault'</b></p><p>Commenting on the TPP deal, James Love, director of the US-based NGO Knowledge Ecology International, again criticized the non-public disclosure of the TPP text while access was provided to "hundreds of corporate representatives" even during the negotiations.</p><p>Once the actual text is released, "the profound influence of the agreement on a wide range of non-tariff issues will become clear," including on IP rights and pricing and reimbursement. </p><p><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/8/7/new-tpp-leaks-show-conflict-but-little-clarity" target="_new">Previous leaks</a> suggest it "will be an unprecedented assault on national sovereignty, consumer rights, and access to medicines," Love said.</p><p>He charged that the Obama administration's most important goal "was to raise the prices for drugs, vaccines and medical devices, worldwide, and they have no doubt achieved that objective."</p><p>In a statement in Japanese released after the TPP agreement, Osamu Nagayama, chairman and CEO of majority-Roche owned Japanese pharma firm Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., said that the TPP was in general to be welcomed, given the trade opportunities and business and tax regulatory streamlining that it would bring.</p><p>But he expressed caution over the need to balance the "eight years of effective protection" for biologics with the need to provide sufficient incentives for innovation and R&D.</p><p>This article has <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/10/6/tpp-missed-opportunity-or-unprecedented-assault" target="_new">also been published</a> in <i>PharmAsia News</i>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to subscribers.)</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
