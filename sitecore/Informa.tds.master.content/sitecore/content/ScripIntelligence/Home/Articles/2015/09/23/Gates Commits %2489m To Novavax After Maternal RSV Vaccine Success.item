<p>Now that Novavax Inc.'s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine has succeeded in a Phase II clinical trial in pregnant women, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed up to $89m to help the company fund a massive Phase III trial that will include sites in developing countries. </p><p>Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Novavax revealed on Sept. 29 that its RSV F-protein recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate (RSV F vaccine) generated significant antibodies to block RSV infection in pregnant women and provided protection against lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV in the mothers' newborn infants. The company plans to start a 4,000- to 8,000-patient, adaptive design Phase III clinical trial during the first quarter of 2016 in pregnant women.</p><p>The RSV F vaccine results in new mothers and their babies follow <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novavax-Gets-Aggressive-With-Its-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus-Vaccine-359914" target="_new">positive Phase II clinical trial results in elderly adults</a>, which were reported in August. An 8,000- to 10,000-patient Phase III trial that will enroll older adults is expected to begin before the end of 2015. Late-stage data in elderly patients are expected about a year from the Phase III study's initiation, but it may take two to three years to enroll the Phase III study with pregnant women.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is funding the maternal program for RSV F vaccine, because of the organization's mission to protect newborns in developing countries from diseases. The Gates Foundation's grant requires Novavax to conduct part of its Phase III study in emerging markets, including Africa and South America, and to sell the approved vaccine at affordable prices in low-income countries without a big time gap between approvals in the US and EU and approvals in developing countries.</p><p>"It's their goal to solve the problem with the pharma industry, because it takes 15 to 20 years on average to get drugs approved in developing countries after they're approved in high-income countries," Novavax president and CEO Stanley Erck said. </p><p>The Gates Foundation's backing also should help Novavax enroll pregnant women in its Phase III clinical trial in developing countries where the Gates Foundation has relationships with clinical trial sites. </p><p>"As a small biotech company, we wouldn't have been able to enroll patients there ourselves," Erck said.</p><p><b>Second Set Of Phase II Results</b></p><p>Novavax's 50-patient, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial enrolled pregnant women in their third trimester to assess safety and immunogenicity as measured by serum RSV anti-F IgG, microneutralizing and palivizumab-competing antibody (PCA) titers through the rest of their pregnancies, at delivery and for 180 days postpartum. </p><p>Umbilical cord blood samples were obtained to determine the titers of RSV PCA, anti-F IgG and microneutralizing titers in the mothers' infants. Other infant blood samples were taken through the first six months of life to estimate the half-life of vaccine-induced maternal antibodies.</p><p>Vaccinated women had a mean 14-fold increase in anti-F IgG, a mean 29-fold rise in PCA, and a two-fold rise in microneutralization titers, while women in the placebo had no significant change in antibody levels. </p><p>The infants' antibodies were 100% of the mothers' anti-F IgG antibody titers, while the average PCA antibody transfer between mothers and infants was 90% and the average microneutralizing antibody transfer was 90% for RSV/A and 100% for RSV/B. Estimated half-lives of infant PCA, anti-F IgG, RSV/A and RSV/B microneutralizing antibodies were 41, 30, 36 and 34 days, respectively, after 60-day assessments of the newborns. </p><p>"We don't have the final blood draw from the infants, but we have an estimate of the half-life, which suggests to us that we will at least meet our goal of protection for greater than three months. Everything we hoped to see has manifested in the trial data," Novavax senior vice president of research and development Gregory Glenn said.</p><p>Glenn noted that safety was the first and foremost objective of the Phase II maternal study, and Novavax's RSV F vaccine was even better than the company hoped compared with placebo with only a few cases of RSV, which were all in the placebo groups. </p><p><b>Limited Competition, Big Need</b></p><p>The only prophylaxis for RSV infections is AstraZeneca's Synagis (palivizumab) for at-risk newborns. Otherwise, Novavax is in the lead, followed by GlaxoSmithKline, which completed enrollment in a Phase II study for its vaccine in July, according to Citeline's TrialTrove database and Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database. </p><p>AstraZeneca's MedImmune subsidiary has multiple Phase I candidates under development in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). MedImmune's MEDI-750 is expected to enter Phase II for the prevention of RSV infection in elderly adults in October, according to an RSV vaccine overview written by Citeline's Gabrielle Gessner. </p><p>Bavarian Nordic has plans to begin a Phase II RSV vaccine study in October, but the target population has not been disclosed, Gessner noted.</p><p>"Soon, high-risk infants may not need to spend a week at the hospital with this deadly virus, but could be vaccinated before birth," she concluded.</p><p>Novavax noted that half of all hospitalizations due to RSV occur during the first three months of life.</p><p>Also, RSV is the leading cause of pneumonia in infants in developing countries, but there are no affordable vaccines to protect children in lower-income regions, according to Keith Klugman, director of the Gates Foundation's pneumonia program in a statement about the organization's support of Novavax's vaccine.</p><p>"Maternal immunization may provide protective antibodies to infants during the first few months of life, and we hope this vaccine will protect infants from this disease to help them live healthy, productive lives," Klugman said.</p><p>Novavax always has planned to take its RSV vaccine forward through commercialization on its own in the US and with partners in ex-US markets, Erck said during an interview in early September to lay the groundwork for the company's Phase II maternal study results. </p><p>With Phase II data in hand from two populations, ex-US collaborations could contribute some additional funding for Novavax's planned Phase III trials, but the company has raised $450m during the past two years to make sure it has enough cash to take the RSV vaccine forward on its own.</p><p><p><p><p>
