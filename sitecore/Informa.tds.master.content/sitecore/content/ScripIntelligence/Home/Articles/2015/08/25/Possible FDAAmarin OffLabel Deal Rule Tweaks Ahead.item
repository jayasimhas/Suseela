<p>The FDA appears to be headed towards a settlement with Amarin over the company's challenge that it has the right to share "truthful and non-misleading" information about the unapproved uses of its fish-oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) &ndash; a case in which the biotech was handed a big win on Aug. 7.</p><p>In an Aug. 28 letter to Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Amarin's attorney Floyd Abrams, a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, said "the parties have agreed to explore the possibility of settlement of this matter," and asked the court to stay until Oct. 30 any further proceedings until the firm and the FDA could file a joint letter advising of their views about the next steps in the lawsuit.</p><p>In granting a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Want-To-Promote-Off-Label-Pick-Your-Battlefield-359838" target="_new">motion for preliminary injunction</a> on Aug. 7, Judge Engelmayer said Amarin could share certain "truthful and non-misleading" information about Vascepa "without incurring liability for misbranding" &ndash; a major blow to the FDA.</p><p>But rather than appealing that decision, "it looks like, once again, the FDA is going to blink," Philadelphia lawyer James Beck, counsel in life sciences industry group at Reed Smith, told Scrip.</p><p>"It's the second time the FDA has had the opportunity to appeal and it looks like they don't want to," Beck said.</p><p>Indeed, he noted the US regulatory agency had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Americans-unwilling-to-sacrifice-Medicare-but-back-better-Part-D-deal-339427" target="_new">backed away from appealing</a> a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Are-sleepless-nights-ahead-for-FDA-in-wake-of-off-label-narcolepsy-drug-verdict-337862" target="_new">December 2012 decision</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, which overturned the October 2008 conviction of a New York sales representative, Alfred Caronia, for conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce related to discussions he had with doctors about unapproved uses for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' narcolepsy drug Xyrem (sodium oxybate).</p><p>In that case, the Second Circuit ruled that "truthful" off-label promotion of US approved prescription drugs is not criminal activity and is protected speech under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.</p><p>The FDA publicly brushed off the <i>Caronia</i> ruling as not significantly affecting the agency's enforcement of the drug misbranding provisions of the <i>Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</i> (FDCA), and insisted the decision did not strike down any of the law's provisions or regulations.</p><p>"Nor does it find a conflict between the act's misbranding provisions and the First Amendment or call into question the validity of the act's drug approval framework," regulators said in a statement.</p><p>Amarin filed its suit in May after the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-expanded-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-358103" target="_new">refused to approve</a> the use of Vascepa as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in adults on statin therapy with mixed dyslipidemia and TG levels from 200mg/dL to 499mg/dL &ndash; the so-called ANCHOR indication.</p><p>The FDA also refused to allow Amarin to include the results of the ANCHOR trial &ndash; a study whose details were worked out with regulators in advance under a special protocol assessment (SPA) agreement &ndash; in Vascepa's labeling.</p><p>The FDA threatened to bring misbranding charges against the company if it attempted to promote the ANCHOR results.</p><p>But Amarin said that by prohibiting such "truthful" off-label use of Vascepa, the FDA was "chilling" the firm's constitutionally protected free speech under the First Amendment &ndash; basing that argument on the <i>Caronia</i> decision.</p><p>Judge Engelmayer, whose court resides within the jurisdiction of the Second Circuit, sided with Amarin and provided the injunctive relief.</p><p>But the court also warned that the First Amendment does not protect false or misleading commercial speech. </p><p>"<i>Caronia's</i> construction of the misbranding provisions so to exclude truthful promotion speech affords no protection to a manufacturer that uses false or misleading communications to promote an off-label use," Judge Engelmayer said.</p><p>And, he said, the First Amendment "protects expression, not conduct." </p><p>"A manufacturer that engages in non-communicative activities to promote off-label use cannot use the First Amendment as a shield," Judge Engelmayer said. "<i>Caronia </i>holds protected, and outside the reach of the FDCA's misbranding provisions, off-label promotion only where it wholly consists of truthful and non-misleading speech."</p><p>With the potential for there to be a settlement in the Amarin case, Reed Smith's Beck said it will be interesting to see whether the FDA "reconciled itself, and I don't know that it has, to a greater degree of court-sanctioned truthful off-label promotion."</p><p>While Beck said he thinks regulators are anxious to put the Amarin case behind the agency, he wondered whether the FDA would seek to revise its rules to prevent another similar case from happening.</p><p>After all, he said, it was the specific procedural path the FDA took that led Amarin to file its case, allowing the company to choose the jurisdiction &ndash; the Second Circuit &ndash; something more firms are apt to do.</p><p>If the FDA decides to change its practice &ndash; either by issuing formal rules or refusing to entertain off-label promotion proposals &ndash; "that's how you will know whether they've reconciled," Beck said. </p><p>FDA spokeswoman Sarah Peddicord told <i>Scrip</i> regulators were "engaged in a comprehensive review" of regulations and guidance documents in an effort to "harmonize the fundamental public health interests" underlying the agency's mission and statutory framework with the interests in the dissemination of "truthful and non-misleading" information. </p><p>But it's unclear what direction those actions will take.</p><p>This past spring, the FDA said it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-to-hold-off-label-drug-meeting-358249" target="_new">planning to hold a public meeting</a> devoted to off-label promotion, but Beck said he wasn't holding his breath for that to happen any time soon.</p><p>Shares of Bedminster, N.J.-based Amarin rose 5% in morning trading on Aug. 31, before closing at $2.21, down 2 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
