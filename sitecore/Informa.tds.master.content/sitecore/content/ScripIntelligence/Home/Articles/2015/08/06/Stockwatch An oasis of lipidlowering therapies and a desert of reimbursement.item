<p>Last week was chock-full of commentary from the FDA Advisory Panels on the new lipid-lowering drugs directed against PCSK9 from Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Amongst those and other related companies, the only share price winner of the week was Sanofi, with its main listing outside of the US, and even then it was for the wrong reason.</p><p><p>Consecutive Advisory Panels on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">Amgen's Repatha</a> (evolocumab) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Sanofi/Regeneron's Praluent</a> (alirocumab) recommended that both drugs should be approved with the biggest panel majorities leaning towards the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) indication. This may explain the disappointment amongst investors reflected in their share price falls because a wider indicated patient population might have been hoped for. On first blush, that was where the logical correlation between share price movements over the week and fundamental news broke down.</p><p><p>The share prices of Amgen and Regeneron were weak last week even with support from investment bank analysts. (The analysts from Citigroup in particular jumped the gun and proclaimed in three versions of the same research note "Praluent approved as expected". I am sure the FDA will not be pleased with the view from Citigroup that its powers to approve drugs have been devolved to its advisory panels. Perhaps the share price weakness in companies developing PCSK9-directed lipid lowering therapies is part of some wider concern since the shares of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals &ndash; whose product Juxtapid (lomitapide) is approved for the more orphan and distinct homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia &ndash; fell by about half that of Regeneron.</p><p><p>In the cool light of the weekend after the PCSK9 panels it seems clear that both products will probably be approved and both will eventually gain access to a wider patient population outside of HeFH, even if it needs the completion of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and sNDA filings. We should ask ourselves what it is that US investors are concerned about that resulted in the share price weaknesses of Amgen, Regeneron and Aegerion, if it passed by those investors in Sanofi.</p><p><p>The issue of drug pricing briefly raised its ugly head after the PCSK9 panels but representatives from both companies refused to be drawn on the prospective pricing of their drugs which, like the statins, will be chronically administered. This is part of a much wider debate permeating through managed care organizations and other centralized buyers of pharmaceuticals that a few weeks ago featured immuno-oncology drugs, and last week briefly starred these new lipid-lowering drugs. This debate has its roots in the proposed pricing for gene therapy medicines where one dose might result in a clinical cure and the total profit for that drug's development has to be recovered in that one dose. We have probably moved beyond the $1m per dose list price where one diagnosed patient can bankrupt a private hospital or a NHS trust. The management of gene therapy companies uniQure and bluebird bio for example, have both started to talk about payment by instalments and annuity pricing.</p><p><p>Annuity pricing opens a whole can of worms not just for gene therapy and CAR-T companies, where one dose or one course might result in a cure, but also for any company developing and marketing a high-priced pharmaceutical that requires chronic dosing. There is another reason why payers want to help frame this debate now because the other dynamic &ndash; the durability of the response &ndash; is still uncertain. This was illustrated by the recent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celladons-CUPID-wont-kill-gene-therapy-358080" target="_new">failure of Celladon's gene therapy</a> in heart failure and the reported short duration of response of the AAV RPE65 gene therapy in Leber's congenital amaurosis. These results seem to be pushing payers towards pay-by-instalment and pay-for-results pricing models where the long-term outcomes are uncertain. Payment-by-outcome in particular, has big implications since the CVOTs needed to enable the wider prescribing of the PCSK9-directed lipid-lowering therapies will seem like a drop in the ocean when long-term outcome studies become required for gene therapy reimbursement. If Sanofi investors are in blissful ignorance of the smaller initial HeFH market for Praluent, wait until gene therapy investors realize that reimbursement for those drugs will look more like small success-based private financing tranches or even the equivalent of holding a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-Genzyme-deal-whats-the-hold-up-311163" target="_new">contingent value right</a>.</p><p><p>But the still wider issue is the thick end of the wedge as it applies to expensive chronically dosed orphan and ultra-orphan drugs, such as those marketed by Alexion and Sanofi, for example. When annuity outcome-based pricing comes to gene therapies, it is likely that the weighted average annual payments for these therapies will be much less than the $200,000 to $300,000 annual costs for the larger patient groups on Sanofi's enzyme replacement therapies and Alexion's Soliris (eculizumab). At that point, reimbursement for these drugs will be re-negotiated and the cost per year will not go up. Can you see why we are not invested in either Sanofi or Alexion?</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Amgen, Regeneron and Aegerion.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
