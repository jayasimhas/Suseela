<p>When Merck & Co. Inc. won FDA approval on Oct. 2 of its programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) &ndash; the drug's second U.S. approval, gaining an earlier nod in melanoma &ndash; investors may have been hoping for a broader indication.</p><p>But U.S. regulators stuck to what was the likely scenario: granting Keytruda an accelerated approval for use in the subgroup of patients found in Merck's KEYNOTE-001 study most likely to benefit &ndash; those with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test and who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. </p><p>Keytruda's labeling notes that patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for those aberrations before receiving the medicine. </p><p>Shares of Merck initially were trading down on the Oct. 2 news of the NSCLC approval &ndash; falling 2%, or a loss of $ 1.02.</p><p>But once Merck weighed in on the approval &ndash; pointing out that Keytruda is the first and only anti-PD-1 therapy approved for both squamous and non-squamous metastatic NSCLC &ndash; investors appeared more optimistic, giving the company's shares a slight boost, before closing at $50.14, up 77 cents, or 1.5%.</p><p>Merck's competitor in the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor space, Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab), is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">approved</a> for a smaller group of patients &ndash; those with metastatic squamous NSCLC in patients with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>But BMS, whose shares jumped 5.2% on Oct. 2, is hot on the trail of pursuing broader NSCLC use of Opdivo, whose initially cleared lung cancer indication was the "fastest approval I've seen in my 15 year career," Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">declared in March</a>.</p><p>Both <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">Keytruda</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">Opdivo</a> are approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following BMS' Yervoy (ipilimumab) and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor &ndash; with Merck's drug beating BMS' to the finish line by more than three months last year and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Mercks-Keytruda-A-Remarkable-Science-To-Success-Story-360381" target="_new">making history as the first</a> PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor on the U.S. market.</p><p>On Oct. 1, however, BMS <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-OKd-1st-U.S.-Immuno-Oncology-Combo-360779" target="_new">scored another FDA win</a> for Opdivo as part of a combination regimen with Yervoy in patients with BRAF V600 wild-type melanoma.</p><p>Keytruda's NSCLC dosage is the same as what is used in its melanoma indication &ndash; 2mg/kg every three weeks &ndash; so its $12,500 per month price for payers is unchanged, Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>BMS also charges $12,500 for Opdivo per month in melanoma monotherapy and NSCLC.</p><p>Eisele emphasized that "like many cancer treatments, the drug cost of Keytruda will vary based on a patient's weight and length of treatment." </p><p>She noted the amount that any patient actually pays for a medication is determined by the terms of the insurance policy or the government program, like Medicare or Medicaid, in which the person participates.</p><p><b>Companion Dx</b></p><p>Along with Keytruda's NCSLC approval, the FDA on Oct. 2 also cleared a companion diagnostic, PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test, from Agilent Technologies unit Dako North America Inc., which regulators said is intended to enable prescribers to determine the level of PD-L1 expression in a patient's tumor. </p><p>But Evercore's Schoenebaum noted the level of PD-L1 is not specified in Keytruda's indication, which he read as including >1% PD-L1 expression.</p><p>The efficacy data included in the labeling are only for the subset of patients with PD-L1 plus expression >50%, he said.</p><p>Schoenebaum said, however, the labeling for Dako's diagnostic includes response data for the cohort of patients with 1-49% PD-L1 expression.</p><p>He also pointed out Keytruda's NSCLC labeling includes only overall response rate (ORR) and not progression-free survival or overall survival data.</p><p><b>KEYNOTE-001</b></p><p>The open-label multi-cohort, activity-estimating KEYNOTE-001 study evaluated a cohort of 280 patients with metastatic NSCLC who had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy, and if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK mutations and any evidence of PD-L1 expression by a clinical trial immunohistochemistry assay. </p><p>A prospectively defined subgroup was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate PD-L1 as a biomarker among 61 patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) greater than or equal to 50%. </p><p>Patients received Keytruda monotherapy 10 mg/kg every two or three weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. </p><p>Keytruda demonstrated an ORR of 41% in patients with a PD-L1 expression TPS of 50% or more, with all of those being partial responses. </p><p>Merck had reported that 84% of the patients who responded had ongoing responses, including 11 patients with ongoing responses of six months or longer. </p><p>The ORR and duration of response were similar, regardless of dosing schedule &ndash; every two weeks or every three weeks, Merck said. </p><p>In a separate subgroup of 25 patients with limited follow-up with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50% receiving Keytruda at a dosage of 2mg/kg every three weeks in KEYNOTE-001, activity was also observed, Merck said.</p><p>The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 20% of study patients were fatigue (44%), cough (29%), decreased appetite (25%), and dyspnea (23%), the company said.</p><p>Merck noted that it is conducting multiple Phase III trials of Keytruda in advanced NSCLC.</p><p>The company also has submitted applications to expand the drug's use to broader populations with melanoma, with decisions <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Keytruda-Wins-Expanded-Melanoma-Priority-Review-Also-A-Delay-360014" target="_new">anticipated in December</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
