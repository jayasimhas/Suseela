<p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan organization that provides budgetary advice to lawmakers, estimated that implementing the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; a bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise &ndash; would cost $106.4bn over five years, with the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) accounting for most of that amount.</p><p>But the congressional analysts said the bill, known as HR 6, which is expected to be voted on by the House in early July, also would reduce direct spending, on net, by $11.9bn over the same period, from fiscal year 2016 to 2025.</p><p>Certain provisions in the legislation, however, would increase federal spending, like the measure that would permit the FDA to extend the exclusivity of brand-name drugs that gain new indications for treating rare diseases, which the CBO said would add $869m to federal healthcare programs over the first five years because of the delay to the market of lower-priced generics and biosimilars.</p><p>While many manufacturers could benefit over the next decade from an extension of exclusivity, the congressional analysts said they expected only certain medicines would meet all of the criteria.</p><p>They determined that about 15% of brand-name products would gain the six months of exclusivity under the Cures provision.</p><p>States' Medicaid costs also would increase by $2.6bn over five years if the bill is enacted due to the delay of generics and the limitation of payments on durable medical equipment, the CBO estimated.</p><p>Leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">in May proposed</a> covering the costs of the Cures bill by requiring the Department of Energy to sell 8 million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve over eight years, from 2018 through 2025, which is estimated to bring in $5.2bn, and by changing the timing of reinsurance payments to Medicare Part D drug plans, which could provide another $7bn.</p><p>Among the other offsets included in the Cures bill passed by the E&C Committee was a plan to limit Medicaid reimbursement to states for durable medical equipment to Medicare rates, which could provide close to $3bn to go towards paying down the Cures costs.</p><p>The legislation calls for boosting the budgets of NIH by $10bn and the FDA by $550m over five years. </p><p>The Cures bill would reauthorize the NIH, make several programmatic changes to the agency's research and loan repayment programs and authorize other initiatives aimed at promoting medical research &ndash; all at a cost of $105.1bn over five years. </p><p>The legislation also aims to modify the FDA's approach to regulating prescription drugs, biologics, medical devices and health-related technology and would make changes to certain surveillance activities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) relating to antimicrobials and the agency's vaccine-related activities.</p><p>The CBO said implementing the provisions in the Cures bill administered by the FDA would cost $872m, but the agency estimated it would need about <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">$1bn to cover its costs</a>.</p><p>The CBO also said it would take $35m to implement the measures administered by the CDC, which plays a much smaller role in the Cures legislation.</p><p>The analysts also estimated that provisions affecting discretionary spending by other Health and Human Services programs would cost $427m and $21m for other departments and agencies. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
