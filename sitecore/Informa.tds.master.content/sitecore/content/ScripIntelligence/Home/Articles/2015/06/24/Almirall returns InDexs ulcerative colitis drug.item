<p>Almirall has returned ulcerative colitis therapy Kappaproct to its originator company InDex Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Almirall licensed exclusive rights to Kappaproct for the European market in March last year, but has now returned the drug to InDex after a "repositioning of its R&D organization", which will see the company focus on new chemical entities it has in development for dermatological conditions. </p><p>The deal could have seen InDex receive up to &euro;100m from Almirall following an undisclosed upfront payment and staggered milestone payments. InDex was also eligible for double digit royalties from Almirall on the eventual European net sales of Kappaproct.</p><p>The drug, a so called DIMS compound (DNA-based immunomodulatory sequence), is currently in Phase III for ulcerative colitis. Its immunommodulatory effect is brought about through the agonistic stimulation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). </p><p>In March, the Phase III COLLECT (EU) study for Kappaproct did not meet its primary endpoint. But results did suggest that topical administration of the TLR-9 agonist was able to induce remission in ulcerative colitis patients, as judged by objective clinical and endoscopic measures. Analysts at Sagient Research's BioMedTracker said, "Therefore, the concept of TLR-9 activation is a promising and well-tolerated novel therapeutic option for refractory ulcerative colitis patients, warranting further clinical trials."</p>
