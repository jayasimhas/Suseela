<p> <b>Dr David Rubenstein, a dermatologist and the current vice-president of discovery and preclinical development at GlaxoSmithKline's skin health treatment and research company, Stiefel, believes pharma has only gotten skin deep when it comes to dermatology drug development. </b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/AC2681D6FC0945B280DAA167BD03378D.ashx"> <br> <br> <i>Dr David Rubenstein</i> <br> <br> A member of the American Academy of Dermatology, the Medical Dermatology Society and the Society of Investigative Dermatology, he talks to <i>Scrip</i> about how dermatology is a growing opportunity for pharmaceutical companies and what challenges are facing this therapeutic area in light of big technology developments and patient empowerment. <br> <br> Dr Rubenstein, who has also been on the board of directors of the Society of Investigative Dermatology, an associate editor of the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</i>, and chair of the Dermatology Foundation's medical and scientific committee, explains why he loves working with the body's largest organ, how he got into the field and how R&amp;D for skin conditions can be very different to other diseases. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What are the key things that shaped you growing up?</b> <br> <br> <b>David Rubenstein:</b> One of the drivers for me was that I had family and a school environment which really valued and encouraged learning and curiosity. There were many opportunities to ask questions and be encouraged by my parents and teachers to work out the answers to the questions methodically, so really I loved to learn. I loved to solve problems and that has driven me professionally and personally. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What led you into this industry particularly and how did you reach your current position at Stiefel?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I joined the company in December of 2013. Prior to that time I had been a faculty member at the University of Carolina-Chapel Hill, where I still am a practicing dermatologist, but back then I also ran a research lab full-time. Part of what drove my work was my curiosity and desire to learn about things, but also to do things in a way that would provide value and to help the patients that I see in the clinic who really needed additional or newer therapies to treat their disease. There was an opportunity that came along in December 2013 to be part of Stiefel GSK working in an area that would permit me to be part of a larger team to develop medicines and that just was too good of an opportunity to pass up. I just had to be part of it so I left my lab. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What are the biggest differences between being in the lab and being in a pharmaceutical company?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I thought it would be a very different environment but the actual day-to-day setting is not that different. There is a desire to identify problems of significance &ndash; what do our patients need? &ndash; and then to drive the science to develop the information that will allow us to make medicines to treat those diseases. So it's not that different, it's all science driven, collaborative, very interactive, and fun. People have these perceptions of differences between certain parts of the life science world but my sense is that people are people, teams are teams and there are a lot more similarities than differences in the environments. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What are your long-term aspirations?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR: </b>I really want to see some of the medicines that we are developing get to patients. At the end of the day I feel like we have an opportunity to do something really unique here. I want to see it be successful and the accomplishment will be our patients doing better. I also want to provide opportunities for the people that I work with to grow, which is very similar to what I was doing in an academic environment. I want to see them do really tremendous things. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: Can you tell me a bit more about what is in development at the moment at Stiefel? </b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> We are interested in developing a variety of different types of medicine, whether they are topical or systemic agents. We're interested in some of the more common as well as less common diseases that affect patients. I can tell you that we've built some unique capabilities here. One of the nice things about being in the field of dermatology is that the organ we target, the skin, is quite accessible. It allows us to do things both experimentally and clinically that would be more challenging for other organ systems. We really have an opportunity to assess the efficacy of many of our medicines before they would even get to human trials. This can increase the likelihood of the candidates being successfully delivered to the patient. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: Since joining Stiefel, what is the one change you've effected that's been invaluable?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I run the early discovery and preclinical development group and I think I've been able to provide some perspective to the people I work with about patient needs and the impact of disease. There are very few jobs out there where you get to do something that's a lot of fun, that's very interesting and actually has a really positive impact on a very, very large number of folks. I have the benefit of having that type of career. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: And from your previous roles in academia what key learnings have you brought with you?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> Find the best people you can, provide them with the resources that they need to do their jobs, then get out of the way and let them do what they do pretty well. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What current trends or challenges have you noticed in the industry and how are they affecting the way you work? </b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> Some amazing things have happened in the last five or 10 years in terms of the ability to generate vast amounts of information &ndash; there's genomics and proteomics and transcriptomics &ndash; and one of the challenges is how to efficiently collate and look through the data in order to make connections that are relevant to problems of interest. I think computational biology, bioinformatics, is an area that's really growing. That's probably one of the more interesting trends. <br> <br> Another trend, more specific to dermatology, is a recognition that skin disease is not just on the skin. There was an understanding based upon some work published by Joel Gefland initially &ndash; then many, many other investigators following after him &ndash; for example on psoriasis, there are many co-morbid conditions that track with that disease. There's an increasing understanding of the impact of general inflammation that manifests as skin disease in other organ systems, there's a clear understanding of the psychosocial impact in the burden on patients with skin disease. This is an area that many of my colleagues, both in the pharma industry and in clinical dermatology, are beginning to have a better understanding of and it is helping them to treat their patients more wholly than they might have in the past. <br> <br> Also the field of dermatology is changing. It used to be that we actually made very few medicines for skin disease; in fact it was quite rare. Medicines would be made for other indications and they would find their way into dermatology through clinical observations, case reports and things like that. But the potential of the field and the growing understanding of the physiology of skin disease has changed this. There is a big opportunity for drug development in dermatology and space to grow more understanding of dermatology that can feed back into other disciplines and other indications. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What changes do you foresee in the next five or so years and how will they affect your field of interest?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> Technology is exploding, that's going to fundamentally change how we can do things and how we identify targets of interests. Also the field of dermatology is expanding, there is a lot of opportunity to make medicines to help patients who haven't had access to the right medicines before. So I see potential growth and expansion of companies' scientists working in the area of dermatology. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: A bit more about yourself. If you were starting over what would be the best advice you'd give to your younger yourself?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I've been very fortunate in my path and I think I've had really wonderful mentors and wonderful teachers. I would tell my younger self to be less arrogant and perhaps pay more attention to what I was being told. Hopefully I do that more now. I am surrounded by extremely bright and very talented individuals and I've had the benefit of their experience, knowledge and counsel. If I knew at 20 what I know now... oh boy, right! <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What's been your proudest moment in your career?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> Every time I see one of my former trainees or students progress in their lives that provides me with a lot of pride. Having the opportunity to watch people grow and develop and in a small way participate in that is extraordinarily fulfilling. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: The flipside, what's been the most difficult moment?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I think probably the most difficult moments are yet to come. The really difficult moments are the ones that you can't find solutions to and so far I've been fortunate. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: Tell us something surprising about yourself.</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I've been training in martial arts for over 30 years; at the moment I continue to actively train in just taekwondo. I don't like to get kicked in the head anymore. Currently I'm a third degree black belt in taekwondo and training to hopefully someday test for my Master's Level, fourth degree. It keeps me healthy, it's a lot of fun and I've a great group of friends that I've trained with for years. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What else do you do in your spare time?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> I love to cook and eat. Typically when I get home I'll spend a couple of hours making, eating and cleaning up after dinner. It just provides a really relaxing environment at the end of a day. I have two kids, my son is off to college this year, he is a phenomenal musician, great guitar player and I tried to pick up the guitar and well... pitiful. My daughter started gymnastics last year and she's just rocking it, she is amazing and it requires a fair bit of time driving her to and from practices and that occupies some of my spare time <br> <br> <b>Scrip: What was the last thing you changed your mind about in a business decision?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR:</b> About pursuing a project. There was a particular drug development project that was being discussed by one of the folks in my organization and initially it was something I didn't think we should devote a lot of time and resource to. But having really smart, energetic people who are committed to their jobs pays off. This individual came back with a very, very good reason for us to move forward on that project and basically showed me that my initial decision not to want to pursue it was wrong. So we're now moving forward with that particular idea. <br> <br> <b>Scrip: Finally, what is one myth about the pharmaceutical industry that you'd like to set straight?</b> <br> <br> <b>DR: </b>I get this sense sometimes the public view of the pharma industry is quite adversarial but at the end of the day it's an industry that's really trying to help patients. If I look at it as a physician, if I don't have medicines I can't treat my patients. What the pharmaceutical industry is doing is manufacturing those medicines and actually developing newer medicines that are curing diseases. Just look at what's happened in hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Those were diseases that were not treatable not so long ago. <br> <br> I remember I was in medical school at the beginnings of the HIV epidemic and that was a lethal disease but it's a disease that can be better treated today. You could say the same about what is happening in various cancers now. I want people to realize that the pharma industry is part of a partnership with physicians and with patients; together they are trying to improve health and lives. </p>
