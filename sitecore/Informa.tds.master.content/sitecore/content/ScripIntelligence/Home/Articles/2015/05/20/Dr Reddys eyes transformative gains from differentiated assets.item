<p>More details on Dr Reddy's Laboratories' proprietary products business have emerged, with the firm disclosing that it has more than half a dozen programs in the pipeline in the dermatology and neurology space each, including early stage ones for non-genital warts, actinic keratosis (AK) and Parkinson's.</p><p>The Hyderabad-based firm had previously indicated that it expects to build targeted dermatology and neurology franchises powered by "lower risk" innovation in the proprietary products segment.</p><p>In a presentation to investors on 18 May, Dr Reddy's highlighted its mid-stage dermatology and neurology assets. In the derma space, these comprise DFD-03, a zero contact time retinoid facewash; DFD-04, a novel repurposed topical active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for the treatment of rosacea; DFD-05, a novel combination therapy for non-genital warts; and DFD-07, a novel repurposed non-cytotoxic topical API for AK.</p><p>Key mid-stage migraine assets include DFN-02, an intranasal triptan spray with injection kinetics; DFN-15, a novel repurposed rapid acting non-triptan oral API for triptan-intolerant or non-responsive patients; a novel device-based injectable triptan play; and DFN-19, a novel DHE-based formulation with similar efficacy to Levadex, though expected to be in a more convenient dosage form.</p><p>Last year the US FDA <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Rejection-approval-and-2-moves-to-PhIII-change-Allergan-conversation-352592%5d" target="_new">rejected</a>, for the third time, Allergan's experimental inhaled migraine drug Semprana (dihydroergotamine; formerly Levadex). The FDA's complete response letter then essentially flagged off concerns about the specifications around content uniformity on the firm's "improved" canister filling process and on standards for device actuation for Semprana. </p><p>Dr Reddy's suggested that the mid-term opportunities that it was pursuing in the proprietary products segment had the potential to be "transformative" for its business. It expects potential sales of $100-300m per opportunity if the target label is achieved and anticipates first filings of these in FY18.</p><p>Last month, Dr Reddy's Laboratories announced its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Dr-Reddys-kicks-off-derma-neurology-NDA-filings-357720%5d" target="_new">first bucket of New Drug Application (NDA) filings</a> with the US FDA for its proprietary products business: three 505(b) (2) NDAs &ndash; DFD-01 and DFD-09 in the dermatology space and DFN-11 in the neurology segment. </p><p>These could translate into potential sales of $50-75m per opportunity in the near term, the investor presentation indicated.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i> that Dr Reddy's proprietary products portfolio was very interesting, though the value proposition in the near term looked moderate for a company of its size and ambitions.</p><p>Mr Mehta also said that while Dr Reddy's has outlined exciting long-term opportunities, he was hoping for a more granular view on the short-term outlook in the area of complex generics &ndash; the success of which he believes is vital as the company moves into the proprietary products and biosimilars space.</p><p>The Dr Reddy's presentation referred to how complex products now make up about half of its filed generics portfolio. As of March 2015, the company had 68 pending ANDAs and three pending NDAs [505 (b) (2) filings] with 51% complex products. This is against 65 pending ANDAs with 38% complex products in March 2013.</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p>Meanwhile, in addition to potentially offering a "clear" medical benefit for a subset of patients within neurology and dermatology, Dr Reddy's also underscored that its pricing strategy for its proprietary products will be "more attractive" to patients and payers across both franchises, facilitating better market penetration.</p><p>"All of our products are geared toward disease areas whose health and cost burden on patients and the US healthcare system is substantial." </p><p>Dr Reddy's CEO G V Prasad has previously told <i>Scrip</i> that the company's lower risk innovation model largely involved looking at a medical problem or patient convenience issue and attempting to address this with existing molecules rather than novel entities. </p><p>The effort, he then said, would essentially involve modifying an existing drug, pharmacokinetics or dose, or combining or even repurposing molecules, and such products would likely go through the US 505 (b) (2) regulatory filing process. "It will not be an NCE kind of a development, but be more like a super-generic," he said in the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Dr-Reddys-CEO-on-the-windshield-and-rear-view-mirror-350202%5d" target="_new">interview</a>. </p>
