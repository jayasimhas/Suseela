<p> The full-year reporting season began on 21 January with Johnson &amp; Johnson reporting a strong showing from pharma sales (helped from an expected short-lived boost from its hepatitis C newcomer Olysio (simeprevir). Its fourth-quarter figures already showed the effects of &quot;currency headwinds&quot; that are expected to impact many in its pharma peer set in 2015. It warned that foreign exchange shifts with the recent strong appreciation of the US dollar will weigh on its 2015 figures. Goldman Sachs analysts believe big US pharma companies will take a 4-6% hit from currency headwinds in 2015, with about 37-50% of the top line hit flowing to EPS. </p> <p> Aside from currency impact guidance for 2015, Credit Suisse analysts expect major themes in investor calls to include drug pricing dynamics and updates on key pipeline assets. Executives, notably at Pfizer, are also likely to be quizzed on M&amp;A and business split possibilities. </p> <p> <b>All companies' pharma sales 2006-2014 </b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/1D89A88233F64BC99B15840E0870E8DD.ashx"> </p> <p> <b>Biogen and Celgene see strong sales growth </b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/A49BA3D336C048258CA4EEFB4D8C192C.ashx"> </p> <p> Below we round up expectations for the next batch of big pharma and biotech companies due to report financial results 27-29 January 2015. </p> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Company</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Analyst consensus expectations for 4Q</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>What to watch for</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Amgen </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4Q 2014 EPS: $2.05 versus $1.82 in 4Q 2013 </p> <p> Full year EPS: $8.59 versus $7.60 in FY 2013 </p> <p> Full year revenue estimate: $19.94bn versus $18.68bn in 2013 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Amgen began a &quot;significant transformation&quot; of its business in 2014 to position it to capitalize more effectively on its pipeline, said CEO Robert Bradway at the recent JP Morgan healthcare conference.

The latter three products launched during the second half of 2014 and generated $3.4m, $25.3m and $21.6m, respectively, in third quarter sales. </p> <p> Tecfidera provided $787.1m in third quarter revenue, which was nearly three times the sales reported for the same period in 2013. ISI Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum predicted $650m in fourth quarter sales and $2.3bn for full-year 2014 with a forecast for $2.85bn in 2015 sales versus consensus of $3.1bn. </p> <p> Biogen executive vice president of commercial operations Tony Kingsley told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview during the 33<sup>rd</sup> Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on 12 January in San Francisco that Tecfidera continues to perform well in the US, capturing about one-third of newly diagnosed MS patients. &quot;It's a very good choice for new patients and when people have failures on other drugs,&quot; Mr Kingsley said. &quot;The ex-US launch curves are at or above the US, so that's encouraging.&quot; Biogen has negotiated Tecfidera pricing in 11 European markets and the company expects to have reimbursement agreements in all major European markets by the end of 2015. </p> <p> Mr Kingsley noted that the market for Alprolix and Eloctate will be slow-growing, since hemophilia patients don't switch medicines very frequently, but he said the products' launches in the US are going as well as expected. </p> <p> Biogen continues to make progress with its research and development pipeline and the company is expected to seek US and EU approvals in 2015 for the MS treatment daclizumab, which could launch commercially in 2016, Mr Kingsley said.

The company has seen its stock price rise 5% since the beginning of the year, helped by positive lung cancer data for its PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> Opdivo gained its first approval in the US only in December (for advanced melanoma), so 2014 will be too early to see significant sales but Credit Suisse analysts expect the product to bring in revenues of $500m in 2015, rising to $5.7bn by 2020. Details of sales in Japan, where Opdivo was approved in July, will be of interest, as will signs of the impact of Merck's rival PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda on BMS's established antibody melanoma treatment Yervoy (ipilimumab). Credit Suisse expect sales of the latter to rise 35% to $1.30bn. Last month ratings agency Fitch raised its outlook for Bristol-Myers Squibb, saying that the company would see its newer patent-protected drugs including Sprycel for chronic myeloid leukemia, Yervoy for metastatic melanoma and Orencia for rheumatoid arthritis generate solid growth although patent expiries would continue in the short term to be &quot;a headwind to sales and cash flows &quot;, notably including those of Abilify in the US in 2015 and Baraclude elsewhere in 2016. </p> <p> Sales for 2014 are expected to be down on 2013, partly reflecting BMS selling its share of its diabetes alliance with AstraZeneca to its partner. That move came as it narrowed its R&amp;D focus, cutting diabetes, hepatitis C and neuroscience and focusing on priorities like IO.

Abraxane is slated for sales of $848m, an increase of 31%, but Celgene's biggest earner will be Revlimid, which is expected to make $4.98bn, 16% more than last year. </p> <p> Analysts at Credit Suisse concurred with the company's assessment, saying: &quot;Celgene combines a great pipeline (GED-301, MOR-202) with extremely strong growth from its current base business. We expect Celgene to continue to post strong growth driven by the recent launch of three blockbuster drugs &ndash; Pomalyst, Abraxane and Otezla with a patent settlement for Revlimid providing further potential upside.&quot; </p> <p> Looking ahead to 2015, Celgene expects revenues to reach $9-9.5bn, raking in $5.6-5.7bn from Revlimid alone.

<p> The full-year reporting season began on 21 January with Johnson &amp; Johnson reporting a strong showing from pharma sales (helped from an expected short-lived boost from its hepatitis C newcomer Olysio (simeprevir). Its fourth-quarter figures already showed the effects of &quot;currency headwinds&quot; that are expected to impact many in its pharma peer set in 2015. It warned that foreign exchange shifts with the recent strong appreciation of the US dollar will weigh on its 2015 figures. Goldman Sachs analysts believe big US pharma companies will take a 4-6% hit from currency headwinds in 2015, with about 37-50% of the top line hit flowing to EPS. </p>
