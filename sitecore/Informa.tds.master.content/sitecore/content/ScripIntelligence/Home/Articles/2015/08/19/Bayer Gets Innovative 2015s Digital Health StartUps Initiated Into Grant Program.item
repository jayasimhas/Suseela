<p>For a second year, Bayer Healthcare has launched its "Grants4Apps" program, which aims to offer financial support and business expertise to digital health start-up companies &ndash; an area of development it describes as a "very vibrant."</p><p>Bayer is giving five digital health start-ups up to &euro;50,000 each to help them advance business ideas and strategies for innovative software, hardware and technologies for doctors, patients or consumers. </p><p>The five companies were chosen from more than 200 applicants &ndash; almost triple the amount of hopefuls from 201. 2015 is also the first time Bayer employees were able to submit applications. The winning ideas belong to small businesses across three continents: MediKeep OÃœ from Estonia; Sendinaden Limited founded by Bayer entrepreneurs in China; Serona (part of Hack My Hormones, Inc.) from the US; Viomedo UG from Germany; and Vitameter Inc. from Canada. They cover the wide-ranging areas of technology including hormone tests, patient adherence, breathing patterns, clinical trials and vitamin deficiency.</p><p>Bayer's Grants4Apps initiative has sparked greater interest across the globe in 2015, as last year all of the winning ideas selected for the program were from European applicants. </p><p>Bayer told <i>Scrip</i> the initiative is part of the pharma's plan to reach all aspects of the drug development spectrum. "As a knowledge and innovation driven company we aim to advance holistic solutions and services for patients beyond the traditional pharmaceutical and medical products. This includes new approaches in digital health," it said. "Digitization is transforming the world in a rapid and highly dynamic process affecting virtually all areas of life."</p><p>More than 100 senior experts from across Bayer were involved in evaluating all applications received based on their maturity, their existing prototype and team, as well as their fit to Bayer's areas of interest, the big pharma noted. </p><p>The five companies will move into Bayer's Grants4Apps Accelerator premises at the headquarters of the company&rsquo;s pharmaceutical division in Berlin &ndash; where they will remain until late November. For the first time, two of the startup companies will also use the laboratory facilities in the Bayer CoLaborator as they &ndash; need further capacities to test their concepts in real life," Bayer said.</p><p>"The focus is to create an atmosphere where both young entrepreneurial spirit and pharmaceutical expertise can nourish, exchange, and learn from each other," Bayers added. </p><p>Bayer said it couldn't speculate on possible timelines for development for the five products in its Grants4Apps program, but it noted that "some of this year's five digital health startups have already developed quality prototypes."</p><p>Bayer itself already has a number of apps available to support its activities related to particular indications, as well as apps related with information related to the company. </p><h2>Class of 2015</h2><ol listformat="Numbered"><li>MediKeep is a mobile app being developed to keep inventory of home medicine cupboards. It has the option to list all medicines by scanning the bar-codes or searching from a database, viewing expiry dates and remaining quantities. The app is also a pill-reminder, with notifications where the user can count down dosage from the inventory after every notification. Future development plans for the tool consist of making profile based suggestions for home medicine, conflicting drug alerts, simplified medicine information sheets and an option to view taken medicine and symptoms log.</li><li>17 start-ups founded by Bayer employees were in the list of applicants for 2015, but only one was chosen for the final five. Sendinaden is focused on 3D printed smart wearable devices that help city-dwellers build better habits by triggering "flow states" for learning and health. Sendinaden's first product, the Pattern Breathe Mask, records changing in breathing patterns. Customized to each user and up to 95% 3D-printed locally, the mask filters the air while measuring the user's breathing and giving real-time feedback.</li><li>Serona generates and tracks hormone data to enable precision medicine. It is described as offering accurate and accessible hormone testing and data management to researchers and healthcare professionals. The company was co-founded in 2014 by Heather Bowerman, a biomedical engineer from UC Berkeley and Harvard, ex-McKinsey consultant and former White House science and technology policy associate; and Dr. Brandy Houser, who previously managed Pfizer alliances for the Partners Healthcare System in Boston.</li><li>Viomedo UG is a clinical trials search app. The online platform aggregates 2,000 clinical trials that are open for patients in Germany.</li><li>Finally, the Vitameter is a handheld device that analyzes users' vitamin levels from a single drop of blood similar to glucometers. The intent is to expand to other biomarkers, providing users with the information needed to "quantitatively understand and optimize their health."</li></ol><h2>Previous Grants4Apps Graduates</h2><p>The Grants4Apps Accelerator program was originally launched in 2014 for the first time as a new "model of open innovation." </p><p>The five companies chosen last year were: Cortrium, a wearable tech program that assesses body surface temperature, activity, respiration rate and runs a three-channel ECG for screening and diagnostics of cardio-logical diseases; PharmAssistant a medication reminder app; FaBulyzer a handheld device to give a precise indication of fat-burn either during or after physical activity by measuring naturally occurring compounds in breath; Parica, a contactless health monitoring app; and Qompium, which has developed FibriCheck, a screening tool to detect irregular heart rhythms.</p><p>Qompium appears to have had the most success with its app development out of the five Grants4Apps 2014 graduates. Its offering, FibriCheck, is beign developed for use on smartphones. The app enables the detection of hearth rhythm disorders by placing a finger on a smartphones camera which can retrieve algorithms. FibriCheck is currently being tested in a pilot study at the Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg hospital and the mobile health unit of Hasselt University &ndash; both in Belgium. </p>
