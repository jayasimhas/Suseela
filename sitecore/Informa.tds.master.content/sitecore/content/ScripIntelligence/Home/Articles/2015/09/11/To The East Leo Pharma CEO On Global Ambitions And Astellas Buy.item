<p><p>The acquisition of Astellas's dermatology business for &euro;675m ($725m) by Denmark's skin disease specialist Leo Pharma, announced Nov. 11, is as much about satisfying the company's desire to reach critical mass in certain markets as it is about reviving an aging portfolio of products.</p><p><p>Over the past six years, Leo has been re-inventing itself as a global specialty company rather than a Europe-focused mid-pharma, and the Astellas dermatology acquisition is its largest so far. Through the acquisition, Leo obtains a "strong foothold in markets such as China and Russia, and adds critical mass in many other markets. It's a great strategic fit for the company," said Leo's president and CEO Gitte Aabo in an interview.</p><p><p>Leo believes it can revive the Japanese company's dermatology products, that include the immunosuppressive <i>Protopic</i> (tacrolimus) ointment for eczema, and products for the treatment of acne and skin infection including <i>Locoid</i> (hydrocortisone butyrate) and <i>Locobase</i> cream for skin care and <i>Zineryt</i> (erythromycin plus zinc acetate) solution for acne. The deal does not include Protopic in Japan, however, where Maruho Co. Ltd. has distribution rights.</p><p><p>"Sales of Protopic for atopic dermatitis may be declining in the US because of generic competition, and that is likely to happen in Europe, but if you look at markets outside the US and Europe we continue to see potential to help more patients with Protopic," Aabo said. </p><p><p>According to Aabo, Leo also has experience of maintaining and building the sales of specialty products through the development of new indications, formulations and presentations. </p><p><p>"In our current portfolio we have products like the topical antibacterial <i>Fucidin</i> (fusidic acid) that have been on the market for more than 50 years, and have a number of generic versions, but our products are still showing growth. It's the same philosophy that we can apply to Protopic," she commented. </p><p><p>Leo is also just about to launch the psoriasis product <i>Enstilar</i> in the US, a foam formulation of calcipotriene and betamethasone propionate, following the loss of patent protection on a similar product <i>Taclonex</i> ointment that led to a decline in its US sales in 2014. That development is due to "the same type of thinking," Aabo noted.</p><p><p>The Astellas acquisition may be the first of several for Leo, but others "may not be of the same magnitude". There are other big pharma companies with dermatology products that are no longer part of their future strategy, but such opportunities are rare, noted Aabo, who has previously <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Leo-Pharmas-Global-Ambitions-In-Hot-Dermatology-Space-Assembles-New-Top-Team-360257" target="_new">outlined the company's ambitions to Scrip</a> following a management restructuring earlier this year. </p><p><p>For now, the Leo CEO is keen to build on the relationships it has forged with Astellas to make sure the transfer of ownership is smooth and patients don't see any disruption. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, and will increase the company's annual turnover by 20%.</p><p><p>For Astellas, the transaction allows the Japanese company to re-allocate resources to what it sees as more profitable activities &ndash; global sales of Protopic decined by 24% to $75m in the six months ended Sept. 30, 2015 and president and CEO Yoshihiko Hatanaka said: "we feel that dermatology patients around the world will be better served by transferring these products to Leo Pharma." It's the second major transaction by the Japanese firm this week: it announced the planned $379m acquisition of US regenerative ophthalmology company Ocata Therapeutics Inc. on November 10.</p><p><p><p><p>
