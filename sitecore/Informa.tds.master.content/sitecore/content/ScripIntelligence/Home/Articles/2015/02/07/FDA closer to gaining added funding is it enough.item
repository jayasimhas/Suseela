<p>Under a fiscal year 2016 spending bill that easily passed the House Appropriations Committee on 8 July in a voice vote, the FDA would get an additional $30m in discretionary spending and almost $76m in added user fees &ndash; or about $106m total &ndash; over the agency's current appropriated funding.</p><p>The bill now goes to the full House for consideration. The Senate has yet to take up a companion spending bill.</p><p>Overall, the FDA would be funded for FY 2016 under the House Appropriations bill at about $4.55bn, $1.93bn of which would come from industry user fees, with the remainder &ndash; about $2.62bn &ndash; in discretionary spending.</p><p>But Democrats complained that amount is about $116m lower than President Barack Obama had asked Congress to provide the agency.</p><p>"We are fooling ourselves if you think the FDA will be able to keep us safe and healthy without resourcing it fully," declared Representative Sam Farr (Democrat-California), the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies.</p><p>Without the full amount the president had requested, added Representative Nita Lowey (Democrat-New York), the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, the FDA would not have the resources it needs, "preventing it from fully combating dangerous illnesses."</p><p>Plus, she said, the spending bill failed to end the sequester cuts imposed by the <i>Budget Control Act of 2011</i>.</p><p>Of the user fee amount included in the bill, $826m would be paid for by brand-name prescription drug makers, with $320m coming from generic manufacturers and $21.5m from biosimilar firms.</p><p>The remainder would be provided by animal medicine companies, tobacco product firms and food producers. </p><p>Lawmakers noted the spending bill adopted by the Appropriations Committee on 8 July included a $4.2m increase over FY 2015 for FDA medical product initiatives, including $2.5m for combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) under President Obama's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">national strategy</a>.</p><p>It also included $1m for the FDA's activities related to the president's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> (PMI).</p><p>Mr Obama, however, had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">asked Congress</a> to provide an additional $14.8m for the FDA for its AMR activities and almost $10m for the agency's PMI work. </p><p>In its bill report, the Appropriations Committee urged the FDA to work to foster the development of new antibiotics by supporting greater collaboration between industry and the agency around adaptive clinical trials and labeling changes &ndash; noting the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Staying-ahead-of-tricky-resistant-bugs-PCAST-outlines-path-352852" target="_new">recommended</a> such a proposal "to help support the type of robust drug development that will be needed to ensure patients are protected from bacterial resistance."</p><p>The committee outlined a number of concerns and items it told the FDA it needed to accomplish.</p><p>Among the lawmakers concerns was the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">proposal</a> to allow generic drug makers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes, just like brand-name manufacturers do already.</p><p>The committee urged the FDA to finalize the rule based on comments it received in "to meet the stated objectives of ensuring that patients have the most complete and up-to-date information regarding their prescription drugs."</p><p>But in the Republican-led committee report, the lawmakers said the final rule should establish the FDA as the final decision maker of whether a manufacturer should change its labeling in a multisource environment. </p><p>They also said the FDA should set up processes by which the agency collects and uses all safety information to determine if a labeling change is required &ndash; from the new safety information from the manufacturer to sources such as the Sentinel System and other global databases; by which regulators have defined time parameters to take action on new safety information provided by innovator or generic application holders; and by which companies should have a defined period to make the corresponding labeling change. </p><p>"A final rule with these minimum requirements should be grounded in scientific evidence, and present no opportunity for mismatched dispensing or use information between the innovator drug and the generic version drug," the lawmakers said.</p><p>The House lawmakers pointed out the FDA has yet to approve a list of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for use by compounding pharmacists as required by the <i>Drug Quality and Security Act</i> (DQSA).</p><p>They instructed regulators to report to Congress within 90 days of enactment of the appropriations bill when the agency's review of the proposed APIs would be completed.</p><p>The appropriators also said they were concerned the FDA has been interpreting the DQSA provisions "in a manner inconsistent with its legislative intend and with the agency's own previous positions." Specifically, they said, the FDA has taken the position that that a pharmacist may not compound medications before receiving a prescription and transferring the drugs to a requesting physician or other authorized agent of the prescriber for administration to his or her patients without a patient-specific prescription accompanying the medication. </p><p>"This practice, which is often referred to as 'office-use' compounding, is authorized in the vast majority of states and was intended to be allowable under DQSA," they said. </p><p>The committee directed the FDA to issue a guidance document on how compounding pharmacists can continue to engage in office-use compounding before the receipt of a patient-specific prescription consistent within 90 days after the appropriations bill is enacted.</p><p>The lawmakers also directed the FDA to issue other guidance documents, including those for non-proprietary names for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-finalizes-3-biosimilars-guidances-358100" target="_new">biosimilars and interchangability</a> &ndash; two documents the agency has promised to have out this year.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
