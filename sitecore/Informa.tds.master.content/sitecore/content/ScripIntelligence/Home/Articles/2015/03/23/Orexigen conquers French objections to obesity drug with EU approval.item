<p>Orexigen has overcome objections from France to receive European Commission approval for its obesity product Mysimba (naltrexone HCl / bupropion HCl prolonged release) in all 28 EU member states.</p><p>The product is now approved for use as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for the management of weight in adult patients with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of ? 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese), or ? 27kg/m<sup>2</sup> to <><sup>2</sup> (overweight) in the presence of one or more weight-related co-morbidities (eg, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or controlled hypertension).</p><p>Mysimba has managed to succeed where competitor weight loss products have failed: Arena/Eisai's Belviq (lorcaserin) filing was withdrawn in 2013, and the CHMP has twice rejected Vivus's phentermine/topiramate combination Qsymia. </p><p>But it has done so in the teeth of objections from two member states. At the CHMP's meeting last December, both France and Ireland voted against Mysimba's approval and detailed their objections in a "divergent position". It is standard practice to include these divergent positions when sending the CHMP's opinion to the commission so that it can see why certain CHMP members took a particular view on a product. </p><p>The French and Irish regulatory agencies later detailed their concerns on the product's benefit-risk profile in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/France-Ireland-oppose-Mysimba-EU-approval-on-safetyefficacy-grounds-355952" target="_new">written statement in January</a>. They included doubts over the limited efficacy, rebound potential after therapy cessation, lack of long term CV data and worries over neuropsychiatric risks such as depression and suicide. </p><p>But the French regulatory agency ANSM felt strongly enough about Mysimba to raise the matter directly with the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/France-fights-to-prevent-approval-of-Orexigens-obesity-drug-356718" target="_new">which it did at the beginning of February</a>. It wrote to Sabine JÃ¼licher, head of unit D5 (medicinal products) at the commission's health and food safety directorate, informing her that it believed that Mysimba has a negative benefit-risk profile in the management of obesity.</p><p>The decision on the product's approval awaited this month's meeting of the Standing Committee.</p><p>French regulators are particularly sensitive to safety issues surrounding anti-obesity drugs, especially after the withdrawal of several other products, in particular Mediator, Servier's benfluorex-containing product. Mediator was presented as an antidiabetic but was actually more akin to an anorectic drug and was finally pulled in 2010, amid evidence that ANSM's predecessor, AFSSAPS, had kept the product on the market despite growing evidence of its risks. The situation was compounded by conflicts of interest and industry influence and the affair resulted in a wholesale restructuring of France's regulatory system. </p><p>
