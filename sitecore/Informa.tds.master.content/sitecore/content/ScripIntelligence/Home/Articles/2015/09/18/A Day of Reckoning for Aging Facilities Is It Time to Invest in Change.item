<p>With its acquisition of Hospira, Pfizer joins the ranks of pharmaceutical companies struggling to eke out a profit from aging sterile injectables facilities without shutting them down for badly needed upgrades for fear of triggering additional drug shortages. Meanwhile, flexible, modular next-generation facilities that could add capacity where needed are on the horizon.</p><p>The quality troubles that Pfizer acquired with Hospira this month are symptoms of an aging, shortage-prone sterile injectables infrastructure that the pharmaceutical industry is preparing to resolve with new, more agile manufacturing facilities.</p><p>Pfizer is piloting a modular oral solids manufacturing system that could be adapted for sterile injectables even as other manufacturers are working to resolve the challenges of the aging sterile injectable facilities they recently acquired.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amgen has taken a modular approach using single-use systems with a new biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore.</p><p>For its part, Hospira has been finding ways to upgrade its facilities without incurring downtime as it races against shortages.</p><h2>Caught In A Squeeze</h2><p>Pressured by price-cutting healthcare providers and generic competitors and by the profit demands of their own shareholders, generic injectables manufacturers have been cutting their cost of goods to the point of triggering shortages, Maik Jornitz, president of G-CON Manufacturing Inc., explained in April at the Parenteral Drug Association's 2015 annual meeting in Las Vegas.</p><p>As facilities age, they fall prey to increased risk of quality issues, unit operations breakdowns, supply problems and yield losses, he explained in a session on PDA's Aging Facilities Task Force.</p><p>Periodic upgrades of these facilities, often spurred by regulators, require extensive downtime and high remediation costs, but only provide temporary relief.</p><p>Also, because older facilities are less automated, their quality can be highly dependent upon the retention of experienced personnel, he noted.</p><p>PDA's task force is exploring solutions that would involve retrofitting such operations with quicker, more flexible closed systems that are less risky and that rely on advanced process analytical technologies. It's also looking into encouraging regulatory authorities to reduce their scrutiny of such changes so as not to inadvertently prevent them.</p><p>But for these retrofits to proceed, manufacturers will need to justify their expense, given the low margins of generic injectable drug products.</p><p>Pfizer expects the Hospira acquisition to deliver $800m in annual cost synergies by 2018, with a significant portion expected from manufacturing.</p><p>How Pfizer intends to achieve those manufacturing savings while modernizing the infrastructure is a question the company has not yet answered.</p><p>Now that drug shortages have precluded the type of extended shutdowns the industry has historically used to repair its aging infrastructure, Hospira has adapted by cleverly interweaving bite-size upgrades into its plant operations.</p><h2>Living On Borrowed Time</h2><p>With a nearly 50% US market share of specialty injectables like morphine, lidocaine, meropenem and propofol, Hospira has to approach facilities modernization with great care, global engineering VP Craig Johnson told PDA's post-conference Aging Facilities Workshop.</p><p>"It doesn't give us many freedoms to potentially take a facility down for an extended period of time because the impact of that could be rather significant," he said.</p><p>If you're a sole supplier of a product on drug shortage, "at the end of the day, you're probably running your manufacturing operation at 100% utilization just to keep up with demand or just to try to keep the product off the drug shortage list. So guess what? That makes very little time for an engineering guy to come in and say, 'I've got $20m approved. Let's go and take this line out of service for six months and do this great modernization project.'"</p><p>However, he added, "With some very careful planning, modernizing aging facilities can be done and done well without impacting drug supply."</p><p>Johnson, who came to Hospira in 2012 after a career at Merck, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, acknowledged that he would be the first to say, based on prior experience, that there is no time for upgrades during annual maintenance shutdowns &ndash; "until I said that that can't be the answer because there isn't any other time to do it."</p><p>On the surface, it doesn't seem ideal to add a modernization project when the plant is racing 24 hours a day to complete preventive maintenance activities, he said.</p><p>At Hospira, the risk is particularly severe. "Most of our manufacturing facilities are running flat out, so our shutdown windows are very narrow and we're under a tremendous amount of pressure to get back up and running right away."</p><p>The company has nevertheless found some creative ways to slip architectural upgrades into those shutdowns, "and I'll tell you, it's some of the biggest bang for the buck ... and if you can stagger them every six months through shutdowns, it's a great move."</p><p>Another strategy common in the industry is to build up inventories before going offline for upgrades. But this can be difficult if there is a shortage, because the line probably is already operating continuously, he said. And if a competitor goes off market or stops operating and a shortage begins, "then you're running flat out immediately, no questions asked."</p><p>If there is room in the manufacturing area, Hospira will install new equipment while the old equipment is operating, then during a shutdown connect it to the manufacturing line.</p><p>But because there's not a lot of space in its plants, Hospira often resorts to building an expansion area for the new equipment.</p><p>The company stages these modernization changes to give each at least a short window to work through any "hiccups." Start too many at once, and any little issue could very quickly impact drug supply.</p><p>While obtaining funding for upgrades takes work, Johnson said that, "for me, getting capital approved is not the secret to modernizing facilities." The bigger challenges are around scheduling the projects and their regulatory approval processes.</p><p>It would be a lot simpler to just build new facilities, whether at a green field site or as an expansion of an existing facility, Johnson said. "However," he added, "it's typically more expensive and typically takes much longer."</p><p>Johnson was asked if Hospira had already missed its best opportunity to improve production, which the questioner suggested would have involved investing in upgrades before exceeding a 70% utilization threshold.</p><p>His reply: "It's common across the whole industry that you would tend to push some of the manufacturing areas toward the higher end of that utilization, higher than they should, and as you know, that leads very little time for modernization."</p><p>He agreed that "it's a very good point that, if you're looking across the manufacturing facility, and across every single line you're at 99% utilization, you're living on borrowed time &#8230; and that's a lesson that I think has been learned by a lot of companies across the industry."</p><h2>Pfizer Tries Agile Approach</h2><p>Pfizer in March piloted a more agile approach to building facilities for manufacturing oral solid dosage forms, and that also could apply to sterile injectables, Pfizer technology and innovation VP Michael O'Brien told the PDA annual meeting.</p><p>The idea is to truck or ship manufacturing pods and small-footprint continuous manufacturing equipment for installation in warehouses where they could quickly begin producing development, clinical and commercial product.</p><p>Pfizer's Portable, Continuous, Miniature and Modular, or PCM&M, model provides the flexibility needed to produce to demand rather than to forecast, O'Brien said.</p><p>Because it manufactures to forecast, Pfizer endures significant expiry consequences, he said. </p><p>"We burn probably $500m to $1bn a year of inventory. Why? Because we're trying to meet the demand, but we have to go to forecasts and when demand falls short of forecast, we're in trouble."</p><p>Pfizer could rapidly deploy pod farms around the world to develop, manufacture and distribute pharmaceuticals regionally, O'Brien suggested.</p><p>And those farms could include pods from multiple manufacturers, he suggested. "It's an industry journey, not a Pfizer journey by any stretch of the imagination."</p><p>The more companies that use them, the lower their cost will be, he noted.</p><p>For the oral solid dosage prototype facility, G-Con built the pods, GEA built the continuous manufacturing equipment and they assembled everything in a warehouse at Pfizer's Groton, Conn., site.</p><p>O'Brien showed the conference a five-minute video of the installation, which is now available on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/Xys-L9aMm6k" target="_new">https://youtu.be/Xys-L9aMm6k</a>.</p><p>He told attendees it cost $15m for the prototype, including detailed design, fabrication and assembly. With wider usage, the cost could drop toward that sweet spot where it would be affordable for manufacturers while still profitable for the vendors, he said.</p><p>Moving pods from one site to another is feasible, though the estimated expense of $300,000 to $500,000 "is not trivial," he said.</p><p>For sterile injectables, Pfizer could install pods that rely on disposables, or single-use systems, rather than stainless steel, for quicker, more flexible manufacturing, according to a slide O'Brien included in the deck but didn't present.</p><p>Amgen scientific executive director Duncan Low discussed some of the issues involved in replacing fixed stainless steel assets with more flexible, faster-turnaround, modular single-use systems for manufacturing of biologicals.</p><h2>The Need For Speed</h2><p>George Wiker, VP with M+W US Inc., the U.S.unit of M+W Group, a global high technology engineering and construction company, described some strategies for saving money and time by acquiring aging facilities for expansion projects rather than building in greenfield locations.</p><p>He gave examples where firms accelerated their schedules by repurposing a former biotech facility, a former cathode ray tube television assembly plant and an old warehouse.</p><p>His main point was to move quickly by scoring the sites on a scale of one to 10 based on preset defined criteria. And rather than performing detailed assessments of existing equipment like pumps and boilers, he said to just keep anything less than five years old and replace anything more than 10 years old.</p><p>The key is to focus rigorously on net present value, he said.</p><p>Wiker said he's a big believer in the type of modular approach that Pfizer prototyped. Manufacturers can build the pods while they're preparing the building.</p><p>By taking the brownfield approach he described rather than the typical green field strategy and relying on modules, manufacturers can reduce project time from the 24 to 28 months traditionally required to just nine to 14 months, he said.</p><h2>Old But Gold, Or Not</h2><p>Chris Smalley, a director with Merck Sharpe & Dohme, compared aging facilities to his restored Auburn, which could never perform like a modern car because, like all pre-World War II automobiles, it was built on a wooden frame.</p><p>"You may say that that is a keeper. And I'll use the analogy of maybe your facility is a keeper," he said. "I like the phrase old but gold. ... I like to use that term for a facility that's been properly maintained. &#8230; Many times you can make high quality production at a more reasonable cost because you're leveraging an existing facility by having maintained service to that facility properly."</p><p>Consultant Robert Dream, HDR Company Inc., compared assessing the severity of manufacturing facilities' quality risks to determining the health of people. Very low, medium, high and very high risks would correspond in his matrix to worry, actual illness, hospitalization and death. "Death," he observed, "yeah, that's very severe." </p><p>And the question of whether to remediate is similar for a manufacturing facility, particularly one that has not kept up with the technology and regulatory requirements over the years. "If a facility's dead, you need to do something else with that."</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in</i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-gold-sheet" target="_new">"The Gold Sheet"</a>.
