<p><p>Teva Pharmaceutical is continuing to see positive momentum with its top-selling brand, the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer), despite the launch of the first generic competitor in June. </p><p>During the company&rsquo;s second quarter sales and earnings call 30 July, Teva said it remains &ldquo;cautiously optimistic&rdquo; about the strength of the brand in the face of generic competition. </p><p>Novartis&rsquo; Sandoz unit launched Glatopa, a generic version of Teva&rsquo;s 20 mg once-daily Copaxone, on 18 June, hours after a US appeals court invalidated the patent covering the drug. Glatopa is priced at a 15% discount to Copaxone&rsquo;s wholesale acquisition cost, though drug companies typically negotiate pricing with payers. </p><p>Teva, meanwhile, has been quite successful with its effort to switch patients to a new 40 mg version of Copaxone that is dosed just three times a week. The 40 mg version currently accounts for about 68.5% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the US, the firm reported. </p><p>The strength of Copaxone is important to Teva because it&rsquo;s the company&rsquo;s top-selling brand drug. The franchise generated sales of $1.05bn in the second quarter, representing 12% growth. The bulk of the sales &ndash; $870m &ndash; were generated in the US, where sales grew 31% fueled by higher volumes and price increases. Sales of Copaxone made up 50% of the company&rsquo;s $2.09bn in specialty drug sales during the quarter. </p><p>The impact of a generic entrant has been an overhang for Teva, and is one of the motivations behind the company&rsquo;s $40bn acquisition of Allergan&rsquo;s generics business, announced 27 July. </p><p>The combined company will have $26bn in pro forma revenues, with a pipeline of 320 ANDAs pending at the FDA, 110 of which are first-to-file opportunities, according to Teva. </p><p>The merger will help Teva compete in an increasingly cost conscious drug market fueled by ongoing payer consolidation by delivering $1.4bn in cost synergies annually and incremental revenues, at a time when its own top line is expected to come under pressure, partly because of the generic. </p><p>But Teva said its Copaxone franchise is holding up well against the new competition. In fact, CEO-Global Specialty Medicines Rob Koremans said that since the launch of Glatopa, Teva has seen a slight increase in both Copaxone 20 mg and 40 mg prescriptions. Copaxone 40 mg is at an all-time high for the 18 months since its launch, he said, with close to 63,000 prescriptions in the US. </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early days what we&rsquo;ve seen from the generic entry but all the early indicators are making us cautiously optimistic,&rdquo; Mr Koremans said. </p><p>Health plans remain very supportive of the 40 mg version and there has been no change to access, he said, with 95% of patients having access to the product through their health plans. </p><p>The generic version has a 1.5% market share in the overall multiple sclerosis market and a 5% share of the glatiramer market, according to Teva. </p><p>The company is pushing forward with the development of other specialty medicines that could eventually make up for lost sales of Copaxone. One product investors are particularly excited about is the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist TEV-48125 for the treatment and prevention of migraine. Teva acquired the drug with the acquisition of Labrys Biologics last year for $200m upfront.</p><p>Teva released positive Phase IIb data showing the drug administered subcutaneously once monthly resulted in fewer migraines versus placebo in two studies, episodic migraine and chronic migraine, at the American Headache Society in June. </p><p>The company is planning to meet with the FDA to discuss the Phase III study design before initiating the program, President-Global R&D Michael Hayden said. </p><p>Teva is hopeful the FDA will grant the product a priority review, but Mr Hayden said it does not expect it will receive a &ldquo;breakthrough therapy&rdquo; designation because the Phase IIb trial did not include an active comparator, which the FDA would have preferred. </p><p>&ldquo;We believe that this whole field will revolutionize the field of migraine just like statins revolutionized the treatment of high cholesterol,&rdquo; Mr Hayden said. </p><p>Teva estimates the market could be a $10bn market if not larger, though there are multiple competitors racing to get there, including Amgen, Eli Lilly & Co, Alder Biopharmaceuticals and Allergan.</p><p><p><p>
