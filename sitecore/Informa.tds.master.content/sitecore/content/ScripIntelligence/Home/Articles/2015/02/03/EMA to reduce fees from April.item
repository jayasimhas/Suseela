<p> The European Medicines Agency is to reduce its fees from 1 April by 0.1%, in line with inflation. Although not a huge reduction, it comes at a time when the agency is experiencing staff shortages and when national agencies are requesting better remuneration for the work they do for the EMA. </p><p> The agency adjusts its fees every year in line with the European Union inflation rate from the previous year. The exact rate is not yet known, but the agency expects to make a downward adjustment of 0.1%. This will equate to a decrease in fees revenue of &euro;250,000, said the agency. Of that figure, &euro;100,000 would have been paid to National Competent Authorities. </p><p> The 2015 budget estimated that revenue from fees and charges would total &euro;250.6m, of which &euro;113.7m would go to the national authorities for evaluation activities, &euro;10.7m for reimbursement for attending meetings and &euro;1.9m for checking the translations of product information. The agency's main source of income comes from fees, and last year fees generated &euro;217.7m for the EMA. </p><p> As the agency takes on more fee-related activities and public health initiatives, its workload is increasing and finances are increasingly under pressure. In addition, national authorities want more money for their services. The agency's biggest concern is staffing shortages imposed by the European Commission. The commission has demanded that EU-level regulatory agencies (across all industries, including, for example, the European Food Safety Authority) cut their staff by 5-10% over five years. Discussions between the EMA and commission on the matter are ongoing. </p><p> The EMA's 2015 budget was increased by 7% to &euro;302m. The increase was largely down to an expected increase in applications and extra revenue generated by new pharmacovigilance fees paid by industry. Nevertheless, the bigger budget does not mean that the agency will be particularly flush. The extra fee income will be used to pay national regulators for their work at the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (PRAC) and to cover the agency's own pharmacovigilance-related costs, which have risen in tandem with the new activities it has to conduct under new legislation approved in 2014. Revenue from the annual fees will pay for activities such as literature monitoring and a PSUR repository (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EMA-2015-budget-up-applications-set-to-rise-355786" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 22 December 2014</a>). </p>
