<p><p>Closely-watched start-up Caribou Biosciences announced 02 April that it has brought in $11m in Series A round financing through a group of deep-pocketed investors, including European pharma giant Novartis. </p><p>The biotech is a developer of CRISPR-cas9 technology, a type of gene editing that has the oncology world abuzz. </p><p>Aside from Novartis, investors in the initial financing round include Fidelity Biosciences, Mission Bay Capital and 5 Prime Ventures, as well as an unnamed strategic partner. Co-founder Dr Jennifer Doudna also contributed to the fund. Dr Doudna has attracted attention for her work in CRISPR-cas9, earning her an international Breakthrough Prize. She is an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor at the University of California -Berkeley. </p><p>"What the money really allows us to do is build out the development and deployment of this genome-editing platform in a whole variety of different potential areas, including applied biomedical research, agricultural biotechnology, industrial fermentation and therapeutic development. The money allows us to accelerate our growth and the expansion and improvement of the platform technology," said Caribou Chief Scientific Officer Andy May in an interview. </p><p>Along with the Series A, Caribou recently announced a collaboration with the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research to use the technology platform to research CRISPR-based drug targets. </p><p>"We were founded by Jennifer Doudna and some of her colleagues who did some of the earliest pioneering work in the field," added May. "That's what has stood us apart from other companies. That will be an important part of who we are and how we proceed."</p><p>The CRISPR-cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology is an adaptable immune mechanism typically used by bacteria to splice and edit a gene. Novartis has spoken out as a proponent of the technology and has become known of late for being an early investor in new technological areas. </p><p>Many in the industry believe that CRISPR could be a major way to revolutionize medicine, by improving cell lines/transgenic animal models, boosting the quality of drug candidates and potentially reducing the size of clinical trials further down the line.</p><p>Novartis has said previously that in a short period of time the CRISPR technology has proven to be a powerful tool for creating very specific models of disease for use in drug discovery. Novartis believes the technology has great potential treating disease at the genetic level by deleting, repairing or replacing the genes that cause disease.</p><p>Caribous isn't the first CRISPR start-up Novartis has invested in &ndash; the big pharma <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-to-use-gene-editing-tool-with-CAR-T-therapies-355979" target="_new">inked a collaboration</a> and contributed an unspecified amount to the Series A round in November of Intellia Therapeutics. Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research will collaborate with Intellia with R&D activities focusing on using CRISPR ex vivo for engineering chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Intellia was co-founded by Caribou and uses the company's discovery technology platform to develop human therapeutics. </p><p><p>
