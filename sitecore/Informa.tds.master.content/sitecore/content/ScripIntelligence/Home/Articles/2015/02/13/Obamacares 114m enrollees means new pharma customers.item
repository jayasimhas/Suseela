<p>At the midnight 15 February deadline, about 11.4 million Americans had enrolled and selected plans through the federal and state marketplaces set up under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), with most of those, 8.6 million, coming in through the HealthCare.gov platform, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said.</p><p>Biopharmaceutical manufacturers stand to gain from the large enrollment numbers because it means patients will have coverage for their prescription drugs they otherwise may not have been able to afford. </p><p>The 11.4 million number could go higher because HHS is permitting those who were "stuck in line" while attempting to sign during the days leading up to the deadline to now have until 22 February to complete their 2015 enrollment, Secretary Burwell told reporters during an 18 February media briefing. </p><p>Some of those people ran into problems on 14 February when the HealthCare.gov website experienced a glitch, which was blamed on an overload of users all trying to sign up at the same time, although the issue was resolved within a few hours, HHS reported.</p><p>The agency noted there actually have been few problems this year with the HealthCare.gov website &ndash; unlike the first enrollment period for 2014 coverage, when the site experienced numerous disastrous crashes and other glitches (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shutdown-drama-exchange-trauma-Obama-said-thered-be-days-like-this-346988" target="_new">2 October 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Im-sorry-347959" target="_new">8 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-We-fumbled-but-game-not-over-348158" target="_new">15 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-Obamacare-woes-Leakers-hackers-political-attackers-348235" target="_new">20 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Website-fix-goal-met-but-salvaging-ACA-credibility-tougher-348439" target="_new">2 December 2013</a>).</p><p>But HHS was able to declare success after more than 8 million Americans selecting qualified health plans (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-ACA-hits-8m-time-to-forcefully-defend-351375" target="_new">18 April 2014</a>). </p><p>Ultimately, however, that 8 million for 2014 was whittled down to 7.1 million who actually paid for their insurance plans, HHS acknowledged. </p><p>Secretary Burwell also noted that up to 200,000 who enrolled in 2014 ACA marketplace plans could not continue in 2015 because they had not yet provided the necessary documentation of their citizenship or immigration status. </p><p>She said the 2015 number is likely to fluctuate, with additions and subtractions throughout the year, like in 2014.</p><p>Nonetheless, Secretary Burwell said the administration remained optimistic it would reach its projection of 9.1 million people signed up and paying their premiums.</p><p>Last fall, officials actually had projected as many as 9.9 million could sign up (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/HHS-projects-up-to-9.9-million-Obamacare-2015-enrollments-354961" target="_new">11 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Just in the first month, there were 6.4 million enrollments for 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obamacares-HealthCare.gov-enrolls-6.4m-in-1st-month-355851" target="_new">29 December 2014</a>).</p><p>But because some may be caught off guard by the tax penalty being imposed for the first time, the Obama administration is considering another "special" enrollment period.</p><p>The ACA required US taxpayers making at least $18,000 annually to maintain minimum essential insurance coverage for themselves and their dependents by 2014 or pay a penalty of 1% of their family income or $95 per family member, whichever is greater, with that figure rising to 2% of income or $325 per family member in 2015, topping out at 2.5% of income or $695 per family member in subsequent years.</p><p>The act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual's taxes, and shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as tax penalties.</p><p>During the 18 February briefing, Secretary Burwell would only acknowledge the idea of a special tax period extension was being discussed and the administration would make a determination in the next few weeks. </p><p>"We're going to analyze it and think about it," she told reporters. </p><p>The tax penalty was at the heart of the case that went before the Supreme Court in 2012, with the majority of the justices declaring that because the "Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness." The court upheld the ACA's individual mandate as constitutional (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Affordable-Care-Act-constitutional-under-Congress-taxing-powers-332248" target="_new">28 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Constitutionality-declared-Surgery-or-hammer-time-next-for-health-reform-332278" target="_new">29 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Post-SCOTUS-HHS-moves-forward-with-ACA-but-Republicans-push-back-332329" target="_new">2 July 2012</a>).</p><p>On 4 March, the Supreme Court will hear new arguments in <i>King v Burwell</i>, in which challengers are arguing Congress did not intend for the tax credit subsidies to be offered to all who qualify.</p><p>Secretary Burwell said 87% of those currently enrolled, or 6.5 million, qualify tax credit subsidies, which are intended to help pay the costs of the insurance premiums.</p><p>If the challengers prevail, drug makers could potentially lose many of the new customers they gained under the ACA plans.</p><p>The case comes down to four words in the ACA: "established by the state."</p><p>The challengers are arguing that four-word phrase expressly limits the subsidy eligibility to only those Americans who purchase insurance through online marketplaces operated by the states.</p><p>Only 14 marketplaces were set up by the states and the District of Columbia. The federal government set up about three dozen exchanges on behalf of the states under federal regulations.</p><p>But the Obama administration is insisting Congress meant for all Americans who qualify for the ACA subsidies to obtain them &ndash; no matter whether they buy their health insurance on a state-based exchange or a federally run marketplace.</p><p>"We believe the position we are holding is the right position," Secretary Burwell said. </p><p>The case will be the third time a major lawsuit involving the ACA will go before the Supreme Court.</p><p>Last June, the justices in a 5-4 vote declared in <i>Burwell v Hobby Lobby</i> the ACA&rsquo;s mandate for employers to cover all 20 forms of US-approved birth control impeded two closely held companies&rsquo; exercise of their religions (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hobby-Lobby-Narrow-ruling-or-new-can-of-worms-352590" target="_new">1 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-When-sincerity-trumps-science-Implications-for-FDA-352675" target="_new">7 July 2014</a>). </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
