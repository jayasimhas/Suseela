<p><p>AstraZeneca's Shaun Grady, head of strategic partnering and business development told an audience at the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) annual meeting in Philadelphia that he's in awe of the mega asset swap conducted by big pharma counterparts GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis due to the sheer "scale and scope."</p><p>The slurry of deals, announced last year, included the $5.25bn acquisition of Novartis' vaccines business by GSK and the divestment of GSK's oncology business to Novartis for $16bn, as well as the formation of a joint venture and the sale of Novartis' animal health business to Eli Lilly & Co for $5.4bn. </p><p>The major deal announcement prompted a slew of speculation that the days of mega-mergers &ndash; like Pfizer's attempt to acquire AstraZeneca &ndash; are over and the age of the asset swaps has begun as companies try to whittle down their areas of focus to just a few core therapeutic spaces. </p><p>"This is a huge change that is happening across the industry," said Grady. "We were all trying to do too much, and therefore, not necessarily doing things well. Being really focused and operating in an area where you can win allows you to invest much deeper and go much further."</p><p>This laser-like focus on a specific therapeutic area is incredibly beneficial to a small company, Jordi Sabe, corporate development director of Spain's Almirall, told the panel. Sabe noted that Almirall realized it couldn't be a competitor in the respiratory space and that's why it sold its assets to AstraZeneca in 2014 and shifted its focus to dermatology.</p><p>"You have to figure out what is best for the patients, what is best to payers, what is best for the company," he said. "You need to objectionalize and rationalize where you can really compete in a space."</p><p>Both Sabe and Grady agreed that convincing the board of directors that a divestment is necessary isn't always easy, but "at least in an asset swap, you get something back," said Grady. </p><p>Yet, AstraZeneca's Grady told conference attendees on 17 June that AstraZeneca tried to conduct a similar deal to the GSK/Novartis asset swap, but couldn't execute on such an alliance due to the complications that come with integrating a deal of that size. </p><p>"We have looked at actually swapping assets with other big pharma, but at the end of the day, it didn't work. The scale and sophistication in that case was absolutely a barrier," said Grady, who didn't reveal the other parties in the discussions. "Despite being incredibly successful companies, big pharmas are still under incredible P&L constraints. We are all looking at each other trying to figure out where these assets best fit."</p><p>The shifting mindset in the industry is visible by the kinds of meetings that companies are taking at conferences like BIO. The panel agreed that big pharmas' business development teams historically avoided each other in the conference environment and now have come to sit down at the table together.</p><p>Despite AstraZeneca's pointed rejections of Pfizer's $106bn offer, Grady noted during the panel discussion that he thinks we could see more mega-mergers this year. </p><p>"I don't think we can really rule big acquisitions out. I don't think anyone expected Pfizer to have talks with AstraZeneca, but we did. I don't think you can look at these asset swaps and think of them as the alternative to big acquisitions," he added. </p><p><p>
