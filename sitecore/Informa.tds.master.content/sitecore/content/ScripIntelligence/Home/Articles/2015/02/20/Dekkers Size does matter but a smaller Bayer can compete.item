<p>Bayer's divestment of its Material Science business and reorganization as a "pure" life sciences company was the main point of discussion at the German firm's full year financial results presentation. </p><p>Bayer CEO Dr Marijn Dekkers said the firm had still not made a final decision on how it would separate its Material Science unit to float on the stock market &ndash; the two options being either a spin-out business or through an IPO &ndash; but he said the company was on target to have the unit separated by mid-2016. Dr Dekkers said the next step for this process would be the "carve-out" of the unit, through legal and economical separation. </p><p>Once the Material Science section of Bayer is removed, the company will go from three main entities to two, cutting the size of Bayer as an overall business. Dr Dekkers said that while "size always matters", Material Science only represents 10% of Bayer's overall profits. He said the reorganization would make the company "more agile compared to competitors".</p><p>Despite the downsizing move, Bayer intends to push its way up the pharma league table over the next couple of years. "There is so much organic growth in our pharma unit," Dr Dekkers noted. "We'll be looking to get up a few notches in the pharma rankings."</p><p>When asked at the firm's press meeting on 26 February in Leverkusen if selling the Material Science unit was an option, Dr Dekkers did not rule it out. "Should a convincing enough offer be made we have a responsibility to consider it," he said, while continuing to refuse to comment on what is currently the more likely outcome for the future of the unit. "I would love to speculate along with you, but I'm not allowed," he joked. </p><p>Bayer's CEO did insist though that all plans were on track for the process and the reorganization of the company with its remaining two units: Healthcare and Crop Science. Spinning out the Crop Science business though is "not on the radar" at all he said, adding that the company is now "happy with the logic of its [just life science-focused] portfolio".</p><p>According to <i>Scrip's</i> annual number crunch, the <a href="http://codex.uk.corplan.net/kms/faces/frameset/publicationView.xhtml?id=-1&pubid=6a716aa4-bdb7-11e4-9ba0-1b58775dc434http://www.scrip100.com/scrip100.html" target="_new">Scrip100</a>, which ranks the top 100 global companies by their drug sales*, Bayer sits at number 17, under Pfizer (1), Novartis (2), Merck & Co (5), Amgen (12), Novo Nordisk (15) and Boehringer Ingelheim (16). </p><p>Bayer claims a lot of organic innovation but only spends a small percentage of its total company profits on research &ndash; in 2013, the firm spent 15.3% of its total profits on R&D. But Dr Dekkers addressed the issue during Bayer's presentation. He said the firm's R&D spending decisions"didn't hurt it last year." However, the company plans to increase its research budget by 10% in 2015 to more than &euro;4bn. Life Sciences (Healthcare and Crop Sciences) will see approximately &euro;3.8bn of that total. </p><p>"You cannot just look at a company's R&D spend and translate that into future success," Dr Dekkers said. "You also have to be good at R&D." He said Bayer's increase in R&D budgeting "demonstrates our confidence in our innovative capability and the future of our business model."</p><h2>German VC funding boost needed</h2><p>Bayer's chief also stressed that "a stable and favorable framework" was needed as well as innovation in order to achieve "lasting success." </p><p>Another factor Dr Dekkers highlighted was the need for financial backing of start-ups in Germany. He said Germany's venture capital environment was lacking when compared with other regions such as the US. Dr Dekkers said, "A country's innovative capability is critically dependent on the number of new start-ups&#8230;The market is underdeveloped in Germany." In the past three years only &euro;2bn has been invested in venture capital in Germany, compared to &euro;64bn in the US. Dr Dekkers said overall VC investment in Germany needs to be easier and more attractive in terms of taxation. </p><p><i>*Data taken from 2013 full year results for all companies</i></p>
