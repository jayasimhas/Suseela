<p>Signs of a shakeout in the Indian CRO segment are growing clearer, with a number of small and mid-sized units apparently having scaled down or put themselves on the block.</p><p>If a clutch of industry heads and investment bankers is to be believed, then fringe and smaller firms largely focused on bioavailability and bioequivalence (BA/BE) studies are already feeling the pinch. But there are signs that bigger players such as Fortis CRO have also scaled down significantly, setting the stage for potentially roping in a strategic partner or more. </p><p>''I'm not sure to what extent they [Fortis] are operational at all but the signs are not good. A couple of smaller CROs in southern India too are struggling,'' the head of an Indian CRO told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Another official with a leading CRO claimed that Fortis may have as good as wound up, but added that he was aware of at least five to six CROs that used to be operational some years ago that ''no longer exist''.</p><p>''Even large CROs have reduced manpower or have scaled down. It's a kind of cycle and even if foreign sponsors become active, and trial approval timelines improve drastically, I'm not sure if things can pick up in the short-term,'' the official told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>India's clinical research sector has seen a significant recent slow-down amid uncertainties and delays caused by still-evolving and controversial regulations and ongoing trial-related litigation.</p><p>Fortis CRO's top brass did not respond to repeated e-mails from <i>Scrip</i>, while a spokesperson for Fortis Healthcare offered no comment on the issue.</p><p>That Fortis CRO is no run-of-the-mill service provider is clear from the milestones listed on the firm's website &ndash; including that certain studies had been approved by the US FDA in 2010, 2011 and the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety in 2012, among others. The firm's services include early clinical drug development, Phase II-IV studies, data management and medical monitoring. It's not immediately clear if some parts of the firm's operations are, perhaps, still functional.</p><p>Among other names doing the rounds, investment banking sources cited a Mumbai-based CRO with units in Gujarat that claims to have a share of more than 10% in the BA/BE services segment, which is open to securing a strategic partner. ''There is surplus capacity and no buyers at least for now,'' an investment banker told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><h2>GVK Biosciences</h2><p>Then there is the GVK Biosciences effect. Top CRO officials say that while the current ''GVK-type'' of issues are clearly isolated ones, only an industry ''in good shape'' can weather the storm that generally follows such incidents.</p><p>The head of an Indian CRO said that the adverse observations of European regulators on GVK's conduct of BA/BE studies ''suspecting a misconduct'' and the subsequent action of suspending sale of many products had ''cast a shadow'' on the quality of BA/BE study conduct in India.</p><p>''Clients - Indian and Western- would be wary of quality of BA/BE studies from India. This would impact the business prospects of Indian BE CROs leading to measures to survive - cost containment, down-sizing, '' he told <i>Scrip</i>, but added that, in general, he wasn't aware of specific instances of a down-turn in the BA/BE CRO segment. </p><p>GVK Biosciences is currently in the eye of a storm after the French medicines agency ANSM uncovered data manipulation <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hundreds-of-generics-face-European-ban-following-GVK-breaches-356345%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 January 2015)</a>, though the Indian CRO has all along claimed the actions of the European agencies were overblown.</p><p>Industry sources also claimed that GVK has since pruned its bioavailability unit in Hyderabad, clearly with some implications on headcount. </p><p>Manni Kantipudi, CEO of GVK Bio, however, told <i>Scrip</i> there were no such employee turnover issues and that the firm's employees ''understand the issues well ''and had been kept updated on the ''events that have transpired''. </p><p>''On the industry, from our intelligence, the competition is doing well. Our Hyderabad unit is implicated, but we are focusing on rebuilding the business through our Ahmedabad unit which has no such issues,'' Mr Kantipudi said in an e-mail response. </p><p>The GVK boss said that while the firm respected the regulator&rsquo;s views, it was important to consider that the check-out ECGs had no bearing on the study outcome or the bio-equivalence of the drugs being tested (as stated by ANSM ) and that there was ''never any question'' about the safety or efficacy of the drugs (also stated by the EMA). </p><p>''The ANSM itself stated that the findings at the Hyderabad clinical facility should not be extrapolated, yet the EMA decided to extrapolate and went onto recommend suspension of over 700 marketing authorizations,'' Mr Kantipudi explained. </p><p>He underscored that the EU action was ''unprecedented and highly disproportional''. </p><p>GVK data concerns centre on apparent evidence of systematic manipulation of electrocardiogram records during the conduct of nine generic medicines studies over a period of at least five years. "Their systematic nature, the extended period of time during which they took place and the number of members of staff involved cast doubt on the integrity of the way trials were performed at the site generally and on the reliability of data generated at that site," the EMA earlier said. </p><h2>Long road</h2><p>Experts tracking the Indian clinical research segment, though, point to an arduous road ahead for recovery in the segment.</p><p>An expert with a foreign firm noted how the Indian CRO industry has been plagued by ''ill-luck'' for well over a year now and how despite its inherent strengths, multinationals do not favour India as a potential ground for conducting clinical trials. </p><p>''While we may say that the situation may yet swing around if the industry improves the quality standards of trials and the regulator posits favourably, the cruel fact of the matter is that in less than two years, the clinical research industry in India has gone from boom to bust,'' the expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The official also noted how the regulator or the health ministry had not been able to come up with ''some creative solutions'' that can ''assuage'' investor sentiment and ''soothe the nerves'' of the industry. </p><p>He referred to a proposal last year by India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to create an online portal for clinical trials by creating an IT-enabled ''real-time'' database of clinical trials. </p><p>''The obligation was on the industry to submit daily information. This proposal raises the cost required for compliance while doing precious little to address the uncertainty of safeguards, the lack of which created the whole controversy in the first place,'' he explained.</p><p>Others say that the biggest challenge is the significant delay and uncertainty surrounding Indian regulatory approval. ''This makes it extremely unpredictable to execute clinical trial programs for global houses which run multi-centric trials across the world. Combined with this, there are countries like Malaysia that offer incentives for conduct of clinical trial programs - another reason for India not being a preferred destination for clinical trials,'' Visalakshi C, partner, private equity, at Tata Capital Healthcare Fund, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>While there are signs that trial approval timelines in India have picked up and some of the slowdown may have been reversed, industry experts see this as more ''tactical'' and say unless laws governing the sector are more pragmatic, ''lasting change'' was unlikely. </p><p>KL Sharma, joint secretary at India's ministry of health and family welfare, had recently indicated that the government expects to set timelines for trial related approvals very soon <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-manufacturer-meeting-Regulator-sets-tough-tone-declines-friend-request-356077%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 12 January 2015)</a>.</p><p>The expert with the foreign firm suggested that easing up regulations with ''practical and grounded solutions'' that work to protect patient's lives while allowing CROs to attract additional business are paramount. </p><p>''The damage to the reputation of the Indian CRO has certainly been deep,'' he said.</p><p>India had recently notified a slew of much awaited modifications in its clinical trial compensation regulations including clarifications concerning injury or death due to an investigational product not having its intended therapeutic effect and on the requirement of free medical management for trial-related injury <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/India-notifies-tweaked-trial-compensation-rules-355884" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 December 2014)</a>. </p><p>India also expects to amend the Drugs And Cosmetics Act 1940 and upgrade and introduce provisions for trials and regulations of medical devices <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-set-for-wide-ranging-policy-review-in-2015-355926%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 5 January 2015)</a>. </p>
