<p>Blueprint Medicines has priced its heavily oversubscribed initial public offering (IPO) of just over 8 million shares at $18.00 per share, above the initial range of $15-$17. This led to gross proceeds of $147m and a market capitalization of $465m, "a pleasing result for a young biotechnology company not in the immune-oncology space and with two drugs about to enter the clinic," noted Thilo Schroeder, partner at Blueprint investor Nextech Invest and former member of its board.</p><p>The shares began trading on 30 April on the Nasdaq global market under the ticker 'BPMC'.</p><p>Blueprint was founded in 2011 by the three developers of pioneering cancer drug Gleevec (Novartis's imatinib) and Third Rock Ventures. Nextech, which held around 3.5% of Blueprint prior to the IPO, was lead investor of the series B financing in January 2014 together with Biotech Value Fund, Fidelity Bioscience, Casdin Capital and other undisclosed investors. In November 2014, Blueprint raised an additional $50m in a mezzanine series C financing that included Nextech and others. Nextech also invested in the IPO. Blueprint has raised $260m in financings since it was founded in 2011.</p><p>"We invested on the basis of a certain milestone plan, and we are looking forward to seeing that achieved and supporting the company further," Dr Schroeder explained.</p><p>"The company has made impressive progress since its inception in 2011, having built a differentiated translational discovery platform and pipeline of five kinase development programs. Each program targets genomically defined cancers, of which two programs will enter clinical development this year. Blueprint's genomic insight combined with the drug development expertise positions the company to bring the next wave of targeted therapies for patients in need," said Dr Schroeder.</p><p>Blueprint's two lead programs, which should enter the clinic later this year, are a KIT Exon 17 selective inhibitor for systemic mastocytosis and a FGFR4 selective inhibitor for hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes.</p><p>Blueprint has signed one formal collaboration, outside of the oncology space, with Alexion &ndash; a deal which was announced in March this year. The alliance is focused on an undisclosed kinase target which is the cause of a rare genetic disease. Blueprint will perform all research activities up to filing of an IND application. "The terms were very attractive," noted Dr Schroeder. Blueprint received an upfront payment of $15m plus research funding. In addition, Blueprint is eligible for more than $250m in milestones payments plus potential royalties.</p>
