<p>This year's Biopharma Congress conference in Washington had something for everyone &ndash; debates on the current drug pricing atmosphere, discussions about what's missing in the House-passed <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> that may be included in the Senate's version of the legislation and an update about the status of those pending FDA biosimilars guidances, which was essentially to confirm they're still pending. </p><p>But by far the high point of the conference, hosted by the analysis firm Prevision Policy and patient advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research, was when FDA's Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, described the thrill he got when seeing the lung cancer data for the first time from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab).</p><p>A few days before Christmas last year, Pazdur said he sat down at his desk at home late in the afternoon after receiving an email from Patricia Keegan, director of the FDA's Division of Oncology Products-2, telling him he could access the survival curve data for Opdivo in patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p>Pazdur said he put in his password, the file opened, "and I said, 'Holy [expletive]! This is great.'"</p><p>What it showed was a median overall survival of 9.2 months in the Opdivo patients, versus six months in the docetaxel group &ndash; the first time a PD-1 had demonstrated an overall survival in previously treated metastatic squamous NSCLC.</p><p>The FDA oncology chief said he immediately called Keegan and others at the agency and told them "We really need to get on this."</p><p>"You have to have that energy when you see something to motivate people and to say, 'Yeah, this is important, what are we going to do?'" Pazdur said.</p><p>When the FDA reached out to BMS, however, the firm actually told Pazdur it was considering waiting a couple of months until the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to report the Opdivo NSCLC data.</p><p>But Pazdur, shaking his head, said he told the company the agency was going to work to approve Opdivo in lung cancer before the May 29-June 2 ASCO meeting anyway. </p><p>And the FDA did &ndash; giving its blessing on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">March 4</a> to BMS to market Opdivo as a treatment for patients with advanced squamous NSCLC after prior therapy.</p><p>That decision came only days after BMS had revealed it won a priority review &ndash; actually winning the FDA's nod more than three months ahead of Opdivo's <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date in the NSCLC indication, which had Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum declaring it was the fastest approval he'd ever seen.</p><p>The drug previously was cleared for the market in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">melanoma</a>, which also came three months early, and has since gained <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-OKd-1st-U.S.-Immuno-Oncology-Combo-360779" target="_new">broader use</a> in that disease and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obviously-FDA-Loves-Opdivo-Another-Quick-Nod-360905" target="_new">lung cancer</a> &ndash; demonstrating further Pazdur's love affair with Opdivo, which competes with Merck & Co.'s PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Mercks-Keytruda-A-Remarkable-Science-To-Success-Story-360381" target="_new">Keytruda</a> (pembrolizumab).</p><p><b>It's Academic</b></p><p>But Pazdur acknowledged not everyone at the FDA is as enthusiastic as he is &ndash; bluntly pointing out there are those who like to just "sit in their office" and check things off the lists and "not interact with anyone else."</p><p>"You have to have people in the divisions who want to do this," he said.</p><p>Pazdur said he likes to recruit scientists for his oncology staff from academic medicine &ndash; noting that when he came to the FDA 16 years ago, he recognized it needed to "change from a regulatory agency to a more academic platform."</p><p>Working at the FDA, he argued, "is as interesting as academic medicine."</p><p>"We do more academic work here than most academic places," Pazdur declared, adding he wasn't talking about "grants or publishing papers up the wazoo." </p><p>"I'm talking about sitting down and really analyzing a problem" together with statisticians, clinical pharmacologists, toxicologists and drug safety officers, weighing the pros and cons of a drug, he said.</p><p>Pazdur said one thing that has helped change the culture at the FDA's oncology divisions is the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">breakthrough</a> therapy designation &ndash; a status <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> intended to expedite the R&D and regulatory processes.</p><p>Firms whose products win the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Breakthrough-fees-FDA-urges-self-control-on-requests-358065" target="_new">breakthrough</a> status have more opportunities to engage with the FDA, he noted.</p><p>"It isn't that the oncology divisions were not interacting with the sponsors, but it really kind of highlighted the urgency to have that iterative discussion, not just waiting for these end-of-Phase II meetings, end of this meeting, end of that meeting," Pazdur said.</p><p>The breakthrough status, he said, is "really getting the staff more involved" with drug makers &ndash; something he said he's been pushing his reviewers to make more of an effort to do.</p><p>"I keep telling the review staff, 'If you have a question, just call up the damn company,'" Pazdur said. "I have no compunction about picking up the phone and calling somebody rather than waiting for some meeting and discussing this and what should we do about this," he said.</p><p>Pazdur said that while FDA should not be considered a partner of drug companies &ndash; because, after all, "we are a regulatory agency" &ndash; regulators are "somebody who could facilitate a potentially very important drug to patients."</p><p>"I want the pharmaceutical companies to know what we're looking for for approval endpoints, what we would be flexible on," he said.</p><p>For instance, Pazdur said, "if our traditional stance had been to accept overall survival on a disease, if you have a huge effect on response rates, well, that might be good enough for us." </p><p>"So let's start talking about this," he declared.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
