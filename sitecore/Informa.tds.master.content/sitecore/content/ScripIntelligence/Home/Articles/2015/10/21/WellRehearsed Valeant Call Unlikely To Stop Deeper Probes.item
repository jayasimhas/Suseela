<p>After days of providing few answers to a lot of unanswered questions, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. finally explained itself on Oct. 26 in a well-rehearsed morning conference call, which had Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat gushing about how well the firm had handled itself after being slow out of the gate.</p><p>"They really did a good job clarifying," Raffat declared.</p><p>But not all was clear, and likely, prosecutors and Washington lawmakers &ndash; who already are engaged in probing Valeant for its pricing practices &ndash; and state regulators and others trying to unravel the knotty tale of the company's relationships with specialty pharmacies will not be completely satisfied by the drug firm's explanations, despite what Raffat called "very well written" slides.</p><p>Indeed, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">first raised concerns in July</a> about Valeant's sharp spike in the prices of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) and Isuprel (isoprenaline), shot off another letter to the company following its Oct. 26 conference call &ndash; declaring the firm's response to the lawmaker earlier this month was inadequate.</p><p>"The only thing that this morning's investor call made clear is that Valeant's questionable business practices extend well <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-Else-Dont-We-Know-May-Spread-Beyond-Valeant-361194" target="_new">beyond price gouging</a>," McCaskill asserted. </p><p>Valeant's troubles last week started when the company divulged for the first time during its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">Oct. 19 quarterly earnings call</a> that it not only had been using a specialty pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, but had even purchased an option late last year to acquire the firm, paying $100m, plus up to $133m in milestones, of which it already had paid $33m &ndash; with those amounts not revealed until the Oct. 26 call.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">Fraud accusations</a> were made last week by short-selling firm Citron Research. Then more revelations came to light. And things began to get really messy as details from court and other documents were uncovered, with Valeant being slow to respond. </p><p>After the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Demystifying-Valeant-And-Philidor-361239" target="_new">latest call</a>, analysts advised Valeant to cut its ties with Philidor and be done with it.</p><p>But even then, they noted there's still likely going to be more fallout, although Morningstar Equity Research analyst Michael Waterhouse said he thought Valeant may still be able to manage any fines, fees or lawsuits.</p><p>Nonetheless, Waterhouse and other analysts said Valeant's relationships with Philidor, which accounts for about 5.9% of the drug company's net revenue year to date, and the other specialty pharmacies remains unclear and questions likely will persist.</p><p><b>Ad Hoc Panel Probe</b></p><p>Valeant CEO Michael Pearson insisted during the Oct. 26 call the company complies with US laws and accounting and disclosure rules &ndash; declaring that if he finds any violations he would not hesitate to take action.</p><p>Valeant's board plans to establish an ad hoc committee to review the various allegations related to the specialty pharmacies. But there are no plans currently for an independent audit.</p><p>McCaskill criticized Valeant for only including board members on the panel, which she said "makes it hard for me to believe that their inquiry will be independent or unbiased."</p><p>One of the first issues the ad hoc panel will address, Pearson said, will be examining why Valeant employees who were at Philidor used phony names in their email addresses &ndash; reportedly borrowing names like "Peter Parker," aka "Spider-Man," or the Beach Boys' "Brian Wilson," as reported by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.</p><p>That report sent already panicked investors again running from Valeant, with shares dropping 8.7% on Oct. 26, or $10.13, before closing at $110.04, down $6.12,or about 5.3%.</p><p>Robert Chai-Onn, Valeant's general counsel, said it's "really not clear" whether the email issue violated the company's indemnification agreement with Philidor.</p><p>"We first, obviously, have to make that assessment to determine whether we have indemnity coverage on that," Chai-Onn said. "We generally have indemnity coverage for compliance with laws. So, it really depends on the fact that whether there's actual issue with emails at all."</p><p>"Philidor is a separate limited liability entity, and we believe we do not have any legal liability for Philidor," said corporate director Howard Schiller, who left his position as chief financial officer at the company in June but remained on the board.</p><p>Pearson insisted the situation with the fake email identities was "not a legal issue," but one of compliance. </p><p>Valeant would not discuss the emails further.</p><p><b>Lawsuits And More Questions</b></p><p>Other questions that were raised revolved around Philidor's creation of a holding company named Isolani LLC, whose existence came to light in Los Angeles Superior Court documents, which described a lawsuit between the firm and another specialty pharmacy, Camarillo, Calif.-based R&O Pharmacy. </p><p>Chai-Onn said Philidor has an option to acquire Isolani, which has not yet been exercised.</p><p>But the creation of Isolani looked somewhat shady to some observers, who asserted it was established so that Philidor could fill prescriptions for Valeant in California, where the specialty pharmacy was denied a permit last year. </p><p>Valeant had disclosed on Oct. 19 that it was involved in a legal dispute with R&O, which is part of the pharmaceutical firm's network &ndash; news that had been reported earlier that day by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, which said it does investigative reporting.</p><p>But Evercore ISI's Raffat pointed out the lawsuit between Isolani and R&O had not been acknowledged by Valeant on the Oct. 19 call.</p><p>According to Isolani's complaint, it entered into a deal under which it paid $350,000 to R&O's pharmacist-in-charge Russell Reitz for a 10% equity stake in the specialty pharmacy, with an option to purchase the remaining 90% later. </p><p>Currently, Isolani has a management services agreement (MSA) with R&O, Chai-Onn explained. </p><p>"Isolani is R&O's agent and provides management and administrative services to R&O," he said.</p><p>Under the MSA, R&O compensates Isolani with all profits and losses realized by R&O. </p><p>The MSA was supposed to terminate when Isolani acquired the remaining 90% of R&O.</p><p>Chai-Onn said Isolani, on behalf of R&O, submitted product orders through Philidor to Valeant. </p><p>But in August, Valeant learned R&O had stopped making regular payments, so the drug firm ceased shipping products to R&O, he said, noting that by that time, the value of intercompany payable was $69m measured at wholesale acquisition cost.</p><p>After discussing the matter with Philidor, Valeant learned that R&O had refused to deposit patient and third-party payer checks into the appropriate operating account as required by the MSA, Chai-Onn said.</p><p>He said R&O had received about $19.3m in payments based on its entries into the prescription processing system used by all members of the Philidor network.</p><p>"With R&O wrongfully keeping funds, we decided to take action," Chai-Onn said, noting Valeant sent a letter to the specialty pharmacy on Sept. 4 demanding payment.</p><p>On Oct. 6, R&O preemptively sued Valeant, seeking a declaration that it does not owe any money to the drug company.</p><p>"We believe that R&O's lawsuit is without merit," Chai-Onn said, adding that the company will soon file its own counterclaim.</p><p>Meanwhile, Isolani filed a suit on Sept. 8, claiming R&O and Reitz were wrongfully holding money.</p><p>Schiller insisted the Isolani structure was not intended to avoid continued review issues in California.</p><p>"Valeant has consulted with experienced and knowledgeable regulatory counsel and we believe that the Isolani structure meets California's legal requirements," he said.</p><p>Schiller also defended Philidor's practice of auto-refilling prescriptions &ndash; arguing it does not occur for all patients and that for those who are eligible, they can opt out "at anytime."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
