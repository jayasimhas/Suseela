<p>A confirmed case of the rare, serious brain condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a multiple sclerosis patient treated with Novartis's Gilenya (fingolimod) without prior treatment with Biogen's Tysabri (natalizumab) is to be considered by the European Medicine Agency's CHMP meeting this week. </p><p>According to the website of the French medicines agency ANSM, the case was identified in a German patient during a routine MRI scan undertaken during a clinical study. The patient had been treated with Gilenya for four years and had not had prior treatment with Tysabri or any other immunosuppressive product. The patient had shown no symptoms of PML. Treatment with Gilenya was immediately stopped. </p><p>The ANSM said it was considering whether to issue recommendations on the risk of PML during treatment with Gilenya. It said the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee had recommended that health professionals be informed of this case.</p><p>This is not the first reported case of PML with Gilenya, but it is the first in a confirmed MS patient that is not potentially linked to prior therapy with another immunosuppressive drug. The underlying disease of an earlier case reported in 2013 was an aggressive form of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO) and not MS, according to Novartis. The patient, whose illness was "complicated and atypical", was also being treated with various medications that could have had an immunosuppressive effect. There was additionally a question over the timing of the onset of PML. Nonetheless, that earlier case prompted the launch of an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-reveals-new-Gilenya-PML-probe-Novartis-says-link-unlikely-346119" target="_new">investigation by the US FDA</a> in August 2013. "The FDA investigation of this case did not lead to a conclusion or a request for a label update," Novartis told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The company said at the time that for various reasons the case was "unlikely to be attributable to Gilenya". It has made no such claims this time, but told <i>Scrip</i>: "Our current knowledge of the mechanism of action of fingolimod does not explain a causal relationship to the development of PML." It said the unusual lesions in the MRI scan led to an examination of the 49-year-old patient's cerebrospinal fluid, which confirmed the diagnosis of PML. The patient had previously received Rebif (interferon beta-1a), which is not an immunosuppressive.</p><p>In November last year, the CHMP (the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EU-tables-cautionary-measures-for-Tecfidera-and-CorlentorProcoralan-355240" target="_new">recommended that healthcare professionals be alerted to the risks of the PML with Biogen's newest MS treatment</a>, the oral drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), following the first reported case in a patient taking the medicine, which proved fatal. Analysts thought however that the development would do little to dent the product's sales prospects.</p><p>"The MS community is especially sensitive to cases of PML, given prior experience with Tysabri," commented Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Daniel Chancellor. "Thankfully, these Gilenya incidences appear anecdotal and not representative of a wider safety signal with the drug. While it is important to report these serious side effects, Gilenya's safety is now well established and I don't see this latest case having any bearing on the drug's commercial future. By comparison, there have been over 500 cases of Tysabri-associated PML, among approximately 140,000 treated patients." In September 2014 Novartis reported that there had been 11 Tysabri-associated PML cases in MS patients from the fingolimod safety database. In addition, there was the one reported PML case in the NMO patient and now this one. </p><p>Novartis said 114,000 patients had been treated with Gilenya, which saw sales rise by 28% to $2.5bn in 2014. BioMedTracker analysts predict global sales will peak at $3.2bn in 2017.</p><p>Health authorities including the FDA are reviewing the information about the recent case, which came to Novartis's attention in January. It reported the case to worldwide health authorities on 16 February. </p><p>PML is a rare, progressive neurological disease which is caused by the JC (John Cunningham) virus. As well as Tysabri and Tecfidera, it has been linked to Roche/Genentech/Biogen/Chugai's Rituxan/MabThera (rituximab), Roche/Genentech/Merck Serono's now suspended psoriasis treatment Raptiva (efalizumab) and Seattle Genetics' lymphoma treatment Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin). When it occurs, it is usually in patients whose immune systems have been severely weakened and often results in an irreversible decline in neurological function and death.</p><p>
