<p> Germany's health technology assessment body the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) has concluded Novo Nordisk's new antidiabetic <i>Xultophy</i> (insulin degludec plus liraglutide) and H. Lundbeck's antidepressant <i>Brintellix</i> (vortioxetine) bring no additional benefits to clinical practice, raising concerns yet again about how it evaluates new medicines. </p> <p> &quot;The conclusion that Brintellix brings no additional benefit is difficult to understand,&quot; Lundbeck commented. &quot;IQWiG doesn't seem to have taken into account all the clinical evidence, and we will be bringing this up in discussions with the German HTA body,&quot; the company said. </p> <p> Novo Nordisk would not comment on IQWiG's evaluation of Xultophy, citing the release of its second-quarter finals results Aug. 6, but its views on HTA and pricing processes in Germany are well known. On July 1 it announced it would cease distribution of one of the constituents of Xultophy, its new basal insulin Tresiba (insulin degludec) in Germany because it could not negotiate a high enough price with the GKV-Spitzenverband, the German national association of statutory health insurance funds. </p> <p> The GKV wanted to set the price of Tresiba to be the same as cheaper human insulin products that have been marketed in Germany since the 1980s, an idea rejected by Novo Nordisk. 40,000 patients being treated with Tresiba are to be switched to other products, with Novo Nordisk continuing supplies until the end of September 2015. Xultophy was launched in a number of European markets earlier this year. </p> <p> IQWiG's evaluation of the two products were released Aug. 3, and will now be considered by the Federal Joint Committee, the G-BA, Germany's top decision making authority, with the companies having the opportunity to challenge the institute's conclusions at a hearing. The G-BA's decision on Xultophy is expected in October. </p> <h2> No Suitable Studies </h2> <p> In its evaluation, IQWiG said Novo Nordisk did not submit suitable clinical studies for evaluation &ndash; the studies used insulin degludec as a comparator instead of human insulin, and the majority of patients had previously only received metformin monotherapy, not multiple oral antidiabetics (OADs). </p> <p> With vortioxetine, the dossier submitted by the company could not be used in the IQWiG evaluation because there were no direct comparisons with other antidepressants, only with placebo. In patients with severe symptoms, citalopram was used as the comparator rather than the use of a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) with an offer of psychotherapy. </p> <p> Lundbeck pointed out that a lot of patients have a suboptimal responses to SSRIs and could benefit from the multimodal mechanism of action of vortioxetine. More than 10,000 patients have already been treated with vortioxetine in Germany, suggesting there is demand for such a product, it added. </p> <p> Vortioxetine was approved in the US in the second half of 2013 where it was marketed in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., and cleared by the European Commission in December 2013. Lundbeck was expecting positive pricing decisions in Europe for vortioxetine in the second quarter of this year. </p> <p> Germany's IQWiG is not the first European HTA body to give a preliminary thumbs down to vortioxetine. The UK's National Institute for health and Care Excellence concluded in draft guidance released at the beginning of June that it needed further clarification and analyses from the company before it would recommend the product's use in the UK's national health service. </p>
