<p><p>Now that Mylan shareholders have voted in favor of the Perrigo acquisition, the next step is for Mylan to conduct a tender offer to Perrigo shareholders, but don't expect this to be a smooth ride. </p><p>As expected, Mylan held a meeting of its shareholders on Aug. 28 where more than two thirds of the votes cast were in favor of the transaction. While Mylan is painting this as an overwhelming show of support, analysts disagree, noting that the vote shows the mixed feelings about this transaction by shareholders. Mylan did not reveal the exact of outstanding shares that were included in the vote. </p><p>Perrigo responded immediately, keeping in line with its previous message that the Mylan offer undervalues the company and would not be in the best interest of Perrigo shareholders. </p><p>Under Irish takeover rules, Mylan is now required to issue a tender offer for all outstanding share of Perrigo stock by Sept. 14. Mylan has stated previously that it need at least 50% of Perrigo share to take over the company, but would ideally like greater than 80% of shares for things to move along quickly. </p><p>"Investors, rating agencies, and leading proxy advisory services have noted that the lowered threshold would make any synergy targets more difficult to achieve, raise integration and execution risk and add additional downward pressure on Mylan's credit rating," said Perrigo CEO Joe Papa in an Aug. 28 statement. Papa insists that there is a low likelihood of Mylan achieving the 50% threshold it needs to begin the takeover process. </p><p>While the Mylan vote was expected to go through, what happens next is anyone's guess. The tender offer is unlikely to be an easy process for either company. </p><p>Worst case scenario: more than 50% but less than 80% of Perrigo shareholders tender their shares. In this instance, Mylan will have an uphill battle in trying to complete the acquisition and then would have to unseat the company's current board of directors before issuing another tender offer to acquire the remaining shares. The acquiring company could end up as Perrigo's largest shareholder for an extended period of time, but with no access to the company's cash or the synergies that Mylan has promised the acquisition would create. </p><p>If less than 50% of Perrigo share are tendered, Mylan is not allowed to make another offer to Perrigo under Irish takeover laws for at least another year, and would likely mean this transaction will never be completed.</p><p>If more than 80% of Perrigo shareholders tender &ndash; the unlikeliest scenario, Mylan will be able to close the acquisition quickly by acquiring the remainder of outstanding shares. </p><p>"In spite of the positive vote, we still believe the barriers to consummation of the deal are high as PRGO has already rejected a $205 per share bid and based on the recent pull back in MYL's stock price, the last offer now implies a lower (~$195 per share) takeout price for PRGO," wrote Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry in an Aug. 28 note. Gerberry sees plenty of obstacles to Mylan taking over Perrigo and has some concerns about whether Mylan will achieve its synergy target of $800m. </p><p>Expect to see Perrigo exploring all of its options before the Sept. 14 offer takes place, including any M&A the company can fit in. </p><p><p>
