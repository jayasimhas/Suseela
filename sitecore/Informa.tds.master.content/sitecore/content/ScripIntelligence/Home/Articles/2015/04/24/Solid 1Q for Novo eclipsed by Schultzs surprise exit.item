<p>Novo Nordisk has raised its full year guidance for 2015 on the back of a strong first quarter performance and the successful IPO spin-out of its IT unit. </p><p>For 2015, sales growth measured in local currencies is now expected to be 7&ndash;9% (raised from previous expectations of 6-9%), whereas operating profit growth measured in local currencies is expected to be around 17% (up from a previously anticipated 10%).</p><p>However, positive earnings results, which saw 1Q sales and EPS beat consensus by 1% and 8% respectively, have been somewhat over shadowed by the news of a management shakeup at the company. </p><p>Novo Nordisk's chief operating officer Kåre Schultza, a 26-year veteran at the company who had been expected to become the next CEO, has left the company. Current chief executive Lars Rebien Sørensen had been anticipated to step down from his position well before the end of his contract in 2019 and Mr Schultz was slated as the next head of the company &ndash; with some suggesting he would take the helm as early as 2016. </p><p>But Novo's board has reportedly decided it wants to keep current head Mr Sørensen in his position until near the end of his contract. The company has also effectively made Mr Schultz's job redundant by making changes to its management structure. The board has decided to "elevate the leaders of the commercial activities in the US, Europe and international operations and of product supply to executive management."</p><p>"This change will enhance the board's visibility of Novo Nordisk's international business operations and support the further development of key leadership talents," the company said in its 1Q 2015 earnings report. </p><p>As a result of these changes, Novo is launching a new "operations committee" to coordinate commercial and production priorities. It will be chaired by Mr Sørensen, with executive vice-president Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen as vice-chair. </p><p>Commenting on Mr Schultz's decision to leave the company following these changes, Mr Sørensen said, "Kåre Schultz has during his 26 years with us played a key role in making Novo Nordisk a successful global company. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors."</p><h2>1Q numbers</h2><p>In the first quarter of 2015, group sales of DKK25.20bn beat consensus of DKK25.00bn by 1% and EPS of DKK3.79 beat consensus of DKK3.52 by 8%.</p><p>Diabetes Care saw sales of DKK19.82bn, which slightly missed estimates for the quarter of DKK19.87bn but Biopharmaceuticals saw sales of DKK5.38bn beating consensus (DKK5.13bn). </p><p>The sales beat was helped by better-than-expected sales for Victoza (liraglutide) &ndash; which increased 18% in local currencies &ndash; the human insulins, Novo's hemophilia franchise, and Norditropin. </p><p>Sales of Victoza reached DKK3.96bn in the first quarter of 2015, versus DKK2.91bn in the same period a year prior. </p><p>As a result of the initial public offering Novo completed in March this year for NNIT on Nasdaq Copenhagen, the company has recorded a non-recurring income of DKK 2.4bn as "other operating income" in the first quarter. </p><h2>Victoza lawsuits</h2><p>Novo highlighted in its 1Q earnings that it did not anticipate any financial effects in 2015 from a number of lawsuits in the US related to lead product Victoza. </p><p>"As of 27 April 2015, Novo Nordisk, along with the majority of incretin-based product manufacturers in the US, is a defendant in product liability lawsuits related to use of incretin-based medications," the company said. </p><p>Novo added that currently it "does not have any trials scheduled in 2015&#8230; [and] does not expect the pending claims to have a material impact on its financial position, operating profit and cash flow."</p><p>To date, 154 plaintiffs have named Novo Nordisk in product liability lawsuits, predominantly claiming damages for pancreatic cancer that allegedly developed as a result of using Victoza and other GLP-1/DPP-IV products. 103 of the Novo Nordisk plaintiffs have also named other defendants in their lawsuits.</p><p>Victoza is approved in the US as a treatment for type 2 diabetes and for obesity. It is currently in Phase III for type 1 diabetes. </p><p>
