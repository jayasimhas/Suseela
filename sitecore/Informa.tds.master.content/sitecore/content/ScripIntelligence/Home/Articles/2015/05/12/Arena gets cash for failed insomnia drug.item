<p><p>While Arena Pharmaceuticals continues to concentrate on its floundering obesity drug Belviq, the company managed to monetize an old asset to bring in a little cash. </p><p>The biotech announced 12 May that it has offloaded its once-dead 5-HTA2 agonist nelotanserin to Roivant Sciences. </p><p>Roivant will have exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin, while Arena will manufacture clinical supply and commercial product. Arena will get paid $4m upfront for the previously failed asset and be eligible for $41.5m in regulatory and development milestones, as well as 15% of sales and a one-time $60m purchase price adjustment based on sales. </p><p>Roivant will develop the drug in patients with behavioral and neuropsychiatric disturbances, but did not disclose the specific indications. Yet, the company mentioned the usefulness of the target in patients with dementia and other neurological diseases. </p><p>Nelotanserin has already been tested in more than 900 patients. Arena tested the drug for safety and tolerability in a Phase I study, as well as in insomnia patients in a Phase II trial. The drug was shelved in 2008 when Arena was struggling to pay for the development of Belviq and nelotanserin failed to meet its primary or secondary endpoints in a mid-stage insomnia trial. </p><p>Belviq (lorcaserin) has been struggling since it entered the market. The drug has a less favorable efficacy profile than competitors and has struggled to gain traction amongst reimbursement pitfalls. The company's marketing partner Eisai has consistently changed the number of sales reps in the field as Belviq continues to flounder &ndash; the drug only had about $40m in sales last year. </p><p><p>
