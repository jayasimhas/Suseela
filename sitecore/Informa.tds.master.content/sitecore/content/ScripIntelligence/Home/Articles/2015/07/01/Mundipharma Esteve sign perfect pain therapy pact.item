<p>Mundipharma Laboratories, in partnership with Purdue Pharmaceuticals, has signed a collaborative deal with Laboratorios Esteve to develop next-generation pain management products &ndash; with Esteve aiming to collect a potential $1bn+ in milestone payments. </p><p>The partnership will see Mundipharma and Purdue expand their pain franchise into neuropathic, acute and moderate pain in addition to existing expertise in opioids and severe pain. Managing director of Mundipharma Anthony Mattessich told <i>Scrip</i> the deal was a "perfect fit" for all involved. </p><p>"We have moved away from the idea of doing our own discovery in pain and realized it's better left to others," Mr Mattessich said. "This is a perfect situation where we have found a company which is what we believe to be the best at pain discovery in the industry and a perfect match from a cultural stand point. They're good at new chemical entities and we're good at commercializing assets."</p><p>Mundipharma hasn't conducted a collaboration on this scale before in the area of pain therapeutics and under the agreements Mundipharma and Purdue could potentially make payments to Esteve exceeding $1bn if all development, regulatory and sales milestones are met across the different programs. However, Mr Mattessich noted that "given how open the collaboration is the billion is really looking at the products we can see now. The key strength that Esteve brings is in the discovery of new chemical entities, that's where you look at the potential collaboration further out and what could become of it."</p><h2>Programs included in the deal</h2><p>The deal will focus on the field of sigma-1 receptor biology and a Phase III ready co-crystal compound. </p><p>The companies will first be developing Esteve's E-52862, a first-in-class new chemical entity targeting the sigma-1 receptor pathway, currently in Phase II trials covering multiple neuropathic pain indications. Mr Mattessich said dose-ranging Phase II trials are being conducted for this product and key data readouts are anticipated this year. However, he said these data are needed before a full development pathway for E-52862 can be determined. </p><p>It terms of competition in this area Mr Mattessich said, "We're pretty much alone and this is by far the most advanced platform of the sigma-1. There are a lot of different companies involved and certainly the sigma-1 has been around for a long time but never as a target in and of its self."</p><p>The companies will also be developing E-58425, a novel first-in-class co-crystal of tramadol and celecoxib. In a Phase II study, comparing the compound against placebo and tramadol, E-58425 demonstrated a strong improvement in efficacy and significantly improved the risk-benefit ratio compared to that expected for the individual components. It will now be taken into Phase III by Mundipharma, although the pharma company will not have commercialization rights to this product in the US, where it will be marketed by Esteve. </p><p>Finally, the collaboration includes access Esteve's Multi-Modal (MuMo) technology platform which has a number of assets in the preclinical stage using the sigma-1 receptor mechanism. "The sigma-1 concept is primarily about neuropathic pain but there are a number of areas of applicability that sigma might have which we are very curious to explore," Mr Mattessich said. </p><h2>No merger plans</h2><p>2014 was notable for its M&A action and the pattern looks set to continue in the New Year, but Mundipharma and Esteve have no plans to merge their businesses. "It was really a matter of going after something that we thought is the most exciting area in pain and then finding the company that is the most advanced and then working an agreement with them," Mr Mattessich said. "These are two very successful and well-funded privately held companies and the families that run both of them have refused to consider selling: they are very close to the business and very concerned about how to manage these business for the next generations. There was never a discussion of a merger or acquisition," he said. </p><p>
