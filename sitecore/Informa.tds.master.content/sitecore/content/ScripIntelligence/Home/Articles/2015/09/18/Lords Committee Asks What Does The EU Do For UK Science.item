<p>What would happen to UK science, research and innovation if the country were to leave the EU? </p><p>That's not exactly the question being posed by the latest inquiry launched by the House of Lords' select committee on science and technology, but it is certainly the reason for launching it. And it's a discussion that research-based biopharmaceutical companies will certainly want to be a part of.</p><p>Few can be unaware that the UK is to hold a referendum on its membership of the EU before the end of 2017, and that any decision to leave will have far-reaching consequences for people in every walk of life.</p><p>Where the UK research base is concerned, EU membership has "a wide-ranging influence on the vitality of UK science, research and innovation," although understanding this influence is "complex and multifaceted," according to the committee.</p><p>While it is careful not to mention the referendum, the committee is clearly concerned to elucidate the possible impact a "Brexit" might have, not only on researchers but on investment in UK science, both public and private. </p><p>The inquiry, it says, is intended to understand and characterize the interactions between the EU and the science and research base with regard to four major themes: funding, collaboration, regulation and scientific advice. </p><p>Lord Selbourne, the committee's chair, says the aim is to explore the status of "UK Science" as it operates within the EU, and to conduct a "rigorous, evidence-based 'stocktake' of the key ways our EU membership affects science, research and innovation in the UK."</p><p>The committee notes, for example, the "myriad" EU-level funding mechanisms available to UK researchers, some of which &ndash; such as European Research Council funding, Horizon 2020 programs, Joint Programming Initiatives (JPIs) and European Innovation Partnerships &ndash; are highly intricate. </p><p>"As well as public funding, private investment in UK research and development from international (both EU and non-EU) and UK-domiciled businesses is also increasingly recognised as crucial to the performance of the science base as a means to maintain competitiveness and productivity," the committee says. "The UK's EU membership may serve to make the UK a more or less attractive location for investment. As such, membership may influence access to public, private and charitable funding."</p><p>Although the committee does not specifically mention it, the EU's public/private Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is jointly funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the European Commission, is seen by both academics and industry as a key driver of research into new innovative drugs.</p><p>As for collaboration, the committee notes that science is, "by its very nature, a collaborative endeavor" and key breakthroughs are often the result of links between researchers across the world. As part of EU partnerships and other international relationships, UK researchers have access to both funding and shared infrastructure, allowing the sharing of costs and expertise and facilitating larger-scale investments. "Within the EU, freedom of movement allows researchers to work in universities, research institutes and industry with relative ease," the committee observes.</p><p>Moreover, much of the science carried out in the UK is regulated by EU frameworks, notably clinical trials and research into genetically modified organisms (GMOs). "Innovation in the UK is also highly influenced by EU-level legislation and regulation and is affected by the balance (or imbalance) struck between regulation and innovation," the committee declares.</p><h2>The questions</h2><p>The committee is now inviting comments from stakeholders, with responses to be submitted by Nov. 20, 2015. It has drawn up a list of questions under each of the four major themes mentioned above, although it says that respondents are encouraged to highlight any other issues they see as particularly relevant.</p><p>This is a brief summary of the questions posed for each theme:</p><p><b>Funding</b>. What is the scale of the EU's financial contribution to UK science and research, and of the UK's similar contribution to the EU? How effectively are these funds managed in the EU compared with the managing of science funding in the UK?</p><p><b>Collaboration</b>. How is private investment in UK science and research influenced by EU membership, and is international investment leveraged on the basis of membership? What are the benefits to the UK of taking part in EU programs such as Horizon 2020 and the ERC, and how does EU membership influence bilateral collaboration between the UK and EU member states? Does membership constrain the operation of international facilities outside the EU or affect collaborations with non-EU countries?</p><p><b>Regulation</b>. What are the key EU regulatory frameworks that directly affect the UK science and research community? How is the innovation landscape affected by EU membership? If the UK were not a member of the EU, could regulations be changed to give more benefits, for example in data regulation and the use of the precautionary principle? </p><p><b>Scientific advice</b>. How does the quality and effectiveness of scientific advice on matters of public policy compare between the EU and the UK, and to what extent does EU membership help (or hinder) UK scientists in informing and influencing public policy at EU and international level?</p><p><i>As part of a series of articles on "The Brexit Effect", Scrip will shortly be publishing an article by Claire Skentelbery of the European Biotechnology Network looking at the possible impact on the UK research community and biotechnology sector</i>. <i>A </i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/The-Brexit-Effect-Clinical-Trials-And-New-Drug-Approvals-359784" target="_new">previous article</a><i>in this series looked at the effects of a Brexit on clinical trials and new drug approvals.</i></p>
