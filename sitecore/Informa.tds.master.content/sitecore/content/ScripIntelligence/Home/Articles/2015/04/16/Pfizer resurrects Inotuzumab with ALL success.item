<p><p>After a late-stage failure for its lead antibody drug conjugate (ADC) a couple of years ago, Pfizer has resurrected the compound and given investors reason to believe the drug still holds potential. </p><p>The big pharma announced 21 April that inotuzumab ozogamicin reached its first primary endpoint in a Phase III study of patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy, demonstrating a higher hematologic remission rate. The INO-VATE study included 326 patients who were given chemotherapy or the drug. Patients on inotuzumab received the drug intravenously once weekly for three weeks for upto six cycles. </p><p>Pfizer only announced the topline result and is continuing the study to get further data on the overall survival rate. There were no unexpected safety issues and the rest of the results will be reported at an upcoming medical meeting. </p><p>"The top-line results show that inotuzumab ozogamicin has the potential to be an important new treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory disease," said Dr Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development and medical affairs and chief medical officer for Pfizer Oncology, in a statement. "We look forward to discussing these data with the FDA and other regulatory authorities."</p><p>Inotuzumab is an ADC comprised of a monoclonal antibody targeting CD22 linked to the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin. The drug binds to the receptor on the surface of the cell and the cytotoxic agent is released and destroys the cell. </p><h2>A rocky past</h2><p>Inotuzumab had a storied history for Pfizer; the company and analysts once thought the compound could be a major blockbuster, but development <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Pfizers-leading-ADC-in-Phase-III-study-failure-343410" target="_new">got tripped up</a> in May 2013. At the time, the major pharma announced that a Phase III study of inotuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was stopped due to futility. Following a scheduled interim analysis, the study's independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin plus rituximab (Roche's Rituxan) would not meet the primary objective of improving overall survival compared with the comparator arm.</p><p><p><p>
