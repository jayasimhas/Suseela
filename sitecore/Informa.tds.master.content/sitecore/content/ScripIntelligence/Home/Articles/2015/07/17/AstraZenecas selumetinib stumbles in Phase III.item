<p>One of AstraZeneca's key prospects in oncology, selumetinib, has failed in at the Phase III stage in one of its potential indications, uveal melanoma.</p><p>The Phase III SUMIT study of the MEK inhibitor in combination with dacarbazine in patients with metastatic missed its primary endpoint of progression-free survival. Uveal melanoma is an orphan disease in which cancer grows in the tissues of the eye; it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, comprising 5% of all melanomas. </p><p>AstraZeneca notes that the adverse event profile with the combination was generally consistent with what is already know about each of the drugs tested. The data are now being evaluated fully. </p><p>Antoine Yver, AZ's head of oncology, global medicines development said the setback would have no bearing the selumetinib's other studies. "Selumetinib is supported by a strong development program with different scientific rationale in multiple tumor types as both monotherapy and in alternative combinations."</p><p>The drug is also in Phase III for KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer and thyroid cancer and in Phase II in children with neurofibromatosis Type 1, but uveal melanoma had been the most advanced indication. US and EU filings had been planned for the fourth quarter this year, whereas those for lung and thyroid cancer are not slated until 2017. </p><p>The oral small molecule MEK inhibitor was licensed to AstraZeneca in 2003 by Array BioPharma. </p><p>Selumetinib appears to have been the most advanced product in development for uveal melanoma. Other products are being tested, include Talon Therapeutics vincristine (Marqibo) in Phase II, and Array/Novartis's MEK inhibitor binimetinib in Phase Ib/II. Recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lilly-to-trial-kinase-inhibitors-with-Immunocores-TCR-candidate-in-melanoma-359165" target="_new">Lilly and Immunocore entered into an immunotherapy-based clinical trial collaboration</a> to explore the utility of the TGF-&szlig; Type I receptor kinase inhibitor galunisertib in combination with Immunocore's IMC-gp100 for the treatment of melanoma, including uveal melanoma. </p><p>
