<p>Some people reckon that what others say of us is none of our business. It's a useful maxim for retaining sanity in the Twitter and Google age, but perhaps there are times when a bit of constructive criticism is good for the soul. We all know that the public perception of the pharma industry isn't great, but the opinions of an Ivy League economics professor laid out in a recent JAMA Forum commentary may sting. Paraphrasing, it seems Professor Uwe Reinhardt thinks you're a bit spoilt: fragile little birds shielded by government from the harsh realities of the free market, and enjoying monopoly positions. He's got a point. </p><p>But is what he says anything new? The balance of the costs versus the benefits of drugs is a perennial seesaw, and the trade-off between the risks of and rewards for pharmaceutical investment has always been tricky. These debates have long raged and will continue to do so. And through them all, pharma's trump card has remained that it is the only entity bringing novel pharmaceuticals to market. Who else has cured hepatitis C? Or tamed HIV? Or made huge strides in the treatment of cancer? This is pharma's true monopoly position. </p><p>But industry cannot preen itself on its achievements while simultaneously trying to screw ever more money out of governments and other payers without losing some of its moral high ground. When added to previous bribery and corruption scandals, mis-selling and data hiding, appearing greedy is not a good look. The general public is so quick to take medical advances for granted (indeed, those in the developed world could also be called spoilt &ndash; turning their backs on childhood immunizations and demanding unnecessary antibiotics of compliant doctors) while taking much longer to forget pharma's mistakes. The thalidomide tragedy is so strong in the public memory that the recent death of the FDA scientist who saved US children from the fate of others elsewhere made the headlines decades later. Eventually a benefit was found for the drug in treating leprosy and it returned to market as Thalomid. Surely if thalidomide can be redeemed, then so can pharma's reputation.</p><p>
