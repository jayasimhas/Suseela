<p><b>Alex Rogers, Partner at UK European Intellectual Property practice, Haseltine Lake, explains how the UK IPO's Patent Office Opinions service can be a powerful tool in patent disputes.</b></p><p>If you're looking for an impartial assessment of patent validity or infringement, one option is to ask the UK Intellectual Property Office for its opinion. Whether you are in the middle of a patent dispute, considering accusing a competitor of infringement, or concerned about whether you may need a licence under a competitor's patent, these opinions could help clarify the situation.</p><p>Since 2005, the UK Intellectual Property Office (UK IPO) Opinion Service has been used by a wide range of companies and individuals. For lone inventors, SMEs and multinational corporations &ndash; including Dyson, which has requested eight opinions over recent years<sup>1 </sup>&ndash; the service has provided a valuable way to obtain an impartial opinion on the novelty, inventive step and infringement of either their own or someone else's granted patent. The opinions are relatively cheap and quick to obtain: the official fee is just &pound;200, and the UK IPO aims to provide its opinion in three months. As of October last year<sup>2</sup>, this tool has become even more powerful, having been extended to cover not just patents but also supplementary protection certificates (SPCs). Furthermore, the service now also covers all aspects of patent and SPC validity, not just novelty and the presence of an inventive step. In addition, the UK IPO now has the ability to start revocation proceedings of its own volition following the issuance of a negative patent office opinion on novelty and/or inventive step.</p><p>Within the pharmaceutical industry specifically, the service's extension to include SPCs significantly increases its usefulness. Because the scope of many SPCs differs from that of the patent upon which it is based, an infringement of the patent may not be an infringement of the SPC. Moreover, an SPC can be invalid when the patent is valid. As a consequence, an opinion on the infringement or validity of the patent may not provide any useful insight into the corresponding SPC; as a result, the opinion service was, until recently, unable to provide guidance in relation to SPCs. With the introduction of opinions on SPCs, an opinion can now be gained about the SPC directly rather than having to rely on the more expensive and slower court system.</p><p>Companies worried about a competitor's patent may also be attracted by the increased power of the UK IPO to revoke a patent when an opinion has concluded that it is either not novel or does not involve an inventive step. However, before the patent can be revoked, the period during which a review of the opinion can be requested must have expired, any requested review must have been issued, any appeal of that review must have been determined, and the proprietor must have been given the opportunity to comment on the opinion and to amend the patent claims. Accordingly, patent proprietors will have an opportunity to contest the negative opinion and amend the claims before their patent can be revoked. Additionally, the revocation proceedings will, apparently, only be commenced in relation to patents that have been found to be clearly invalid<sup>3</sup>. Unfortunately, it is not yet clear under what circumstances this will be considered to be the case. As the review-request period has not yet expired for any validity opinions requested since the change in the law, it is not yet possible to determine the circumstances under which this power will be utilised. </p><p>An additional attraction of patent office opinions is that, unlike in the UK courts, they can be requested by a so-called "straw man". In other words, the real requester does not have to reveal its identity, and can name another party in the application papers. For example, many requests are filed in the name of a patent attorney or their firm. One such opinion, requested by a firm of patent attorneys in the UK, explored whether a patent for improved pharmaceutical formulations containing ibuprofen and codeine, owned by SmithKline Beecham plc, was inventive based on several publications submitted to the office in the request for an opinion. In making its decision, the opinion service followed the guidance of leading UK court cases on claim construction and analysis of inventive step, concluding that 15 of the 16 claims in the patent were not inventive, leaving only one, much narrower, claim considered as valid. However, the non-binding nature of patent office opinions at that time meant that all 16 claims remained in the patent until the proprietor allowed it to lapse more than six years later. Under the new regime, the UK IPO would have the power to start revocation proceedings, so the patent could eventually be removed or significantly restricted in scope as a result of the patent office opinion. </p><p>The anonymity of a "straw man" request may be particularly useful if a company is concerned that a product may infringe if the patent is valid. However, in some situations, anonymity may be impossible, for example where the evidence names the requester, or makes it obvious who this is. One example would be where the evidence includes literature naming a particular company or a product with which it is associated. For instance an opinion that was based on such evidence related to a patent on the use of 19-nor-vitamin D compounds for the prevention of hyperphosphatemia in kidney disorder patients, owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. A request was made by Pharmathen for an opinion as to whether their proposed generic product, for which a marketing authorisation request had already been submitted, would infringe the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation's second-medical-use patent. </p><p>In this case, in the opinion of the patent Examiner, the medical use indicated in the claim and the use indicated in the patient information leaflet (PIL) provided by Pharmathen were intimately related since the use indicated in the PIL was a common cause of the use claimed in the patent. As a result, in the opinion of the patent opinion service, the product, if launched, would infringe the patent, a conclusion that may have had a significant effect on Pharmathen's planned product launch. Since the patient information leaflet was used as evidence and named the drug in question, and Pharmathen has filed for marketing approval in the UK, it is highly likely that it would have become obvious that it was Pharmathen requesting the opinion, given that the marketing approval would be public. </p><p>More frequent than infringement opinion requests by potential infringers, however, are requests by patent proprietors for the opinion service to determine whether their patent is being infringed by a competitor. One such request came from INOV8 Medical Solutions Limited in relation to a competitor's product that they believed infringed their patent for a single-use storage device for an endoscope. Although the competitor, Medical Innovations Group Limited, was given the opportunity to file a response to the allegation of infringement, they chose not to do so and the patent office utilised the extensive disclosure of the allegedly infringing product provided by the patent proprietor to conclude that several of the claims in the patent were infringed.</p><p>In conclusion, opinions on infringement and/or validity, whether requested by the proprietor or their competitor, can provide a useful tool when in a patent dispute or contemplating whether to proceed with litigation. Additionally, if you are considering whether or not you need to license to launch a product, an opinion from the UK IPO may provide helpful strategic information. It should be borne in mind, however, that the opinion procedure is public, so anything filed as evidence during the procedure, and the final opinion, will be available for competitors to view on the UK IPO's online records. This, however, can be advantage if you obtain a negative opinion on the validity of a competitor's patent. Furthermore, the increased power of the UK IPO to now revoke patents as a result of the negative opinion could prove very attractive to companies that wish to remove patents that are of concern. </p><p><b>Footnotes</b>:</p><p>1 All requests for opinions can be found at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/requests-for-opinions%20" target="_new">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/requests-for-opinions</a></p><p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/18/contents/enacted?text=intellectual%20property" target="_new">2 Changes introduced by the Intellectual Property Act 2014</a> and implemented by the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2330/pdfs/uksi_20142330_en.pdf" target="_new">Intellectual Property Act 2014</a> (Commencement No.3 and Transitional Provisions) Order 2014</p><p>3 Explanatory Notes, Intellectual Property Act 2014, <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/18/notes/division/5/2/2" target="_new">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/18/notes/division/5/2/2</a></p>
