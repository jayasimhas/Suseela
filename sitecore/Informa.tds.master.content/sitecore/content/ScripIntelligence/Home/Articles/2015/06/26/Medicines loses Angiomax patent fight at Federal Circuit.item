<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on 2 July declared that two patents on The Medicines Company's top-selling anticoagulant Angiomax (bivalirudin) were invalid &ndash; ruling in favor of Hospira and opening the door for the company and others to market generic copycats in the US.</p><p>While the decision was bad news for MDCO's financial bottom line, investors embraced the ruling, which was anticipated by Wall Street &ndash; viewing it as a major overhang being lifted from the firm's stock.</p><p>Indeed, MDCO's shares leaped as high as 10.65% on 2 July, gaining $3.02, before closing at $31.28, up $2.94, or 10.4%.</p><p>Plus, analysts said, investors already have moved on &ndash; anticipating the potential for MDCO's newly approved intravenous antiplatelet agent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Medicines-coronary-angioplasty-drug-Kengreal-359070" target="_new">Kengreal</a> (cangrelor) to do well in the marketplace.</p><p>They also are excited about the firm's experimental proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, even though it is well behind others in the class &ndash; such as Sanofi's and Regeneron's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab) and Amgen's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Repatha</a> (evolocumab), which are awaiting FDA approval decisions later this month and next, respectively.</p><p>Last year, the US District Court of Delaware had ruled that MDCO's patents, known as '727 patent and the '343, covering Angiomax were valid, but determined Hospira had not infringed them. </p><p>MDCO appealed the district court's claim construction and non-infringement ruling.</p><p>Hospira also appealed the lower court's decision on the validity of the patents. </p><p>MDCO had filed its patent applications in 2008, which described a discovery made by its consultant involving certain methods of adding a pH-adjusting solution during the compounding process, which minimized the Asp9-bivalirudin impurity to less than 0.6%. </p><p>But a year before filing the patent applications, MDCO had hired Ben Venue Lab to prepare three batches of Angiomax using an embodiment of the patented method. </p><p>Meanwhile, Hospira had sought approval through the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) process to market a generic of Angiomax.</p><p>But MDCO sued in August 2010 &ndash; declaring Hospira's ANDA filings infringed the patents on Angiomax.</p><p>The case rested on the so-called on-sale bar rule, which applies when, before the critical date, the claimed invention was the subject of a commercial offer for sale and was ready for patenting. </p><p>The district court found that the claimed invention was ready for patenting but not commercially offered for sale before the critical date. MDCO disputed the former part of that ruling, while Hospira argued against the latter. </p><p>The court had concluded that no commercial sale occurred because Ben Venue only sold manufacturing services, not pharmaceutical batches. It also said the batches fell under the experimental use exception.</p><p>The Federal Circuit said the district court did not err in finding that the claimed invention was ready for patenting.</p><p>But the appeals court said the lower court had "clearly erred in finding that the claimed invention was not commercially offered for sale before the critical date."</p><p>Therefore, the Federal Circuit reversed the district court's determination that the on-sale bar did not apply, and accordingly, held that MDCO's patent claims were invalid.</p><p>"This does not appear to be good outcome for MDCO," said Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz. </p><p>But, he said, Wall Street widely already assumed that Angiomax is going generic now and the company "is no longer an Angiomax story, hence rendering this ruling to be largely irrelevant."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
