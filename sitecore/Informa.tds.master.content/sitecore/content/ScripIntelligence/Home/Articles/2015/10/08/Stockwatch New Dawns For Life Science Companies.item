<p>Beneath the surface of a sporadically negative second-quarter earnings season lie two significant changes to the way that life science companies conduct their businesses.</p><p><p>When Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc. announced the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AMD-Gene-Therapy-Prospects-Swept-Downhill-With-Avalanche-359966" target="_new">relegation of its lead gene therapy drug</a> AVA-101 from Phase IIb down to preclinical development, it prompted a severe 28% share price sell-off. At first glance, this caution was out of character for a management team that had previously announced a "positive" Phase IIa clinical study of AVA-101 in age-related macular degeneration patients and seemed set to blunder undaunted into a Phase IIb study when there were legitimate safety and efficacy issues with the top-line data. I initially thought that Avalanche's lawyers or physicians must have had a sudden attack of conscience, however bearing in mind the recent announcements by Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., I surmise some joined-up actions by no less than agencies of the Federal government.</p><p><p>The share price of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-says-Qinprezo-not-ready-for-NDA-Sunesis-slammed-359597" target="_new">Sunesis fell by about 67%</a> on the day it announced that discussions with the FDA suggested submission of an NDA based on the failed Phase III VALOR study of Qinprezo (vosaroxin) in acute myeloid leukemia patients would not be supportive of an approval. In the past, early stage biotech companies would have probably held back the sort detail that included either their clinical trials (for disclosure at some much later medical conference) or their discussions with the FDA (for commercial purposes) leaving many investors with a more rosy picture of the company's prospects than would be the case, had they been fully informed. </p><p><p>The share price of Celldex dropped by about 30% when it announced that the FDA would not accept the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Consistent-and-continuing-Phase-II-survival-benefit-for-Celldex-brain-cancer-drug-337319" target="_new">Phase II study of its cancer vaccine Rintega</a> (rindopepimut) as a basis for accelerated approval because the trial was conducted in only 67 patients and the significant overall survival benefit observed could have arisen by chance. The recent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Mind-what-you-disclose-357132" target="_new">focus by the SEC</a> on the accuracy and timeliness of biopharma company filings, particularly those related to the FDA, seems to have moved the goalposts on material disclosure. I would like to think that for Avalanche to, as the analysts from Jefferies put it, "bring AV-101 back to the drawing board," probably suggests the safety and efficacy concerns of the FDA. For Sunesis and Celldex not to suggest some sort of 'dialog with the FDA that culminated in our NDA submission', despite whatever opinions the FDA expressed in private, implies an influence of the FDA and possibly the SEC to prevent the opaque statements and actions of the past that might have resulted in investors being misled. While this raises the bar on the behavior of early-stage biopharma companies, it can only be a good thing.</p><p><p>At the other end of the market capitalization spectrum, big strategic moves have been afoot. I have applauded the strategic moves by the pure-play generics companies that were Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Mylan, Inc. to transform themselves into the more diversified companies that they are today and offset the effect of their own patent expiry opportunities expiring. The acquisition of specialty pharmaceutical assets &ndash; which give a 'pile them high, sell them cheap' generic pharmaceutical company the things it aspires to most; branded products &ndash; and the consolidation of smaller and geographically diverse generic assets, have resulted in growing pains at companies that are now Allergan Plc and Mylan N.V. As Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. will be finding out as it tries to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mega-Deals-or-Not-Allergan-Transformation-Under-Way-359815" target="_new">digest the generic drug portfolio of Allergan</a>, you can only be so big before you start to bump up against market shares that make the FTC and the EU nervous enough that they start to make you divest some of the very products you were keen to acquire. With over 85% of all prescriptions written in the US now being for generic drugs, the consolidation of generic drug market share typified by Teva's acquisition of Allergan's generics and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-Keeps-Options-Open-As-Perrigo-Pursuit-Continues-359814" target="_new">Mylan's attempted acquisition of Perrigo</a> Company Plc, might be a rational move if it did not play right into the hands of their biggest customers. These are the pharmacy benefit managers who themselves are consolidating and likely to pressure their fewer biggest generic suppliers on both price and volume.</p><p><p>Against this strategic backdrop, Allergan's shift to specialty pharma and away from generic small-molecule drugs (but not biosimilars), a move the analysts from UBS described as "an offer they couldn't refuse," seems to be ahead of the volume-cost-pressure curve and the increasing public scrutiny on increasing generic prices that have accompanied supply constraints. That would be if Allergan was not now under intense pressure to go shopping for specialty and branded assets and end up looking like a traditional branded pharmaceutical company that will ultimately have patent expiries and got us into this strategic mess in the first place.</p><p><p>Unlike the increased transparency of the interactions of companies with the FDA, the answer to the branded or generic question at the moment is that there isn't an answer. Once generic companies and their customers get too big, competition gets muted and the ability to generate abnormal earnings declines. At the moment, Allergan's strategy to side-step this generic quicksand looks inspired, but let's see what they end up buying.</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Mylan and Allergan.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
