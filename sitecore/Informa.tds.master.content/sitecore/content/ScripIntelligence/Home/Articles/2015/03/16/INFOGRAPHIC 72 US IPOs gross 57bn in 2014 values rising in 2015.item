<p> In 2014, 72 biotechnology firms that develop drugs, biologics and gene, stem or cell therapies grossed $5.7bn from initial public offerings in the US with most companies ending the year with stock values well above their IPO price &ndash; and values have risen higher in 2015. </p> <p> Even so, only eight therapeutics companies have launched first-time offerings this year versus the 22 biotech IPOs that hit the market during the first two and a half months of last year. It appears that the second half of 2014 was a harbinger of the biotech IPO market for 2015, since 41 drug developers went public between January and June, but only 31 began trading on the US stock market between July and December of last year. </p> <p> Still, the market continues to shine a bright light on therapeutics companies that launched IPOs in 2014. While 25 of the 72 firms that completed IPOs ended last year below their offering prices, 22 of the declining companies regained ground and have stocks that are trading above their year-end 2014 values as of 16 March 2015. Collectively, the IPO class of 2014 continues to outperform broader indices &ndash; even the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index. </p> <p> For more data on last year's IPOs and the companies' performance in 2015, see the infographic below. </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/2014_Biotech_IPOs__249332a.jpeg"><img border="0" src="-/media/1D840AEF5CE94D248F9A1EA9626EA4C7.ashx"> </a> </p>
