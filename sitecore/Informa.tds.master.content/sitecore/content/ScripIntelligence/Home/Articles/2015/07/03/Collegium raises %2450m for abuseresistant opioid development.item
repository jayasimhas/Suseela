<p>Collegium Pharmaceutical has raised a $50mprivate financing to advance its lead abuse-deterrent product candidate, Xtampza ER (oxycodone extended-release capsules), through to FDA approval and launch, as well as to fund operational growth and other pipeline development programs. The FDA accepted for filing the Massachusetts-based firm's NDA for Xtampza ER in February, following a December filing. The financing was led by TPG Biotech, which was joined by RA Capital Management, Adage Capital Management, Rock Springs Capital, EcoR1 Capital, Eventide Asset Management and Aperture Venture Partners. Existing investors Longitude Capital, Skyline Ventures, Frazier Healthcare and Boston Millennia Partners also participated. In conjunction with the financing, Eran Nadav, TPG Biotech partner and managing director, will join Collegium's board. Xtampza is one of several products in development that uses the firm's DETERx microsphere-in-capsule formulation technology to reduce the risk of abuse. "The proceeds from this financing will allow us to continue to build our commercial organization and prepare for launch, subject to FDA approval," said CEO Michael Heffernan. </p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Collegium-enters-Phase-III-with-DETERx-oxycodone-334466" target="_new">Collegium enters Phase III with DETERx oxycodone</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Collegium-collects-22M-in-venture-round-for-tamper-resistant-ER-oxycodone-product-327368" target="_new">Collegium collects $22M in venture round for tamper-resistant ER oxycodone product</a></p><p>
