<p>Janssen Pharmaceuticals has acquired XO1, a privately held biotech company founded to develop the anti-thrombin antibody ichorcumab.</p><p>XO1 was established by Index Ventures as an asset-centric company, an investment model advanced by Index, via its &euro;150m Index Life 6 fund. IL6 was launched in 2012 and XO1 is its first exit. J&J and GlaxoSmithKline are both investors in the fund. </p><p>Ichorcumab is a recombinant human antibody developed to mimic the activity of a human antibody which appears to produce an anticoagulated state without predisposition to bleeding.</p><p>"We've been in the thrombosis space for some time, with Xarelto (rivaroxaban). We are very excited by this product. We believe it has the potential for the same efficacy as Xarelto but with a better bleeding profile," Dr Peter DiBattiste, global cardiovascular development head, Janssen R&D, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Ichorcumab's mechanism of action is unclear, but this does not concern Janssen. "We know a bit about how it works - where the antibody attaches onto thrombin &ndash; but it is not unusual at this stage of the game to not have the entire mechanism elucidated," he said.</p><p>There is still some preclinical work left to do before ichorcumab is ready for testing in man, but Dr DiBattiste hopes to get it into the clinic within 12-15 months.</p><p>The acquisition opportunity was identified and facilitated through Johnson & Johnson Innovation, London. Its head, Patrick Verheyen, told <i>Scrip</i> that J&J was "very attracted" to the asset-centric model. J&J's position on the scientific advisory board of IL6, along with GSK, "enables us to identify promising assets early through scientific engagement." However, none of the investors in the fund has any pre-emptive rights over any of the assets, he clarified. </p><p>Francesco De Rubertis, a partner at Index, explained further. "It is the responsibility of the scientific advisory board to add value to the programs, make suggestions and contributions. So they are more familiar with the companies than anyone else. But this is an open market competition."</p><p>Index invested $11m in XO1. "A fair bit" of this money has been spent, noted Mr Verheyen. Financial details of the transaction are not being disclosed. </p><p>XO1's CEO is Dr Richard Mason, the former head of business development and strategy at BTG. Dr De Rubertis said that while some of XO1's employees would help to ensure a smooth transition over to J&J, there were "lots of new projects" in the pipeline to keep the outgoing management team occupied.</p>
