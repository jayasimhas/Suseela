<p>With much of the global attention in the past year centered on Ebola, other diseases, like tuberculosis, have been given short shrift.</p><p>But the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other groups are now putting new focus on TB &ndash; with the US biomedical research agency pumping $105.3m over the next seven years into its Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) intended to drive innovation. </p><p>Although TB illnesses and deaths have slowly been declining in recent years, the global burden of the disease remains substantial, the NIH pointed out.</p><p>In 2013, about nine million people worldwide became ill with TB, with 1.5 million of those dying from the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). </p><p>TB infected more than 500,000 children in 2013 &ndash; killing 80,000, WHO reported.</p><p>About one-third of the world's population actually carries latent TB bacteria, the global health agency said. </p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, said TB remains especially entrenched in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The new investment in the TBRU, he said, "will help us to improve our understanding of this ancient disease and how best to diagnosis, treat and ultimately prevent it."</p><p>The TBRU program was established in 1994 with the aim of integrating basic and clinical research to study TB in countries where the disease is endemic. </p><p>The NIH funds will be used to integrate epidemiology, immunology and microbiology by four awardee institutions &ndash; Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Emory University and Weill Cornell Medical College &ndash; which will work together to examine how mycobacterium TB interacts with the human host and the immune system to cause disease. </p><p>Through animal studies and clinical research, the TBRU program will focus on TB latency and persistence and their relation to active TB disease in humans, the NIH said. </p><p>The nonprofit TB Alliance also revealed last week it was starting a Phase I trial of a new TB drug candidate, TBA-354, an investigational nitroimidazole compound.</p><p>Nitroimidazoles have been shown to be effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.</p><p>The study plans to enroll 50 US volunteers for the randomized, double-blind Phase I trial, which will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and dosing of TBA-354.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
