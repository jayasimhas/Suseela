<p>Following up on a decision first mentioned in an August 2014 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/ThromboGenics-cuts-EU-operations-in-Jetrea-US-quest-353645" target="_new">business update</a>, ThromboGenics has spun out a new company called Oncurious to develop the early clinical-stage oncology candidate TB-403. VIB, a Belgian life sciences institute, is also a partner in the new venture, and it is hoped that access to basic research at VIB will allow Oncurious to go on to build an oncology pipeline behind TB-403. ThromboGenics will be the majority shareholder. </p><p>Oncurious will initially be focused on the development of TB-403 as a treatment of pediatric brain tumors, and plans to start a Phase I/IIa program in medulloblastoma patients by the end of 2015. </p><p>TB-403 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against placental growth factor (PlGF). PlGF is expressed in several types of cancer, including medulloblastoma. High expression of the PlGF receptor neuropilin 1 has been shown to correlate with poor overall survival. The antibody can potentially be used in other pediatric cancer indications, including neuroblastoma.</p><p>ThromboGenics and its Swedish partner BioInvent previously conducted a Phase I trial with the product in solid tumors which showed a "favorable safety profile," said ThromboGenics. The product had also been licensed to Roche but was returned to ThromboGenics and BioInvent as a result of "pipeline prioritization" in 2012.</p><p>BioInvent will act as a co-development partner for the TB-403, but holds no stake in Oncurious, ThromboGenics told <i>Scrip</i>. In an announcement last month, BioInvent said it would be contributing half of the development costs for the TB-403 program in pediatric brain tumor and was entitled to 40% of all future revenues.</p><p>ThromboGenics, meanwhile, retains exclusive rights to TB-403 in ophthalmic indications.</p><p>"This formation of a new company allows a proper focus for ThromboGenics &ndash; in ophthalmology &ndash; and for Oncurious [in oncology]," said ThromboGenics. "To be able to progress TB-403 optimally, it requires focus, specific expertise and an own face. Creating a new company just makes it more clear for all, and this joint venture with VIB is a great opportunity."</p><p>ThromboGenics has been struggling to make a commercial success of Jetrea (ocriplasmin), the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VME), which was launched in 2013. Within a year, low Jetrea sales forced ThromboGenics to "explore options" that included a sale of the company. However, efforts to find buyers for the company proved tricky and the company was forced to abandon those plans.</p><p>Last month the company reported positive topline results from its OASIS study with Jetrea. It followed patients for 24 months post injection and was designed to provide long term controlled efficacy and safety data. "The positive OASIS results are starting to reach the community. Our next moment where we will report sales progress will be around the half year," concluded ThromboGenics.</p><p>
