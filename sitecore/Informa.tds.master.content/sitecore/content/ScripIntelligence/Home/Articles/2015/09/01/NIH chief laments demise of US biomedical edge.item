<p>The slide in funding for US biomedical research and development is not a favorite topic, by any means, for Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). But it is a subject for which he frequently finds himself engaged in explaining.</p><p>And Dr Collins&rsquo; "fireside chat" at the 33rd annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco was no different, where he again sounded the alarm that US funding in innovation is on a dangerous downward trajectory. </p><p>This time, however, the NIH chief was backed up by a new study, which found that if nothing changes, the US will relinquish its historical innovation lead in the next decade.</p><p>The study, which was reported 13 January in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (JAMA), found that from 2004 to 2012, the rate of total US investment in medical research declined to 0.8% annually, decreasing in three of the past five years.</p><p>US government research funding dropped from 57% in 2004 to 50% in 2012.</p><p>In the meantime, however, there was a significant increase in research investment in China &ndash; tripling from $2.6bn in 2004 to $9.7bn in 2012. </p><p>In addition, the US share of life science patents fell from 57% in 1981 to 51% in 2011. For the most valuable patents, the US share plunged from 73% to 59% during the same period. </p><p>The authors of the <i>JAMA </i><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2089358" target="_new">report</a> said their analysis underscored the need for the US to find new sources to support medical research. </p><p>"Substantial new private resources are feasible, though public funding can play a greater role," they said, adding that both will require non-traditional approaches.</p><p>"This is truly unfortunate and bizarre, because it doesn't follow any logic," Dr Collins declared at the JP Morgan conference, calling the <i>JAMA</i> report "sobering."</p><p>"Even if you didn't care about human health, the economic arguments for investment in academically based biomedical research supported by NIH is overwhelming," he said, pointing to big programs like the Human Genome Project, which has shown a 178-to-one return on investment (ROI), and the Women's Health Initiative, whose ROI was 140 to one.</p><p>Dr Collins said his greatest hope right now is the US "will figure it out."</p><p>"Americans can be counted on to do the right thing after they have exhausted all the other options," he said, paraphrasing famed UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill.</p><p>But, Dr Collins said, "we've exhausted the options. It's time to put medical research back on a stable trajectory &#8230; to do what America has done so nobly and beautifully for decades."</p><p>The "crunch in resources," which is making it "difficult to go as quickly as we'd like to" on research, comes as some of the most exciting science has the potential to lead to new medical breakthroughs, he said, noting the recent ballyhooed news about the experimental dirt-derived antibiotic teixobactin, for which bacteria may be far less likely to become resistant.</p><p>Dr Collins also said he feared projects like the BRAIN Initiative &ndash; a program aimed at unlocking the mysteries of the brain to solve the complex puzzles of diseases like autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy and Alzheimer's and eventually finding preventive therapies or even cures for those conditions &ndash; could be stung if investment is not increased (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BAM-Obama-aims-for-job-creation-economic-growth-with-brain-initiative-341691" target="_new">02 April 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">04 April 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">17 September 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brains-secrets-unlocked-for-price-of-a-6-pack-352183" target="_new">06 June 2014</a>).</p><p>This past September, the NIH launched the first wave of BRAIN Initiative grants totaling $46m to 58 projects (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">01 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Another R&D area with new emerging science that holds great promise is vaccines against diseases like Ebola, influenza and HIV, Dr Collins said.</p><p>He noted two experimental Ebola vaccines are expected to enter Phase II/III testing in Africa this month &ndash; a significant achievement for NIH and science (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>).</p><p>There's also a growing sense of optimism it's not just a pipe dream there could be a universal flu vaccine available within the next five years, which could end the yearly selection of strains, in which regulators and government health officials may not always get it right &ndash; the current season a case in point, Dr Collins said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Antivirals-underused-against-nasty-H3N2-flu-356062" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>).</p><p>After several failures for a vaccine against the "diabolical" virus HIV, there is reason for "some optimism that we might be able to take the human immune system to school and teach it, maybe not in one step, but maybe in two, how to produce the appropriate antibody to be protective," Dr Collins declared.</p><p>But the scientific gains in brain research, vaccines and genomics could be stifled if investment continues to falter, he lamented. </p><p>"We are throwing away exciting science just at the moment where we could be going faster" because of a lack of investment, which has led the NIH to cut the number of grants it awards each year, Dr Collins said.</p><p>"And it's having a profound effect on particularly young scientists, who are wondering if there is a career for them if this climate doesn&rsquo;t improve," he said. "That is the thing that wakes me up at night."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
