<p>The European Commission has approved the use of Xadago (safinamide) for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), making it the first new chemical entity to be approved for the condition in ten years.</p><p>The product will be marketed by Zambon, which acquired the rights from Newron Pharmaceuticals, after it was returned by its original licensee, Merck Serono, in 2011 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biotie-drops-Newron-after-Merck-Seronos-safinamide-bombshell-323035" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 28 October 2011</a>). </p><p>The EU's CHMP granted a positive opinion on marketing the product in December (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Xadago-gets-EU-nod-in-first-for-Newron-355790" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 22 December 2014</a>).</p><p>This was followed a few weeks later by a resubmission of the US NDA for the product (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Parkinsons-drug-safinamide-refiled-in-the-US-355856" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 December 2014</a>). The first submission of safinamide to the US FDA was made in May 2014. The FDA issued a Refusal to File (RTF) letter based on "organizational and navigational problems, largely due relating to the hyperlinking of tables, folders and the organization of the table of contents in the submission," explained Newron. </p><p>The approved indication of Xadago is for the treatment of adult patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease as add-on therapy to a stable dose of Levodopa (L-dopa) alone or in combination with other Parkinson's products in mid-to late-stage fluctuating patients.</p><p>Safinamide is a highly selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor that causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. It is also associated with state-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels, and modulation of stimulated release of glutamate. </p><p>Zambon has the rights to develop and commercialize Xadago globally, excluding Japan and certain other territories, where Meiji Seika has the rights to develop and commercialize the compound.</p><p>"Levodopa, still the gold standard of symptomatic efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, in its long-term use is associated with motor complications which still constitute a major unmet medical need in PD therapy," stated Professor Werner Poewe, director of the department of neurology, Innsbruck Medical University and University Hospital. "Targeting non-dopaminergic systems might be an alternative approach to improve and control such motor complications, enhancing efficacy and removing the need for further increases in levodopa dose, that has been shown to worsen motor fluctuations." </p><p>"EU pricing is a challenge," Zambon's Vincenzo Abruscato, head of the global specialty business unit, told <i>Scrip</i>. "But Xadago is a new chemical entity with a unique double mechanism of action and is the first new molecule in PD after 10 years. Naturally, we are ready to support [our case] with data to health authorities to get the right price for our product."</p><p>Zambon is ready to launch safinamide. "Our first country will be Germany in the next months and our sales force is in place. They are focused only in PD, with high expertise, and very well prepared."</p><p>He also revealed that Zambon was looking for a "credible partner" to develop and commercialize safinamide "all the world and give the availability of this new treatment to all patients that need support in PD."</p>
