<p>The next biosimilar to reach the EU market could well be a version of Amgen's TNF inhibitor Enbrel, after the European Medicines Agency revealed in a January update that its scientific committee, the CHMP, has a biosimilar etanercept under evaluation. </p><p>No details of the product are being divulged, beyond its INN and the therapeutic area, but it is likely to be either SB4 from Samsung Bioepis, which is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis, or Sandoz' GP2015, which is in Phase III for chronic stable plaque psoriasis. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Giles Somers said that in his view the Samsung Bioepis drug was the most likely candidate, as the product's Phase III trial primary endpoint had been due in June 2014, "so the timing fits". Samsung Bioepis is a joint venture between the South Korean company and Biogen Idec.</p><p>The trial with SB4, which began in May 2013, is a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of SB4 versus Enbrel in 498 subjects with moderate to severe RA despite methotrexate therapy. </p><p>Sandoz' GP2015, while a strong contender, is less likely to be the product filed with the EMA, as its Phase III EGALITY study has an estimated primary completion date of April 2015, according to clinicaltrials.gov. The randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial is intended to show equivalent efficacy and to compare the safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and Enbrel in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.</p><p>Other companies are working on biosimilar Enbrel, but they seem to be relative outsiders at this point in time. Coherus BioSciences began a Phase III trial in July 2014 with its CHS-0214 in chronic plaque psoriasis (the RaPsOdy trial), having earlier launched a Phase III study in RA. "It's not likely to be Coherus in my view, as they're a bit further off", Mr Somers observed. </p><p>Coherus is developing the drug with its partner Baxter which has commercial rights in Europe, Canada, Brazil and some other markets (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Baxter-enters-biosimilar-Enbrel-race-through-Coherus-collaboration-346283" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 5 September 2014). In Japan it is being co-developed with Coherus' partner Daiichi Sankyo. </p><p>Another possibility is South Korea's Hanwha Chemical, which gained approval for biosimilar etanercept (HD203) in its home market in November 2014 on the basis of a smaller Phase III trial. Mr Somers says the results of this study may not be enough to meet the requirements of the EMA, but nonetheless "they may be having a go". Merck & Co had gained development and commercialization rights to the Hanwha drug in most markets under an alliance signed in 2011, but the collaboration was quietly dissolved the following year, apparently after the US firm reviewed its biosimilars strategy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/DEAL-ALERT-Merck-ends-alliance-with-Hanwha-for-biosimilar-Enbrel-338436" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 20 December 2012).</p><p>A number of other Asian firms have biosimilar etanercept products in development, including LG Lifesciences (South Korea), Mycenax Biotech (Taiwan), and Avesthagen (India). </p><p>
