<p> <preform><p>Dr Stanley T Crooke is founder, chairman and CEO of Isis Pharmaceuticals. He has led the R&D of more than 20 marketed drugs and the scientific development of a whole new platform for drug discovery: antisense technology.</p> <p>Dr Crooke's early career was spent at Bristol-Myers Squibb, where he created the first broad anticancer program in history, and later at SmithKline Beecham, where he was responsible for worldwide R&D. About 25 years ago he founded Isis, where he conceived and implemented the scientific and business strategies that led to the invention of antisense, and brought to market the first two drugs based on this this platform technology: Vitravene (fomivirsen) and, more recently, Kynamro (mipomersen).</p> <p>In the latest instalment of <i>Scrip</i>'s executive profile series, Dr Crooke talks of the tough early experiences that formed his values, the impact that a good mentor can have, and his surprising ability to relinquish control. </p> <p> <h4><img src="-/media/57F4F2F5D0274EF5A8FF6C2BC4079270.ashx" version="c" refid="248852" alt="Dr Stanley T Crooke"></h4><h5>Dr Stanley T Crooke</h5></p> <p> <p> <b> <i>Scrip</i>: You have risen to a leadership position in your field. What has been the secret to your success?</b></p> <p> <b> <i>Stanley Crooke</i></b>: Training, commitment, energy, perseverance, leadership skills. Without having planned it, it turns out I'm uniquely well-trained to do what I do today. I am an MD, PhD, trained in molecular pharmacology and in RNA biochemistry. I was lucky early in my career to be given senior leadership positions in drug discovery and development. Thus, I know pharmacology and medicine, drug discovery and development and the RNA world. I am committed to the patients and science and understood when I founded Isis that doing what I planned would require perseverance from me and my colleagues. Even today, I never get tired while I work and doing everything necessary is rarely a problem. Finally I think I am a good leader and a manager.</p> <p> <b>Scrip: What are your own long-term aspirations?</b></p> <p> <b> <i>SC: </i></b>To create a novel, more efficient drug discovery platform that changes biological sciences, that results in drugs that improve the lives of patients with many diseases, that supports the creation of a unique "fully disintegrated pharmaceutical company" and returns great value to our shareholders. We are not quite there yet, but I think all of our hopes are within our grasp. </p> <p> <b> <i>Scrip:</i> What are the key things that shaped you when growing up?</b></p> <p> <b> <i>SC: </i></b>Anger and desperation. Anger at the unfairness I saw and experienced; desperation to have something more to life than what I saw around me. Although there are many, I'm sure, who come from more difficult environment, I have known what it means not to have a bed or enough to eat. Being the first person in my family to graduate from high school and being on my own with no guidance, I had to create myself. I made mistakes and had false starts, but the unfairness that I experienced and the desires to be fair and be fairly treated were central to my life. Finally, the desperation came from knowing that I couldn't be a mechanic meant I had to find something else to do. </p> <p> <b> <i>Scrip:</i> Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b></p> <p> <b> <i>SC: </i></b>The late Dr Harris Busch, former chairman of pharmacology at Baylor College of Medicine. Harris was instrumental in my being admitted to Baylor Medical School. (I still don't know what he saw in me, as it was certainly not my undergraduate grades.) He introduced me to medicine, science and intellectual life, and taught me to demand more of myself and others. He and his wife Rose were the closest thing to parents and a family I have experienced. </p> <p> <b> <i>Scrip:</i> What is the best advice you've ever had?</b></p> <p> <b> <i>SC: </i></b>Find what you love to do and do it.
