<p>Astellas Pharma Inc. will pay Chromocell $15m up front and could spend more than $500m on milestone fees under a license and collaboration agreement for Nav1.7 antagonists, including lead drug candidate CC8464 and backup compounds, for the treatment of neuropathic pain and other conditions.</p><p>North Brunswick, New Jersey-based Chromocell is a 12-year-old company with about 100 employees that uses its Chromovert technology platform to develop flavor enhancers as well as therapeutics. The transaction with Astellas is the company's first pharma partnership and it is one of the largest deals to date associated with Nav1.7 &ndash; a sodium ion channel involved in the transmission of pain, which has become an increasingly popular non-opioid pain drug target.</p><p>"Neuropathic pain is really a field where there is still a lot of unmet need. We have early on looked at Nav1.7, which is the first target with big potential in the pain space besides opioids and without the side effects," Chromocell CEO Christian Kopfli told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p><b>Dual Deal Decision</b></p><p>Kopfli described two reasons why the company was willing to sign a deal with Astellas so early in the development process for the preclinical compound CC8464 and its follow-on molecules. </p><p>First, Astellas understood the value of drugs targeting Nav1.7, which is associated with an inability to feel pain for people who don't express high levels of Nav1.7. The target also has been validated in mid-stage clinical trials for more advanced Nav1.7 antagonists.</p><p>Second, Kopfli said, it has been difficult to develop successful novel compounds targeting Nav1.7, because it has been hard to reproduce the Nav1.7 receptor for <i>in vitro</i> assays &ndash; a feat that Chromocell's Chromovert technology was able to achieve. </p><p>Those two factors led Astellas to propose terms for an early-stage collaboration that was attractive to Chromocell. "The offer they put on the table was convincing for us," Kopfli said.</p><p>In addition to the upfront, milestone and royalty payments that Chromocell stands to earn, the biotechnology company retained development responsibilities through the first Phase IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial in neuropathic pain.</p><p>Astellas will take over development beyond Phase IIa in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain, but Chromocell is free to develop CC8464 and its backup compounds in certain areas, such as rare diseases and non-oral formulations. Astellas may opt-in to develop any of those alternative indications and formulations for additional fees, and Chromocell may exercise US co-promotion rights in certain instances.</p><p>"For us [the deal] is a big validation of the Chromovert platform. Now, for the first time, we have a big validation in the pharmaceutical field," Kopfli said.</p><p><b>Growing Nav1.7 Pipeline</b></p><p>Other recent transactions in the Nav1.7 space include Biogen's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogen-Idec-buys-analgesic-developer-Convergence-for-200m-356088" target="_new">purchase of UK-based</a>Convergence Pharmaceuticals in January for $200m up front and up to $475m in milestone fees. Convergence's lead drug candidate is the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/GSK-spin-out-Convergence-considers-all-options-after-positive-face-pain-data-352346" target="_new">Phase II selective Nav1.7 inhibitor CNV1014802</a>. The company was spun out of GlaxoSmithKline before its sale to Biogen.</p><p>Pfizer Inc. also has a Phase II Nav1.7 blocker, which it acquired in the 2011 purchase of Icagen for $56m and which it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizer-sells-Icagen-drug-discovery-not-compounds-359236" target="_new">retained when the Icagen drug discovery platform</a> was sold to XRpro Sciences for up to $11m in July.</p><p>The most advanced Nav1.7-targeting drug is TV-45070 from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which is in Phase IIb for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and Phase I/II for neuropathic pain in partnership with Xenon Pharmaceuticals. The topical drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-failure-impact-Xenons-other-programs-359215" target="_new">failed in a Phase IIb clinical trial</a> in mid-2015 for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.</p><p>Also, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Proteus SA and Roche each have Phase I Nav1.7-targeting drugs for neuropathic pain, anesthesia and other pain indications, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database.</p><p>Astellas has a lot of experience in pain drug development, mostly as a partner. The company is the development and commercial partner for Pfizer's <i>Celebrex</i> (celecoxib) in Japan, XenoPort's <i>Horizant</i> (gabapentin enacarbil) in Japan and other Asian territories, and <i>Qutenza</i> (capsaicin) from Acorda Therapeutics in the EU. </p><p>Astellas also is the lead developer for the oral 11-Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) inhibitor ASP3662, which is in Phase II for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and ASP8477, which is being developed outside of the US for neuropathic pain, according to the BioMedTracker database.</p><p><p><p><p>
