<p>Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 agonist product Saxenda (liraglutide) has won a recommendation for regulatory approval from the European Medicine Agency's CHMP for use in obesity. The drug, which is already marketed as Victoza at lower doses for diabetes, is not hampered by safety concerns that have hindered other anorectics, and is thought likely to perform well.</p><p>Saxenda will be available for obese adults with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater and overweight adults with a BMI of 27kg/m2 to <30kg 2="" who="" also="" have="" one="" or="" more="" weight-related="" complications,="" such="" as="" type="" 2="" diabetes,="" high="" blood="" pressure,="" high="" cholesterol="" or="" obstructive="" sleep="" apnea.="" the="" drug="" is="" recommended="" for="" use="" in="" addition="" to="" a="" reduced="" calorie="" diet="" and="" physical="" activity.="" patients="" should="" stop="" treatment="" with="" saxenda="" after="" 12="" weeks="" if="" they="" have="" not="" lost="" at="" least="" 5%="" of="" their="" body=""></30kg></p><p>The product's main benefit, according to the CHMP, is that it can achieve a clinically relevant weight loss. The most common side-effects are gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation.</p><p>Liraglutide's mechanism of action in obesity is not clearly understood, but the drug seems to regulate appetite by increasing feelings of fullness and satiety while reducing feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption. Liraglutide's availability for diabetes could prove an advantage as physicians may already be familiar with the product and its weight loss potential, says Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Christina Vasiliou.</p><p>Other central nervous system-acting obesity drugs, like the Orexigen's Mysimba (naltrexone/bupropion), Arena/ Eisai's Belviq (lorcaserin) and Vivus' phentermine/topiramate combination Qsymia have all had FDA approval, but in the EU they have faced complications. Mysimba (marketed by Takeda and Orexigen as Contrave in the US) is awaiting EC approval, but France and Ireland have questioned the CHMP's positive opinion (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/France-Ireland-oppose-Mysimba-EU-approval-on-safetyefficacy-grounds-355952" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 January</a>). Meanwhile, the CHMP has rejected Qsymia twice and Arena/Eisai withdrew its application for Belviq.</p><p>Saxenda is likely to compete well against Mysimba, assuming the EC rubber stamps the CHMP's positive opinion. "Saxenda's safety profile is clearly superior to that of Contrave. In the US it carries a black box warning because bupropion is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors," Ms Vasiliou points out. Contrave can also cause sleep disturbances, seizures, as well as have negative effects on blood pressure and heart rate, she adds.</p><p>GLP-1-based therapies may cause an increased heart rate and there have also been a small number of reports of acute pancreatitis, as well as gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder. These concerns will be closely monitored as part of the risk management plan for Saxenda. In addition, safety monitoring for Saxenda will also benefit from information that is collected for Victoza.</p><p><p>
