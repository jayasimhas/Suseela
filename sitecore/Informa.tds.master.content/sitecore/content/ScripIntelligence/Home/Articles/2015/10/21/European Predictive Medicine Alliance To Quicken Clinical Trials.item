<p><p>An alliance between pharma industry and academic researchers on developing modeling and simulation technology to conduct "in silico" computer-based clinical trials is expected to be launched in the first quarter of next year, says Adriano Henney, executive director of the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) Institute in Brussels, Belgium.</p><p><p>It's yet another push to try and reduce the cost and duration of clinical trials that are a significant drain on the R&D purse; another approach is technology heavyweight IBM Watson's development of cognitive computing to reduce the time spent recruiting patients into clinical trials.</p><p><p>The Avicenna Alliance &ndash; Association for Predictive Medicine - will work towards introducing the routine use of mathematical modeling and engineering concepts into drug discovery decisions, the design of devices, and the implementation of software, Henney said in a recent interview. If even a small part of a clinical trial is eventually replaced by in vitro modeling, the development process could become markedly quicker and less expensive, Henney added.</p><p><p>A two-year European Commission-funded project called the Avicenna Consortium ended last month with the online publication of a "roadmap" in which more than 500 participants worldwide provided input into how in silico clinical trials could be adopted more widely, and called for the setting up of the pre-competitive Avicenna Alliance to drive this process forward (Avicenna was a Persian philosopher and scientist who wrote one of the leading medical textbooks in medieval times).</p><p><p>The roadmap identifies a number of research challenges that will need funding from the European Commission and national research funding agencies, and calls for regulators to develop a regulatory framework so that the safety and efficacy of biomedical products can be evaluated using in silico clinical trial technologies. </p><p><p>"There is no regulatory framework for software, but at some point regulators are going to need to find out whether it is safe; currently they usually say the technology is not mature enough," Henney commented. However in the US, the FDA has suggested modeling simulation might need to be included in the regulatory process.</p><p><p>"Whilst clinical trials may tell us that a product is unsafe or ineffective, they rarely tell us why, or suggest how to improve it. As such a product that fails during clinical trials may simply be abandoned, even if a small modification would solve the problem. This results in an 'all-or-nothing' mind-set in the biomedical industry &#8230; that stifles innovation," the roadmap says. </p><p><p>Reliable computer models of a treatment's effects could be married with a patient's characteristics, allowing exploratory trials to be conducted in silico without exposing patients to potential harm, and potentially reducing the size and duration of clinical trials, the roadmap says.</p><p><h2>Using Cognitive Computing</h2><p><p>Shortening the duration of clinical trials is also one of the first health care applications of IBM&rsquo;s cognitive computing software, IBM Watson, that can analyse "big data" and learn from its findings. </p><p><p>The Dublin, Ireland-based CRO Icon PLC is piloting the system to speed patient recruitment in oncology trials, and COO Steve Cutler pointed out that this was one of the few areas still available for improvement in the clinical trial process.</p><p><p>"Patient recruitment, clinical site set-up and ethical review can take a long time, some trials can take up to 24 months to start up, and we need to improve efficiency in this area," Cutler noted. "If recruitment time was reduced, it would reduce costs and allow more trials, more shots on goal. So the technology is potentially disruptive and terribly exciting," he added.</p><p><p>The technology can interpret word, notes and phrases in electronic health records in order to match patients with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of clinical trials, and thereby doing away with physicians searching manually through patients' notes. For ICON, the system has been programmed to understand words and terms in four cancer areas, breast, rectal, lung and colon, and is being evaluated in around 25 clinical trial protocols.</p><p><p>Patients should also directly benefit by being involved more in clinical trials and having more opportunities for cutting-edge treatments and greater oversight of their condition; only around 5% of cancer patients currently take part in clinical trials, Cutler noted. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries has also decided to partner with IBM on using IBM Watson, in its case to help patients with complex chronic diseases like asthma, pain and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
