<p>A new acquisition by Roche in the field of liquid biopsy stands to bolster the company's anticancer R&D. Roche has expanded its presence in the space by buying CAPP Medical, a Palo Alto, California-based company that has developed technology for cancer screening and monitoring through the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. </p><p>As well as strengthening Roche's diagnostic offering, the deal could boost its pharma pipeline by providing "valuable clinical trial support" for cancer drugs in development, it said. </p><p>Liquid biopsies could be used as an alternative to tissue biopsy in patients too sick to undergo the invasive procedure, or where the tumor tissue is not easily accessible. The technology could also be valuable for monitoring cancer patients when the original tumor has already been removed, so cannot be sampled further.</p><p>There are two main liquid biopsy approaches: detecting ctDNA released by dead cancer cells into the bloodstream; or intact circulating tumor cells (CTCs), living cells shed by tumors into the circulation. Each has its own advantages: ctDNA is easier to detect than CTCs, but CTCs can provide more information, for example RNA and protein expression. </p><p>Roche already has a presence in the CTC space through a partnership with Swedish firm Liquid Biopsy, agreed in 2013. The company, which has now changed its name to iCellate, has developed an instrument to capture CTCs from the blood that relies on biomechanical characteristics rather than biomarkers. </p><p>One drawback with the biomarker approach, which uses antibodies to capture cells of interest, is that it only picks up certain types of CTCs and misses others. So-called filtration approaches, like iCellate's, are thought to be more promising. </p><p>But detecting ctDNA could be a simpler proposal, and Roche is keeping its options open with the acquisition of CAPP. </p><p>The firm was founded in 2013 by Stanford University scientists and "industry veterans." It has developed a method of analyzing ctDNA using next-generation DNA sequencing and bioinformatics "that allow for the detection of multiple mutations with a single assay," according to the company. Currently, CAPP's technology is approved for research use only, and not for clinical diagnostic procedures.</p><p>"Roche believes focused and high quality next generation sequencing (NGS) assays using simple blood draws have the potential to significantly advance the time of cancer diagnosis and change routine cancer diagnostic monitoring and may be highly cost effective compared to today's current standard of using PET and CT imaging to monitor tumor progression," said Roland Diggelmann COO of Roche Diagnostics.</p><p>The latest buy adds to Roche's purchase of Signature Diagnostics in February, giving it access to Signature's blood plasma and tissue biobanks which it uses to develop circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) tests for noninvasive cancer monitoring. </p><p>Other players in the liquid biopsy space include Johnson & Johnson, through its Janssen division, which has the only US FDA-approved CTC system, CellSearch; Biocept, which claims to be the only company with a clinical offering for both ctDNA and CTCs; Qiagen, which was already in the ctDNA space but got into the CTC arena in March through its acquisition of AdnaGen; UK firm Angle, which has developed the Parsortix system for detecting CTCs; and Inivata, which in September bagged &pound;4m ($6m) in investment from Johnson & Johnson to help develop its ctDNA technology. Another firm, Trovagene, is taking a different approach &ndash; while it has blood-based liquid biopsy technology, it is also developing a technique to measure ctDNA in urine.</p><p>And noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) specialist Natera is also getting in on the act: earlier this month, it raised $55.5m in a private financing round that will support existing products like its Panorama prenatal test, as well as development of non-invasive ctDNA-based tests for early detection and therapeutic monitoring in cancer. </p><p>Financial details of the Roche/CAPP transaction were not disclosed.</p><p>A version of this article was published in <a href="http://www.clinica.co.uk/" target="_new">Clinica Medtech Intelligence</a></p>
