<p>2014 was the "dawn of the next 150 years of Bayer," said CEO Dr Marjin Dekkers at the company's full year financial read out this week in Leverkusen. </p><p>And Bayer's annual results illustrated clearly that in its new dawn the company is preparing to make big changes. </p><p>The German drug maker reiterated plans to divest its remaining major chemical division (Material Science) in order to become "a pure life sciences company;" with 2014 results backing up the move (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dekkers-Size-does-matter-but-a-smaller-Bayer-can-compete-356958" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 26 February 2015</a>). Last year, Bayer Healthcare sales grew at 5.6%, from &euro;18.9bn in 2013 to &euro;19.97bn, while Bayer Material Science grew at just 3.7%. More importantly perhaps, even though Bayer managed to increase the operating profit of the Material Science division by 27%, polishing the goods ahead of the possible 2015 disposal, it was still just 4.8% of sales. </p><p>In contrast, its Healthcare division turned an operating profit of just under 18%. Margins in the prescription pharma business which represents about 60% of Healthcare sales (the rest is consumer pharmaceuticals) were even better. &euro;12bn in pharma sales produced operating profit of $2.37bn, a 19.7% margin. Consumer Pharma subdivision with sales of $8bn generated a 15.2% operating margin, over three times the rate of the Material Science division.</p><p>Bayer has forecast that core earnings will increase by more than 10% in 2015, credited to a boost from anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban) &ndash; one of its key growth products. Bayer said that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are set to grow by between 10% and 15% in 2015 based on the assumption of a positive currency effect of about 2%. </p><p>Significant growth in sales of the Xarelto and Eylea (aflibercept; licensed in Europe from Regeneron) boosted European sales 12.2 %, significantly higher than Bayer&rsquo;s growth in North America or Asia, and certainly against the general trend in European markets. Eylea sales alone grew around 130% from &euro;333m in 2013 to &euro;759m, contributing 25% of the year-on-year growth in Bayer's pharma sales.</p><h2>auf wiedersehen Brandicourt </h2><p>Meanwhile, Bayer's rejuvenation project will also see the introduction of a new team member. The panel of Bayer's leaders at the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Leverkusen was a man down from the same time last year, as Bayer Healthcare's CEO and chair Olivier Brandicourt did not attend the event following the recent announcement he is leaving the firm to head up big pharma competitor Sanofi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-official-Bayers-Brandicourt-is-Sanofis-new-CEO-356855" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 20 February 2015</a>). </p><p>He was replaced at the top table by soon-to-be Healthcare chief Werner Baumann, who will take over when Dr Brandicourt leaves the company officially on 2 April this year. Mr Baumann has been with Bayer since 2002, serving as head of central administration and organization then chief financial officer before joining the management board at the start of 2010.</p><p>Dr Dekkers said though Bayer had been "very pleased" to recruit Dr Brandicourt just 15 months ago to lead its Healthcare business, an opportunity like the one he has been offered "doesn't come around every day." Bayer's chief said he was sad to see Dr Brandicourt leave and offered his congratulations. </p><p>However, he noted that while Dr Brandicourt had "influenced our thinking and made contributions" he had only been there a "short time to make significant differences."</p><p>When asked about his opinion on Dr Brandicourt's &euro;4m "golden handshake" from Sanofi &ndash; an action which has angered members of the French government &ndash; Dr Dekkers simply said "it is correct"; offering no further comment on the matter (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-reveals-Brandicourts-pay-deal-356920" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 24 February 2015</a>). </p><h2>Dekkers succession plans</h2><p>Dr Dekkers will be stepping down as CEO of Bayer in 2017 and was asked multiple times during the company's full year results presentation if he had any idea of a successor; with some suggesting Mr Baumann could be a shoo-in for the role. However Dr Dekkers replied that it was not the time to speculate. "I'm still around for two more years if you don't mind," he said. Bayer's chief added that he has a lot more to do at the company, including "maximizing innovation and fully integrating the consumer health business Bayer acquired in 2014 from Merck & Co."</p><h2>No more M&A planned</h2><p>Bayer did not comment specifically on any M&A activities for the coming year but chief financial officer Johannes Dietsch said the company would be focusing on reducing its debt. He said acquiring new businesses was not a priority at this time, but that if an "excellent opportunity" came about the company would still be in a position to secure financing. </p><p>Dr Dekkers added that while "biogenerics is a wonderful field, it is not one Bayer is interested in getting in to." Peer companies, such as Pfizer, have made actions towards this route recently. The US drug maker acquired Hospira for $17bn earlier this year for its biosimilar portfolio (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wheres-the-value-in-Pfizers-17bn-Hospira-buy-356578" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 February 2015</a>). </p><p>
