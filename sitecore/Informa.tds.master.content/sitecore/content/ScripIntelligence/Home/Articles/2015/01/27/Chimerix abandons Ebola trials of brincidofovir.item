<p>Shares of Chimerix took a 4% hit in after-hours trading on 30 January after the company revealed it was abandoning its participation in all current and future trials of brincidofovir as a treatment for Ebola &ndash; blaming it on the drop in case counts in recent weeks in Liberia. </p><p>The company emphasized the decision would not affect its research and development programs of brincidofovir in cytomegalovirus and adenovirus infection &ndash; with the pivotal studies in those indications remaining ongoing. </p><p>But Chimerix is bailing from a study testing the effectiveness of brincidofovir in Ebola that recently got underway in Liberia, which is being conducted by investigators at the University of Oxford and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, with operational support from Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Africa-trials-underway-testing-Chimerix-Fujifilm-Ebola-drugs-355963" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/West-Africa-Ebola-trials-to-test-brincidofovir-favipiravir-355056" target="_new">13 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The company said over the last several weeks, the number of new cases of confirmed Ebola in Liberia had decreased significantly, with only a handful of patients enrolled by late January in the single-arm study.</p><p>The firm also is dropping a supportive Phase II study of brincidofovir, known as study 205, which Chimerix first announced this past October (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-drugs-vaccines-advance-US-frets-354531" target="_new">17 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Brincidofovir, a nucleotide analogue lipid-conjugate, burst onto the Ebola scene in a big way on 6 October 2014 after the FDA cleared it for use in the first patient ever diagnosed with the virus inside US borders, Thomas Eric Duncan (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gambling-on-Ebola-1st-US-case-sparks-stock-fervor-354228" target="_new">01 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Duncan, however, received the drug too late in his disease and died of Ebola on 8 October 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">09 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Brincidofovir has been used on an emergency basis in Ebola-infected patients, including Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance journalist who was in Liberia working as a cameraman for NBC News when he became ill with the virus, and Dr Craig Spencer, who was the first person to be diagnosed with the virus in the US after returning from West Africa.
