<p>Three French biotechs have announced initial public offering updates this week, with one investor dubbing France one of the top places for biotech IPOs. </p><p>Leading the pack is Cerenis Therapeutics, a Sofinnova portfolio company, which has raised &euro;53.4m ($58.6m) through its IPO on Euronext Paris to fund development of its cholesterol lowering drug, CER-001. </p><p>On the basis of nearly 17.8 million shares to be traded at &euro;12.70 per share, Cerenis' market capitalization will sit at around &euro;226m. The company will begin trading on 30 March under the symbol CEREN. </p><p>Denis Lucquin, a managing partner at Sofinnova and a member of Cerenis's board of directors, said the company would not have been able to raise this amount through private investment and an IPO was its first choice for financing. He told <i>Scrip</i> that Cerenis's decision to list in Paris was because he considers France to be the second best place in the world for biotech public investment, after the US.</p><p>"There are US investors on the Cerenis board who first suggested a US IPO, but one critical element for the decision to list in Paris was the amount of money Cerenis needed to raise. The company was seeking &euro;50-55m. You go to exchanges like Nasdaq for higher figures, around &euro;80m plus." He added that it was "also much easier for us to go public in France".</p><p>In 2014, 15 biotech companies listed in France, and already this year four companies have gone public in the country. </p><p>"Though the market in France is fragile there is enough investor interest to get financial backing for biotech companies," Mr Lucquin said. </p><p>He drew comparisons between Cerenis and another of Sofinnova's portfolio companies, DBV Technologies, which also first listed in France before also listing on Nasdaq. "This is the perfect path for Cerenis," Mr Lucquin said. He added that the French IPO was an interim step for Cerenis. "In two to three years' time we may consider something bigger &ndash; again much like the path taken by DBV technologies."</p><p>Founded in 2005, Cerenis &ndash; which is based near Toulouse &ndash; is developing CER-001, a HDL or high-density lipoprotein. </p><p>Early last year, Cerenis struggled in Phase II testing when CER-001 failed to meet its primary endpoint of plaque regression in the CHI-SQUARE study. However, Cerenis said the CHI-SQUARE study provided safety data for a range of doses and had helped identify the optimal dose for treatment. </p><p>The compound is now being tested in a second-stage Phase II clinical trial to evaluate its effect on the atherosclerotic plaque burden in post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. "In the second stage, Cerenis hopes to confirm the number of doses to administer to post-ACS patients based on the main lessons drawn from long-term studies (SAMBA and MODE) already performed," the company said. </p><p>CER-001 is also currently being tested in a Phase III trial, evaluating its effect on the atherosclerotic plaque burden in patients with primary and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia (FPHA). Cerenis plans to seek approval in this narrow, targeted indication first to accelerate the process. It will then seek approval in the much broader ACS indication. </p><p>Mr Lucquin described the company's program as "ambitious" and said investors had high expectations for its development in both areas. </p><h2>Other European IPO updates</h2><p>Two other French companies have also announced updates on their debut public offerings.</p><p>Cellectis opened for trading on Nasdaq on 25 March at $41.50 per share. The gene-editing company increased the amount it wanted to raise via an IPO by 70% to $197m earlier this week, based on the strength of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) programs. The company is offering 4.75 million shares; it had previously filed to offer just 3.5 million when it was trading at $36.83 per share. Cellectis has listed on Nasdaq under the symbol CLLS.</p><p>Last summer big pharma <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cellectis-soars-as-Pfizer-fronts-80m-for-immuno-oncology-352405" target="_new">Pfizer fronted $80m</a> for access to Cellectis's CAR-T platform. At that time, Pfizer also agreed to buy a 10% stake in Cellectis through the purchase of newly issued shares at &euro;9.25 per share. </p><p>Also this week, cancer immunotherapy firm OSE Pharma completed an IPO on Euronext Paris, which was 3.6 times over-subscribed. OSE launched its shares at the top end of the price range, &euro;10.80, raising &euro;57.9m to finance late-stage trials of its Tedopi (OSE-2101) vaccine for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tedopi has already been tested in a Phase II study in patients with NSCLC and is set to undergo Phase III trials in the second half of next year. The company also aims to develop the drug for ovarian, colon or breast cancer. It has yet to decide which of those applications to focus on first but plans to begin a Phase II trial by the end of the year. The company's shares will commence trading on 30 March.</p><h2>Meanwhile in the UK</h2><p>RedX Pharma, a Manchester-based drug discovery and development company focused on anti-infectives has priced its IPO. The company plans to raise &pound;15m through the placement of 17,647,059 new ordinary shares of 1p each in the company at a price of 85p per share. At the placing price, RedX's market cap will be approximately &pound;55.2m. Shares in RedX will begin trading on AIM on 27 March 2015 with the ticker REDX. </p><p>RedX announced its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/RedX-Pharma-set-for-IPO-356085" target="_new">IPO plans</a> in January this year. At that time, CEO Dr Neal Murray told <i>Scrip</i> "The board has been discussing options over the last 12 months and we feel that the time is right to access the public markets&#8230;and we think that the AIM market is the best market for the company at its current stage of development."</p><p>
