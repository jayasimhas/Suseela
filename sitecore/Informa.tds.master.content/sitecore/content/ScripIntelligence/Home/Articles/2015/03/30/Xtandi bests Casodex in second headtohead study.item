<p><p>Medivation and Astellas announced a 19-month progression-free survival for Xtandi (enzalutamide) compared with 5.7 months for Casodex (bicalutamide) in patients with non-metastatic or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer &ndash; reinforcing the drug's strong profile over competitors. </p><p>The oncology partners announced topline results to the Phase II STRIVE trial on 02 April that showed Xtandi provided a longer duration of disease control in prostate cancer patients. </p><p>The trial results bolster the positive data seen in the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/New-Xtandi-data-bolster-case-for-pre-chemo-use-356312" target="_new">earlier TERRAIN trial</a>, which was reported in January and showed that Xtandi increased progression-free survival (PFS) by 10 months compared with five months for Casodex in a head-to-head comparison of the androgen receptor inhibitors in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</p><p>"The longer PFS in STRIVE vs. TERRAIN is expected, given that STRIVE included both M0 and M1 (both</p><p>non-metastatic and metastatic) patients (n=396, all US), while TERRAIN included only M1 (metastatic CRPC) patients (n=375, North America/EU)," wrote RBC Capital markets analyst Simos Simeonidis in a 02 April note to investors. </p><p>Patients in the STRIVE trial had a median treatment time of 14.7 months on Xtandi versus 8.4 months in the Casodex group. Serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate in both treatment arms; grade 3 or higher cardiac adverse events occurred in 5.1% of Xtandi patients compared to 4.0% of Casodex patients, while one patient on Xtandi reported a seizure. The side effect profile was similar to what was seen in previous trials. </p><p>Additional data from STRIVE, including secondary endpoints and further safety data, will be reported at upcoming medical conferences. </p><p>"The data are positive and very consistent with the TERRAIN data and confirm the drug&rsquo;s good activity and safety," added Simeonidis. "We believe these data will help the drug get additional penetration in the pre-chemo setting, where we believe it will have the upper hand over Zytiga, mainly due to convenience."</p><p>Simeonidis projects that Xtandi could reach peak sales of $9bn by 2026 and could play a dominant role in the market should Phase III trials show that the drug is effective in earlier stages of the disease. He also notes that physicians could prefer to use Xtandi over Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster cancer drug Zytiga (abiraterone) because the latter requires the use of steroids as well. </p><p>J&J reported in January that sales of Zytiga were $2bn for the full-year 2014, meanwhile Medivation reported 2014 sales of $1.6 billion for Xtandi. </p><p><p>
