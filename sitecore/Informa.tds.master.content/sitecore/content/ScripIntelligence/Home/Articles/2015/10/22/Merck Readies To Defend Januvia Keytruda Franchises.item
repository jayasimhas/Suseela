<p><p>Merck & Co. Inc. is relying heavily on its diabetes and immuno-oncology franchises, but the big pharma is facing new competitive threats in those areas that will require the company to defend its leadership positions. </p><p>The New Jersey-based pharma giant had a strong third quarter that beat analysts' bottom-line expectations, bolstered by sales of its diabetes drug <i>Januvia </i>(sitagliptin) and its cancer immunotherapy <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab), which both exceeded consensus expectations. The Januvia franchise was up 10% year-over-year to bring in $1.6bn and ranks as Merck's best-selling drug. The PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda has been doing well in melanoma and recently garnered an approval in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Keytruda brought in $160m for the quarter, up 45% from the previous quarter. </p><p>"We have been investing our resources to grow our strongest brands and to support the most promising assets in our pipeline while at the same time lowering our overall cost base and delivering a leveraged P&L. We restored the Januvia franchise to growth. We established an oncology business unit and accelerated the development of Keytruda, which was the first anti-PD-1 to market in the US," Merck CEO Ken Frazier said during the Oct. 27 call quarterly call. </p><p>The company relies heavily on these two franchises; one is an older drug in a crowded market, while the other is a highly-touted innovative therapy with only one direct competitor (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&rsquo;s <i>Opdivo</i>) but plenty more in the pipeline. </p><p>Yet both Januvia and Keytruda face plenty of challenges. Januvia is the leader in the DPP-4 class and has been on the market for almost a decade, but is facing increased competitive pressure from newer classes of diabetes drugs. </p><p>First Januvia was threatened by the GLP-1 class, but as injectables, the drugs were never able to displace the oral blockbuster. Then came the SGLT2 class that started flooding the market when Johnson & Johnson introduced <i>Invokana</i> (canagliflozin) in 2013. Several other companies have introduced SGLT2s in the last two years and the class has taken off in a way that analysts hadn't predicted prior to their launch. </p><p>Increasing competition isn't the only pressure from these drugs. Results from a cardiovascular outcomes study for Eli Lilly & Co.'s SGLT2 inhibitor <i>Jardiance</i> (empagliflozin) showed cardiovascular benefit for the drug. The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cardiovascular-Data-To-Propel-Jardiance-Ahead-Of-Rivals-360626" target="_new">EMPA-REG data</a> was a landmark in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is expected to lead to quick uptake of the drug. It's not yet known if this will be a class-wide effect, but it likely isn't good for Merck.</p><p>"If you look at Januvia, we continue to be pleased with the underlying demand in the US where we're seeing about 4% [total prescription] volume growth. And that's been consistent since before EMPA-REG and after EMPA-REG," said Merck's EVP and President of Global Human Health Adam Schechter. "If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace, we see switching that's occurring within the SGLT2 class, but we do not see switching occurring across classes at this point in time."</p><p>In the meantime, Merck is currently developing an SGLT2 inhibitor of its own. Ertugliflozin (MK-8835), being developed with Pfizer Inc., is in Phase III. </p><p><b>Keytruda Uptake In Lung Cancer Dependent On Testing</b></p><p>As for Keytruda, it's made a splash in melanoma since becoming the first PD-1 inhibitor to hit the market and currently has 70% share of the PD-1 market in the indication, but Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) garnered approval in lung cancer first and is expected to be the market leader in this space. Lung cancer is the largest indication for these drugs and has the potential to be a $4bn market for each of them. </p><p>Keytruda received FDA approval for NSCLC at the beginning of the month; the indication is limited to patients with high expression of the PD-L1 biomarker, as determined by a companion diagnostic. Bristol has a companion diagnostic as well, but it is approved for all-comers. </p><p>"We think that lung cancer is a very significant opportunity for Keytruda and we think there is room for multiple products with Keytruda and Opdivo in that market. If you look, we're still early in the launch but we're encouraged by customer feedback and just days after the approval, we got to 100% of our top 150 accounts, and we had over 5,500 customer interactions. And we're confident that the uptake will be good over time as customers build in PD-L1 testing as a common practice," Merck Research Laboratories' President Roger Perlmutter told the call. </p><p>Merck is relying on testing for the PD-L1 marker to become commonplace. Currently, this sort of testing isn't always done, but the excitement surrounding the PD-1 inhibitors could drive physicians to use these tests more. </p><p>"We actually had the companion diagnostic available and accessible for patient sampling day one at the time of launch. So it allows the physicians to really have a different conversation with patients depending on their PD-L1 expression. And I think that's important when you start to see the differences between low PD-L1 expressers and high PD-L1 expressers. It allows physicians to have better conversations," added Perlmutter. </p><p>Merck has already begun registration enabling studies for Keytruda in another 10 tumor types and is exploring the drug in 20 additional cancers.</p><p><p>
