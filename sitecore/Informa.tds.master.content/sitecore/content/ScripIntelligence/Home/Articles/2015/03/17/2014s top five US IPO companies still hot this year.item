<p> Three of the top five drug development firms that completed initial public offerings in the US in 2014 are focused on chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, but all five of the highest-grossing IPO players last year have one thing in common: later-stage assets for the treatment of high-value indications, like cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS) and anemia. </p> <p> <i>Scrip</i> considered several ways to determine the top five biotech IPOs of 2014 &ndash; Juno Therapeutics, Forward Pharma, FibroGen, Bellicum Pharmaceuticals and Kite Pharma &ndash; and settled on total gross proceeds from the companies' first-time offerings. The amount of capital raised seems to best reflect investor interest in the therapeutics developers, considering each company was among the top 20 most frequently traded stocks for newly public biotech firms last year, even though Juno and Bellicum didn't launch their IPOs until December. </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/Volume_2014_Mandy_249351a.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="-/media/590A111802AB4D61A87F54BEA502B883.ashx"></a> </p> <p> <i>Credit: John Hodgson, Scrip Intelligence</i> </p> <p> Investors clearly were bullish about biotech last year given the fact that 72 companies developing drugs, biologics, gene or cell therapies and other medicines grossed $5.7bn from first-time offerings in 2014, including 16 companies that raised more than $100m each (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-72-US-IPOs-gross-5.7bn-in-2014-values-rising-in-2015-357399">20 March 2015</a>). The average stock value for the biotech IPO class of 2014 outperformed both broad stock indices and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) last year and so far in 2015. </p> <p> <b>No. 1: Juno Therapeutics</b> </p> <p> Juno's IPO exemplified the tremendous excitement for CAR-T therapies, which have shown high remission rates in early-stage blood cancer studies, driving extreme investor enthusiasm for companies in the field (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-CAR-T-cell-therapies-generate-buzz-355536">10 December 2014</a>). While the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapies still are being established, a risk that is well understood &ndash; at least by Juno investors &ndash; is that it will take a lot of money to fund clinical development in this area. </p> <p> Seattle, Washington-based Juno ultimately grossed $304.8m from its 19 December IPO, including shares set aside for overallotments, after the company raised more than $300m in venture capital in less than a year (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-Update-Juno-has-biggest-2014-offering-as-investors-chase-CAR-T-stocks-355776">21 December 2014</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Junos-134m-Series-B-more-than-3-VC-deals-combined-353228">7 August 2014</a>). Juno's offering went to market at $24 per share &ndash; the highest biotech IPO price of 2014 &ndash; and its stock ended the year up 117.6% at $52.22, crossing the $60 threshold in mid-March. </p> <p> Juno closed at $61.53 on 20 March after the company said in its recent year-end financial report that it would spend $125m to $150m this year out of the $474.1m in cash it had at the end of 2014. The capital will finance ongoing Phase I and I/II clinical trials for a CAR-T therapy directed against CD19 in leukemia and lymphoma, and for a T-cell receptor (TCR) therapy targeting WT-1 in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. </p> <p> <b>No. 2: Forward Pharma</b> </p> <p> Forward Pharma grossed $235.2m from its 15 October IPO priced at $21 per share (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-TABLE-Biotech-slides-even-after-strong-offerings-354592">22 October 2014</a>). Investors responded well to the Danish company's one and only clinical-stage product: a delayed-release formulation of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), the main ingredient in Biogen Idec's successful oral MS drug Tecfidera, which generated $2.9bn in 2014 sales. </p> <p> Forward sued Biogen in November for patent infringement in Germany (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EU-tables-cautionary-measures-for-Tecfidera-and-CorlentorProcoralan-355240">24 November 2014</a>). The company allocated $102m of its IPO proceeds for Phase III clinical trials to evaluate FP187 in the treatment of relapsing and remitting MS as well as psoriasis. Another $25m was set aside to enforce Forward's DMF patents. </p> <p> With few updates since October on the company's clinical trial progress and its aggressive intellectual property protection strategy, Forward's stock closed 0.8% below its IPO price at $20.83 at the end of 2014, but gained 16.1% between 31 December and 16 March to close at $24.18. </p> <p> <b>No. 3: FibroGen</b> </p> <p> FibroGen's lead development program is roxadustat for anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is under evaluation in an 8,000-patient, global Phase III development program that is fully funded by partners Astellas and AstraZeneca through more than $2.5bn in upfront and pre-approval payments plus research funding and post-approval fees and royalties. Roxadustat is an oral small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PH). </p> <p> With big pharma-backing for its most advanced clinical asset, San Francisco-based FibroGen will use its $167.7m in gross IPO proceeds for the development of FG-3019, a mid-stage monoclonal antibody that inhibits connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is involved in the progression of fibrosis. The company has completed Phase II studies for FG-3019 in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pancreatic cancer. </p> <p> FibroGen priced its IPO at $18 per share on 13 November and the stock gained 51.9% to reach $27.34 by the end of 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-NeuroDerms-CEO-felt-well-received-but-FibroGen-soared-355081">15 November 2014</a>). The share price inched another 6.7% higher as of 16 March at $29.18. Updates on the company's clinical programs are expected on 26 March when FibroGen releases its 2014 financial report. </p> <p> <b>No. 4: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals</b> </p> <p> While its competitors and fellow top-fivers Juno and Kite are still in early-stage clinical development with their CAR-T therapies, Houston, Texas-based Bellicum is in preclinical development with its CAR-T programs. However, the company also is developing BPX-501, an off-switch for the still-novel therapies that is in Phase I/II testing as a means for the inactivation of CAR-T cells in the event of intolerable side effects (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-First-trial-for-Bellicums-CAR-T-cell-safety-switch-deals-trials-financings-350826">24 March 2014</a>). </p> <p> Bellicum also has a dendritic cell vaccine called BPX-201 in Phase I for prostate cancer and the company hopes to advance at least one of its CAR-T and TCR product candidates into the clinic before the end of 2015. The programs will be financed with Bellicum's $191.6m in cash as of 31 December, including $160.6m in gross proceeds from its 18 December IPO at $19 per share (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-Update-Juno-has-biggest-2014-offering-as-investors-chase-CAR-T-stocks-355776">21 December 2014</a>). </p> <p> Bellicum gained 21.3% versus its IPO price to end 2014 at $23.04 and the stock rose another 7.4% to $24.75 as of 16 March. </p> <p> <b>No. 5: Kite Pharma</b> </p> <p> Kite Pharma was the fifth highest-grossing IPO, but it had the highest stock price of any therapeutics developer that went public in 2014 at the end of last year. The CAR-T developer's stock more than tripled its 19 June IPO price of $17 to end 2014 at $57.67 and the stock grew another 7.9% to $62.20 by 16 March (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Kite-IPO-catches-strong-breeze-plus-Endocyte-Merrimack-Aastrom-Nektar-Horizon-Acorda-Ariad-352463">22 June 2014</a>). </p> <p> Santa Monica, California-based Kite grossed $146.6m from its IPO in June and $218.4m from a secondary offering that closed in early January, including shares set aside for overallotments in both offerings (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Agios-Kite-raise-cash-on-ASH-buzz-plus-5-other-public-offerings-355644">15 December 2014</a>). The funds will pay for ongoing early-stage clinical trials as well as a set of pivotal trials that are expected to begin this year for the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia with its CD19-directed CAR-T therapy. </p> <p> Kite has been in dealmaking mode since its IPO, including a pact with Amgen to develop CAR-T therapies with Kite's technology and Amgen's targets. The deal is worth $60m upfront for Kite plus cash for certain development costs and up to $525m in milestone fees for each program that Amgen chooses to license, although Kite will pay the same milestone fees to Amgen for each program that it takes forward on its own (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-hangs-on-to-Kite-in-CAR-T-race-355933">5 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> The company also has expanded its existing development partnership with the National Cancer Institute for development and clinical research of CAR-T therapies, and Kite has signed deals to improve its manufacturing capabilities in the US and Europe (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Targacept-gone-in-reverse-merger-with-Catalyst-plus-five-other-deals-357095">6 March 2015</a>). </p> <p> <b>Bottom five IPOs</b> </p> <p> The combined $116.1m in gross proceeds for the bottom five IPOs of 2014 was less than what Kite raised in its first-time offering, but the companies' performance showed that not every drug developer soared during a robust year with high investor interest in the biotech sector. </p> <p> Bio Blast priced at $11 per share on 31 July to gross $35.2m and its stock has traded between $9.79 and $4.53 since then, closing at $6.64 on 16 March. But while Minerva Neurosciences went to market at $6 per share to gross $33.6m on 30 June, its stock &ndash; unfortunately for the company &ndash; hasn't experienced wild swings; it closed at $6.02 on 31 December and $5.95 on 16 March. </p> <p> Ruthigen priced at $7.25 per share to gross $20.3m on 21 March of last year and its stock was cut in half to $3.50 by the end of 2014, but rebounded to $4.33 as of mid-March of this year. However, GlobeImmune went to market at $10 per share to raise $15m on 2 July and its stock dropped to $7.59 as of 31 December and $6.42 on 16 March. </p> <p> Last, but not least, Aldeyra Therapeutics grossed just $12m from its 2 May IPO at $8 per share, yet the company's stock has been on the rise recently. The share price fell 9.8% to $7.22 at the end of 2014, but increased 58.7% since 31 December to $11.46 on 16 March. The Lexington, Massachusetts-based company raised nearly $10m in two private placements since its IPO and advanced its lead drug candidate NS2 toward clinical development in two indications. </p> <p> <b>2015 IPO prospects</b> </p> <p> Only eight therapeutics companies have completed IPOs so far in 2015 versus 26 in the first three months of 2014, and the market for first-time biotech offerings slowed last year from 41 in the first half to 31 in the second half, which may have been the first sign of a slowdown for the industry. </p> <p> The IPO-tracking firm Renaissance Capital warned of a biotech bubble in February based on the volume of pre-revenue companies that went public in 2014, but noted that the sector's offerings have slowed substantially this year (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Are-investors-cooling-to-new-biotech-offerings-356882">23 February 2015</a>). </p> <p> However, the pace of filings for new IPOs picked up recently with registrations from Par Pharmaceutical, Cidara Therapeutics, KemPharm and Aduro Biotech during the past two weeks (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Par-files-for-IPO-357320">16 March</a>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cidara-plans-IPO-to-fund-antifungal-pipeline-357313">16 March</a>, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/KemPharm-seeks-58m-via-IPO-357258">12 March</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Aduro-launching-IPO-357257">12 March 2015</a>). </p>
