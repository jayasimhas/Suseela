<p>A nearly 20% drop in US sales of Sanofi's top-seller <i>Lantus</i> was largely to blame for a 6.6% fall in its diabetes franchise sales in the third quarter, leading the French pharma to lower its forecasts for its leading therapy segment. </p><p>The announcement during its third quarter results presentation wiped nearly 5% off Sanofi's share price, which was down to around &euro;88.92 in trading on Oct. 29, but recovered later in the day. </p><p>The French pharma giant now projects its global diabetes sales to decline at an average annualized rate of between 4% and 8% between 2015 and 2018, as Lantus (insulin glargine) succumbs to biosimilar competition amid changing diabetes market dynamics. This compares with a largely flat or slightly growing outlook for the diabetes franchise over this timeframe previously forecast by the company.</p><p>It is not just the basal insulin blockbuster that is feeling the pressure. About half of this revision is related to reduced expectations for the inhaled insulin product <i>Afrezza</i>, the GLP1 agonist <i>Lyxumia</i> (lixisenatide) and in blood glucose monitoring. Sanofi said that by 2018 it would be able mitigate the impact of this revised sales expectation on its business operating income but it was thin on further details ahead of its mid-term strategic and financial outlook presentation scheduled for Nov. 6 in Paris. </p><p>Overall group sales in Q3 were up by 3.4% to &euro;9.6bn and pharmaceutical sales increased 2.6% to &euro;7.3bn, both driven by the Genzyme unit, whose sales grew by 33% to &euro;923m in the quarter (&euro;2.65bn year to date) on the back of strong momentum in multiple sclerosis with <i>Aubagio</i> and <i>Lemtrada</i>. Pharmaceutical sales for 2015 so far were &euro;22.5bn, up 2.8%. Sanofi reaffirmed that it expected 2015 Business EPS to remain stable or even grow slightly at CER versus 2014.</p><h2>Diabetes Debacle</h2><p>Third quarter sales for the entire diabetes division worldwide came in at &euro;1,852m, down 6.6%, with Lantus sales of &euro;1,561m, down by 10.8%. US sales of Lantus dropped more sharply by 19.6% to &euro;997m, which the firm said was mainly due to a slowdown of basal insulin market growth, continued higher discounts on Lantus as compared with last year and an unfavorable mix effect towards government channels such as Medicaid.</p><p>Outside the US, diabetes sales were healthier, up by 8.1% at &euro;777m in the third quarter, but this was owing to a strong performance in the emerging markets (&euro;373m, up 15.5%) as sales in in Western Europe merely stabilized (&euro;296m, down 0.3%); Sanofi attributed this squarely to the entry of glargine biosimilar competition there. Rival Lilly launched its Lantus biosimilar in several EU markets in the third quarter (including Germany, UK, Netherlands, and Denmark) as well as in Japan. Moreover, Sanofi management admitted that there could be three further biosimilars approaching the market (analysts at Bernstein say one is due from Merck & Co. with a US filing due in the next few months).</p><p>In September, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-Lilly-Settlement-Paves-Way-For-Biosimilar-Lantus-360713" target="_new">Sanofi resolved a US patent infringement lawsuit</a> regarding Lilly's pursuit of regulatory approval for a product that would compete with Lantus SoloSTAR. As part of the agreement, Lilly and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH can launch the product named <i>Basaglar</i> on Dec. 15, 2016. Lilly will pay Sanofi royalties, though the details of the agreement were not disclosed.</p><p>Analysts at Berenberg said that given the profitability of the diabetes franchise, the revised forecast "is concerning for the medium-term earnings prospects of the group" as a whole. Pending further details on Sanofi's "mitigation" plan, they fear earnings in 2016 and 2017 may suffer. "We estimate that a &euro;2bn downgrade to sales of high-margin diabetes products could cut our 2018 earnings estimate by as much as 10%."</p><p>Moreover, the diabetes franchise situation looks set to get considerably worse almost immediately. The analysts point out that the nearly &euro;1.9bn diabetes sales in Q3 were weak, at 4% below their estimates, and they continued: "Full-year diabetes sales are now expected to decline by 6-7% at CER. With the franchise down by 4.5% year-to-date at the nine-month point, this implies a significantly accelerated downturn in Q4."</p><p>Revenues from Afrezza and Lyxumia were meagre. Afrezza sales were &euro;2m and &euro;5m in the third quarter and the first nine months, respectively, while Lyxumia had sales of &euro;9m (+25%) in the quarter and &euro;27m for the year to date (+42%). The GLP1 agonist has now been accepted for review by the US FDA, and does holds further promise as part of a combination with Lantus, dubbed LixiLan, which met its primary endpoint in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofis-LixiLan-Succeeds-In-Second-Pivotal-Trial-But-Benefit-Still-Uncertain-360468" target="_new">a second Phase III trial in type 2 patients</a> recently. A US filing for LixiLan is slated by the end of the year, with an EU filing due in the first quarter of 2016.</p><p>The next-generation basal insulin <i>Toujeo</i> was the only real bright spot for the franchise, making a better debut than some had expected. This product, which is burdened with the task of off-setting falling Lantus revenues, was launched in the US in late March, and Sanofi said it was encouraged by its performance in its first two full quarters on the market. "The product is trending favorably compared to diabetes analogue launches and now captures around 14% of IMS basal market new-to-brand prescriptions in the US." Total Toujeo sales of the product reached &euro;46m in the third quarter compared to &euro;13m in the second. In the first nine months, Toujeo sales were &euro;66m. Eventually, Sanofi says Toujeo should capture 15-20% of the basal insulin market. </p><h2>Praluent Performance</h2><p>Another key new launch was the cholesterol-lowering drug <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab, in collaboration with Regeneron), approved in the US in July and EU in September, and CEO Olivier Brandicourt admitted it too had got off to a slow start with sales of &euro;4m for the quarter. Nevertheless, he was adamant that its initial performance does not represent the underlying demand for the product. </p><p>There is under-reporting from some specialty pharmacies, he said during the Q&A session of the results call, and prescriptions for patients in assistance programs and bridging programs awaiting insurance coverage are not being captured in IMS data. "The task is to get coverage for these patients and future patients," and based on Express Scripts' decision to add Praluent in a branded preferred Tier 2 formulary position, he was optimistic for two further PBMs' responses to the product. </p><p>
