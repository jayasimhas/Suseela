<p>Scientists are building a theory that may account for GlaxoSmithKline's Pandemrix flu vaccine's association with narcolepsy during the 2009-10 swine flu A(H1N1) pandemic. The findings published in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> may help prevent similar problems with future vaccines. </p><p>Pandemrix was given to high-risk groups at the height of the pandemic, including children and those with asthma, diabetes and heart disease; in all around 30 million people across Europe received the jab before it was withdrawn. As the vaccine was made specifically for the H1N1 strain it differed from the normal seasonal flu vaccine, which has not been linked to narcolepsy. </p><p>During the swine flu pandemic, narcolepsy was also seen in some patients who were infected with the swine flu strain, but very few cases were reported in those who received Novartis's differently manufactured adjuvanted pandemic flu vaccine, Focetria. </p><p>The researchers hypothesized that differences between the two vaccines (both made from inactivated influenza flu viral proteins) may account for the problem. Narcolepsy, they explain, is linked to dysregulation of the hypocretin ligand-hypocretin receptor pathway, and part of the extracellular domain of the hypocretin receptor 2 closely mimics part of the surface-exposed region of the influenza nucleoprotein. </p><p>Further testing showed that sera from a significant proportion of patients with vaccine-associated narcolepsy contained antibodies to the hypocretin receptor 2 compared with non-narcoleptic patients who either had had swine flu or who had received Focetria. Moreover, antibodies from vaccine-associated narcolepsy sera cross-reacted with both influenza nucleoprotein and hypocretin receptor 2 on cell lines expressing human hypocretin receptor 2. </p><p>This compared with Focetria-vaccinated non-narcoleptic patients where no durable antibody responses were seen to the nucleoprotein. Mass spectrometry also showed Focetria contained 72.7% less influenza nucleoprotein than Pandemrix, the researchers said. "Thus, differences in vaccine nucleoprotein content and respective immune response may explain the narcolepsy association with Pandemrix," <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/294/294ra105" target="_new">they concluded</a>. </p><p>The research builds on that reported in the same journal <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSKs-Pandemrix-problems-rumble-on-350356" target="_new">in December 2013</a> by an expert commissioned by GSK to examine the potential link, which pinpointed the hypocretin mimicry as a potential mechanism. </p><p>In response to the latest findings, GSK said it was reviewing the paper carefully. "We are actively conducting research into the observed association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy and the interaction this vaccine might have had with other risk factors in those affected. We're also continuing to support ongoing work from other experts and organizations investigating reported cases of this condition and we hope these efforts will enable us to provide more answers in the future."</p><p><p>
