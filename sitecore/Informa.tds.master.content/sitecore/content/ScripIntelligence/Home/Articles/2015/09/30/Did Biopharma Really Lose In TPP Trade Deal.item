<p>After more than six years of intense efforts to lobby a group of Asia-Pacific trade ministers &ndash; a pact that eventually involved representatives from 12 nations &ndash; the innovator biopharmaceutical industry failed to get what it most wanted in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): 12 years of data exclusivity protection for biologics against biosimilars.</p><p>But did brand-name biopharma really lose in the TPP?</p><p>While it didn't get 12 years across the board in all 12 TPP nations &ndash; Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, U.S. and Vietnam &ndash; the innovator biopharma industry did get a "minimum" of five years, and that's significant, considering more than a third of those countries currently don't have any exclusivity protection.</p><p>Plus, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman noted during an Oct. 5 press conference that individual nations will be able to use "government measures that can achieve a comparable outcome."</p><p>"For some of us, in our systems we use data protection as the method for creating effective market protection," Froman explained, noting the U.S. supports 12 years under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act </i>(BPCIA) &ndash; the law that granted the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars &ndash; while other nations have eight or 10 years, although Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam currently have no exclusivity protection. </p><p><b>First Trade Deal With Exclusivity</b></p><p>Froman pointed out that the TPP is the "first trade agreement in history to ensure a minimum period of protection for biologics," and by putting such measures in place, he insisted it would "help set a reasonable model and will create an environment in which through comparable treatment there will be an effective period of protection to encourage both innovation and access." </p><p>He said the debate over biologics exclusivity was "one of the most challenging issues in the negotiations."</p><p>But, Froman said, "We've worked cooperatively with all of our TPP partners to secure a strong and balanced outcome that both incentivizes the development of these new life-saving drugs, while ensuring access to these pioneering medicines and their availability."</p><p>"What we are doing in TPP is recognizing that we're all trying to achieve that effective market protection and deliver a comparable outcome through various mechanisms," he said. </p><p>Froman said that in debating the exclusivity issue, the ministers all recognized the "importance" of innovation and having effective market protection for encouraging it.</p><p>But he said there also was a "recognition that there may be multiple ways of achieving that."</p><p>"I think that was a long and hard discussion among all the parties around the table, reflecting different levels of development of the pharmaceutical and biotech industry," Froman said. "The outcome, I believe, both encourages and incentivizes the innovation around important life-saving medicines and treatments and ensures access to affordable medicines more broadly around the world."</p><p><b>Unhappy Innovators</b></p><p>But Jim Greenwood, president and CEO of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), begged to differ, declaring that his group was "very disappointed" in the outcome of the TPP negotiations over exclusivity protection, calling it "short-sighted," with the potential to "chill global investment" and "slow development" of new treatments.</p><p>"BIO strongly believes that 12 years of data exclusivity is a prerequisite to attract the investment required to continue medical innovation and develop new biological cures and therapies," Greenwood charged, insisting that what Congress established under the BPCIA was the "appropriate period" to foster innovation and provide access to biosimilars in a "reasonable timeframe." </p><p>"This term was not a random number, but the result of a long debate in Congress, which determined that this period of time captured the appropriate balance that stimulated research but gave access to biosimilars in a timely manner," John Castellani, president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said of the 12 years under the BPCIA.</p><p>But Chester "Chip" Davis, president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association &ndash; who used to be a lobbyist for PhRMA before recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Generics-group-steals-one-of-PhRMAs-guys-359596" target="_new">switching teams</a> &ndash; praised the TPP agreement as an effort to improve worldwide patient access to affordable medicine, declaring he was optimistic it "brings us closer to achieving that goal by embracing competition from safe, effective biosimilar therapies."</p><p><b>Angry Patient Advocates</b></p><p>MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/Doctors Without Borders, however, said it was dismayed by the TPP deal, asserting the agreement would "raise the price of medicines for millions by unnecessarily extending monopolies and further delaying price-lowering generic competition." </p><p>"The big losers in the TPP are patients and treatment providers in developing countries," the humanitarian group said, declaring the deal would "go down in history as the worst trade agreement for access to medicines in developing countries, which will be forced to change their laws to incorporate abusive intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical companies." </p><p>Peter Maybarduk, director of the Access to Medicines Program at the Washington consumer watchdog Public Citizen, warned that those government "mechanisms" Froman mentioned, but gave no clear details on, could be used by the USTR to "browbeat countries, now and in the future, to get what big pharma wants, and pull countries toward longer monopoly periods."</p><p>Maybarduk said the final Asia-Pacific trade deal does not appear to adhere to the standard under the so-called May 10th 2007 Agreement &ndash; a deal reached by Democratic congressional leaders and the Bush administration &ndash; on access to affordable medicines, which he said could complicate the TPP's prospects at getting through the U.S. Congress. </p><p>He also insisted the TPP as proposed would expand "monopoly protections for the pharmaceutical" beyond the biologics, but also to other drugs "at the expense of people's access to affordable medicines." </p><p><b>21st Century Trade Deal</b></p><p>But in declaring they had sealed the TPP deal on Oct. 5 &ndash; although some finalizing of the text still needs to take place &ndash; the 12 trade ministers said they achieved their goal of reaching an ambitious, comprehensive, high standard and balanced agreement, which they insisted would "benefit our nation's citizens."</p><p>"TPP brings higher standards to nearly 40% of the global economy," Froman said. "We think it helps define the rules of the road for the Asia-Pacific region in a way that's consistent with the interests and the values that we share."</p><p>Froman noted that the 12 ministers and their staffs were working on the TPP until 5am EDT on Oct. 5 &ndash; pointing out the press conference that had been set for the day before had been rescheduled several times.</p><p>"All of us have shared the belief that the substance had to drive the timetable and this was an opportunity to get that substance right," Froman said.</p><p>"At the end of the day, here we are as 12 TPP partners having achieved something that some time ago people didn't think was achievable," said Canadian trade minister Tim Groser, who praised his colleagues for getting a "21st century high-ambition trade agreement actually negotiated, getting it done, one that is going to serve us very well and will set the rules for the 21st century for trade within the Asia-Pacific region." </p><p><b>Pause In U.S.</b></p><p>In the U.S., President Barack Obama cannot sign off on the TPP for at least 90 days, although his administration is already claiming it as one of his major achievements. </p><p>Under the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-gets-his-fast-track-to-seal-trade-deals-359110" target="_new">trade promotion authority</a> &ndash; commonly called fast-track &ndash; which Congress granted in June, the full text of the TPP must be made available to the American public for 60 days before lawmakers vote on it. Congress also can only give the TPP an up-or-down vote and cannot amend or filibuster it. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
