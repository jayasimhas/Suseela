<p>Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he is hoping to have an agreement by the end of this month on a bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise.</p><p>And then, he said, the legislative phase can swiftly progress on the bill, which is intended to accelerate the nation's discovery, development and delivery processes for new medicines.</p><p>Representative Upton's remarks about the highly anticipated legislation, which is based on the 21st Century Cures Initiative he launched last year with Congresswoman Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), came on 20 April while the two were on a Michigan road trip together.</p><p>Mr Upton <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">released a draft</a> &ldquo;Cures&rdquo; legislative package in January, although Ms DeGette did not join him on that effort &ndash; declaring she disagreed with some of its contents, notably the measures seeking greater exclusivity protection for drugs in certain circumstances.</p><p>But it's been all hugs and kisses between the two lawmakers since then, with Representatives Upton and DeGette vowing to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/21st-Century-Cures-leaders-vow-to-work-out-differences-356688" target="_new">work together</a> to solve the differences they have on any final language in the bill.</p><p>Mr Upton had said in February the revised draft bill would be ready in a "couple of weeks" and that he hoped to have a vote on the legislation by the end of May.</p><p>That timeline now, however, may not be feasible, even if the bill is introduced in the next few weeks.</p><p>But the Michigan lawmaker said he nonetheless wants to have the Cures bill to President Barack Obama for his signature by the end of the year. </p><p>But the Senate is moving at a much slower pace &ndash; only recently getting its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">process underway</a>.</p><p>Rumors were swirling on Capitol Hill that some details of a revised House bill could be revealed as early as this week. </p><p>Both the former and current acting FDA commissioners, Drs Margaret Hamburg and Stephen Ostroff, respectively, as well as the head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Francis Collins, have expressed concern about the Cures legislation imposing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Path-to-cures-More-unfunded-FDA-NIH-mandates-356150" target="_new">unfunded mandates</a> on their agencies.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat-Massachusetts) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Warren-picks-fight-with-Cures-author-over-NIH-funding-357475" target="_new">took Representative Upton to task</a> last month for not having a plan for how to pay for the measures in the Cures bill.</p><p>"Talk is cheap," she declared.</p><p>"It doesn't matter what Republicans say about innovation if their budgets actually cut support for NIH," Senator Warren asserted. "It doesn't matter that House Republicans put the word 'cure' in the name of a bill if the bill doesn't put one new dollar from Congress into NIH to help fund those cures. Something needs to change. Families are losing loved ones to incurable and untreatable diseases while we do nothing. It is time for Congress to stop talking about medical research funding and actually do something about it. People are counting on us."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
