<p> <preform><p> Merck KGaA is in a transition period, to better position its biopharmaceutical unit Merck Serono to move up the ranks against competitors. Merck Serono's chief executive Belén Garijo, who is also responsible for Merck's other pharmaceutical businesses such as Consumer Health, Allergopharma and Biosimilars, caught up with <i>Scrip</i> exclusively at the company's recent <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Immune-oncology-central-to-Merck-KGaAs-pharma-growth-hopes-357071">annual press conference</a> in Frankfurt to discuss the progress of its pipeline, how the company will tackle pricing and reimbursement concerns for new cancer drugs, and why diversity in the C-Suite is vital to Merck Serono's success. </p><p><h4><img alt="Belén Garijo" refid="249280" version="c" src="-/media/20E17EDA66784949A2FA9E8EB89EBB51.ashx"></h4><h5> Belén Garijo </h5></p><p><p> A large factor in the Germanfirm's plans for growth is its ongoing alliance with big pharma Pfizer for the development of immune-oncology therapies. Merck Serono and Pfizer teamed up in 2014 through a global strategic alliance deal initially focused on avelumab (MSB0010718C), an investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody. The two companies are testing the compound as a single agent as well as in various combinations with Pfizer's and Merck Serono's portfolios of approved and investigational oncology therapies. The products will be tested in up to 20 clinical trials, due to commence throughout 2015. The clinical development programs will include up to six trials (Phase II or III) that could be pivotal for potential product registrations. </p><p><b>Scrip: The alliance is focused on products that will be marketed in a competitive space. How will Merck Serono differentiate its offering?</b></p><p><b>Belén Garijo:</b> We are in a space that is highly crowded but the products from this alliance will stand against the competition. Certainly for avelumab, our anti-PD-L1 candidate, we are on course. Selecting and prioritizing tumor types based on the early results we have from Phase I is important. For example, we are moving forward with an ovarian cancer indication which had promising results. We will be staying away from indications that are highly crowded like melanoma. Our priority towards certain indications will be guided and we will be able to remain one of the first three producers when getting to the commercialization stage. </p><p> We will also be looking at combinations through the Pfizer alliance. With avelumab being the backbone of the immuno-oncology franchise, the combination of Merck Serono and Pfizer will be one of a &quot;multiplier.&quot; We will be able to access faster potential combinations between Merck Serono and Pfizer products whenever it makes scientific sense and whenever the clinical data indicates a combination will take us forward. </p><p> Through our global alliance with Pfizer we have also gained broader access to the US market through the co-promotion of Xalkori, Pfizer's targeted ALK kinase inhibitor for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, which is already on the market. </p><p><b>Scrip: A lot of new cancer drugs are struggling to get reimbursement at individual country levels from health technology appraisal bodies. How will Merck Serono deal with this challenge?</b></p><p><b>BG: </b>We are in favor of an environment that protects and values innovation but the sustainability of the various healthcare systems is going to require us being smart when developing our products. We have to be able to prove that our innovations, our new products, are superior to existing treatments. This is something we are very aware of when taking a compound into clinical development. We take cost-effectiveness and value into account from an early stage. </p><p> There is a second element though and that is communication. Many countries and governments have already started opening the doors to more creative partnering when commercializing innovation. Outcome-based deals and other new approaches are great to see. We are very aware that we have to continue to develop advanced therapies globally and make realistic and affordable proposals so as many patients as possible can access those products. </p><p> [In Germany specifically] we will continue to see and deal with developing methods of drug pricing and we will retain a dialogue with the respective parties. This evolution of systems is taking place in multiple countries. For the time being we are coping with the constant change and are not particularly concerned. We are more concerned with creating an environment across all of Europe that will continue to value novelty and progression. </p><p><b>Scrip: Last July, you said that China is of strategic importance to Merck KGaA. Have</b><b>the slowing economy and volatile currency situation impacted your views?</b></p><p><b>BG:</b> China is a region of great importance to us and the current economic slowdown there is not going to change our minds. We have a model of business based on three pillars: localization &ndash; for example we are investing in a new manufacturing plant in China; partnering &ndash; we have accelerated partnering with some Chinese biotech companies to enhance our pipeline; and finally developing our own presence. China will continue to be important to Merck and while we fully understand the volatility and challenges we have had a very strong performance in China. Emerging markets represent around 60% of our organic growth. </p><p> The aging population, the growing support for healthcare infrastructure and the rise of biologics in China creates a very important opportunity for our company &ndash; particularly for our fertility and oncology portfolios. Merck Serono is uniquely placed in terms of portfolio to compete effectively both in developed and emerging markets. </p><p><b>Scrip: What are your plans for M&amp;A in China and the emerging markets?</b></p><p><b>BG:</b> We are actively in-licensing from other companies in emerging markets whenever it makes sense for our portfolio. Partnering is very much at the center of our business in the emerging markets. </p><p><b>Scrip: In a </b><a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Phemale-pharma-more-women-more-revenue-340930">Scrip study</a><b> in 2013, we found that women represent only 11% of total board members across the top 100 pharmaceutical companies. As a successful woman in the industry, do you think there is a lack of higher-level roles for woman in pharma?</b></p><p><b>BG:</b> While some methods like quotas have been put in place to force up the number of female members in executive and board roles I don't think this is the best option. There are more specific dimensions that have to be managed and I don't think by just forcing participation that the problem will be solved. </p><p> We have to accept first of all this is the decision of the woman to drive her own career. There are a number of social constraints that will only be managed with time. Hopefully people in coming generations will be less constrained by the social beliefs we still face currently. But right now I am positive that by creating awareness and establishing objectives that push ambition we will make progress. But there is an onus to manage your own career and make decisions to push yourself. </p><p> Merck KGaA thinks diversity is a competitive advantage. If I look at the pharmaceutical executive committee around 40% are women. The female representation is very high. This is because we cultivate our standards beyond genders. </p><p> However, I believe it's very important that we don't focus on just on gender diversity. We are proud to have tremendous cultural diversity at Merck. </p><p><i>[Merck's pharmaceutical executive committee includes six women and eight men </i><i>, with nine different nationalities represented: three German, two French, two Italian, two British, one Spanish, one Indian, one Turkish, one American and one Austrian.]</i></p><p><b>Scrip: There's still not been a female top 10 pharma CEO though; could this change anytime soon?</b></p><p><b>BG:</b> Let's keep our fingers crossed. </p><p></preform> </p>
