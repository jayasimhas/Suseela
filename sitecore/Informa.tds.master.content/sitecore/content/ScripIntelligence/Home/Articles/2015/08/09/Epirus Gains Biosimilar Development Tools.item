<p><p>Boston-based biotech Epirus Biopharmaceuticals is expanding its presence in biosimilars through the acquisition of a Dutch biotech with its sights on containing costs. </p><p>Epirus announced Sept. 9 that it's picked up Bioceros for $14.1m in cash and stock that will be paid out over the next year in tranched payments, mostly in stock. </p><p>The acquisition adds three preclinical biosimilar products &ndash; namely, the copies of Johnson & Johnson's Stelara (ustekinumab) and Simponi (golimumab), as well as Alexion Pharmaceuticals' Soiliris (eculizumab). Epirus President and CEO Amit Munshi said during a same day conference call with analysts that he has no knowledge of any other companies developing biosimilar versions of these three products, which the company anticipates could have a collective market potential of $12bn. </p><p>All three assets are currently preclinical, but are expected to enter the clinic within 18 months. The company expects to spend about $3m to $5m per molecule in the early stages and then another $8m to $10m in later stages of development. Epirus expects to file Soliris first &ndash; as early as 2020. </p><p>The products add to Epirus' existing portfolio of biosimilar products, including versions of AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab), J&J's Remicade (infliximab) and Roche's Actemra (tocilizumab). Munshi revealed during the conference call that Epirus has been working with Bioceros for the last two and a half years on its biosimilar products of Remicade and Actemra. </p><p><b>Gaining Expertise</b></p><p>Aside from boosting its pipeline, the larger motivation behind the acquisition for the Boston biotech was both cost management and Bioceros' development capabilities. </p><p>Through the deal, Epirus gained a 6,000 square foot facility outside of Amsterdam, as well as approximately 20 scientists who are experienced with cell line development. "By bringing these capabilities in house, this will allow us to reduce the cost of goods and reduce the time and cost to market," said Munshi. </p><p>The facility and capabilities that come with the acquisition will reduce Epirus' outsourcing costs, reducing the amount spent by about $4m over the next three years. </p><p>"We're picking up a technical team with deep cell line expertise and a physical lab. The secret, often times, to biosimilars is early product development," the executive added. </p><p>The acquisition was in-line with what the company has said previously about its intentions. "Management told us a big motivating factor for the deal was developing a pipeline engine for early product development with an eye toward intellectual property development, as many of the second generation biosimilars have a much more complex portfolio of patents to navigate, meaning development of proprietary manufacturing process could circumvent some of those IP barriers," wrote Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry in a Sept. 9 note to investors. </p><p>Epirus hopes to begin looking for partners for the products in early 2016. This sounds like a solid plan; a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/How-Big-Pharma-Can-Play-To-Win-In-US-Biosimilars-360197" target="_new">recent analysis</a> by independent research service BioMedTracker concludes that big pharma would be well advised to partner early, ideally when the drug is in development outside the US, and to use the 351(k) abbreviated pathway to get the quickest regulatory approval.</p><p>The landscape for biosimilars have been changing rapidly as the first biosimilar gained approval in the US and was <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">launched</a> in early September.</p><p><p>
