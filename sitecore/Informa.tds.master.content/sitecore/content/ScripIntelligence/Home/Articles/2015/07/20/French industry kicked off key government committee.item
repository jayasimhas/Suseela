<p>The French industry body Leem is to lose its seat on a key government committee that makes recommendations on the medical added value of new medicines. This appears to be the latest manifestation of the government's intent to proscribe all industry involvement in regulatory decision-making following the 2011 Mediator scandal.</p><p>A decree published in the French official journal earlier this month modified the composition of the transparency committee, which is part of the HTA body, the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS). It abolished the seat held by the industry representative while creating a new position for a representative of patient groups. It also amended the make-up of the national committee for the evaluation of medical devices and health technologies (CNEDiMTS). </p><p>According to the government, the aim of the reorganization is to "adapt and harmonize" the composition of the two bodies, which evaluate products for reimbursement purposes, and to spell out more clearly the scientific and technical competences of their members. The new members of the two committees will be announced by the HAS within four months of publication of the decree.</p><p>Leem is not happy with the removal of its place on the transparency committee. Describing the move as "inappropriate", it said while it had only a consultative role and did not take part in the committee's decisions, it was able to put forward views on issues affecting the industry and "ensure equity of treatment among products evaluated".</p><p>The move comes as health authorities worldwide increasingly make use of health technology assessments to determine the actual medical value of new drugs compared with those already available. In France the transparency committee carries out an evaluation of the medical benefit (SMR) of a drug, as well as any added medical value (ASMR) offered. Its recommendations are taken into account in decisions on both reimbursement and price levels. </p><p>At present the committee has 20 members with decision-making powers, a number that will rise to 21 with the addition of a patient representative. It also has eight representatives with a consultative role, including that of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the social security, the health directorate, the health insurance agencies and the regulatory agency ANSM.</p><h2>The Mediator effect</h2><p>The decision to abolish industry's seat was taken in light of the regulatory upheaval that followed the 2011 Mediator <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2012-Scrip-100-The-French-fallout-325146" target="_new">scandal</a>, which resulted in a new law tightening up regulatory procedures, introducing more transparency into the system, and revamping the old AFSSAPS under the new name of ANSM.</p><p>Among other things the law precluded any industry involvement in ANSM's work. The regulator has since seen industry representation removed from all its advisory bodies, including the committees responsible for drug approvals and pharmacovigilance, and from its board &ndash; a move that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/French-industry-bemoans-loss-of-presence-on-regulatory-bodies-325954" target="_new">criticized</a> at the time by Leem. </p><p>Now, "the same procedure has been followed within the HAS", a spokesman for the health minister said. However, this does not mean that there will be no more discussions between industry and the transparency committee, the spokesman stressed. Rather, the emphasis will be on stronger "bilateral dialogue" between the two parties on individual products "in a clearly identified framework".</p><p>Leem said the fact that the three main health and social security bodies as well as the three health insurance associations retained their seats on the transparency committee while industry would lose its seat was not only inequitable but also "introduced a real bias into the medical-technical evaluation". </p><p>Moreover, the decision to abolish its seat was "all the more inappropriate" as it came at a time when the strategic council for health industries and the pharmaceutical industry's strategic committee were reflecting on the attractiveness of the sector in France.</p><h2>Changes needed</h2><p>But Leem has put forward a set of proposals that seem to be more or less in line with the ministry's desire for more "bilateral dialogue" on a product-by-product basis. It says that companies preparing a submission should be able to meet the transparency committee beforehand, and that the committee should draw up a list of questions to which the company could reply either in writing or at a hearing before the submission was examined.</p><p>It said it also wanted the committee's discussions to be made widely available, in the same way as those of ANSM already are. If a company wished, it should be able to take part in a full debate on its submission involving the external experts who contributed to the evaluation of the product. </p><p>In future Leem should be invited to meetings of the committee's bureau (which consists of the committee's chair and vice-chairs) in order to allow it to ensure equity of treatment of the products evaluated and where necessary to explain any industry-related issues that have arisen. </p><p>The industry association suggested that a permanent HAS-Leem liaison committee be established. It has also called for a full review of the transparency committee's procedures so as to ensure the "clarity and fairness" of its deliberations. </p><p>While there is no suggestion that this has any direct bearing on the decision to remove industry's seat &ndash; the move has apparently been on the cards for some time &ndash; the question of industry influence in regulatory and reimbursement decisions came to the fore again in March this year following claims by a media organization about alleged links between some companies and former members of the transparency committee and ANSM's drug approvals body. </p><p>Both HAS and ANSM have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/therapysector/French-revelation-scandal-or-business-as-usual-357651" target="_new">launched internal investigations</a> into allegations by Mediapart that, over a period of more than 20 years from the late 1980s, money and gifts changed hands in advance of drug approval and reimbursement decisions. </p><p>
