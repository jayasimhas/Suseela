<p>The drug development landscape has changed markedly over the 20 years since the EMA was founded in 1995, with a pronounced shift away from the blockbuster model to a more personalized approach involving diagnostic tools, more patient involvement, and the earlier availability of promising new drugs for unmet needs. Maureen Kenny and Ian Schofield spoke to Guido Rasi, former EMA executive director and now its principal adviser on strategy, about the complexity of the EU regulatory system, why it's OK to give companies scientific advice, and what the drug evaluation landscape might look like in the next 10-20 years.</p><p>Over the past two decades, the growing complexity of the science underlying new drug evaluations has been mirrored by that of the regulatory system that oversees these evaluations. Indeed, there have been complaints from the industry that the system has become too complex and that it stifles innovation rather than allows it to flourish. </p><p>Guido Rasi, former executive director of the European Medicines Agency and now its principal adviser on strategy, agrees, but only to a limited degree. Professor Rasi sees the need for a certain level of complexity, but emphasises that there are ways to make the system more streamlined and efficient and so help to bring innovation to patients more quickly than before.</p><p>"I agree that it is a complex system. It can't be too simple because medicine and therapy is a complex issue. Some complexity has been added because of a little bit of a decline in trust in the system that called for additional tightening of the regulations &ndash; any time there is some uncertainty, of course regulation becomes tighter."</p><p>It's not just that the regulation has been tightened up: medicine itself is much less straightforward than it used to be. "Just look at the molecules of 20 years ago, and the molecules of today. The world is becoming more complex. Having said that, there are ways of streamlining the process and making it more efficient, and I think we are ready. In the current R&D model we are re-identifying ways to speed up access."</p><p>Improving patient access to new medicines is a core part of the EMA's future plans, and Professor Rasi believes there are two principal tools to use to do this. One is the increasing use of scientific advice, the other is adaptive pathways.</p><h2>Scientific advice</h2><p>The scientific advice procedure, whereby companies engage in a dialogue with the agency on issues such as the most appropriate clinical trial design, has the effect of giving the EMA a bird's eye view of all the products that come its way, allowing it to generate the best evidence, which means more efficient use of resources. "So scientific advice certainly contributes a lot to simplifying and showing the easiest way to produce the needed evidence," says Professor Rasi.</p><p>Professor Rasi dismisses suggestions that having the EMA work closely with companies through the scientific advice process is something of an uncomfortable relationship &ndash; a criticism that has been levelled at the agency by NGO Health Action International, among others. Professor Rasi emphasises the importance, particularly for the patient, of ensuring the best kind of trial design is chosen.</p><p>"Scientific advice is third party, it is not given by the people who will eventually decide on whether to recommend the product. It is intended to give the company information generally on what evidence is needed for the product they want to develop. This means, firstly and most importantly, the clinical trial design, which means making the best use of the patient's involvement. If they fail in the design, they expose the patient to something useless."</p><p>Professor Rasi thinks that HAI's view represents a gap in communication that needs to be filled. "It is more perception than reality, but we [the EMA and industry] are not developing anything together, just reminding them again and again what evidence is needed, and the methodology."</p><h2>Adaptive pathways</h2><p>The second tool for speeding access is adaptive pathways (formerly known as adaptive licensing). This is not a new regulatory pathway, but rather an initiative bringing all stakeholders together in a common approach to using the existing regulatory tools, such as conditional licensing and patient registries, to allow earlier licensing of a promising new drug in a restricted patient population, followed by a gradual widening out of its use in bigger populations.</p><p>Professor Rasi envisages that the adaptive pathways experiment will progressively develop as a multi-stakeholder system. "It needs the patient to be more involved because ultimately it is the patient who is really positioned to set the benefit risk. It needs the industry to be serious about agreeing on what the medical needs are, it needs us to be able to identify alternative clinical methods for gathering evidence, and it needs HTA bodies to have the proper tools for the appropriateness of the prescription." </p><p>Some concerns have been expressed by those who perceive this as a rush to get new drugs to the market before they have been properly assessed, but Professor Rasi is quick to point out that the idea is not to approve drugs on less evidence, but to generate the same level of evidence with different tools. Much of the emphasis will be on post-approval monitoring of the product: "With a very robust post-marketing plan we can move from the uncertainty of the prediction, which is the current situation, to the robustness of monitoring. Since the focus on the effect of the medicine will be much more evident, the benefit will be much higher." </p><p>As to the drug development paradigm of the future, Professor Rasi envisages it as a comprehensive exercise that involves drug delivery systems, diagnostic tools, and a different approach to diagnosis given that diseases will be classified differently. Medicine will be much more targeted to the patient: "If we succeed it will be much more patient needs-oriented and more efficacious, which means the benefit will be higher and therefore the benefit-risk ratio will be more favourable."</p><p>Professor Rasi also expects patients to play an even bigger part in the drug assessment process. They have recently started taking part in benefit-risk discussions at the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), but with no part in the decision-making process &ndash; although this could be about to change. "Now they contribute a lot, but I think it is time for them to contribute to the final decision," Professor Rasi says. This will require special training, and patients may, he says, need to be distanced from emotional involvement in the product under evaluation.</p><p>There is also the problem of the perceived independence of patient groups, in view of the need to avoid conflicts of interest where such a group might have some sort of link with industry. "I think it is time for Europe to decide how we can support the patient contribution and the patient work at regulatory level, since they are professional people who generally need some functional support to give their contribution. I fear they are not taken seriously because the only way [of support] they have is from the pharmaceutical industry. I think it is time to reflect and find a solution, which probably means public money."</p><h2>Relations with the EU regulatory network</h2><p>Another issue to be settled is the state of the EMA's relationship with the EU medicines regulatory network, particularly the way that the agency distributes revenues from industry fees to pay the national competent authorities.</p><p>The revenue the EMA receives from these fees is shared 50% with the NCAs for the work they do on behalf of the agency. NCAs have long been unhappy that what they are paid does not cover their direct costs, and so we asked Professor Rasi to comment on the current relationship between the agency and the NCAs. </p><p>"I don&rsquo;t see major tension; I see a dynamic, I see a debate, I see specific issues but&#8230; overall it's a very well-functioning network [and] I don't see any critical element that would put in doubt the model," Professor Rasi says. The European drug regulatory model, he notes, has attracted "quite a lot of interest in other parts of the world". [This echoes comments made by R&D&ndash;based pharmaceutical industry group, EFPIA, in an article for this same "EMA at 20" series &ndash; Ed.]</p><p>The network is preparing for a revision of the entire EMA fee structure "in due time", says Professor Rasi. In the meantime, the EMA management board sees that current NCA direct costs are adjusted on a regular basis in an effort to make the system as fair as it can be. Also, "we are collecting data together with the member states" that will feed into the review, and the European Commission is on board, Professor Rasi says. "It's wise to start now before we come to a critical point."</p><p>It's not only the NCAs that are feeling the pinch. With the new pharmacovigilance fees, the EMA receives one -third, and the member states two -thirds (one -third for the rapporteur and another third for the co-rapporteur). "[This for us] is sometimes a little bit too strict and we are not covering our direct costs for some big procedures. But so far it is not critical and it's good we are starting to think about it now and to have a sound approach together&#8230; I don't see a major problem."</p><p>Professor Rasi described two "very interesting" tools that are being used to build member states&rsquo; capacity to collaborate with EMA and help to strengthen the relationships among member states themselves. One is a major new training programme that began in January under which training is given "member state to member state". The other involves making sure assessment teams are multinational in nature rather than being comprised of members of just one or two member states.</p><p>The training initiative was fostered and is supported by the EMA but the training is carried out by the member states themselves, with "one agency [giving] training to another or vice versa in their area of strength". Participation is voluntary. The initiative is expected to lead to a more harmonised approach among experts when it comes to the work they do on behalf of the EMA &ndash; such as assessing marketing authorisation applications &ndash; with a resulting improvement in the overall quality of experts.</p><p>The second tool, the multinational team approach, is "more operational and more powerful", says Professor Rasi. The rapporteur in charge proposes the make-up of the team and considerable effort goes into ensuring that each team comprises experts from different member states. This initiative has had a considerable positive impact on the spread of member states involved in product evaluation, says Professor Rasi. </p><p>Portugal and Germany are working together, and other member states that are already taking part include Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Malta and Italy. Other countries such as Greece are "thinking about it", says Professor Rasi.</p><p>In 2010, for example, 80% of CHMP assessments were carried out by seven countries; now 80% of assessments are carried out by 15 countries. Twice as many member states as before now make a substantial contribution, and this can only be viewed as positive, Professor Rasi notes.</p><h2>No plans to be full review body</h2><p>Some time back, the EMA mooted the idea that its ambition was to be a full review body that would routinely require and re-analyse original clinical trial data in marketing authorisation applications. The agency later backtracked on the idea. We asked Professor Rasi if he could envisage at any point a much-expanded EMA reviewing raw trial data. He was diplomatic in his answer: "The current model is the winning model&#8230; It's beyond our remit, and personally [I don't see that it would have] any immediate benefit."</p><p>Fernand Sauer, the EMA&rsquo;s first executive director, suggested in an article for this series that the European Commission should delegate marketing authorisation decisions to the EMA, except where these involve difficult ethical aspects. Asked to comment on this suggestion, Professor Rasi said that he didn't see "major problems with the current system" under which the EMA makes recommendations to the commission and the commission decides whether to accept them or not. </p><p>Asked whether such a change might be on the cards, Professor Rasi said it was not something on which he'd had "deep discussions". If it were to happen, "it would not be a substantial change", he said. "We would still need an appeals body."</p><h2>Future challenges</h2><p>Looking towards the wider healthcare challenges of the future, Professor Rasi says there will be a shift towards chronic diseases, the geographical distribution of epidemics will change constantly, and the aging population in Europe will see co-morbidities and concomitant use of many medicines become the norm. But there will be far more challenges on the horizon: "I can list so many it is impossible to say." </p><p>Keeping up with scientific innovation and rapid change in this context will be "excitingly challenging", Professor Rasi says. "There is nothing an individual can do, but an organisation can try to keep up the pace. We are naturally engaged, our network is composed of lot of experts, there is academic input, so it is kind of a continuous debate. You understand how much has changed only if you look behind: you don&rsquo;t perceive while you're doing it, so you are not frightened of how much you have to do."</p><p>So how does the EMA try to keep abreast of what might be coming over the hill in terms of new drugs? It has a number of horizon-scanning tools at its disposal &ndash; for example, examining company pipelines to see the kind of expertise that will be needed when these drugs arrive at the EMA, and the innovation task force, "which interacts at many levels with many stakeholders to understand what is coming up." The agency's senior medical office, Hans Georg Eichler, is constantly in touch with academia and cutting edge technology. "We also have a multi-annual plan where we try to incorporate what is coming, and now we have a corporate stakeholder department which is really exposed to the external environment." </p><p>In future Professor Rasi believes there will be a more global approach to assessment. "I expect that if the science takes over more and more, then the evidence will be increasingly strong, and that will put us in a better position to evaluate. I am very positive that the science will help a lot." And secondly, the redefining of many diseases according to molecular pathways will give a clearer way to prescribe, "so I would see more robust evidence being generated, and more globally". </p><p>"Of course in such a fast moving world it is a matter of maybe only one scientific breakthrough innovation that will change the way we see things, in diagnostic terms, in epigenetics, we will find something spectacular that will completely change the approach of medicine. It is very difficult to say," Professor Rasi comments. </p><p>"I can see that the transition from the so-called blockbuster model to personal medicine is kind of happening slowly, but as a scientist I expect that something will cause a breakthrough change." Professor Rasi is not sure what, but it could be driven by big data, new apps that change the way patients are monitored and clinical trials are conducted. </p><p>And with the advent of big data, closer alignment of standards, and more robust evaluations, is a single global assessment on the horizon? "Not today, maybe in 20 years yes, but less than 20 years - I don't think so." </p><h2>Executive director post</h2><p>We couldn't interview Professor Rasi without asking whether he had re-applied for his job as executive director of the agency. He declined to comment, saying it was all "in the hands" of the European Commission. Professor Rasi was appointed as the agency's third executive director in November 2011 but his tenure came to an abrupt end in November 2014 when he was forced to step aside following an EU tribunal ruling that annulled his appointment on procedural grounds. The European Commission posted a vacancy notice in December 2014, and 36 people applied for the job. The recruitment process is still under way.</p><p><b><i>Maureen Kenny</i></b><i> is editor of Scrip Regulatory Affairs and </i><b><i>Ian Schofield</i></b><i> is a principal analyst with Scrip Intelligence. </i></p><p>*This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
