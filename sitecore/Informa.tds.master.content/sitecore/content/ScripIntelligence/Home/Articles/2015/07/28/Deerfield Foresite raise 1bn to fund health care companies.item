<p>Deerfield Management and Foresite Capital raised money for two separate funds that will invest a total of $1bn in health care firms, including therapeutics companies, at the earliest stages and in the later stages of product development.</p><p>The Deerfield Healthcare Innovations Fund has $550m in venture capital to invest in technology spun out of research institutions and medical centers, while Foresite Capital Fund III will put its $450m in private equity into development programs that are in the clinic and may be in or near the commercial market. Both funds favor therapeutics, medical devices, diagnostics and health care services, including information technology.</p><p><b>Deerfield's very early-stage focus</b></p><p>New York-based Deerfield frequently invests in drug development companies, such as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CytomX-advancing-PD-L1-targeting-Probodies-with-70m-in-new-cash-359001" target="_new">CytomX</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/KemPharm-seeks-58m-via-IPO-357258" target="_new">KemPharm</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Naurex-leads-VC-funding-surge-with-80-Series-C-355396" target="_new">Audentes</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Top-6-US-venture-capital-deals-in-2nd-quarter-352825" target="_new">Spark Therapeutics and Avalanche Biotechnologies</a>. </p><p>But Deerfield's new fund has a doubly altruistic purpose: 1) to invest seed money or Series A venture capital into startups emerging from academia as well as young companies that need some help getting out of the "valley of death" between seed funding and venture capital, and 2) to generate a return that can be donated to the Deerfield Foundation.</p><p>Deerfield president and managing partner Jim Flynn said the idea behind the Healthcare Innovations Fund was to fill the gap caused by reduced grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as reduced private investment in early-stage companies. Even with increased investment in biotechnology companies, the money still isn't flowing as well as it used to for nascent ideas.</p><p>"There are a number of funds for seed and early-stage investments, but the number is still small based on the funds available historically," Mr Flynn said. "There's still a lot of heavy lifting to be done [after early-stage funding] to create a viable entity. Once that's done and the intellectual property is created, there's tons of money to fund that. Until then, the valley of death is still very deep."</p><p>Deerfield may source some of the investments for its Innovation fund from its investors, which include New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children's Hospital as well as philanthropic organizations like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and universities, such as Princeton University and Northwestern University. </p><p>About 90% of Deerfield's prior investors pitched in capital for the Innovation fund, but the participation of Memorial Sloan Kettering and Seattle Children's is notable, because they frequently spin technology out into new companies. Both medical centers have intellectual property licensed to Juno Therapeutics for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Startup-Juno-raises-120m-for-unprecedented-immunotherapies-348529" target="_new">chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell (CAR-T)</a> therapies, which have generated a lot of excitement in treating cancer and attracted <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-shows-CAR-T-confidence-with-1bn-Juno-investment-359176" target="_new">major investments</a> by Celgene and other big biopharma companies.</p><p>"We've worked had to develop relationships with academic medical centers," Mr Flynn said. "There's a lot of investment activity in centers located in Boston and San Francisco, and not a lot of focus and not a lot of funding in the middle of the country."</p><p>Deerfield will donate all of its profits from the Innovations fund &ndash; potentially as much as $100m &ndash; to the investment firm's Deerfield Foundation, which has given $25m so far to programs that provide medical treatment to children without access to care and other health care-related causes.</p><p>Mr Flynn said Deerfield will earn a less than 2% management fee, which the firm will reinvest in its in-house services that support health care entrepreneurs. </p><p><b>Foresite supports late-stage investments</b></p><p>Four-year-old Foresite raised its third fund totaling $450m barely a year after the investment firm closed its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Foresite-raises-300m-health-care-fund-350990" target="_new">second fund totaling $300m</a>. San Francisco-based Foresite's past investments include the Phase III <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/200m-gets-private-Intarcia-to-diabetes-finish-line-350989" target="_new">once-yearly diabetes drug maker</a> Intarcia and the inflammatory bowel disease-focused <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Protagonist-raises-40m-to-test-oral-peptides-in-IBD-359470" target="_new">Protagonist Therapeutics</a>, which is in mid-stage clinical development. </p><p>Foresite managing director Christine Aylward said the investment firm's strategy is to back companies with transformative products and technology as well as management teams who have a successful track record.</p><p>"We're really looking for emerging leaders across all therapeutic areas and all technology, including therapeutics, diagnostics and health care services," Ms Aylward said. "It's an incredible time to be investing in health care companies, because of the technology and innovation in health care. The technology is catching up to real, working products."</p><p>She said Foresite had a lot of interest from investors that wanted to put money into the firm's third fund. Foresite will provide private equity and crossover funding, which may help some companies bridge the gap between venture capital and an initial public offering. The firm also backs publicly-traded companies and continues to invest in businesses already in Foresite's portfolio.</p><p>"It's such an exciting time," Ms Aylward said. "The innovation we're seeing today is amazing."</p><p><p><p><p>
