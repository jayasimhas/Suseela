<p>The diversified German group Merck KGaA believes demographic patterns for the world's seven billion-plus population bode well for fertility treatments and technologies, and is positioning itself accordingly.</p><p>There is added urgency in the plan given that the group's drug R&D portfolio has misfired in past years, while the company hasn't launched an important new drug in a decade.</p><p>To try to counteract that, the conglomerate is working hard to develop its offerings of reproduction treatments, a sector where it has a world leader status. Merck's existing drug portfolio for infertility includes Gonal-f (follitropin injection) for follicle stimulation, Ovidrel pre-filled syringe to deliver recombinant human choriogonadotropin for egg maturation, and Cetrotide (cetrorelix injection) to prevent premature ovulation. The importance of infertility treatments to Merck's health was underscored last year by ovulatory stimulant Gonal-f which saw its sales grow by 14.9%, making it the group's third-largest-selling drug. </p><p>The German group's business development strategy is increasingly emphasizing this and follows a strategic review by management which identified fertility treatments and technologies as being key activities going forward, according to the conglomerate's deputy CEO-elect Stefan Oschmann. </p><p>"We asked whether the pharmaceutical approach to treating infertility is so mature in major markets that it is going to be commoditized by the arrival of biosimilars and other innovations &#8230; We decided that's not the case," Oschmann said in a recent interview.</p><p>"We also looked at 'Big Sign' trends, like fertility demand in emerging markets and development of higher parental age &ndash; women today want to have children later in life than in the past &ndash; and came to the conclusion that this continues to be an important business. We [also] concluded that the main unmet need was in the embryology area. Our aim is to provide solutions beyond the drug for IVF centers and physicians."</p><p>With that in mind the German conglomerate has been busy striking alliances with other players in the field.</p><p>In May, Genea Biomedx Pty. Ltd. gave Merck KGAA worldwide rights to three of its marketed fertility treatment devices and future pipeline developments. The deal brings Merck beyond the pharmaceutical approach to treating infertility and gives it rights to Gavi, an automated vitrification instrument that reduces errors and increases embryo and egg cryopreservation efficiency. It will also sell Genea's Geri benchtop incubator, with time-lapse cameras and six chambers for separate patient processing in one instrument, and the Gems embryo cultivation culture medium. </p><p>One month later Merck launched the new Eeva (Early Embryo Viability Assessment) Test with the Xtend Algorithm, the advanced version of a non-invasive test to aid embryo assessment within assisted reproductive treatment. </p><p>The group also established a global fertility alliance between Illumina Inc., Genea and the group's pharma division, Merck Serono. Oschmann says that collaboration's aim is to improve consistency in Assisted Reproductive Treatment (ART) worldwide. "It will bring about more standardization, process organization and offer improved incubator technology and a science-based embryo-selection process," he added. </p><p>Asked how the reproduction strategy will evolve with Merck's plans to expand into China and other developing markets, he replied: "The worldwide fertility market is currently worth more than &euro;8bn and predicted to grow to around &euro;13bn by 2020/21. The hormonal treatment part of that is around &euro;2bn. It's a huge market and it's growing fast. And there's large market potential beyond the drug segment. In China we expect between 15 and 20% annual growth of the fertility market there. The one child per couple policy there has made child fertility even more precious a treatment," he said.</p><p>There is also a lot of growth potential in other emerging markets for fertility treatment. </p><p>"Even Africa, which might seem counter intuitive, but there are many couples in Africa that do require access to fertility treatment, given the stigma for women that infertility has there. In India we have our regular business approach which is focused on urban centers and people who can afford the medication but we have no fertility program in India yet. But the biggest potential for us is in East Asia, in particular in China &ndash; but also in mature Asian markets such as Japan and South Korea."</p><p>Meanwhile, the prosperous Old World is aging &ndash; a situation where infertility treatments and devices can help. "Germany and Italy, especially," he said.</p><p>But China will also need an increased birth-rate in coming years to manage economic growth.</p><p>"The Chinese are going to face severe demographic challenges in 10 to 15 years when they'll also have an aging population and too low a birth rate. So shifting gradually from a one child per couple policy to a sustainable approach is a major challenge for the Chinese authorities there - and we see a lot of growth in this market in China because many couples there want to have a child."</p><p>The company had some bad news earlier this year when its fertility drug Pergoveris (follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa) missed its primary endpoint in a Phase III study called ESPART in which Pergoveris was being compared with GONAL-f for multifollicular development as part of an ART treatment cycle in women classified as poor ovarian responders. The executive said Merck Serono aims to further clarify the clinical opportunity for recombinant lutropin alfa in poor responders, but that, for the moment at least, Pergoveris has been stopped in its tracks. "After the failure of Pergoveris [in ESPART] we don't have any fertility drug candidate in Phase III trials." </p><p>That means Merck remains on the look-out for cutting edge drugs with promise in reproduction.</p><p>"Our ultimate goal remains to find innovative solutions to help infertile couples at every stage of the reproductive cycle. If we see a promising external innovation project then we'd be interested, and we're scanning the market continuously. We're also open to licensing approaches, and small scale M&A," Oschmann said, without elaborating. He declined to identify possible targets of interst.</p><p>But he believes combining technology with reproduction therapies is the field's way to the future.</p><p>"Any pharma company today wants to go beyond the drug and into solutions. And solutions are usually based on a drug and a technology plus data, analytics and services that emanate from that and that's what we're trying to do in this very specialized fertility field. You should also expect that we'll work with digital health, start-ups on patient management, on management approaches or apps for managing the embryonic lab &ndash; so we want to be an almost full-service provider in this field," Oschmann said.</p><p>
