<p><p>Depomed is willing to bet it on its recent launch of pain drug Nucynta, rather than take Horizon Pharma at its current offer of $29.25 per share. The specialty pharma thinks there is more value in going it alone, but they might be passing up a solid combination. </p><p>On 07 July, Horizon made public its intentions to acquire Depomed in an all-stock transaction worth about $3bn. The offer stands as a 42% premium to Depomed's closing price of $20.64. Depomed shareholders responded by pushing the stock up 34.74% to close at $27.81 on 07 July. The closing stock price didn't surpass the offer price &ndash; indicating the Horizon offer could be right in line with the company's worth. </p><p>Hoizon says the combined company with have pro forma sales of $950m and EBITDA of $350m through the sale of 13 marketed products. </p><p>The offer was apparently not Horizon's first attempt at acquiring Depomed, but its third offer to the company. Horizon Chairman, President and CEO Tim Walbert said in a letter to Depomed shareholders that Horizon first approached the company on 27 May and then again on 02 June, but was rebuffed both times. </p><p>Depomed continued to turn down the offer in a letter to Horizon made public on 07 July that stated that the "proposal does not reflect the inherent value of Depomed in light of the company's standalone prospects" and fails to adequately value the Nucynta (tapentadol) franchise. </p><p>Depomed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-paying-1.05bn-for-Janssens-US-Nucynta-rights-356173" target="_new">acquired the pain drug</a> from Johnson & Johnson in January for $1.05bn and relaunched the drug last week. The spec pharma had $114m in product sales during 2014 and expects Nucynta could double that. </p><p>In a letter sent to Mr Walbert from the Depomed board of directors, the company noted that it's been going through a four-year transformation into a focused specialty pharmaceutical company that has increased its share price 330%. </p><p>"Depomed's transformation has delivered tremendous value to its shareholders, with Depomed's stock price recently reaching an all-time high of $28.16 on April 27, 2015. The Board notes that the Proposal suggests an acquisition premium of approximately 3.9% over such price. Together with Depomed's significant growth opportunities that extend well into the next decade, our Board believes the indicated value of the Proposal of $29.25 substantially undervalues Depomed and its business," said the letter. </p><p><b>A missed opportunity?</b></p><p>Despite Horizon's insistence that it's dedicated to make this combination happen, the company executives wouldn't give any further information on how much higher they are willing to go to make the deal happen and indicated that it's looking at other prospects. </p><p>Horizon Chief Business Officer Bob Carey called the deal price a "full and fair offer" during a call with investors on 07 July. "We have got a very well-developed perspective on the intrinsic value of Depomed and it is one that we are going to be disciplined in our approach to, but we are not going to speculate on what it is going to take to get a transaction done," he added. </p><p>Horizon has said that it's willing to negotiate with Depomed if the company will allow for due diligence, but also indicated that it has other prospects. "So as we are looking at other transactions, we are targeting specialty and orphan, and opportunistically in primary care," said Mr Walbert during the call. "And as we have said, Bob and his team have really put a process in place where we have a funnel of anywhere from 20 to 40 opportunities that we are looking at in any one point in time and in dialogue on many of those. And we are in active dialogue on several different assets as we speak."</p><p>Depomed may want to act quickly if it is interested in negotiating. Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry also noted that the current deal price is a "sound transaction." Yet, he added in his 07 July note to investors that "HZNP likely to be active on the M&A front, with or without DEPO."</p><p><p><p>
