<p>Biotechnology companies ended 2014 with $6bn in new venture capital in their pockets, which was the biggest annual total since 2007, but that's after private startups and early-stage businesses raised $2bn in the fourth quarter alone &ndash; the biggest single-quarter total in at least 19 years.</p><p>The MoneyTree Report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) with data from Thomson Reuters, which goes back to 1995, shows no other quarter in which biotech companies have exceeded the $2bn fundraising mark. And 2007's $5.99bn full-year total was the only other year to exceed or come close to 2014's $5.97bn total. </p><p>So was 2014 a sign that a bubble is about to burst, since 2007's robust VC fundraising preceded a global economic recession, or does last year's biotech total merely reflect rising valuations based on a variety of costs, improvements in innovation and other factors? </p><p>That remains to be seen, but the pace of venture capital investment in 2015 is not slowing down. First quarter biotech company fundraising announcements neared $800m halfway through January, including $715m in venture capital deals during the first full week of the year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FUNDING-ROUNDUP-One-startup-six-public-companies-raise-cash-356063" target="_new">10 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Funding innovation</b></p><p>Atlas Venture has launched 18 biotech companies during the past two years, including the next-generation immunotherapy developer Surface Oncology, the autoimmune disease specialist Padlock Therapeutics and the gene editing company Intellia Therapeutics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Padlock-raises-23m-for-new-autoimmune-disease-approach-355771" target="_new">19 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/VC-UPDATE-Polaris-closes-450m-fund-in-biotech-friendly-US-market-355269" target="_new">26 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Atlas partner Bruce Booth told <i>Scrip</i> during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference from 12 to 15 January in San Francisco that the VC firm is investing in technology coming out of academia and entrepreneurs in drug development. Also, he noted, "the fruits of genomics are ripening," leading to new drug targets worth exploring.</p><p>There are a couple of caveats to the surge in venture capital funding during the fourth quarter of 2014, however. The $2bn raised during the last three months of the year went to 112 companies after 144 biotech firms raised $1.4bn during the last quarter of 2013. That means fewer companies found investors to back new ideas or next stages of drug development last year than during the year before, although individual companies collected more cash in 2014 than in 2013.</p><p>Also, fundraising continues to be difficult for biotech startups. Eighteen companies raised $216.5m in seed funding or in their first round of venture capital during the fourth quarter compared with 35 startups that raised $250m in their first-ever funding rounds during the same period in 2013. </p><p>Atlas is somewhat of an anomaly in biotech &ndash; a VC firm with a preference for brand new biotech companies &ndash; but venture capitalists that fund biotech companies in early stages of drug development and beyond are finding support from investors, otherwise known as limited partners.</p><p><b>VC firms see more cash</b></p><p>With the exuberance for biotech investments apparent in packed presentation rooms during the JP Morgan conference and continued interest in life science initial public offerings, venture capital firms that fund the industry are raising new cash. Perhaps some of the excitement will spill over to the earliest-stage companies.</p><p>The Canadian venture capital fund CTI Life Sciences has raised Can$134m for its second fund, which follows a Can$100m fund raised in 2006. The first fund has exited its investments in three companies, including Enobia Pharma, which was acquired by Alexion Pharmaceuticals for up to $1.1bn at the end of 2011 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Alexion-to-acquire-Enobia-for-up-to-1Bn-in-rare-disease-tie-up-325280" target="_new">29 December 2011</a>). </p><p>Montreal-based CTI's second fund will continue to invest in therapeutics as well as medical device and health care information technology companies in Quebec and other Canadian territories with a third of the capital reserved for US-based firms.</p><p>Also, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) is in the middle of raising its 15th fund, which will total up to $2.5bn, according to a Form D filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 13 January. NEA closed a $2.6bn fund in 2012 with roughly $650m for biopharma investments (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-2.6bn-NEA-venture-fund-could-invest-650m-in-biopharma-333216" target="_new">26 July 2012</a>). The new fund could be the VC firm's fourth consecutive fund to total $2.5bn or more.</p><p>Last year was the biggest year for venture capital firm fundraising since 2007, according to NVCA and Thomson Reuters. Firms across all high-tech, life science, financial and consumer industries raised $29.8bn in 254 funds, which is the most since 236 funds accumulated $30bn in 2007. </p><p>If NEA succeeds in raising $2.5bn this year, its multi-purpose fund will exceed the largest fund raised in 2014 &ndash; the $1.7bn Andreessen Horowitz Fund IV. </p><p><b>Exits boost VC capacity</b></p><p>Successful exits have made it possible for funds to raise new capital. NVCA and Thomson Reuters report that 115 venture-backed companies across all industries went public in the US in 2014 and 455 venture-backed companies completed mergers and acquisitions last year. Among the 132 deals that disclosed their values, the M&A total was $46bn, including five (out of seven total) life science transactions with a combined disclosed value of $2.4bn.</p><p>NVCA president and CEO Bobby Franklin noted in the association's report that: "2014 was an exceptionally strong year for the public markets, creating favorable conditions for venture-backed companies to make that long-awaited IPO [exit]. With the technology sector grabbing all the headlines, it's worth noting that for the second year in a row biotechnology companies accounted for more than half of all venture-backed IPOs."</p><p>There were 59 biotech initial public offerings during 2014, including 11 IPOs that raised $1.2bn during the fourth quarter.</p><p>Biotech companies in 2015 are benefitting from the recent increase in IPOs, M&A and venture capital fund capacity. Moderna Therapeutics announced $450m in new cash in early January, making it the largest single funding round ever in biotech (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Moderna-raises-450m-most-ever-for-private-biotech-355938" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Other recent beneficiaries of the biotech VC funding boom include:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Financing</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Use of proceeds</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>CoLucid Pharmaceuticals;</p><p>Durham, North Carolina</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CoLucid completed a $37.1m Series C preferred stock offering led by TVM Capital Life Sciences with participation from new investors Novo Ventures and Auriga Partners.

The drug selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors in the trigeminal pathway, making up a new drug class called ditans than do not cause vasoconstriction common with triptans that are used to treat severe headaches. CoLucid previously raised a $16.5m Series A round in 2006, a $25m Series B in 2008 and $7.5m in debt in 2011 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/New-firm-Colucid-raises-16.5-million-61070" target="_new">25 January 2006</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CoLucid-raises-25-million-for-oral-migraine-treatment-1758" target="_new">3 July 2008</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CoLucid-raises-7.5M-for-Phase-II-oral-migraine-therapy-320599" target="_new">1 September 2011</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cortendo;</p><p>Radnor, Pennsylvania and Goteborg, Sweden</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>RA Capital Management, New Enterprise Associates and Broadfin Capital, along with prior supporter HealthCap, are funding a private placement of up to $27.5m.
