<p>Amgen/ Onyx's second-generation proteasome inhibitor Kyprolis (carfilzomib) has doubled progression-free survival in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma in the head-to-head ENDEAVOR trial that pitted it against Takeda's older proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade). </p><p>Top-line data from an interim analysis show that patients with relapsed multiple myeloma treated with Kyprolis had a statistically and clinically significant improvement in median PFS, the study's primary endpoint, over Velcade of 18.7 months versus 9.4 months (HR=0.53, 95% CI, 0.44 - 0.65). Both drugs were given on top of low-dose dexamethasone in 929 patients whose multiple myeloma had relapsed after at least one but no more than three previous therapeutic regimens. Overall survival data are not yet mature; the full data will be presented at ASCO in June.</p><p>In addition, the Kyprolis arm also beat the Velcade arm in the secondary objectives of higher overall response rate and lower neuropathy events. Neuropathy is a key problem with Velcade that Amgen/Onyx hopes to improve on with Kyprolis.</p><p>However, Kyprolis performed less well than its older rival in terms of cardiac and renal failure, which were both higher than in the Velcade arm, but comparable to those seen with the newer drug in the previous Phase III study ASPIRE. Moreover, in ENDEAVOR, the incidence of hypertension and dyspnea in the Kyprolis arm was higher than with Velcade and that seen in ASPIRE.</p><p>This trial, which reported results at ASH in December, added Kyprolis on top of Revlimid (Celgene's lenalidomide) plus dexamethasone in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, and reduced the risk of death by 21% and improved quality of life. Median PFS, ASPIRE's primary endpoint, was 26.3 months for patients treated with Kyprolis, Revlimid and dexamethasone versus 17.6 months for Revlimid and dexamethasone alone (p<0.0001)></0.0001)><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASH-2014-AmgenOnyxs-Kyprolis-improves-survival-quality-of-life-355471" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 December 2014</a>). ASPIRE was a welcome relief for the product after the disappointing open-label FOCUS study, announced last summer, which did not meet its primary endpoint of improving overall survival (OS) when used as a single agent in 315 patients with relapsed and advanced refractory multiple myeloma, compared with an active control regimen of low-dose dexamethasone, or equivalent corticosteroids, plus optional cyclophosphamide.</p><h2>vindication</h2><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Dr Colin White said it was impressive that the median PFS was so much better in ENDEAVOR given that both drugs have such a similar mechanism of action. The data could lead to an increased uptake of the newer product in relapsed patients but their effect on first-line use is less certain, he added. </p><p>As such, the ENDEAVOR data provide some vindication for Amgen's 2013 acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, which seemed to some observers overpriced at $10.4bn. Kyprolis was a key attraction for the deal. It had been granted accelerated approval by the FDA in July 2012 for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) and had demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. The approval was based on response rate.</p><p>Dr Pablo Cagnoni, president of Onyx Pharmaceuticals said, "Demonstrating superiority over Velcade in this head-to-head trial supports our goal of ensuring continued improvement of patient outcomes and potentially establishing Kyprolis as the backbone of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma."</p><p>2014 full year sales of Kyprolis were $331m ($306m were in the US), leaving it a long way to go to compare to Velcade's current sales of around $2.5bn per year. Kyprolis is also now approved in Argentina, Mexico and Israel, and in the EU, the EMA has just accepted an MAA for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. </p><h2>crowded</h2><p>Meanwhile, the multiple myeloma field is also getting increasingly complex; just last month Takeda declared it would file for approval worldwide of its Velcade follow-on ixazomib, which is the leading oral proteasome inhibitor, in multiple myeloma on the basis of encouraging interim data from the 722-patient Phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, where it was compared with placebo when given in addition to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Filings-set-for-Takedas-ixazomib-on-Phase-III-data-356675" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 February 2015</a>). Velcade is due to lose US patent protection in 2017.</p><p>Velcade and Kyprolis are given intravenously or subcutaneously, and experts have said ixezomib's oral delivery route might mean it is associated with fewer side-effect concerns such as peripheral neuropathy, which will be especially useful when used as a maintenance therapy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-Takedas-oral-ixazomib-succeeds-as-myeloma-maintenance-therapy-355473" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Other treatments include Celgene's Pomalyst (pomalidomide) for patients who have failed at least two prior therapies including Revlimid and Velcade.</p><p>
