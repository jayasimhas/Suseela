<p>Roche has signed a deal with Celldex Therapeutics to test its immunotherapy MPDL3280A (also known as anti-PDL1 and RG7446) with Celldex's varlilumab, a CD27 targeting antibody, in a Phase I/II study in renal cell carcinoma. Varlilumab is currently being studied in two Phase I/II combination studies and more combination studies are planned. Celldex the latest trial was supported by promising signs of single-agent activity observed in a Phase I study in renal cell carcinoma. The company believes that combining an immune activator with a checkpoint inhibitor in this disease setting could augment this activity. Roche, which has US FDA breakthrough therapy designation for MPDL3280A in bladder cancer and NSCLC, has already presented preliminary clinical data of a combination of MPDL3280A with Avastin in first line metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</p><p>
