<p>AstraZeneca's executive vice-president of global medicines development and chief medical officer Briggs Morrison has stepped down from his position.</p><p>He is leaving to become the CEO of a small privately held biotech firm. Elisabeth Bj√∂rk, who currently oversees the CVMD therapy area in the global medicines development, will take on the role of chief medical officer on an interim basis until a permanent successor has been appointed. </p><p>Dr Morrison joined AstraZeneca in 2012 from Pfizer, and took up his current position in early 2013 when Mr Soriot placed his stamp on the company in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Soriot-sharpens-broom-in-AstraZeneca-C-suite-sweep-339086" target="_new">revamp of the leadership team structure</a>. He eliminated the then-R&D chief Martin Mackay and split the R&D functions into three: Mene Pangolos became executive VP if innovative medicines, Bahija Jallal executive vice-president of the MedImmune unit; and Dr Morrison rounded out the triumvirate in the CMO position. </p><p>Since then, the company has bolstered its pipeline through a series of deals and has a number of interesting pipeline prospects particularly in immune-oncology. However, the company has also had to deal with a few setbacks, with partner <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-dumps-brodalumab-AstraZeneca-losing-a-blockbuster-358573" target="_new">Amgen pulling out of development</a> of the anti-inflammatory brodalumab putting its future in doubt late last month, and the UK's HTA NICE has also expressed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shock-NICE-decision-on-AstraZenecas-olaparib-358700" target="_new">concerns over the cost-effectiveness</a> of the novel PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib). </p><p>
