<p> Companies developing products for rare diseases in the EU could be facing changes to the requirements for gaining orphan drug designation, after the European Commission announced that it planned to review the criteria for showing that a new product has a &quot;significant benefit&quot; over existing treatments. </p><p> Also in the offing is an examination of the criteria used to determine whether a new product is &quot;similar&quot; to an authorized orphan drug and can therefore not be approved during the 10-year exclusivity period following approval of the authorized product. </p><p> The commission says the review is needed because some &quot;weaknesses and challenges&quot; have been identified in the field of orphans which &quot;affect the reputation and the credibility of the system&quot;. It therefore plans to streamline the system and bring the requirements up to date with technical progress. </p><p> It will do this by updating its 2003 communication on orphan drugs, which outlines the criteria and procedures for orphan drug designation, as well as the EU marketing authorization and market exclusivity. It has asked the member states to notify it of any concerns they may have about the system, after which it will draw up a set of proposals and run out a public consultation during the second half of this year. It expects to adopt an updated version of the communication sometime in the first quarter of 2016. </p><p> The review will focus mainly on two key aspects of the orphan drug system: &quot;significant benefit&quot; and &quot;similar product&quot;. The first is used to determine whether a drug is enough of an advance over existing treatments to be granted orphan drug designation, and is described in the legislation as a &quot;clinically relevant advantage or a major contribution to patient care&quot;. The second is used to ensure that no product that is deemed to be &quot;similar&quot; to an existing orphan drug is approved for the same indication during the 10-year period (unless the MA holder has given its permission or the new product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior). </p><p> The problem is that these two concepts are not well defined in the EU orphan drug legislation. According to Vincenzo Salvatore, senior counsel at law firm Sidley Austin, the system has worked well and offered companies with orphan drugs the right incentives, but the definitions of the two terms are &quot;quite vague and don't provide any clear elements to clarify with sufficient certainty when a product should be considered similar or of significant benefit&quot;. </p><p> It is up to the EMA's orphan drugs committee (the COMP) to make a scientific assessment of significant benefit and similarity, but &quot;the more room you give to the scientific assessors to decide what should be considered similar and of significant benefit and similar product&quot;, the greater the risk of inconsistency, Mr Salvatore told Scrip. </p><p> Conversely, &quot;the more the notions are clear in the legislation, the less room for manoeuvre in the scientific assessment. We appreciate that it is difficult to provide a very narrow notion of 'similar' because similarity implies a comparison, and you can't define this in legislation. However, if you add additional elements and criteria to the definition, that would help the assessor to place the product inside or outside the box of similarity, and so reduce the risk of inconsistency&quot;. </p><h2> Clarifying the data requirements </h2><p> The matter was discussed at last month's Pharmaceutical Committee meeting, at which the commission said it was important to clarify exactly what type of data sponsors needed to show to demonstrate significant benefit over authorized medicines (this criterion does not apply if there are no available treatment options for the condition in question). </p><p> As for the definition of &quot;similar&quot;, it said it would &quot;like to ensure that the definition of 'similar' is suitable. In light of the experience to date, the European Commission will re-examine the definition of 'similar products' and will assess the need to review this definition&quot;. </p><p> To allow it to take an informed decision on the two terms, it has asked the member states whether they have any concerns regarding the interpretation of the orphan legislation laid down in the 2003 Communication. </p><p> Specifically, it wants comments on: </p><ul> <li> The criteria for orphan designation, for example the criterion of significant benefit; </li><li> The procedure for the designation, re-evaluation and removal of the orphan designation from the commission registry; </li><li> The orphan EU marketing authorisation; </li><li> Market exclusivity and similarity. </li> </ul><p> The commission has not gone into any great detail regarding what needs to be done with these definitions, but some indication of the issues regarding &quot;significant benefit&quot; was given in a January 2012 paper on the conclusions of a workshop in late 2011. Participants at the workshop agreed that a better definition and structure of the scientific justifications for significant benefit was needed, &quot;including a review of the level and type of data requirements&quot;. </p><p> As there are no procedures allowing the submission of data on significant benefit after the product has been approved, &quot;strengthening the input on significant benefit at the time of protocol assistance/scientific advice appears to be a crucial step,&quot; it was suggested. </p><p> The workshop also agreed that there was a need for more comprehensive public information on the assessment of significant benefit, and in general more on the orphan criteria, particularly at time of marketing authorisation. &quot;It is necessary to provide clear, robust and well-structured information on the scientific basis for assessment of significant benefit, which can be of use to any stakeholders with responsibilities on medicinal products after marketing authorisation.&quot; </p><p> It added that more interaction and information exchange between the COMP and the CHMP [the EMA's main scientific committee] on significant benefit would be welcome &quot;in order to discuss and better define the data required for significant benefit, particularly regarding secondary endpoints in relation to major contribution to patient care, and different comparators&quot;. </p><h2> What's to come? </h2><p> Nor is it clear exactly what will eventually emerge from the public consultation process. Mr Salvatore, who is a former head of legal service at the European Medicines Agency, said he had not yet seen any draft proposals from the commission, but there had been &quot;sufficient elements from practice at the EMA&quot; to allow for the fine tuning of what should be considered to be &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;of significant benefit&quot;. </p><p> &quot;I don't know in which direction the commission is moving,&quot; he said, but he hoped it would take into consideration the need for consistency with the approach followed in the US, as well feedback from regulators and industry. </p><p> &quot;What I would pay attention to if I were the commission is the situation in the US,&quot; he said. &quot;This is one of the major success stories of co-operation between the FDA and the EMA, which have a common template for applying for orphan drug designation. The more you can reach a common approach on these notions, the easier it will be for the pharmaceutical industry to understand.&quot; </p><p> &quot;You cannot work ignoring what has been done in field of orphan drugs in the framework of co-operation between the EMA and the FDA, so I would try to share the same notion and the same approach, or else to propose a new notion but to be aware and possibly check in advance that the FDA will support this, Mr Salvatore suggested. &quot;A major risk when fostering collaboration between regulators on occasion of revising legislation is to jeopardise future co-operation in a field like orphan drugs where co-operation has proved to be very successful.&quot; </p><p> There have also been suggestions along the way that reaching a decision on significant benefit should involve more input from health technology assessment (HTA) agencies, possibly as part of the EUnetHTA initiative, which is looking to bring HTA bodies closer together. </p><h2> List of orphan incentives </h2><p> The commission is also planning to update the inventory of the incentives that the EU and the member states make available to support research into, and the availability of, orphan medicines. Under article 9(3) of the orphan regulation (No 141/2000), the commission must update this inventory on a regular basis, but the last edition dates from 2005 and is due for an overhaul. </p><p> The commission says it is planning to write to all members of the Pharmaceutical Committee (which represents member states) asking them for information on their own national incentives for orphan drug development, and will use this to update the inventory by the end of this year. </p><p> At the Pharmaceutical Committee meeting, the commission presented data showing that it has authorized a total of 113 orphan medicines to date, and that there are 1,153 products in development that have orphan designation. </p>
