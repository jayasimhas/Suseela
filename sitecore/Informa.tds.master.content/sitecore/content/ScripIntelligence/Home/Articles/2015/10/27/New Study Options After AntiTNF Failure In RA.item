<p>Doctors participating in a new, small study reviewed a Slovenian patient registry in an attempt to answer a long-unanswered question for rheumatoid arthritis patients: After failing to respond or following a short-lived response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as the AbbVie Inc. blockbuster <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) or Amgen Inc.'s <i>Enbrel</i> (etanercept), is second-line treatment with another anti-TNF therapy the best option or should other mechanisms of action be considered?</p><p>The answer, based on the review of Slovenian patient experiences, is that a TNF inhibitor (TNFi) may not be the best option for RA patients after they fail TNFi treatment in the first-line setting. Does the small study justify an immediate shift in RA treatment strategies? Maybe not, but there is another study in the works that also hopes to shed new light on treatment challenges for patients with severe joint damage and debilitating pain as a result of their disease.</p><p>Anti-TNF therapies are the first-line biologic of choice in RA, even though a significant proportion of arthritis patients fail to respond or they experience disease progression. But even with <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/A-test-for-anti-TNF-non-responders-Few-alternative-RA-therapies-available-359693" target="_new">a test to identify people whose RA won't respond to a TNFi</a>, there <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-RA-pipeline-has-limited-new-options-359695" target="_new">aren't many options for non-responders</a>. With solid footing in the arthritis market, companies that own anti-TNF agents don't have a lot of financial incentive to study alternative treatments or the best sequencing for approved therapies.</p><p>"The anti-TNFs have been in the market for 10 years and doctors have experience with it," noted Ani John, senior medical science director in Genentech's immunology group, in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>John said there have been few head-to-head studies to compare the effects of TNFi and other RA therapies when patients switch from first-line to second-line therapies, but "it's an incredibly worthwhile endeavor to take on."</p><p><b>Slovenia Seeks Anti-TNF Answers</b></p><p>Because treatment guidelines are "vague" and "since no head-to-head [randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs)] comparing switching to TNFi versus non-TNFi have been performed thus far there is no evidence that one strategy is better than the other," five doctors from the University of Ljubljana, the university's Institute of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, and the University Medical Center Ljubljana wrote after they reviewed Slovenia's patient registry and published the real world evidence they found in the journal <i>Clinical Rheumatology</i> in September.</p><p>The doctors reviewed the treatment of 688 RA patients, including 238 people who failed or stopped responding to first-line TNFi therapy and published their results on behalf of Slovenian rheumatologists. </p><p>In the second line, 130 RA patients were given another TNFi and 108 patients were treated with one of two therapies from Genentech, a Roche company &ndash; 31.5% received the CD20-targeting biologic <i>Rituxan</i> (rituximab) and 68.5% got the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist <i>Actemra</i> (tocilizumab). </p><p>"When we talk to rheumatologists, they want to know what to do next and what is the data to support it. Studies like this are important to add to the body of evidence of what happens when a patient switches," Dr John said.</p><p>After first-line TNFi failure or loss of response to therapy, 60 out of 130 Slovenian RA patients who switched to another TNFi failed in the second line (46.1%) compared with 16 failures out of 108 patients (14.8%) in the non-TNFi group (p<0.001). also,="" after="" two="" years="" of="" treatment,="" only="" about="" 30%="" of="" second-line="" tnfi="" patients="" remained="" on="" therapy="" compared="" with="" about="" 80%="" in="" the="" non-tnfi="" group.=""></0.001).></p><p>"We have done quite a lot of work in this area looking at US data," John said. "This is not a surprising treatment pattern. It's consistent with how rheumatologists think and practice."</p><p>The results remained statistically significant even after adjusting for confounders: the non-TNFi group had higher baseline disease activity and patients who stopped first-line TNFi treatment due to adverse events were more likely to be treated with a non-TNFi in the second line.</p><p><b>A First Look At Second-Line Alternatives</b></p><p>The Slovenian investigators believe that their study is the first to look at the difference between patients who are treated with an anti-TNF agent in the second line and patients who are treated with alternative biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic agents (DMARDs) after a first line TNFi failure.</p><p>They noted that the Slovenian patient data "supports recent observations that in patients with rheumatoid arthritis failing their first-line TNFi, switching to either rituximab or tocilizumab might be a better strategy than switching to an alternative TNFi."</p><p>The Slovenian rheumatologists hope that an ongoing Phase IV clinical trial in the UK, known as the SWITCH study, will provide "high-quality evidence" regarding effective second-line RA treatments. The study enrolled 477 patients who failed first-line anti-TNF therapies. The change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) at six months is the primary outcome measure.</p><p>Patients were randomized for two years of treatment with the TNF inhibitors Humira, Enbrel, UCB Inc.'s Cimzia (certolizumab pegol) and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (infliximab) or Simponi (golimumab) in one cohort, while individuals were treated with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator Orencia (abatacept) in the second cohort, with Rituxan in the third cohort. Secondary endpoints will assess disease activity and safety at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 96 weeks.</p><p>In the US, where payers are picking and choosing which RA therapies to cover, John said the Slovenian study and the SWITCH trial give payers "another piece of information to support looking at what would be another treatment option."</p><p><p><p><p>
