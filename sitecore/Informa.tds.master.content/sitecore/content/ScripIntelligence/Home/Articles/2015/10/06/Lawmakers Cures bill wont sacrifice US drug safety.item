<p>Surrounded by patients and their advocates, a bipartisan group of leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee insisted during a 16 June Capitol Hill press conference a bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise would not forgo patient safety by speeding up the drug development and approval processes. </p><p>"Everyone here is concerned about safety and we're never going to sacrifice that," said Representative Frank Pallone (Democrat-New Jersey), ranking member on the E&C Committee.</p><p>"There are those out there who say that any change we make to the way FDA approves drugs and medical devices inherently will mean that the byproduct is not safe. And that's not true," he argued. "What we've found from talking with patient and advocacy groups is that you can make changes," Mr Pallone said, insisting that those changes could mean even better safety.</p><p>The New Jersey lawmaker's remarks came in response to questions about a <i>New York Times</i> op-ed co-authored by former FDA Commissioner Dr David Kessler, now a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, who charged that the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which passed the E&C Committee on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">21 May</a>, "could substantially lower the standards for approval of many medical products, potentially placing patients at unnecessary risk of injury or death." </p><p>Dr Kessler and his co-authors said the legislation would weaken the FDA's regulatory processes by allowing consideration of drug approvals based on clinical experience, "replacing scientific data from large numbers of patients in well-designed and controlled clinical trials."</p><p>The <i>Times</i> op-ed authors also raised concerns that the legislation would "mandate the use of biomarkers" to approve a wider variety of drugs, "far beyond just those for serious and life-threatening conditions."</p><p>But Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), E&C Committee chairman, contended that the biomarker objections were largely due to the lack of people the FDA has on hand to review drugs under such a clinical development process. </p><p>He argued the additional $550m lawmakers have proposed in the Cures bill should remedy that issue and allow the agency to hire more people.</p><p>"We have dramatically increased funding for the FDA, so they won't have an excuse not to fill those spots," Representative Upton declared. </p><p>"We all want safe drugs and devices," he said. "We know that you can streamline the process. But we also knew that we had to add to FDA's resources for what we're asking, demanding them to do, and we do that."</p><p><b>Full House vote 'soon'</b></p><p>Representative Upton would not predict a date for when the Cures bill would be called up for a vote by the full House &ndash; only telling reporters it would be "soon."</p><p>"We are very close," the lawmaker said.</p><p>He said there are a "couple of little concerns" that are being worked out with other members of the House on the legislation, although Representative Upton declined to disclose what those issues involved.</p><p>"We are communicating together," he said. "We want as strong of a vote as we can. We don't want any member to have an excuse of voting no." </p><p>Representative Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), who has been Mr Upton's partner on the Cures legislation, insisted the bill was not being delayed.</p><p>"We are still finishing up the final touches," she said. "There's nothing insurmountable."</p><p>Representative Upton acknowledged the Senate is well behind the House on its companion bill.</p><p>"Our goal was to get it signed before end of the year," he said. "I think we can still make that target."</p><p><p><p><p><p>
