<p> Novartis AG's skin cancer drug <i>Odomzo</i> (sonidegib) has been approved in the EU for use in patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (LaBCC). </p><p> Odomzo, which is already approved in the US, Australia and Switzerland, is an oral, selective smoothened inhibitor that regulates the hedgehog signaling pathway. Novartis has previously highlighted that hedgehog signaling plays a critical role in stem cell maintenance and tissue repair and also in advanced basal cell carcinoma. </p><p> The approval applies to all 28 EU member states, plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, and is based on data from the Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center BOLT (Basal cell carcinoma Outcomes in LDE225 Trial) study in patients with laBCC not amenable to local therapy or metastatic basal cell carcinoma (mBCC). In patients with laBCC treated with Odomzo 200 mg, the objective response rate (ORR) was 56% per central review and 71% per investigator review. The median duration of response per central review has not been reached. The median progression-free survival was 22 months per central review and 19 months per investigator review. </p><p> LaBCC is Odomzo's first approved indication, but Novartis is developing the product in a number of other cancers, including: brain cancer (currently in Phase II trials); acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; Phase II); myelofibrosis (Phase I/II); pancreatic cancer (Phase I/II); breast cancer (Phase I); colorectal cancer (Phase I); and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; Phase I). </p><p> According to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, Novartis' product is one of only two drugs to have been approved that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway. The other approved therapy is Roche Holding AG's Erivedge (vismodegib), which is also approved for basal cell carcinoma. </p><p> Other players developing hedgehog drugs in the clinic include Pfizer, which has glasdegib in Phase II; and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which has LY2940680 in Phase I. </p>
