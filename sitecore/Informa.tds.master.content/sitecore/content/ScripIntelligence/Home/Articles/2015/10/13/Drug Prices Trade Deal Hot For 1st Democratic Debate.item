<p>Prescription drug prices and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are sure bets to be among the hot cards played on Oct. 13 in Las Vegas at the first of six debates among the 2016 Democratic contenders, former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and those three other guys &ndash; former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and former US senators James Webb (VA) and Lincoln Chafee (RI).</p><p>Clinton and Sanders have taken staunch stands against the TPP and have made no bones about how they feel about the significant prescription drug price increases by Turing Pharmaceuticals AG and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc., calling those moves "gouging."</p><p>Sanders already had been in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Forget-Sovaldi-generics-new-pricey-drugs-poster-child-355087" target="_new">hot pursuit</a> of the drug pricing issue &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introducing legislation</a> in September with Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) aimed at reining in the costs of prescription medicines and stopping price gouging. The two lawmakers also already had opened an investigation into the matter last year, with Sanders leading a Senate <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Drug-price-yellow-signs-market-canaries-or-lemons-355217" target="_new">hearing</a> to examine the issue &ndash; something Cummings is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pricing-Policy-Panic-Persists-Subpoena-Demands-Vex-Valeant-360715" target="_new">hoping to soon do</a> in the House, although no date has been set for such a forum.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">turmoil</a> over Turing's nearly 5,550% price increase of its toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim gave Clinton the perfect opening to spotlight her <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">health plan details</a> &ndash; which largely resembles Sanders' proposals.</p><p>The night before the debate, Twitter was alive with speculation about how often "drug prices" and Turing CEO Martin Shkreli's name would be brought up at the Oct. 13 debate.</p><p>Shkreli joined in, actually tweeting a question to Sanders and Clinton asking whether they preferred a lower price for Daraprim, which he argued is "overwhelmingly paid for by 'Corporate America' and their insurers," who he said are reporting "record profits," or have Turing use its resources to research a new drug for resistant strains of toxoplasmosis, which he called a "neglected disease."</p><p>"Does it make sense that we're using a 70-year-old drug to treat an ever-evolving parasite? Why hasn't 'big pharma' cared about innovation in toxoplasmosis?" Shkreli demanded in his tweet. "If Turing didn't show up and show interest in this illness, how long would it take for a new toxoplasmosis medicine to be developed?" he asked. </p><p>Shkreli, by the way, also had been retweeting tweets throughout the day from Sanders' campaign &ndash; declaring on Twitter the Vermont lawmaker, who has condemned the Turing CEO with scorching criticism, "has some good points." </p><p>But just days earlier, Sanders had blasted Shkreli in an Oct. 9 statement for his "blatant profiteering" and for hiring an "army of new Washington lobbyists and lawyers to stem the massive fallout from his actions and to stymie congressional oversight" &ndash; asserting the Turing chief was "holding hostage the patients who rely on this lifesaving medication, as well as the hospitals that administer it, by charging unconscionable prices for a drug on which he has a monopoly &ndash; just because he can."</p><p>Sanders even used the "skyrocketing" drug prices as the basis for declaring on Oct. 9 he planned to vote against President Barack Obama's choice to lead the FDA, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/A-Califf-Regime-The-Disruptor-FDA-Industry-Needs-360491" target="_new">Robert Califf</a> &ndash; citing his "extensive ties" to the industry.</p><p>"At a time when millions of Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs they need, we need a new leader at the FDA who is prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and work to substantially lower drug prices. Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that Dr. Califf is not that person," said Sanders, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is expected to hold a confirmation hearing on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Califf-Praised-As-Thoughtful-Choice-To-Lead-FDA-360469" target="_new">FDA commissioner nominee</a> next month.</p><p>The senator made his disdain for drug makers known even further on Oct. 11 by condemning the TPP on <i>NBC's</i> Sunday political program <i>Meet the Press</i> as being "written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street."</p><p>Last week, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-Execs-Obama-Go-Face-To-Face-Over-TPP-360879" target="_new">Clinton also came out against the TPP</a> &ndash; breaking with her former boss President Obama &ndash; declaring she was "not in favor of what I have learned about it" and said there were "still a lot of unanswered questions."</p><p>She also said she was worried "pharmaceutical companies may have gotten more benefits," while patients and consumers got "fewer" in the TPP, whose negotiations among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">ended in agreement on Oct. 5</a>.</p><p>O'Malley, Webb and Chafee appear to be members of the same chorus line as Sanders and Clinton on the drug prices and the TPP issues, but the Las Vegas stage may provide the three men an opportunity to dance to their own beats &ndash; the breakout moment political pundits are salivating over.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
