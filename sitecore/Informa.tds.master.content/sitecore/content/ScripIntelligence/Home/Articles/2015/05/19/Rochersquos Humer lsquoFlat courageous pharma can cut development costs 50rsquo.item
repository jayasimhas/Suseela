<p>Franz Humer, chair of Roche, believes the pharma industry has to fundamentally change the way it manages costs in order to survive. He believes it is possible to bring down the cost of developing a drug by 30-50% over the next five years. </p><p>Dr Humer says he has never experienced a time of such "rapid and fundamental change" in his 40 years in the pharma industry. "Innovation takes time and comes at a price. Increasingly, policy makers all over the world are implementing tougher measures to reverse the healthcare spending curve. The question: 'Does our society still want healthcare innovation and is it willing to pay for it?' needs to be asked."</p><p>Speaking at the FT global pharmaceutical and biotechnology conference in London on 5 December, he told delegates that "all aspects" of cost management had to be addressed. "This industry needs a different perspective on operating costs," he stated. Companies that want to stay innovative have to move towards "leaner headquarters and smaller central functions; get rid of duplications and get rid of excessive reporting standards". The pharma industry needs the "courage" to operate in "flatter organizational structures". </p><p>Dr Humer sees the need to simplify organizations as critical. "I know this is easier said than done as organisations have an inherent capacity to resist change and resist simplification because it means layoffs and restructuring." However, the industry has to trust its regional offices across the world "to run their businesses". Big pharma needs to "get away from the notion that headquarters know best, that headquarters are more important than the periphery". </p><p>On the question of cutting the costs of drug development he said that "One way to do this is to get more innovative in designing and conducting clinical trials," he said. "New forms of collaboration play an important role here." </p><p>"It would be too easy to say R&D is a black box and there's nothing we can do about it." Instead, Dr Humer believes all companies should examine their R&D investments more closely. Management should be asking the following questions: "Are our research ambitions realistic? Do we have the right priorities for our size and financial resources? Do we really have to develop every product only because it is safe and effective? And how do we explain our choices to our own scientists, let alone the outside world?"</p><p>But he acknowledges that reducing cost is not a viable long-term strategy. It is, however, "a prerequisite for sustainable growth". For innovation-driven companies, R&D productivity is "the make or break". Pharma companies need courage, again, "to accept the uncertainty; to take risks and explain those risks", he stated. </p><p>However, he concedes that whatever the conclusions, genuine breakthroughs in the pharma industry are difficult to achieve and many instances of innovation are the result of "serendipity and luck combined with knowledge and expertise". While luck can't be controlled, companies must create conditions where innovation can thrive. "Innovation needs a decentralized management approach." This is why, at Roche, its key units (Genentech, Chugai, Roche) operate fully independently, according to Dr Humer. "They are fully empowered to make their own decisions. They manage their own budgets, set their own priorities and decide where they are going to do their research."</p><p>It is also vital to strike the right balance between internal and external innovation, he added. Roche has 150 collaborations worldwide, he noted. "One third of our pipeline and one third of the products we market originate from original partnerships."</p>
