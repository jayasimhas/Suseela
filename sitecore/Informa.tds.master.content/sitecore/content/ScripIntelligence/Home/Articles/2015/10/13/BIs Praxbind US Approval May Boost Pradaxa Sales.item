<p>The FDA on Oct. 16 gave privately held Boehringer Ingelheim GmgH the go-ahead to market its humanized monoclonal antibody fragment Praxbind (idarucizumab) under an accelerated approval as an agent to reverse the blood-thinning effects of the company's highly popular anticoagulant Pradaxa (dabigatran) in emergency surgery or urgent procedures or in situations when there's life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. </p><p>Praxbind is the first drug available in the US to reverse Pradaxa, a direct thrombin inhibitor indicated in the US to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients who have been treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for five to 10 days and to reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in patients who have been previously treated.</p><p>Having Praxbind available may help boost the use of Pradaxa, whose sales have recently been stagnant.</p><p>Indeed, Praxbind's approval may allow Pradaxa to gain an edge over competing novel oral anticoagulants &ndash; Pfizer Inc.'s and Bristol-Myer Squibb Co.'s Eliquis (apixaban), Bayer Corp.'s and Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Xarelto (rivaroxaban) and Daiichi Sankyo's Savaysa (edoxaban), which are all factor Xa inhibitors, said Jack Allen, an analyst with <i>Datamonitor Healthcare</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He said much of Pradaxa's recent decline in sales may have been caused by a drop in physician confidence in prescribing the drug, due to the dangers associated with the lack of a reversal agent. </p><p>Public confidence in Pradaxa also has been impacted, Allen said, noting BI has paid out $650m in more than 4,000 lawsuits involving the anticoagulant. </p><p>"The approval of this antidote will help mitigate physician concerns about the lack of reversibility of Pradaxa's effects in emergency situations," Allen wrote in a July <i>Datamonitor</i><a href="http://www.datamonitorhealthcare.com/pradaxa-sales-likely-to-rebound-with-expected-approval-of-antidote/" target="_new">report.</a></p><p>The increased confidence in the safety of Pradaxa-treated patients is expected to boost uptake of the drug as physicians begin to transition back to the product as a safer anticoagulant, he said.</p><p>Praxbind has been shown to bind specifically to and inhibit Pradaxa with no other expected interactions.</p><p>After Praxbind's application gained a priority review from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BIs-Pradaxa-antidote-idarucizumab-wins-US-priority-review-358036" target="_new">FDA in April</a>, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the likelihood of the drug gaining the agency's nod at 89%. But the <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts raised those chances to 91% in June following BI's report of positive data from its Phase III RE-VERSE AD trial, which demonstrated that Praxbind 5g immediately reversed the anticoagulant effect of Pradaxa in patients requiring urgent anticoagulant reversal, with no safety concerns identified.</p><p>Praxbind's accelerated approval was based on a reduction in unbound Pradaxa and normalization of coagulation parameters in healthy volunteers. </p><p>BI acknowledged it may need to complete a confirmatory study to keep Praxbind on the US market under the FDA's accelerated approval program.</p><p>The FDA in June 2014 dubbed Praxbind a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Boehringers-Pradaxa-antidote-idarucizumab-deemed-breakthrough-by-FDA-352537" target="_new">breakthrough therapy</a> &ndash; a status aimed at expediting the regulatory process of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
