<p>The overwhelming majority of currently approved companion diagnostics are for oncology indications, but AstraZeneca wants to change all that and has signed to deals aimed at bringing companion diagnostics to respiratory disorders and heart disease. </p><p>One of these deals, signed with diagnostics giant Abbot, is to develop a test to identify patients with severe asthma who are most likely to benefit from the Phase III candidate tralokinumab. </p><p>Under the agreement, Abbott will develop and commercialize a diagnostic test to measure serum levels of the proteins periostin and DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), which have been identified as potential predictive biomarkers of up-regulated IL-13. </p><p>"Severe asthma is a complex disease and different pathways result in similar signs and symptoms," explained Dr Koustubh Ranade, senior director of R&D at AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit. "We believe patients whose severe asthma results from IL-13 will benefit from tralokinumab." </p><p>The tests will be developed in conjunction with AstraZeneca's Phase III trial of tralokinumab. Periostin has been previously described as a potential biomarker for asthma, while DPP4 was identified by MedImmune as promising predictive biomarker.</p><p>"The Phase III trial [in severe asthma] is on track for completion in 2017," added Dr Ranade. A Phase II trial in IPF is currently ongoing. </p><p>A second deal sees AstraZeneca join up with researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada to search the genomes of up to 80,000 patients for genes associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><p>Under the collaboration, MHI will genotype DNA samples from AstraZeneca's biobank. The samples include both tissue and blood samples, which have been collected over a period of 12 years under informed consent from patients who have entered clinical trials.</p><p>The aim is to find the "missing heritability" of complex diseases, explained Ruth March, AstraZeneca's vp of personalised healthcare and biomarkers. When the human genome was sequenced, researchers expected the genetic components of diseases to be unveiled. This was not the case. "We will use next-generation sequencing methods to find these missing genetic components, using large numbers of patients," she said.</p>
