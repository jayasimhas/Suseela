<p>Otonomy saw its share price plummet by nearly 18% in after-hours trading on 21 May after it announced that its investigational treatment OTO-104 for Méni&egrave;re's disease had failed a Phase IIb trial. That a range of secondary endpoints were met and the company's decision to move it into Phase III based on the data evidently failed to settle investors' nerves.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the 154-patient trial, reduction in vertigo frequency during the third month following treatment, compared with a one-month baseline period, was "narrowly missed", Otonomy declared. OTO-104 demonstrated a 61% reduction from baseline in vertigo frequency in month three, versus 43% for placebo (p=0.067). </p><p>Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive, following the lead-in period, a single intratympanic injection of 12mg of OTO-104 or placebo gel vehicle.</p><p>Secondary vertigo endpoints included count of definitive vertigo days, change in vertigo severity score from baseline, and change in average daily vertigo count from baseline. The trial also assessed tinnitus as an exploratory endpoint, but OTO-104 demonstrated no treatment effects for this.</p><p>The drug was well tolerated and there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Persistent perforations of the tympanic membrane at the end of month four were observed in 2.6% of patients treated with OTO-104, which was consistent with findings from an earlier Phase Ib study as well as for published results on trials of intratympanic injection of steroid solutions.</p><p>Analysts at Sagient's BioMedTracker, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, highlighted also the tapering of efficacy into month four in describing the results as "not positive". However, they thought the "modest signal" on the primary endpoint may be enhanced by limiting treatments to patients with more severe vertigo, although the numbers of patients in that category was not revealed. Nonetheless, the company said it would probably use the same endpoint in a three-month Phase III study, and would be cautious about overly narrowing the patient population based on severity rather than increasing the number of patients treated. The analysts lowered their estimation of the drug's likelihood of approval by two percentage points to 22% pending further details of the Phase III studies.</p><p>"While the trial narrowly missed achieving statistical significance on the primary endpoint, we believe the clear efficacy trends observed along with the multiple secondary endpoints where statistical significance was achieved provide a solid basis to move OTO-104 forward into Phase III testing," said David Weber, president and CEO of the company. He said the firm would request an end-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA and begin two parallel Phase III trials in Méni&egrave;re's disease, the first to begin by the end of 2015.</p><p>
