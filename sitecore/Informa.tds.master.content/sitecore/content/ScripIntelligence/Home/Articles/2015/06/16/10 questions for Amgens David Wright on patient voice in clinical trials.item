<p>How best to incorporate the patient "voice" into a wider business strategy is a current hot topic for debate amongst pharmas and biotechs of all shapes and sizes. However, for most companies, a lot of ideas are still in the abstract phase. </p><p>One group with tangible evidence of how it is becoming a patient-centric firm is Amgen. From the recent development of a clinical trial "design center" to collate all aspects of study design and execution under one roof and partnerships with advocacy groups like PatientsLikeMe, Amgen is making strides in the area. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> caught up with David Wright, Amgen's global head of trial planning and platform services, at the recent Eyeforpharma Patient Centricity in Clinical Trials conference (#efpPCCT) in London, 8-9 June. He explained the challenges of putting the patient voice into a clinical trial process, the wider effect of this change on a large business and how by breaking down the silos, Amgen has a reshaped clinical trial process that is more patient friendly. </p><p><b>1. How does Amgen define patient-centricity?</b></p><p><b>David Wright:</b> We would say that patients have always been at the center of clinical trials. I think this idea of a "patient-centric" approach has been highlighted recently because recruitment and retention is becoming more problematic. It has always been challenging but trials are getting larger and competition between companies working in the same indication is increasing. There's a need to design trials and reduce the burden on patients and sites in order to address these recruitment issues. In short, we would define patient-centricity in this setting as designing trials to, where possible, meet patient preference and reduce the burden of the trial on the patient. </p><p><b>2. When was Amgen's trial 'design center' created and why did the company follow this path?</b></p><p>The design center idea was conceived early last year but it was really implemented in the fourth quarter of 2014. So it's quite new. </p><p>The approach was chosen because we recognized that the design process and the execution of a trial were separated. For example the team designing the trial wasn't necessarily taking into consideration the feasibility of running that trial. Secondly, we had a silo approach to developing trials. Each therapeutic area team took a different approach to developing trials and taking into consideration operational factors.. So taking those two considerations the idea was to establish a center of excellence in trial design, which combines expertise in trial design, innovative trial design methods, but also is a center of gravity where operational experts in executing clinical trials, experts in data around trial performance and experts in design can come together. We have all this expertise, from data analytics to the operational staff who will actually take the trial forward, together in the same room making sure that trials are designed to be successful. </p><p><b>3. What has Amgen been doing in the area of patient-centricity that other companies haven't?</b></p><p>At the Eyeforpharma meeting in London there was a lot of theorizing on various methodologies to reach the patient and understand their concerns or preferences around trial design. But certainly Amgen in the last 6-12 months has explored actual techniques on actual trials. We have utilized experience feedback from patients and we have tried various methods to gather this information and use it to make decisions on current projects. I was pleased to see that Amgen is making good progress.</p><p><b>4. What technology does the company use to assist its patient-centric trial approach?</b></p><p>We are very interested in the mobile technology aspect. It shows great promise for the patient-centricity angle to really reduce patient burden, patient visits to sites for example. There is the potential to various trial data through wearable tech perhaps at home, through the internet. But we have not taken the step to actually implement any of those technologies yet. We are on the cusp of exploring these tools. </p><p><b>5. What concerns do you have around using new technology, such as wearable devices, in the trial process?</b></p><p>My concerns in this area are around how validated the data collected through mobile devices is compared to hospital-based assessments. Also privacy and security are major issues. And I think acceptance of the data by regulatory bodies for clinical endpoints is also a question. These are quite substantial issues to be further explored. The way Amgen will start discovering this area is likely to be through piloting some technologies on specific trials in the near future. </p><p><b>6. What key learning would you pinpoint so far from Amgen's use of the patient voice in clinical trial design?</b></p><p>It is very important to agree a strategy for collection and use of patient insights early on in a product's development. The techniques we have explored can be long and complex to set up so it's important to have that insights strategy agreed early on. You need to spot the gaps in where you need patient insight and decide what will be the approach, considering any constraints because of the type of trial or the population you are studying. You need to decide the appropriate methodology for addressing those gaps early on. </p><p><b>7. Can you think of one specific example of how Amgen has successfully implemented a patient view into atrial process?</b></p><p>For one of our neuroscience products we utilized a questionnaire, developed with PatientsLikeMe, and deployed that survey to their online patient community to understand more about that community's awareness of clinical trials and their preferences about study designs.. We received some useful insights around the design of that trial, which the team were able to reflect on when deciding various tactics in similar projects. </p><p><b>8. Can a patient-centric model work for all pharma and biotech firms?</b></p><p>I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. Patient-centricity is sort of a hot, trendy topic but actually the success will be when it's completely integrated into how we develop medicines. When it is not an add-on or afterthought and is instead fundamental to the process of developing drugs. </p><p><b>9. What has been the most difficult part of this process of incorporating patient voice into the trial process?</b></p><p>The most difficult aspect is how to demonstrate the value of a new process. Having teams participate in a new way of doing things, that's always quite a challenge. But in this area, because we don't yet have tangible metrics to demonstrate the success of this approach, there is an element of needing to have organizations conceptually believe it's a good idea and that it will improve the clinical process. </p><p><b>10. Finally, for other companies looking to bring the patient voice into the design and running of their trials, what advice would you give?</b></p><p>Dip you toes in the water! I always think of the question "How do you eat an elephant?" and the answer is "In small bites." It's important to start small and start to understand the values in insight collection approaches. Perhaps work with specific teams in piloting particular approaches in various areas. If you try to boil the ocean and try to implement a grand patient insights strategy across the entire business it will be difficult to achieve. </p><p>Also it is still difficult to demonstrate what the advantage of being patient-centric is to the organization. People can see philosophically that involving the patent in the clinical trial is the right thing to do but actually within the pharmaceutical industry, with all the pressures on the cost of developing drugs etc, you need to show what the actual benefit to the product development process is. And that's still difficult to show. So start small and show successes then build on it. </p><p>
