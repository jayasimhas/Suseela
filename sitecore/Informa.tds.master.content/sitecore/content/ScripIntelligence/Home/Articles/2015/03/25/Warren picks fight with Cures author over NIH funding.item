<p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat-Massachusetts), who some Democrats are trying to recruit to run for US president in 2016, picked a fight on 24 March with the Republican leading the House effort to overhaul certain functions at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other areas of the US biomedical research and development enterprise.</p><p>While Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, has said he cares about research and has acknowledged the NIH needs more funding, his draft 21st Century Cures legislative package, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">released in January</a>, "doesn't provide a single new dollar from Congress" for the agency, Senator Warren charged during a 24 March Capitol Hill hearing. "Not one dollar."</p><p>"Talk is cheap," she declared.</p><p>"It doesn't matter what Republicans say about innovation if their budgets actually cut support for NIH," Senator Warren asserted. "It doesn't matter that House Republicans put the word 'cure' in the name of a bill if the bill doesn't put one new dollar from Congress into NIH to help fund those cures. Something needs to change. Families are losing loved ones to incurable and untreatable diseases while we do nothing. It is time for Congress to stop talking about medical research funding and actually do something about it. People are counting on us."</p><p>The Massachusetts Democrat said every single member of Congress she's spoken with has insisted they support the NIH and more medical research.</p><p>"But medical research takes money and Congress has done absolutely nothing to actually get more money into the agency," she said.</p><p>But, Senator Warren argued, over the past 10 years, "Congress has been chocking off vital funding for medical research and has been reducing the buying power of the National Institutes of Health by nearly 25%."</p><p>And, she said, while the Republicans' Senate and House fiscal year 2016 budget plans released last week both declare they support more medical research funding, they actually lower the caps "that are already crushing our research agencies, making it likely that agencies like NIH would see cuts, not increases, under these plans."</p><p>Senator Warren insisted a legislative proposal she drafted, the <i>Medical Innovation Act</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-How-to-beat-China-in-innovation-race-Fine-pharma-356354" target="_new">unveiled in January</a>, would help fix the funding problem by boosting the NIH's budget by about 20%.</p><p>"And it achieves that increase without raising taxes, without gutting vital programs and without adding to the deficit," she contended. </p><p>"There's no reason that every Republican, Democrat and Independent in Congress shouldn't be able to support it," Senator Warren said, noting that her plan has garnered the support of more than 30 nonpolitical doctor, patient and scientific organizations, like the American College of Surgeons, the National Women's Health Network and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.</p><p>"If people don't like this idea, then they should bring other solutions to the table," she declared. </p><p><b>Effects on industry R&D</b></p><p>At the 24 March hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Warren asked a panel of witnesses how "gutting" the NIH's funding has affected the life sciences industry.</p><p>"Our historical investment into NIH has been absolutely the basis of our life sciences ecosystem and all of the innovation that we have here in this country. It is absolutely essential for the future," said Alexis Borisy, a partner at Boston-based venture capital firm Third Rock Ventures.</p><p>But, he said, the NIH's diminishing resources will have long-term effects on "one of the most dynamic sectors of our ecosystem, our economy."</p><p>Mr Borisy said one effect he's seen is that the best talent from academia &ndash; junior and senior faculty &ndash; are now moving to industry. </p><p>And while that's good for companies in the short term, he warned that in the long term, it's ultimately damaging for the biomedical R&D enterprise, "because these people in the past would have gone on to amazing academic efforts, which would have spawned many, many companies and many, many innovations."</p><p>The lack of NIH funding, added Dr Bruce Sullenger, director of the Duke University Translational Research Institute and a professor of surgery, has been "crippling, to be blunt."</p><p>"Not only are we losing people from the academic setting, we are losing them to other countries," Dr Sullenger declared. "Now we are having a loss of our best and brightest leaving the US to go to Asia because they are investing more."</p><p>"NIH funding is a critical element and it really is a great return on investment," said Michael Mussallem, chairman and CEO of device maker Edwards Lifesciences. "That early investment in research answers some key questions that then causes the private sector, like us, to jump in and move products to patients. So there's a return on investment when you get that early research right and answer some tough questions, then you encourage others to follow."</p><p>Answering those basic science questions is particularly critical for antibiotic R&D "if we are going to jumpstart the pipeline," added Dr Allan Coukell, senior director of health programs at the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p><p>"And those are questions that companies aren't in a position to address," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
