<p><p>With an official rejection of Teva's offer, Mylan says it's uninterested in the Israeli company's poor track record and doesn&rsquo;t want its shareholders to take over stock that carries such risk. </p><p>"After thorough consideration, Mylan's Board unanimously determined that Teva's proposal grossly undervalues Mylan, and would require Mylan's shareholders to accept what we believe are low-quality Teva shares in exchange for their high-quality Mylan shares in a transaction that lacks industrial logic and carries significant global antitrust risk," said Mylan Executive Chairman Robert Coury in a 27 April statement. </p><p>"In addition, we also believe that the proposal does not address the serious challenges of integrating two fundamentally different and conflicting cultures under a Teva Board and leadership team with a poor record of delivering sustainable shareholder value," the exec added. </p><p>Teva made a public $82 per share offer for Mylan on 21 April that would consist of 50% cash and 50% Teva stock. The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Rejections-All-Around-Mylan-to-Teva-Perrigo-to-Mylan-357994" target="_new">$40bn offer</a> came about a week after Mylan <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-generic-consolidation-Mylan-goes-after-Perrigo-357722" target="_new">made public its intentions</a> to acquire Perrigo for $205 per share, or $29bn. </p><p>Teva is scrambling now that a biosimilar version of its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) has been greenlit by the FDA. The company has lost investor and analyst faith over the last few years as its undergone several changes, including the public &ndash; and messy &ndash; exit of its CEO Jeremy Levin. The Israeli company has vowed that it's back on track, but it has a pipeline that has yet to prove itself and the bid for Mylan isn't an easy win. </p><h2>Mind your manners</h2><p>Mylan publicly denounced Teva's offer &ndash; <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylans-Coury-on-Teva-deal-without-logic-357962" target="_new">before it was made public</a>, making the official rejection completely expected. Yet, Coury had some thinly-veiled criticisms for Teva management in a publicly-disclosed letter to Teva's CEO Erez Vigodman. </p><p>"I was very disappointed by your decision to make your interest in Mylan public without first taking the time to speak to me or meet in person. As those who know me will attest, I always am willing to discuss opportunities to create value for Mylan's shareholders and other stakeholders, and although it was after-the-fact, I was happy to grant you the opportunity to meet with me in person to hear your rationale outlined in your letter," said Coury to Vigodman in the letter. </p><p>"During our meeting, we touched on Teva's many struggles throughout the last several years, including the approval of the first generic version of your flagship product Copaxone (despite Teva's claims that an AB-rated generic would never be approved); the persistent turnover and turmoil amongst the Teva leadership and Board and the resulting strategic confusion; Teva's consistent underperformance in comparison to the market and our industry; and your increasing need to find new sources of future growth," he continued. </p><p>Coury continued his berating of Vigodman, saying, "Through your leadership, you had the opportunity to set the right tone, and show the world that there is a new Teva. Instead, you chose to approach Mylan in a way that demonstrates that the old Teva is very much still alive, which only continues to beg questions about Teva's credibility&#8230; I do hope you find a way to eventually change Teva's culture and establish credibility in your business dealings."</p><p>Coury made clear in his letter that any company wishing to acquire Mylan would have to open discussions with an offer of $100 per share, and that stock could only be part of the deal-mix if the acquirer has a strong stock position. </p><p>Hammering home his point, Coury added, "It is important to note that given the massive overlap between our companies, the synergizing of redundant or similar efforts and products will inherently have a major negative impact on the very growth prospects you are aiming to extract from Mylan. What will be left is a short-term financial pop and longer-term value erosion."</p><p><p>
