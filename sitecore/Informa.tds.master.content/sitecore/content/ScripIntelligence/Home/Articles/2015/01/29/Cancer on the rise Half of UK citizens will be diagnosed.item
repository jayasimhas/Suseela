<p>One in two people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime, according to new research from charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK), creating an urgent need for the NHS and other stakeholders, including pharma, to bolster plans for dealing with treatment demands.</p><p>Previous estimates had put the figure at one in three, but CRUK has applied a more accurate methodology in this most recent study, published in the <i>British Journal of Cancer, </i>which shows that cancer incidence is higher than previously thought. While the new methodology accounts in part for the higher figure, the study also shows that cancer rates are rising in real terms as well.</p><p>Professor Peter Sasieni, the study author, said that the main reason for the increased incidence is that people are living longer. Around two thirds of the rise in cancer incidence since the last estimate can be attributed to old age, but one third is down to other, often preventable factors such as lifestyle choices.</p><p>The most common cancers, including lung, breast, prostate and bowel, are forecast to remain the same, but others are on the rise. According to Professor Sasieni, rates of oesophageal cancer and melanoma are rising rapidly.</p><p>Harpal Kumar, CRUK's chief executive, said: "We need to plan ahead to make sure the NHS is fit to cope. If the NHS doesn't act and invest now, we will face a crisis in the future." He said that the priorities must be a focus on prevention and early detection, which together reduce the costs of cancer treatment as well as improving survival. </p><p>However, treatment development and drug-based prevention methods will also play a crucial role. In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, he noted in particular the need for a broader range of treatments which address more patients while inducing fewer side effects. With around 30% of industry's pipelines populated with oncology candidates, this is something pharma is already on top of.</p><p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) commented: "There are more new oncology medicines in the pipeline than any other disease area. We are at a point of transforming patient outcomes if we can harness new technologies and make them available to cancer patients. With a rising incidence of cancer the NHS needs to make a choice regarding how much it is willing to invest in the treatment of these patients."</p><p>Pharma company Roche also defended pharma's record: "Pharmaceutical companies like Roche invest significant money in developing medicines to treat cancer. In the last three years alone, Roche has introduced five new oncology medicines. Almost all of the oncology medicines we have introduced in the last 20 years are considered to be targeted medicines. The inclusion of Perjeta (pertuzumab)in the treatment regimen of women with HER2-positive breast cancer extends survival by nearly 16 months compared to the previous standard of care, taking the survival time to beyond five years &ndash; this is unprecedented."</p><p>Dr Kumar also emphasized that there is room for drug developers to look into chemoprevention methods, such as vaccines, or drugs like aromatase inhibitors which have the potential to reduce the incidence of breast cancer by around 50% in high risk patients. There are only a handful of prophylactic vaccines in development currently, but Merck & Co and GlaxoSmithKline have enjoyed huge success from their human papillomavirus vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix respectively, which protect against cervical cancer (although these work by preventing infection with the virus that causes the cancer). As well as commercial success, the vaccines have likely contributed to the fact that rates of cervical cancer are dropping. </p><p>In addition, Dr Kumar noted that industry has begun to play a wider role in cancer strategies. "Some companies are looking at their broader health franchises and thinking about the role they might play in earlier detection and earlier diagnosis. These are areas where industry is very important and could continue to be very important in the future."</p><h2>UK systems need fixing</h2><p>Meanwhile, there are other factors in the UK which need to be fixed to allow industry to fulfil its potential as a partner in fighting the rise of cancer. For example, access to treatments in some patient groups, such as the elderly, is poorer in the UK than in other comparable countries. </p><p>Dr Kumar also pointed out that historically the UK has been slower to adopt treatment innovations. This is due to a number of factors including budget limitations and physician conservatism. The UK is also lacking an integrated system to allow innovation to be disseminated through the NHS, said Dr Kumar. </p><p>One major issue is the role of NICE, and the existence of the Cancer Drugs Fund which has recently begun cost assessments on cancer drugs (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cancer-Drugs-Fund-table-12-drugs-delisted-six-refused-entry-356128" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 January 2015). "The vast majority of people have the view that [the Cancer Drugs Fund] is not a long-term solution," said Dr Kumar. "We're strongly of the view that we need a better system for the future, that doesn't completely separate the process from NICE as it does now, but is integrated with NICE."</p><p>However, "NICE needs to evolve its processes in how it evaluates new cancer drugs," he added. "There is work now underway for a more permanent solution." </p><p>The ABPI agrees, saying: "Current methodologies are no longer fit for purpose for evaluating cancer medicines. They represent a major block in ensuring patients get access to the latest innovative medicines. Significant NICE reform is required to bring the system of evaluating medicines into line with the current industry pipeline and changed regulatory environment which is seeking to make promising new cancer medicines available earlier for the patients who need them."</p><p>Roche added: "It is widely acknowledged that the system for accessing (and assessing) cancer medicines needs reform, and the recent review of medicines that will be funded through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has brought this discussion to the fore once again.Â  There is consensus in the cancer community that a more sustainable access mechanism is needed that gives the access of the CDF but the certainty and financial surety enjoyed by other healthcare systems."</p><p>The company went on, "Industry and the NHS now urgently need to look at the wider system of access to ensure that patients can continue to benefit from more established treatments which the CDF can no longer fund."</p>
