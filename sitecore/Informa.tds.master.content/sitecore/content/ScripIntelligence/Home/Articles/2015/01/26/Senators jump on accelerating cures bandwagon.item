<p>Nearly a year after the House got its effort underway to overhaul the US biomedical enterprise with the aim of achieving faster cures, Senators Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee) and Richard Burr (Republican-North Carolina) launched their own effort in the Senate &ndash; delivering a new report outlining their plan, dubbed Healthier Americans.</p><p>Representatives Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan) and Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) have spent months already on their effort &ndash; holding numerous hearings and roundtables on Capitol Hill and "listening" sessions in other parts of the country under their 21st Century Cures initiative, which they officially launched last May (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Time-to-go-big-on-cures-innovation-lawmakers-declare-351611" target="_new">5 May 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Scrip-100-Lawmakers-seek-RandD-enterprise-overhaul-for-faster-cures-353964" target="_new">16 September 2014</a>).</p><p>When it came time to reveal a draft legislative package, however, Representative DeGette this week jumped ship &ndash; declaring flatly on 27 January she did not support the direction Mr Upton had taken, although she hinted there may still be hope for a bipartisan agreement &ndash; just not on the current proposals (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Representatives Upton and DeGette are scheduled to appear together at a 3 February forum in Washington hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research, which may be a little awkward, given their recent split of opinions &ndash; although being at loggerheads is nothing new on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Senator Alexander, the new chief of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, insisted he and the Democratic ranking member, Senator Patty Murray (Washington), would embark on the "major initiative" together. </p><p>Yet, the Tennessee lawmaker chose instead to partner with another Republican &ndash; Senator Burr &ndash; on initiating the effort, which may reflect the uneasy path ahead to reach bipartisanship. </p><p>"While there are a number of senators in this body on both sides of the aisle who have worked hard on these issues &#8230; no one has been more effective, no one has worked harder and no one has had more foresight and vision on these issues than Richard Burr," Senator Alexander declared on the floor of the Senate on 29 January. </p><p>He said the <a href="http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/Innovation_for_Healthier_Americans.pdf" target="_new">report</a> was "substantially" Senator Burr's product, "and he'll be deeply involved."</p><p>Senator Alexander said he plans to hold a series of hearings, starting in March. He said lawmakers want feedback from the public on the report.</p><p>"Surely we missed something," he said.</p><p>Senator Burr took particular aim at the FDA in discussing the release of the report, insisting there needs to be a full review of the agency's funding, specifically, user fees, before the next round of negotiations begin on the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, which will expire next in 2017.</p><p>The North Carolina lawmaker&rsquo;s declarations may be a sign the FDA&rsquo;s spending may be in for closer scrutiny under Republicans than the agency was when Democrats ruled the Senate (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-spending-could-be-tightened-under-Republicans-354942" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The lawmakers also didn't hold back on criticizing the agency.</p><p>"FDA has struggled to regulate the most cutting-edge medical products. The disparity between the pace of scientific discovery and development outside of the FDA and the pace of growth in FDA's scientific knowledge threatens America&rsquo;s position as a global leader in medical innovation," they said.</p><p>The FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have an "enormous influence" on the US economy. </p><p>"Scientists from across the globe take seriously the findings and caliber of research that NIH funds, as well as the safety and efficacy of products FDA approves," the senators said.</p><p>But, they contended, "our global edge is slipping" &ndash; a worry NIH Director Francis Collins has often himself expressed (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-chief-laments-demise-of-US-biomedical-edge-356149" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>).</p><p>"The NIH and FDA must keep pace with today's cutting-edge scientific advances, manage and stay focused on their primary missions, and consistently and fully leverage the tools that Congress provides. Otherwise, any legislative efforts to address these challenges and reverse these worrying trends will almost certainly fall short. No one would be more disappointed by this outcome than America's patients," the lawmakers said. </p><p>After laying out a history of legislative attempts to fix the FDA and the NIH, and emphasizing the litany of challenges that remain at the agencies, the senator concluded there are five "major themes" they need to address in their reform efforts:</p><p>? It costs too much to bring medical products through the pipeline to patients</p><p>? As science and technology advance, the discovery and development process takes too long for medical products to make their way to patients</p><p>? FDA's responsibilities have grown to include many activities unrelated to the core function of regulating medical products to advance the public health</p><p>? The disparity in scientific knowledge at FDA and the fast pace of biomedical innovation are slowing, and in some cases, stifling innovation in American medicine</p><p>? A working FDA is essential to continuing biomedical innovation in the United States and maintaining America's global leadership in medical innovation</p><p>Congress' tasks ahead, the senators said, will be figuring out how to enable the FDA to consistently and transparently apply the best science to reviews and policymaking that guides development protocols; eliminate barriers and inefficiencies that increase cost, increase time and distract the drug and device regulatory agency from its core mission; and ensure the cost of development is not a barrier to new medical products.</p><p>"Simply creating a new partnership has not worked over the last ten years," they said. "Merely putting out guidance may not help if it is applied inconsistently and is never revised to account for the best science that exists outside the FDA. We need to leverage the brilliant innovators, scientists, and entrepreneurs outside of government to reform the process, ensuring American patients have access to the best care possible. Together, we can confront these challenges head on and ensure that America innovates for patients &ndash; now and in the future."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
