<p>The European Commission has approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in its second indication, squamous non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>The approval, specifically for patients with previously treated advanced squamous NSCLC, makes Opdivo the first immuno-oncology drug to be approved in Europe for lung cancer and represents a major advance in treatment. </p><p>Just last month, the product received <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BMS-secures-1st-European-approval-for-PD-1-drug-Opdivo-cleared-for-melanoma-359064" target="_new">its first EU approval</a>, for both first-line and previously treated advanced melanoma patients, when it became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in Europe for any cancer indication. It has also just <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-Opdivo-blows-Exelixiss-Cometriq-kidney-cancer-data-out-of-the-water-359526" target="_new">shown promising Phase III results</a> in a further indication, renal cell carcinoma, in the CheckMate-025 study.</p><p>Opdivo was first approved (by Ono Pharmaceuticals) in Japan for melanoma last July. This was followed by US approvals for both melanoma (in December) and squamous NSCLC (in March).</p><p>Its main rival, Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), gained an EU CHMP positive opinion for first-line and previously treated advanced melanoma in May. This product has additionally been filed for use in the US for EGFR mutation-negative and ALK rearrangement-negative NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (the PDUFA date is set for 2 October 2015).</p><p>Opdivo's latest EU approval was based on the results of CheckMate-017 and -063 studies. In Checkmate -017 nivolumab showed a 41% reduction in the risk of death versus docetaxel, and demonstrated nearly doubled overall survival at one-year versus chemotherapy (42% vs 24%).</p><p>In Europe, lung cancer accounts for 20% of all cancer deaths. Squamous NSCLC accounts for approximately 25% to 30% of all lung cancers. BMS notes that for patients with NSCLC, whose disease reoccurs or progresses despite chemotherapy, treatment options are limited and the five-year survival rate is only around 2%, globally. </p><p>
