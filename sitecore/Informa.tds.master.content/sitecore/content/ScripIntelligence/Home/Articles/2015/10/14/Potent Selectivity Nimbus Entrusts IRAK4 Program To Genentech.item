<p>Even the most ambitious early-stage biopharma has to prioritize which programs it will take on itself and which might advance more quickly and fully in the hands of a more-experienced and deeper-pocketed partner. Having used its computational chemistry platform to generate IRAK4 inhibitors with potential in autoimmune disease and B-cell lymphomas, Nimbus Therapeutics has licensed global rights to that program to Genentech Inc.</p><p>With one candidate in Phase I for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and several others advancing toward the clinic, Cambridge, Mass.-based Nimbus saw its IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) program as a core item in its pipeline, but determined that it might be best to turn it over to a partner for several reasons, CEO Don Nicholson said in an interview.</p><p>Under the deal announced Oct. 20, the Roche unit obtains a worldwide license for all of the biotech's preclinical, small-molecule IRAK4 inhibitors across all indications. Nimbus receives an undisclosed upfront payment and can earn pre-determined milestones and sales royalties as Genentech advances the program. No specifics of the financial terms were disclosed.</p><p>"A program like this can benefit by having the right partner, that can accelerate [the development progress]," Nicholson said. "This is a tough target. I think Nimbus has made some incredible breakthroughs and I think Genentech recognized that, and as other companies have as well. They're just the right company for us to partner this program with because we just know they'll be fully capable of accelerating it."</p><p>"The second element of it is that the Nimbus capabilities and the platform that we have &#8230; brought us a lot of bounty," the exec continued. "We do have a clinical program right now that is going extraordinarily well in Phase I and we're planning to enter Phase II next year, our ACC [acetyl-CoA carboxylase] inhibitor for NASH. And we have a deep portfolio of other things coming up, so for us it was the right balance of partnering programs that could enable them in a substantial way &#8230; but also allowing us to continue to focus on our core pipeline."</p><p>The licensing agreement resulted from a competitive process, Nicholson said, albeit not one in which his company advertised the IRAK4 program as a partnering asset. Having raised <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Nimbus-transitions-to-clinical-development-raises-43m-357362" target="_new">$43m in March in a Series B financing</a>, led by Pfizer Ventures, with Lilly Ventures and GlaxoSmithKline PLC's venture arm SR One participating as returning investors, Nimbus makes a point of keeping big pharma updated on its progress, he explained.</p><p>The firm does a lot of outreach at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in January, and leverages its position in the Cambridge area, he said. </p><p>"We want to always make sure that large pharma potential partners and potential partners in many different types of ways are aware of what we're doing," Nicholson noted. "A lot of them have pretty overt licensing efforts or groups that go and scout the landscape."</p><p>"We were already in discussions with Genentech prior to my arrival about a year ago as this program was evolving, as we were with a number of other companies," he added. "The bottom line is that as we look at the companies that we think could take care of our assets the best, the field starts fairly broadly but it narrows to the ones that are really committed to this therapeutic area and the target."</p><p><b>The Right Potency, Only The Right Target</b></p><p>What drew the interest of Genentech and other suitors, he explained, was the way Nimbus' platform &ndash; which stems from a long-term partnership with tech company Schrodinger Inc., in which Nimbus serves somewhat as a beta tester of new applications &ndash; offered solutions to the issues of targeting IRAK4, namely yielding and maintaining therapeutic potency and with optimal selectivity.</p><p>"That's been the challenge for all companies working on IRAK4 &ndash; highly potent molecules that are only going to hit IRAK4 and no other related kinases that also are endowed with drug-like properties, so that they'll behave well once you get them into humans," Nicholson said. "That's what our platform has solved."</p><p>Genentech is keeping its plans for the program, none of which is ready to enter clinical development just yet, close to the vest, but Nicholson indicated that potential indications could include a broad spectrum of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and gout, as well as mutation-specific cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstrom's disease and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.</p><p>While Nimbus can't disclose how much cash it is receiving from Genentech, the CEO did say it will "add to our runway in a very significant way." But that hasn't forestalled Nimbus from looking to the future, whether that will occasion an initial public offering, another private funding round or both.</p><p>"We're getting into some pretty capital-intensive clinical efforts; once we go into Phase II for NASH our capital needs are going to be pretty substantial," he said. "We're considering all sorts of different financing opportunities right now. We are thinking about an IPO and the right timing depending on the market. And we'll probably precede that with a mezzanine round where we're in discussions with various investors around right now, but that's one of many different financing options."</p><p>Nimbus may unveil Phase I data for its NASH candidate at the next JP Morgan confab next January in San Francisco, he added. In the meantime, it is advancing two other ACC inhibitors toward clinical development for hepatocellular carcinoma and solid tumors. It is developing individual ACC inhibitors for each planned indication, Nicholson explained, helped along by its platform's ability to fine-tune biodistribution of the molecule using well established and understood active transport mechanisms.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" Daily</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p>
