<p>The FDA has granted a priority review for Merck's supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab) at the 2mg/kg every three weeks dosage as a first-line treatment for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p><p>The agency set Dec. 19 as the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date for the sBLA, which was based in part on data from Merck's Phase III KEYNOTE-006 trial.</p><p>But the FDA also extended the PDUFA until Dec. 24 for a separate sBLA for Keytruda &ndash; that one as a treatment for patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma. </p><p>Merck said the delay for the latter indication was because it had submitted an additional analysis from its Phase II KEYNOTE-002 trial, which the FDA considered a major amendment to the application.</p><p>The firm said it submitted the extra information because it wanted to provide the FDA with the "most robust data" for Keytruda in that population.</p><p>Merck reported that the KEYNOTE-002 study demonstrated Keytruda was superior to chemotherapy in helping more patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma achieve progression-free survival.</p><p>Merck's rival, Bristol-Myers Squibb, also recently had its sBLA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Beefed-Up-Submission-Delays-Opdivos-1st-Line-Melanoma-Timeline-359932" target="_new">delayed for a similar reason</a> for its PD-1-blocking antibody Opdivo (nivolumab) as a first-line monotherapy for advanced melanoma &ndash; declaring that it submitted the additional data "to ensure the broadest dataset, irrespective of BRAF status, was available for review."</p><p>The new PDUFA for the Opdivo sBLA is Nov. 27.</p><p>The Opdivo delay did not affect the company's supplemental submission to market the drug plus BMS' Yervoy (ipilimumab) as a therapy for patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma, whose PDUFA is Sept. 30.</p><p>Merck's drug beat BMS' product to the US market in their respective initial melanoma indications &ndash; with the former firm making history <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">last September</a> when Keytruda became the first PD-1-blocking antibody approved in the US.</p><p>That first win for Keytruda was as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression in patients previously treated with Yervoy, and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</p><p>Opdivo's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">first approval</a> in melanoma followed a few months later in December 2014 for the same indication.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
