<p>The day will come &ndash; hopefully sooner rather than later &ndash; when the FDA approves most, if not all, drugs based on their mechanisms of action, said Dr Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research in New York. </p><p>"If you want to beat diseases with drugs, you have to define them by their molecular mechanisms of actions because that's where drugs do their thing," Dr Huber told senators during a 14 July Capitol Hill hearing.</p><p>To the FDA's credit, the agency has been "fairly flexible" with looking at mechanisms that cause rare diseases when it comes to approving medicines for those conditions, like relying more on animal data and biomarkers, he said. </p><p>But, Dr Huber told members of the Senate Space, Science and Competitiveness Subcommittee, "Once you understand mechanisms, you should be doing that with all diseases."</p><p>Unfortunately, he said, most of the FDA's processes are based on an "antiquated" definition of disease.</p><p>Dr Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor for research at the University of California, San Francisco, said some of FDA's policies may not be recognizing the new frontier of understanding disease mechanisms.</p><p>Indeed, said former Oklahoma Republican Senator Tom Coburn, "You are seeing science move so far ahead of the FDA."</p><p>"FDA knows they can't keep up. They know that they don't have the capability," he contended, adding that even Dr Janet Woodcock, head of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has admitted as much.</p><p>So, Senator Coburn told his former colleagues, the question is "what do you all do in legislation that takes the monkey off FDA's back," while ensuring the agency is the responsible, collaborative and cooperative agency it needs to be.</p><p>But, the former lawmaker said, "the barriers Congress faces in FDA reform are often self-created. You create them."</p><p>He pointed to the hubbub on Capitol Hill that erupted over the revelations about the cardiovascular events linked to Merck's Vioxx (rofecoxib), which the company removed from the market in September 2004.</p><p>Senator Coburn asserted the FDA "did a wonderful job on the approval process of Vioxx." </p><p>"They didn't make one mistake," he argued, insisting "There is no way you can be perfect 100% of the time in what we have set up for a regulatory regime for a new drug approval."</p><p>But the FDA took a "tremendous beating" from Congress, declared Senator Coburn, a physician who currently is acting as an adviser for the Manhattan Institute's Project FDA.</p><p>"And if any of us had been running the FDA, per protocol, as it should have been, we would have done exactly the same thing," Senator Coburn said, adding that no one in Congress considered the "millions of people who were back at work because they didn't have chronic pain anymore because of Vioxx."</p><p>"We sometimes as members of Congress are our own worst enemy," he said.</p><p>But when the FDA is subjected to lawmakers' fault-finding, Senator Coburn said, "it makes them less likely to take a chance on something that could be very beneficial to the country, because if there's a consequence of something going wrong then they want to protect the agency and they don't want to hear the screams that come from Congress." </p><p>"I don't blame FDA for being risk-averse the way Congress treats them," he said. </p><p>But given Congress holds control of the FDA's budget, the agency can't very well ignore lawmakers' criticisms &ndash; although Senator Coburn said it would be "really courageous" for regulators to do so.</p><p>But the former Oklahoma senator also said the FDA should be forced to become more collaborative, cooperative and transparent on the use of biomarkers for approving drugs, which he said would help get things moving at a faster pace at the agency.</p><p>"If you allow FDA to continue to not be cooperative and transparent or collaborative when it comes to biomarkers, you are going to see all this industry and all of the intellectual property go outside of this country," Senator Coburn said.</p><p>While he said the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">passed</a> the House on 10 July, is a "great move towards that," he argued "it's got to be better." </p><p>"It needs to be refined and perfected," Senator Coburn said, adding that he hoped the Senate would take those steps when it takes up its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Cures-aint-law-yet-Senate-concurrence-may-be-tricky-359391" target="_new">companion bill</a>. </p><p>"It's got to have some teeth in it to force FDA to be collaborative, to be transparent, because they haven't been," Senator Coburn charged. "If you do that, what we'll see is a marked move forward in terms of advances into cures for new diseases, not just treatments, but cures, and the identification of new pathways. And it will build on itself. It's happening now."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
