<p>The European pharmaceutical industry has filed a second complaint with the European Commission against national legislation allowing the off-label use of cheaper medicines where approved alternatives exist, for purely financial reasons. </p><p>The action is directed at France's off-label law, under which Roche's anticancer, <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab), is being reimbursed as of Sept. 1 for wet age-related macular degeneration even though two other approved treatments &ndash; Novartis's <i>Lucentis</i> (ranibizumab) and Bayer's <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept) are already available (albeit at a much higher cost).</p><p>The complaint was lodged by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the European Confederation of Pharmaceutical Entrepreneurs (EUCOPE), and the European biotechnology industry body, EuropaBio. EFPIA had said earlier this year that it was considering such action.</p><p>"EFPIA, EUCOPE and EuropaBio are concerned that the promotion of off-label use of medicines on economic grounds circumvents the robust EU authorization process for medicinal products, which sets rigorous standards for market approval for specific medical needs based on the benefit to risk ratio," they said in a statement. </p><p>The three bodies took similar action in January against Italian off-label legislation passed in May 2014, saying such moves undermined the EU drug regulatory system simply to make healthcare savings, and urging the commission to ensure that economic considerations don't take precedence over public health and patient safety. </p><p>The French law allows the regulatory body, the Agence Nationale de la Securité du Médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) to issue a temporary use recommendation (Recommandation Temporaire d'Utilisation, or RTU) for the use of a drug in an unapproved indication for financial reasons even if an alternative product is already available. </p><p>Both laws are aimed mainly at encouraging doctors to use <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/France-Sets-Precedent-With-Off-Label-Avastin-Move-360162" target="_new">Avastin in wet AMD</a> rather than Lucentis, although they could in principle be applied to other cases where the authorities wanted a cheaper unauthorized drug to be used in place of an approved therapy in order to make savings on the drugs bill. </p><p>And this is what the industry bodies are most afraid of. When they filed their complaint against the Italian law at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Italys-off-label-rule-turns-EU-system-upside-down-says-EFPIAs-Bergstrom-356704" target="_new">beginning of the year</a>, EFPIA's director general, Richard Bergström, told <i>Scrip</i> that the problem went much wider than just the Roche drug. "The point is that the law is there, even if we have no indication that the Italians have a long list of products they intend to do this for," he said. "The threat is still there." </p><h2>Contravening EU law?</h2><p>Announcing their complaint against the French law on Aug. 31, the three bodies said that such measures "not only undermine the EU regulatory framework but also contradict the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU, which prohibits member states from off-label use for economic purposes when an authorized alternative exists." </p><p>This is a reference to a 2012 ruling by the CJEU that Poland had contravened EU law by allowing the supply of unlicensed medicines on economic grounds, and had therefore failed to fulfil its EU law obligations to require the imported products to be properly authorized. The CJEU clarified the scope of the "special needs" exemption in EU law in respect of unauthorized medicinal products, pointing out that where an equivalent authorized medicine product is available, there are no special needs for an unauthorized product. </p><p>Bergström stated: "It is simply not acceptable for policy makers concerned with the size of healthcare spending to introduce legislation that not only contradicts EU law, but also puts the overall EU regulatory system aimed at guaranteeing the highest patient safety standards at risk. The pharmaceutical industry collectively calls on the European Commission to address this public health issue urgently and preserve those safeguards that have been put in place."</p><p>It's not clear what position the commission will take, although Paola Testori Coggi, a former head of the commission's health directorate, has in the past said that "the most responsible strategy" a national agency could take where there were doubts about the off-label use of a drug was to "protect public health regardless of the cost of the medicine", and that financial considerations "must not take precedence over the safety of patients".</p><p>The industry bodies say that off-label prescribing should occur only in specific situations where there is no approved therapeutic alternative and making sure that all safety measures and precautions have been taken. "Patients must be fully aware of the risks associated with the use of an off-label medicine and explicitly consent to its prescription."</p><p>Alexander Natz, secretary general of EUCOPE, said "it should be up to the physician to make the decision about the individual patient&rsquo;s treatment and not the legislator or payer". The commission had to "stop national developments infringing EU law," he declared.</p><p>Nathalie Moll, EuropaBio's secretary general, said: "What we are seeing in Italy and now in France may impact patient safety and sends a dangerous message that the assessment and supervision procedures laid down in European legislation are not respected."</p>
