<p>Protagonist Therapeutics raised $40m in Series C venture capital to take its first oral peptide drug candidate PTG-100 into clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).</p><p>Milpitas, California-based Protagonist plans to begin a Phase I clinical trial by the end of 2015 and start Phase I/II trials in 2016 for PTG-100, which blocks the alpha-4-beta-7 integrin associated with IBD. The company also intends to advance earlier-stage assets in its pipeline, including an oral Interleukin-23 (IL-23) receptor antagonist.</p><p>"IBD and other chronic gastrointestinal diseases and disorders represent areas of growing and unmet medical need, where oral targeted therapy drugs could offer significant advantages and differentiation over injectable biologics," Canaan Partners principal Julie Papanek said in a statement from Protagonist. </p><p>Canaan led Protagonist's latest VC fundraising effort, which was backed by three other new investors &ndash; Adage Capital Management, RA Capital Management and Foresite Capital. Prior investors, including pharma company VC arms, also invested in the funding round: Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Lilly Ventures, Pharmstandard and Starfish Ventures.</p><p>Protagonist previously raised an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Protagonist-raises-18m-series-B-346774" target="_new">$18m Series B</a> round that closed in September 2013, which was more than two years after the company signed a deal with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Ironwood-taps-Protagonist-for-novel-peptide-therapeutics-308859" target="_new">Ironwood Pharmaceuticals</a> to discover oral peptide drugs targeting IL-6 for inflammatory diseases. Ironwood and Allergan market the oral guanylate cyclase-C agonist Linzess (linaclitide) for inflammatory bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and chronic idiopathic constipation.</p><p><p><p><p>
