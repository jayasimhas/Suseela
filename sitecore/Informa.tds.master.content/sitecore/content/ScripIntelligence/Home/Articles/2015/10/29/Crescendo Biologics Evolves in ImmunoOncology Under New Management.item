<p>First convinced as an investor by flourishing technology at Crescendo Biologics, Peter Pack has since been wooed to take up the position of CEO at the company. In a recent interview Pack told <i>Scrip </i>of his plans for transforming the firm from a resourceful technology platform business to a fully fledged oncology drug discovery company. </p><p>Established in Cambridge, UK, back in 2009, Crescendo develops Humabody VH therapeutics based on a transgenic mouse platform that takes advantage of <i>in vivo</i> optimization of biophysical properties during B-cell maturation. Its management team includes former executives and team members from Morphosys, CAT and Domantis, and CEO Pack himself started his career as an antibody scientist at MorphoSys where he co-developed its antibody technology HuCAL back in 1993. </p><p>Crescendo Biologics emerged with a $34m <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Crescendo-raises-17.5m-series-A-as-Astellas-ventures-in-348809" target="_new">series A funding</a> round in 2013, with investments from Sofinnova Partners, Imperial Innovations, EMBL Ventures and Astellas Venture Management. In December 2014 it announced further investment from Astellas Venture Management to support its new Humabody therapy. </p><h2>The Technology</h2><p>Crescendo is utilizing its Humabody platform to focus on discovering novel oncology therapies, and Pack is certain the time is right for Crescendo to move down this path. The company had spent its time before perfecting its technology and Pack's appointment is the first stepping stone in the new oncology drug discovery strategy.</p><p>"We have a really efficient transgenic platform delivering leads and now the question is 'How do we best leverage this?' We are not regarding ourselves as a technology platform company, we see ourselves as a drug discovery and development company now &ndash; so that's a real shift. We are extremely strong in the discovery and increasingly in the preclinical and clinical development field and see ourselves as an oncology company," Pack said. </p><p>Crescendo's Humabody molecules are created using its "Crescendo Mouse", a triple knock-out transgenic mouse without any interfering light chains that produces 100% human VH antibody fragments from the heavy chain, raised against particular targets. These can then be formatted to multispecific constructs for Immuno-oncology applications or otherwise modified, in a similar way to antibody-drug conjugates, to add a drug payload and produce a "Humabody Drug Conjugate" (HDC), like antibody drug conjugates (ADC), but to a VH in a defined way. </p><p>Pack emphasized that a VH is the smallest possible binding domain of an antibody, it's able to penetrate faster to the area of interest and bind with high affinity. Since it is 10 times smaller than a conventional antibody, any unbound product is eliminated from the body more quickly, resulting in a better therapeutic window. </p><p>Crescendo's new chief said that the firm had already shown, with different undisclosed partners, that it was able to conjugate payloads to VHs, which bound to target tissues and was internalized. While ADCs also do this, Pack underlined that complete antibodies have problems penetrating tissue, finding the tumour and especially excretion of unbound Antibody-Drug Conjugates is more difficult; "far from ideal", he said.</p><h2>An Evolving Business</h2><p>Currently Crescendo is working on identifying the ideal combination of a payload and VH and is focusing on pushing these small antibody fragments into the clinic. It has not yet disclosed who it is working with but Pack did reveal that it has several collaborations with different payload providers. He explained, "HDC is basically the combination between the smallest possible antibody fragment and best second-generation payload; we are comparing all classes of second-generation payloads and we will soon identify the ideal one."</p><p>In terms of significant partnerships, Pack added that Crescendo has a program with Astellas Pharma, and the more recent funding Crescendo received from Astellas Venture Management is dedicated to establishing a discovery program in the immuno-oncology field in order to generate Humabody VHs as modulators against various checkpoint targets, including PD-1 and further undisclosed targets. Pack said it presented "extremely promising and fast results" and described the program as the "cornerstone" of Crescendo's new I-O drug development programs. The company is "actively looking to cover further I-O mechanisms like T-Cell agonists to go even broader than checkpoint modulators."</p><h2>Crystal Ball Gazing</h2><p>Originally Crescendo started a clinical program in dermatology which it will continue but has since decided to shift its focus on oncology, making it its first priority. The company aims to have its own HDC and VH pipelines in immune-oncology established before looking for more partners. "We are not against partnering at some stage but we have everything we need at the moment," Pack said. However, he noted that for the company two types of deal structures may arise in the future as well: one is multi-target deals &ndash; which do not necessarily have to be in oncology, Pack said. The other type of partnership Crescendo expects to sign will be for what it calls "formatted products", which will involve bi-specific or multi-specific constructs for a partnering company's own drug discovery programs. "We will leverage our platform creating mono &ndash; and multi-specific VH leads against certain immune-oncology mechanisms," Pack said. </p><p>"We have defined clinical and pre-clinical development plans to bring our VH candidates either naked without anything linked, formatted to multi-specific but yet extremely small constructs or linked to a payload as HDC into the clinic," Pack noted. </p><p>Crescendo is setting up two clinical programs and will be looking to fill up its pipeline. </p><p><p>
