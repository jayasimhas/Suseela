<p>The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea is worsening, with the number of confirmed cases and fatalities continuing to climb. Struggling to contain the spread of the disease, the central government has announced it will step up efforts with provincial authorities, the private sector, the military and schools to ease the situation.</p><p>Over the weekend, the government unveiled the names of 24 hospitals which have had confirmed cases of MERS or where such patients had visited. Of the six hospitals with confirmed cases, Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province and the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul's Gangnam district had the largest numbers.</p><p>As of 8 June, the total number of confirmed MERS cases in the country had risen to 87, including the first case of a teenager testing positive. The number of fatalities was six since the outbreak began on May 20, and more than 2,500 people have been isolated at home or state-run facilities. To strengthen monitoring of those who have been isolated at home, the government is seeking to track their mobile phones through cooperation with relevant ministries.</p><p>Meanwhile, 1,869 schools, including kindergartens and elementary schools, in affected regions including Seoul and Gyeonggi Province have decided to temporarily close from Monday to protect students and teachers. Of these, the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education ordered all schools in affected areas to close for five days from 8 June, while the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has ordered all kindergartens and elementary schools in Gangnam district in Seoul - where the Samsung center is located - to close from 8-10 June.</p><p>"We plan to promptly provide the budget required for dealing with the disease by using disaster management funds and contingency funds," said South Korea's Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan during a televised press conference over the previous weekend.</p><p>Local media reported that contingency and disaster management funds are now worth KRW2.5tn ($2.22bn) and KRW1.2tn, respectively.</p><p>Choi assured that the country can control and contain MERS, as the occurrence of cases has been limited to hospitals and there hasn't been any transmission within communities.</p><p>The health ministry said the first wave of infection through Pyeongtaek St Mary's Hospital had now stabilized, while the second wave through Samsung Medical Center is estimated to stall or ease after this week.</p><h2>WHO gets involved</h2><p>MERS is a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus, which is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that caused an outbreak centered on Hong Kong in 2003. Based on existing cases, MERS carries a mortality rate of around 40%, and there is no available vaccine or effective treatment.</p><p>In a related development, the World Health Organization and South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare, after close consultation, will start a joint mission in the country this week to gain information and review the situation, including the epidemiological pattern, the characteristics of the virus and clinical features.</p><p>According to the WHO, the outbreak in South Korea is the largest reported outside Saudi Arabia, where the disease first emerged in April 2012 and the vast majority of cases have occurred.</p><p>The WHO team will be led by Assistant Director-General for Health Security, Dr Keiji Fukuda. The team will be comprised of experts in epidemiology, virology, clinical management, infection prevention and control, as well as public health officers who have previously handled other MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East.</p><p>The team will also assess the public health response efforts and provide recommendations for measures going forward.</p><p>Since the outbreak, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on response measures.</p><p>Based on current data and the WHO's risk assessment, there is no evidence to suggest sustained human-to-human transmission in communities and no evidence of airborne transmission. However, MERS-CoV is a relatively new disease and information gaps are considerable. The joint mission will help the WHO to gain a better understanding of the nature of the virus.</p><p>The WHO said that given the lack of evidence of sustained human transmission in the community, it doesn&rsquo;t advise special procedures at points of entry, or travel or trade restrictions.</p><h2>pharma firms respond</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Korea Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (KPMA) has sent letters to 201 pharma firms urging them to cooperate in providing medicines and other supplies related to treating MERS such as antiviral agents and fluids, and to help with the government's efforts to prevent further spreading of the disease.</p><p>South Korean pharma firms are already discussing with the government a possible increase in production of ribavirin, which is known to be partly effective against the virus. </p><p>The country's 11 producers of ribavirin, including LG Life Sciences, Jin Yang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Shin Poong Pharmaceutical have recently met with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety to discuss the status of ribavirin production and inventories at each firm.</p><p>But details of possible hike in production of ribavirin haven't been determined yet as the companies are willing to raise production only if the government can guarantee purchase of the excess supplies as in the case of SARS several years ago.</p><p>South Korean hospitals are currently using ribavirin and interferon therapy to keep the MERS coronavirus from proliferating in patients.</p><p>Amid heightening fears of contagion, masks, hand soaps and disinfectants are being sold out at pharmacies, and more and more people are wearing masks when they go out and are appearing to refrain from visiting populated places.</p><p>Many cultural and other events including concerts have already been canceled or postponed, and Seoul is strengthening efforts to disinfect subway stations and trains to prevent massive spreading of the disease.</p><p>Fears over the spread of MERS in South Korea seem to be also intensifying overseas.</p><p>The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has said that patients who present with severe acute respiratory disease in the EU and have recently been in contact with healthcare services in South Korea should be considered for assessment for MERS-CoV, similar to patients having been in contact with healthcare services in the Middle East.</p><p>It said travel-associated MERS-CoV infections, such as the primary case in the South Korean cluster, are not unexpected nor are instances of secondary infections. It is the scale of this cluster and that an infected person travelled to China that makes this particularly noteworthy.</p><p>The WHO has stated that there is currently no indication that the virus is behaving differently to in the past and that there is no indication of sustained transmission from person to person. However, further details of the virus characterization in South Korea are pending.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates' <i>The National</i> has reported that the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked UAE citizens to avoid travelling to South Korea in light of the spread of MERS.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p><p><p>
