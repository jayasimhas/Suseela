<p>Novartis' heart failure pill Entresto is already predicted to reach blockbuster status on the strength of its July approval in the US and now formal recommendation by CHMP in Europe for patients with reduced ejection fraction &ndash; representing some 50% of chronic heart failure patients - but those prospects could soar if an ongoing Phase III study presents the opportunity to eventually move the agent into the other half of chronic heart failure patients, those having preserved ejection fraction. </p><p>Heart failure affects about 26 million people across the US and Europe. </p><p>Currently available medicines for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction work only to block the detrimental effects, so the mortality rate remains very high, with up to 50% of patients dying within 5 years of a diagnosis of heart failure. About half of patients with heart failure have HF-REF. </p><p>Formerly called LCZ696, Entresto is an ARNI (angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor) that combines the active ingredient of the Swiss company's blockbuster Diovan (valsartan) and a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril. It acts on the neurohormonal systems of the heart, blocking receptors exerting harmful effects while promoting protective mechanisms. </p><p>The basis for the drug's submissions was the Paradigm-HF study where Entresto demonstrated superiority compared to ACE-inhibitor enalapril. Results from that randomized, double-blind, Phase III study showed the tablet cut the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by 20%, slashed heart failure hospitalizations by 21%, and reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 16%, Novartis said. </p><p>Novartis on Sep. 25 declined to comment on its pricing and commercialization plans for Europe after announcing that the region's top advisory panel the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) backed the drug's use for treating adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure and HF-REF. </p><p>But Novartis two months earlier said it expected a slow but steady uptake of its twice-a-day pill, and added that "once approved by health authorities around the world, Entresto could achieve estimated peak sales in excess of $5bn for the reduced ejection fraction indication." </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Ines Guerra believes Novartis' sales forecast is a bit on the conservative side, and predicts Entresto sales will hit $6.2bn by 2024.</p><p>While the drug&rsquo;s high price - coupled with the rising prevalence of chronic heart failure - could make reimbursement tricky, Novartis does have plans for an outcomes-based pricing model which might persuade payers, Guerra said. </p><p>Its prospects are also helped by a lack of direct competition. The most direct competitors on the market today are older ACE inhibitors and ARBs, but the pivotal trial leading to Entresto&rsquo;s approval went head-to-head against an ACE inhibitor and soundly beat it in terms of efficacy, analysts say.</p><p>"Overall, Entresto's superiority over first-line angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the lack of immediate threats in the pipeline are expected to help it secure a large share of the CHF [chronic heart failure] market," Datamonitor Healthcare's Guerra said. Datamonitor believes physicians will prescribe Entresto to severe CHF patients at first, but uptake in milder groups will substantially increase as clinicians grow familiar with the drug. </p><p>Despite moving quickly to get the drug on the US market after its July 8 approval there, the Swiss company has cautioned investors to expect "relatively modest" uptake during the first six to 12 months, due to several factors, including the complexity of Medicare reimbursement and anticipated reluctance among physicians to move stable heart failure patients off their current treatment regimens.</p><p>Novartis priced the oral therapy at $12.50 per day in the US, at the higher end of market expectations. </p><p>But analyst Tim Anderson at Bernstein in a July note to investors said that price wasn't a big surprise. "Other drugs that improve cardiovascular mortality in the US such as Crestor and Plavix are priced more in the $7-8/day range," he noted.</p><p>Novartis has now started a different trial named PARAGON-HF in a similar-sized group having preserved ejection fraction, where the ventricles do not relax as they should. This grouping is comprised of older patients who more frequently present with co-morbidities and experience recurrent hospitalizations. Final evaluation for PARAGON-HF is scheduled for 2019, with an interim analysis possible in 2017.</p><p>Consensus currently carries healthy forecasts for Entresto, with sales of some $4.6bn in 2020.</p><p>"Of course, if the separate PARAGON-HF trial reports out favourably - which would expand usage of Entresto into preserved-ejection-fraction heart failure patients (HFpEF) - peak sales of Entresto could be much higher," Bernstein's Anderson said.</p><p>Still, that aim could be more difficult to achieve given the industry's poor track record at coming up with drugs that effectively treat this particular CHF population, he concluded. </p><p>
