<p>An occasional column in which we report amusing trivialities, pharmalicious gossip, biotech bons mots and other interesting observations picked up on our rounds.</p><h2>Big in Japan</h2><p><i>Scrip</i> has heard rumors that Takeda's Christophe Weber is finding life in Tokyo rather challenging. The former GSK executive's appointment as president and COO of the pharma major sent shockwaves through the Japanese business community. If he does decide to head back to Europe, we know of a CEO vacancy in Paris, although that might be a case of jumping out of the frying and into the fire.</p><h2>California dreaming </h2><p>Two of the <i>Scrip</i> team spent three days in San Francisco for the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference where the difference between low-key venture capitalists from Boston and San Francisco compared with investment bankers from New York City couldn't have been more apparent. </p><p>"What? Do they expect us to be nice?" said one gray-haired banker, clearly taken aback by the pleasantness of West Coasters at the conference (who wouldn't be pleasant when most of their days are lived in the sunshine?). His companion laughed and shrugged, equally amazed. </p><p>Meanwhile, it seemed that venture capital investors and biotech CEOs from laidback Silicon Valley or academia-filled Cambridge, Massachusetts were more inclined to help pregnant JP Morgan attendees by offering a chair in a crowded room or a glass of water to someone who climbed San Francisco's hills to meet with them. </p><h2>All smiles at Actavis/Allergan</h2><p>Allergan chairman and CEO David Pyott was spotted in the halls of San Francisco's Westin St Francis Hotel, mingling with JP Morgan conference-goers with a smile on his face &ndash; perhaps because he wasn't presenting at the meeting this year in light of his company's pending $66bn acquisition by Actavis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>). </p><p>Mr Pyott did appear in front of investors, however, looking cheery and acting friendly with Actavis president and CEO Brent Saunders during the breakout session following the formal Actavis presentation to investors. Mr Saunders noted that people are the first priority as Actavis integrates Allergan into the company, and Mr Pyott added, "I never hear that it's 'us versus them.' It's all of us together."</p><p>Maybe Mr Pyott is holding out hope that he'll wind up with an executive spot at Actavis, sort of like Mr Saunders did when he sold Forest Laboratories to Actavis in 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Forests-Saunders-takes-lead-role-on-Actaviss-new-leadership-team-351859" target="_new">16 May 2014</a>). The executive team for the combined Allergan-Actavis already is in place, but perhaps there is room on the company's board of directors (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Actavis-names-new-senior-management-team-355793" target="_new">22 December 2014</a>). </p><h2>Don't count your IPO chickens</h2><p>Atlas Venture life science partner Bruce Booth pointed out during the JP Morgan conference that initial public offerings have been great for biotech companies, but they're not the windfall for venture capital firms that many people seem to think. Acquisitions of biotech companies still provide a faster and better return on investment for venture capitalists. </p><p>VC firms have to wait years after an IPO to sell stock from a newly-public biotech company at a price that reflects the technology's potential value &ndash; and at a price that provides a good return even after paying New York investment bankers' fees for disposing of VC-owned shares.</p><p>
