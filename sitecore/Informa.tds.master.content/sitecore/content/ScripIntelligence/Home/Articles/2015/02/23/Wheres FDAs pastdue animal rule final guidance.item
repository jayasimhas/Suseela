<p>It's been nearly two years since Congress passed a measure requiring the FDA to issue final guidance on the so-called animal rule, but the deadline has long passed and there's been no sign of the document, said Senator Richard Burr (Republican-North Carolina).</p><p>"When will the FDA animal rule final guidance be finalized as required by law?" he demanded during a 26 February hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medical-countermeasures-drive-pharma-innovation-US-officials-356971" target="_new">27 February 2015</a>).</p><p>"I share your sense of priority for the animal rule and the sense of frustration," Dr Luciana Borio, director of the FDA's Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats and acting deputy chief scientist, answered back.</p><p>She noted the FDA had issued a draft <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm399217.pdf" target="_new">guidance</a> this past May, which revised a 2009 document, with the comment period ending in August 2014. </p><p>"We have been very engaged with stakeholders on the guidance, as well as providing some additional training, and the feedback we have received is overwhelmingly positive," Dr Borio said, adding that she was not trying to make excuses for the agency's tardiness.</p><p>The animal rule was created in 2002 to permit a drug's effectiveness to be demonstrated in animals when it is unethical or not feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans.</p><p>Under the rule, a drug may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled animal studies when the results establish the product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans.</p><p>The animal rule has only been used a few times in the past decade, such as in 2003 for the approval of pyridostigmine bromide to treat exposure to the nerve gas Soman and for EMD Pharmaceuticals' cyanide-poisoning treatment Cyanokit, which contains the drug hydroxocobalamin, intravenous tubing and a sterile spike for reconstituting the drug product with saline.</p><p>In 2012, the FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's antibiotic Levaquin (levofloxacin) to treat patients with plague (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/JandJs-Levaquin-wins-US-FDA-nod-for-use-in-plague-329928" target="_new">1 May 2012</a>).</p><p>That same year, GlaxoSmithKline's anthrax antitoxin raxibacumab became the first monoclonal antibody approved under the FDA's animal efficacy rule (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKHGS-win-US-FDA-OK-for-raxibacumab-as-1st-mAb-in-anthrax-338294" target="_new">15 December 2012</a>). </p><p>The <i>Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act</i>, which Senator Burr authored and President Barack Obama signed into law in March 2013, mandated that the FDA issue the final guidance on the animal rule by March 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Whos-your-daddy-Obama-signs-PAHPA-reauthorization-341163" target="_new">14 March 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Too-late-to-stop-the-slow-grind-budget-damage-to-FDA-NIH-340476" target="_new">4 March 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/House-embraces-PAHPA-Reauthorizes-bill-critical-to-US-countermeasures-339284" target="_new">23 January 2013</a>).</p><p>Dr Borio pledged to "do everything I can" to bring the final guidance on the animal rule to a closure "as soon as possible."</p><p>But she would not commit to a timeline on the final guidance. </p><p>Senator Burr told Dr Borio to "please carry the message back" to the agency that "we are watching."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
