<p>Xoma Corp.'s stock returned above $1 per share on Oct. 1 after the company revealed a new preclinical immuno-oncology collaboration with Novartis, which gives the antibody therapeutics developer enough cash to fund early-stage internal programs through 2017.</p><p>Berkeley, California-based Xoma's Novartis news effectively distracted investors from a recent Phase III flop for gevokizumab, which was the company's main priority until the monoclonal antibody was bested by placebo in the treatment of a rare eye disease. Novartis will pay $37m up front and extend the due date on $13.5m in debt that the Swiss pharma company provided under a prior agreement. Xoma also will be eligible to earn up to $480m in milestone fees plus royalties.</p><p>Novartis obtained global development and commercialization rights to Xoma's anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) antibody program, including XOMA 089, a preclinical candidate that neutralizes the TGFb1 and 2 isoforms while sparing TGFb3. </p><p>Preclinical models have shown that XOMA 089 is active against head and neck and breast cancer tumor growth, and it may work well in combination with therapies that target the immune checkpoint known as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1).</p><p>The Xoma-Novartis relationship dates back to 2004 when Xoma and Chiron signed an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Chiron-and-Xoma-to-develop-oncology-antibodies-79155" target="_new">oncology collaboration agreement</a>. Novartis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Chiron-takeover-weighs-heavy-on-Novartis-64814" target="_new">acquired Chiron in 2006</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Xoma-and-Novartis-restructure-agreement-9088" target="_new">renegotiated the deal terms</a> with Xoma in 2008, and the pharma company has been developing HCD122 since then. The CD40-targeting antibody is in Phase II for Hodgkin's lymphoma and Phase I/II for four other hematologic malignancies.</p><p>Xoma agreed to a reduced royalty rate for the CD40 program, including HCD122, as part of its new immuno-oncology agreement with Novartis. However, Xoma will earn mid-single-digit to low-double-digit royalties from XOMA 089 and related TGFb programs, if the antibodies are commercialized, but the upfront payment and debt relief under its latest deal with Novartis are the most important aspects in terms of the company's near- and mid-term operations.</p><p>"We had said we did not plan to raise equity capital at our recent stock price in order to fund the development of our very exciting endocrine portfolio. With this non-dilutive liquidity of essentially $50.5m, we currently project this capital, in combination with our planned cost savings measures, will fund operations into 2017," Xoma CEO John Varian said in a company statement.</p><p>Xoma closed up 43.7% at $1.08 per share on Oct. 1 following the immuno-oncology deal announcement. </p><p>The company's stock price has taken a beating recently, falling from more than $4 to $1 on July 22 when it revealed that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Xoma-sinks-on-1st-Phase-III-gevokizumab-failure-359577" target="_new">gevokizumab failed in its first Phase III study</a> in the treatment of Behcet's uveitis. Xoma subsequently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Xoma-Cuts-Staff-To-Conserve-Cash-360109" target="_new">cut its workforce by 30%</a>, or 58 jobs, to facilitate the company's new focus on the Phase I candidate XOMA 358 for congenital hyperinsulinism and post-bariatric surgery hyperinsulinism.</p><p>"We remain on track to begin our XOMA 358 Phase II clinical program this fall and fully anticipate we will have the data from these studies" by 2017, Varian said.</p><p><p><p><p>
