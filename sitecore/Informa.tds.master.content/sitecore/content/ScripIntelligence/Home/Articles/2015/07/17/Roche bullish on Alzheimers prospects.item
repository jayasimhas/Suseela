<p>Roche has reported a solid performance for the first half of 2015 and provided a promising, though data-light, R&D update. A number of Phase III starts and filing timelines have been confirmed, and the Swiss pharma also gave an update on its Alzheimer's ambitions.</p><p>Roche is moving its Alzheimer's treatment candidate crenezumab into Phase III, while also considering pursuing its other Alzheimer's candidate, gantenerumab, at a higher dose than previously considered. </p><p>The anti-amyloid antibody <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Your-move-Roche-what-next-for-crenezumab-in-Alzheimers-352926" target="_new">crenezumab missed its endpoints</a> in two Phase II trials last year, but not badly enough to completely right off the product. </p><p>This was followed by Roche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gantenerumab-fails-time-for-Roche-to-cut-its-Alzheimers-losses-355763" target="_new">halting a Phase III trial of gantenerumab</a>, another anti-amyloid prospect, in December after a futility analysis showed that the probability of the study meeting its primary endpoints was very low.</p><p>"The fact is we have two very interesting, very attractive molecules that have data behind them in Phase II," group CEO Severin Schwan stated in the conference call accompanying Roche's first half results presentation. "Alzheimer's continues to be a huge unmet medical need and we see signals that indicate that there is a dose response in these molecules, and we've seen that dose response to be even more effective in the prodromal-to-mild patients."</p><p>Roche now plans to have discussions with regulators on how to proceed with gantenerumab. "We intend to look at additional dose escalation on gantenerumab and continue to make decisions on that development program based upon the data that comes."</p><p>According to Mr Schwan, "Gantenerumab and crenezumab are really two different molecules that bind to amyloid differently in a very complex disease like Alzheimer's. I think it's very good news that we have different ways of attacking the anti-amyloid process."</p><p>Roche's final decision on whether to pursue crenezumab and gantenerumab or just crenezumab "will be data driven, and we will be thoughtful about the science behind these trials."</p><p><b>immune oncology</b></p><p>In cancer, Roche recently reported that its big immune oncology hope atezolizumab, an anti-PDL1 treatment, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Roches-big-immune-oncology-hope-atezolizumab-shrinks-certain-bladder-tumors-359397" target="_new">shrinks tumors in people with a specific type of bladder cancer</a>. This followed on from earlier positive data in lung cancer and positive results for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in triple negative breast cancer.</p><p>"We'll move ahead now to prepare the filing for bladder cancer in the very early part of 2016," said the CEO. </p><p>Other good news for Roche recently was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bravo-for-Roches-multiple-sclerosis-drug-in-Phase-III-OPERA-studies-359198" target="_new">the Phase III OPERA data</a> with the novel multiple sclerosis treatment, ocrelizumab. These data are due to be included in filings with the US and EU regulators in the first quarter next year.</p><p>"I'm very excited about the ocrelizumab data. We are really looking forward to ECTRIMS, where I can confirm that we will be presenting data at an oral presentation on 9 October," said Mr Schwan.</p><p>The OPERA data "certainly gives credence to the B cell hypothesis in multiple sclerosis ... And I'd also remind you that we have a very attractive dosing schedule with a two times a year IV infusion."</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare has forecast sales of ocrelizumab to reach $777m in 2023.</p><p>"We are certainly preparing the organization for a successful entry into an area that certainly needs highly efficacious, highly safe medicine," added the CEO.</p><p>Roche presented data for ACE910 in hemophilia A in June and plans to move the program forward by initiating Phase III trials in a subset of patients later in the year.</p><p>"Overall the update highlighted the breadth of Roche's pipeline, but may disappoint anyone that was hoping for an acceleration in either ACE910 or PD-L1 timelines vs previous communication," said analysts from Deutsche Bank.</p><p><b>financials</b></p><p>Group sales increased 6% in the first half to CHF23.6bn. In the Pharmaceuticals division, 5% sales growth to CHF18.4bn was driven by medicines to treat HER2-positive breast cancer (Herceptin, Perjeta, Kadcyla, combined +21%) and Avastin (+9%), which saw strong growth in use for cervical and ovarian cancers. </p><p>MabThera/Rituxan (+6%) for blood cancers and rheumatoid arthritis continued to grow solidly. Actemra/RoActemra (+25%), which is used mainly to treat rheumatoid arthritis, also remained a significant growth contributor. </p><p>Biosimilars for Herceptin and Rituxan are expected by the end of 2017, but later in the US, where both drugs have longer patent protection, Mr Schwan noted.</p><p>Xolair (+28%), now for chronic hives as well as asthma, continued to grow strongly. </p><p>Uptake of Esbriet was strong in the first six months (CHF229m). "Recently acquired Esbriet was the stand-out new launch performer with 60% quarter-on-quarter growth to CHF141m in 2Q," noted the Deutsche Bank analysts.</p><p>Sales of oral chemotherapy drug Xeloda and anti-viral medicine Valcyte declined as these medicines are no longer patent protected. Sales of hepatitis medicine Pegasys and eye medicine Lucentis were lower as a result of increased competition. </p><p>The Swiss franc strengthened considerably against the euro during the first half of 2015, after the Swiss National Bank lifted its exchange rate peg in January, whilst weakening against the US dollar. The Japanese yen continued to further weaken against the Swiss franc, as did most European and Latin American currencies. Overall, there was a significant negative currency impact of 3 percentage points on sales, said Roche.</p><p>Roche reiterated its low- to mid-single digit guidance for 2015 (at CER). Core EPS is targeted to grow ahead of sales.</p>
