<p>The Supreme Court has decided to dive into the issue of whether the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been applying too rigid of a test in deciding whether to award so-called "enhanced damages" &ndash; which can be as high as three times the amount a district court has awarded under US law &ndash; when a company has infringed a patent.</p><p>While the cases before the Supreme Court, <i>Halo Electronics Inc. v. Pulse Electronics Inc.</i> and <i>Stryker Corp. v. Zimmer Inc.</i>, which the justices actually consolidated, don't involve biopharmaceutical companies, the outcome will have implications for any plaintiff or defendant in patent litigation, explained Washington lawyer William Jay, a partner at Goodwin Procter and a co-chair of the firm's appellate litigation practice.</p><p>"Since brand pharmaceutical companies are often in a position of threatening to seek enhanced damages during the run up to a generic's decision whether to launch at-risk, that's a consideration everybody in that sector needs to think about when they are assessing the likelihood of damages," Jay told <i>Scrip</i>. "And if district courts that are more prone to award such damages aren't going to be reversed as readily by the Federal Circuit, that's something that both plaintiffs and defendants will have to keep in mind."</p><p>At issue is the Federal Circuit's interpretation of provisions in US patent law, which declares that on finding a claimant's patent has been infringed, the court can award damages "adequate to compensate for the infringement," and may also "increase the damages up to three times the amount found or assessed."</p><p>The federal appeals court, however, has determined that an award of enhanced damages requires a showing of "willful infringement" &ndash; insisting the patentee must prove the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent and the objectively-defined risk was either known or so obvious that it should have been known to the accused infringer.</p><p>The Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-ruling-may-singe-patent-trolls-fingers-but-unlikely-burn-feet-351513" target="_new">already decided</a> a similar case, <i>Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness</i>, which involved awarding attorneys' fees &ndash; declaring last year the Federal Circuit could not use its two-pronged test, calling it an "inflexible framework" for an "inherently flexible" statutory text.</p><p>Even though the Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit's standard in <i>Octane</i>, the appeals court has "refused to adjust" to the law accordingly, and as a result, "district courts are now unable to impose enhanced damages if a defendant presents a non-frivolous defense, even if it acted in bad faith before the suit by copying the patentee&rsquo;s product, ignoring offers to license and failing to investigate or develop any pre-suit defense," Halo argued in its petition. </p><p>"Nothing in the statutory text justifies this ridiculous result, and <i>Octane</i> suggests just the opposite," contended the small family-owned business, which has accused Pulse, a large corporation, of violating its patents directed to surface mount electronic packages containing transformers for mounting on a printed circuit board inside electronic devices, such as computers and internet routers. </p><p>The Federal Circuit, charged medical device maker Stryker, has "effectively stripped district courts of the discretion to enhance patent damage awards for prevailing patentees by imposing a rigid willfulness framework on top of this otherwise flexible statute." </p><p>The plain language of the patent law, the firm said, "is silent as to willfulness." </p><p>The Federal Circuit's current willfulness framework, Stryker argued, "undermines" the intended deterrent effect of section 284 of the Patent Act by "immunizing infringers from enhanced damages so long as they present at least one plausible defense at the post-trial appellate stage." </p><p>In other words, the company said, under the Federal Circuit's rule, an "adjudged infringer can copy a direct competitor's pioneering invention in bad faith but escape punitive damages simply by engaging skilled counsel to advance an unsuccessful but ultimately credible defensive argument on appeal, regardless of whether the infringer relied on or even knew about that defense prior to engaging in its infringing acts."</p><p>In Halo's suit, a jury determined Pulse had indeed infringed on the patents and awarded the smaller firm $1.5m in damages. But the judge in that case refused to enhance the award, declaring Pulse had presented an invalidity defense at trial that "was not objectively baseless or a sham."</p><p>The Federal Circuit affirmed.</p><p>In the case of Stryker, the jury found that Zimmer had infringed and ordered the latter firm to pay the former $70m in lost profits. The district court used its discretion and tripled the award to $210m.</p><p>While the Federal Circuit upheld the infringement finding, it reversed on the willfulness &ndash; vacating the district court's treble of damages.</p><p>Goodwin Procter's Jay said a Supreme Court decision reversing the way the Federal Circuit has been handling enhanced damages could change the way life sciences companies decide whether to launch a product at-risk &ndash; meaning before infringement and invalidity have been decided.</p><p>"Under the approach the petitioners favor, a district court could award enhanced damages even if the defendant had an objectively reasonable defense," he said. "That would change the risk calculus, and it might even change the districts that patentees choose to sue in."</p><p>He noted the consolidated <i>Halo-Stryker</i> case follows the Supreme Court's ruling in its last term in <i>Commil USA LLC v. Cisco Systems Inc</i>., in which the justices granted a petition by patentees contending that the Federal Circuit's current law is too friendly to defendants.</p><p>In that case, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Good-faith-belief-no-defense-in-inducing-patent-infringement-358600" target="_new">ruled 6-2</a> on May 26 that claiming a "good-faith belief" that a patent is invalid doesn't hold water as a defense for inducing infringement by others.</p><p>Another case, <i>Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. Sandoz Inc.</i>, also had raised issues about the standard the Federal Circuit had relied on, Jay noted, although he said those issues were not clearly pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant.</p><p>Jay represented Teva in that case and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Copaxone-decision-could-decide-balance-of-power-354512" target="_new">argued last year</a> on the firm's behalf before the Supreme Court.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270" target="_new">ruling 7-2 in favor of Teva</a>, the Supreme Court said the Federal Circuit must only review district courts' patent case decisions when there is clear error, not <i>de novo</i> &ndash; meaning the appeals court should not rehash the lower court's factual findings in support of its construction of a patent claim term unless there was clearly a mistake made.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
