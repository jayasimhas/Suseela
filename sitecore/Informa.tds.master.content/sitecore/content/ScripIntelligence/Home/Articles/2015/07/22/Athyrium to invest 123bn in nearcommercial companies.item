<p>Can't find a partner to help commercialize your Phase III drug awaiting US FDA approval? Athyrium Capital Management has raised its second fund in hopes of investing $1.23bn in such an opportunity.</p><p>But late-stage companies should move quickly to tap Athyrium's resources, because the asset management firm and its investment management partner Neuberger Berman already have committed about 30% of the freshly raised capital &ndash; roughly $360m &ndash; to six investments to date. </p><p>Two of the first six investments were Cipher Pharmaceuticals, which sold <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipher-enters-US-derm-market-with-Innocutis-deal-357861" target="_new">$100m in senior secured notes</a> to Athyrium to fund its $45.5m purchase of dermatology-focused Innocutis in April and to support future acquisitions, as well as a commitment to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valneva-builds-on-travelers-vaccine-franchise-with-45m-Dukoral-buy-355957" target="_new">traveler's vaccine</a> specialist Valneva in January. Athyrium previously provided an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-secures-more-cash-buys-potential-100m-drug-352080" target="_new">$80m loan facility</a> to acquisitive drug developer Retrophin in mid-2014. </p><p>Other biopharma recipients of the investor's capital include Zealand Pharma, Indivior, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, InnoPharma, Horizon Pharma, Pernix Therapeutics and Vivus.</p><p>Athyrium Opportunities Fund II brings the firm's total capital under management to more than $1.7bn following Athyrium Opportunities Fund I, which raised $507m. More than 40 investors &ndash; pension funds, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds and others &ndash; put money into the oversubscribed second fund.</p><p>Athyrium invests in biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, health care information technology and health care services at companies that have commercial assets or products nearing regulatory approval and a commercial launch. </p><p>The second fund's investments in private and public companies will range from $25m to $150m in various forms of debt, equity, royalty transactions and other structured financial instruments. </p><p>Athyrium founder Jeff Ferrell said in a statement that the firm provides "large, flexible and long-term capital solutions at attractive costs of capital," which Athyrium partner Jeremy Lack said companies may use for "acquisitions, growth acceleration and other forms of expansion."</p><p><p><p><p>
