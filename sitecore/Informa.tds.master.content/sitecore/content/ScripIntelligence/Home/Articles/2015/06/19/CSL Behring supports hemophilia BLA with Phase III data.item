<p><p>Long-acting treatments have been the story of the hemophilia market for the last few years. CSL Behring announced results for its Phase III hemophilia B treatment that could extend prophylaxis treatment to as much as 14 days. </p><p>The Australian company announced 24 June at the 2015 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Congress in Toronto the results from the Phase III trial of its long-acting fusion protein linking recombinant coagulation factor IX with recombinant albumin (rIX-FP). </p><p>The drug is a treatment for hemophilia B, a subset of the orphan bleeding disorder that is characterized by a deficiency or complete lack of the Factor IX clotting factor. Hemophilia B is a smaller patient population &ndash; about 4,200 people in the US &ndash; than hemophilia A, which is a lack of Factor XIII. Due to the smaller market, there are fewer available treatments for hemophilia B patients. </p><p>Patients with hemophilia have been plagued by daily treatments and the potential for spontaneous bleeds. </p><p><b>The results</b></p><p>The study was conducted in 63 previously treated adults and adolescents, who were divided into two arms. In 23 patients who were previously getting on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes, they were given rIX-FP on-demand for six months and then were switched to prophylaxis treatment administered every seven days. In these patients, spontaneous bleeding decreased 100% from a median of 15.43 during the on-demand phase to 0.0 during the prophylaxis phase of the study. </p><p>Forty patients were started on seven-day prophylaxis treatment for six months and then switched to either 10-day treatment or 14 days between doses of the drug. In total, 99% of bleeding events were successfully managed with one or two infusions, with 94% of bleeds controlled with only one infusion. </p><p>Patients on 14-day prophylaxis treatment used a median dose of 75 IU/kg, which was half of their previous dose.</p><p>None of the patients developed inhibitors to factor IX or antibodies to rIX-FP. Less than 10% of patients reported treatment-related adverse events. The most common event was headache. </p><p>The study showed that the drug can be used at lower doses for longer periods of time, reducing the treatment burden for patients and increasing their efficacy. The trial also showed that safety was maintained &ndash; a major concern for hemophilia patients. The market tends to be weary of new treatment approaches due to safety issues that cropped up decades ago and made people more likely to stick with drugs that they find reliable. </p><p><b>What about the kids?</b></p><p>A second Phase III study was conducted in children ages one through 11. The 27 kids were given rIX-FP every seven days and for bleeding episodes. In total, 97% of bleeding episodes were successfully managed by one or two infusions, with 89% treated with only one infusion. The drug was safe and well-tolerated. </p><p>A Biologics License Application was submitted to the FDA for rIX-FP in December 2014 and was accepted by the agency in early February. The drug has also begun review under the European Medicines Agency. </p><p><p>
