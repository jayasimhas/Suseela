<p>It didn't take Retrophin long to find a buyer for the FDA priority review voucher it snapped up in March when it exercised its rights to purchase the newly approved Cholbam (cholic acid) from Asklepion Pharmaceuticals for $27m plus 661,278 shares of the former firm's common stock.</p><p>And its return on investment is a whooper.</p><p>Indeed, Sanofi is laying down a cool $245m for the rare disease pediatric PRV &ndash; the largest amount paid to date &ndash; which Asklepion actually won from the FDA on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Voucher-FDA-approval-lure-Retrophin-to-buy-Cholbam-357371" target="_new">Cholbam's approval</a>.</p><p>The vouchers are good for a priority review on a subsequent application that would not have otherwise qualified for priority review. They also are transferable, which means the holder can sell them, as Retrophin just did.</p><p>Sanofi is paying Retrophin $150m at the closing of the deal, followed by two equal installments of $47.5m each in 2016 and 2017.</p><p>Sanofi has not yet said what it plans to do with the voucher.</p><p>The company already had partnered with Regeneron on buying up another voucher last year &ndash; that one from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, which actually was the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Vimizim-BioMarin-wins-1st-rare-peds-disease-voucher-350063" target="_new">first ever rare peds PRV granted</a> by the FDA.</p><p>BioMarin walked away with $67.5m in its pocket and Sanofi and Regeneron are gaining a quicker review for alirocumab, their experimental PCSK9 inhibitor, whose <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date is coming up on 24 July &ndash; a full month ahead of Amgen&rsquo;s evolocumab.</p><p>Holders of a voucher can shave off at least four months of the time it takes the FDA to examine a marketing application, ultimately allowing a company to put its product on the US market quicker and start pocketing cash from its therapy &ndash; obviously what Sanofi has now bet twice on hoping it can do.</p><p>Before now, Gilead Sciences had paid the highest amount for a PRV &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-pays-unprecedented-125m-for-Knight-priority-voucher-355151" target="_new">doling out $125m</a> for Knight's voucher last November.</p><p>Knight won the PRV in March 2014 when it gained the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Impavido-in-leishmaniasis-Knight-wins-priority-voucher-350770" target="_new">approval to market Impavido</a> (miltefosine) as a treatment for cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by the phlebotomine sand flies and is found in parts of the tropics subtropics and southern Europe.</p><p>Knight&rsquo;s voucher, however, is for the tropical disease program, which was initially created under a provision included in the <i>Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007</i> to encourage development of new drugs and biologics to prevent and treat neglected tropical diseases, which typically affect larger populations in poor nations.</p><p>Congress established the pediatric rare disease PRV under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> (FDASIA) of 2012.</p><p>But FDASIA only set up the peds rare disease PRV on a temporary basis &ndash; declaring it would expire one year after the third voucher was awarded, which actually was the one Retrophin just sold.</p><p>The second peds PRV went to United Therapeutics, which gained the voucher when the FDA approved the firm's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Unituxin-United-Therapeutics-wins-pediatric-voucher-357213" target="_new">neuroblastoma drug Unituxin</a> (dinutuximab) on 10 March.</p><p>United Therapeutics' voucher is now the only one in contention, so all eyes will be on that firm to see if it can bring in a higher price than Retrophin just won. </p><p>Meanwhile, lawmakers are trying to get the peds PRV program extended under the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which was adopted by the House Energy & Commerce Committee <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">last week</a>.</p><p>That bill, however, currently only would extend the peds PRV program to 31 December 2018. But when the legislation goes before the full House, that timeline could be extended further, which Representative GK Butterfield (Democrat-North Carolina) said he would try to get done.</p><p>Shares of Retrophin leaped 12.5% on 27 May, or $3.35, before closing at $30.05, up $3.18, or 12%.</p><p>Sanofi's shares also rose 3.3%, before ending the day at $50.69, up $1.40, or 2.8%.</p><p>Shares of United Therapeutics also got a bump of 2.2%, before closing at $183.46, up 96 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
