<p><p>CytRx Corp investors might be getting ahead of themselves, but their enthusiasm for the biotech's lead product pushed the stock up nearly 30% on 04 May as the cancer drug showed it could be a replacement for a current standard chemotherapy. </p><p>Shares of CytRx jumped nearly 30% before settling at $4.39 at the close of the market, up 18.65%. The stock surge was caused by positive interim data from the company's two ongoing Phase Ib trials of aldoxorubicin in combination with standard chemotherapies gemcitabine or ifosfamide in patients with bone cancer and soft tissue sarcomas.</p><p>Aldoxorubicin is a next-gen variation of standard chemotherapy doxorubicin that is being tested in rare cancers that don't often respond well to chemotherapies. While doxorubicin is a potent drug, the compound has harsh side effects and can damage heart tissue at high doses. </p><p>Interim results from seven evaluable patients show that the combo of aldoxorubicin plus ifosfamide/mesna was well tolerated and that one bone cancer patient achieved a complete tumor response following five treatment cycles. Meanwhile, interim results from the second open-label Phase Ib trial showed that aldoxorubicin with gemcitabine was well tolerated and helped tumor shrinkage in three of seven patients after two cycle of treatment. The biotech intends to conduct further dose escalation in the studies during the next quarter. </p><p>While the trials were small and still very early, the results were extremely promising. Investors are excited because the compound could eventually replace doxorubicin altogether due to its more favorable safety profile and strong efficacy, as well as its ability to be used in combination with other oncology products. </p><p>"We believe the data highlights aldoxorubicin's compatibility with other oncology therapies and reinforces our view of the drug's future role in the treatment of multiple cancer indications. We think the data from these small open-label studies are encouraging and provide validation for the advancement into larger blinded randomized studies," wrote FBR Capital analyst Christopher James in a note to investors. </p><p>BioMedTracker gives the drug a 39% chance of approval in sarcoma; aldoxorubicin is currently in Phase III in the indication. </p><p><p><p>
