<p>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, such as Amgen's Enbrel (etanercept) and AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab), are the biologics of choice to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. But many people with the debilitating autoimmune disease don't respond to anti-TNF therapies, so what if you could identify patients early on who won't respond to those biologics?</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Selventa is developing a test to identify people with RA who won't respond to anti-TNF drugs, the results of which could save a lot of time for patients with a progressive disease and keep payers from spending a lot of money on treatments that won't work. Unfortunately for patients and doctors, there are few other options to treat RA and only a handful of alternatives in development that could be prescribed instead of TNF inhibitors.</p><p>"In rheumatoid arthritis, we have a set of amazingly powerful tools to modify disease that only work for some patients," Selventa CEP David de Graaf, a pharma veteran who previously worked at Boehringer-Ingelheim, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. </p><p>Dr de Graaf noted that it's important to get patients on the right treatments early on in their disease to slow RA progression or achieve remission. Even earlier than that, he noted, a product like Selventa's ClarifyRA test could be used to select the right patients for clinical trials or identify why some people respond to therapy and others don't.</p><p>"There seem to be patients with a molecular phenotype that are more or less receptive to anti-TNFs. This 'Clarify' tool gives patients a molecular profile to know if they will respond to a particular kind of therapy," Dr de Graaf said.</p><p><b>Finding the right therapy</b></p><p>Selventa's Systems Diagnostic (SysDx) tests are designed to help identify the most efficacious therapy for a patient based on his or her molecular profile, including genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data as well as information from electronic medical records. The company's SysDx tests, to be marketed under the brand name Clarify, are being developed in immune-related diseases such as RA, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and lupus. </p><p>Selventa recently published a 119-patient study in BMC Medical Genomics, a peer-reviewed journal, about the gene expression classifier that the company uses in its ClarifyRA test. The study showed that ClarifyRA identified patients who did and did not respond to Johnson & Johnson's TNF inhibitor Remicade (infliximab). Selventa plans to confirm the results in a 1,000-patient study and is looking to raise venture funding or other capital to fund that research.</p><p>Also, Selventa is talking to biopharma companies about developing a version of the ClarifyRA test, which can be adapted to identify patients for a particular drug or molecular target, alongside the potential partners' drug candidates. However, Dr de Graaf said Selventa is seeing more interest from payers than from drug developers, because pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) want to know that if they're covering the cost of an expensive medicine the drug will work for that patient.</p><p>"What they're most concerned about is ineffective treatment, because ineffective treatments are the most expensive. The patients who achieve remission in the first year are $10,000 to $20,000 cheaper patients," Dr de Graaf said.</p><p>And for many people with RA, therapies work for a while and then stop slowing the progression of the disease, so patients switch biologics every two years on average. There are tests that can tell doctors, patients and payers why a drug stopped working, but they need tests that may help them predict what is likely to work next, Dr de Graaf said.</p><p>Sagient Research analyst Robert Jeng noted that it's fairly common in many diseases for patients to see their symptoms return and for their disease to progress, requiring their doctors to change their prescription therapies. </p><p>"The body is always trying to adjust to whatever you're trying to change," Dr Jeng said. "In inflammatory diseases, you block the overreacting immune system, but eventually the immune system finds a way around whatever you're blocking."</p><p><b>But few alternatives</b></p><p>While making sure that patients are taking the right drug based on their molecular profile seems like a great value proposition, people with RA have few options beyond TNF inhibitors. Approved anti-TNF biologics include Humira, Enbrel, Remicade (infliximab), Johnson & Johnson's Simponi (golimumab), and UCB's Cimzia (certolizumab). </p><p>Alternative biologics include Roche's Interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitor Actemra (tocilizumab), the Swedish Orphan Biovitrium (SOBI) IL-1 receptor inhibitor Kineret (anakinra) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's CD80-targeting Orencia (abatacept). Pfizer's janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizers-Xeljanz-elected-in-US-as-1st-JAK-in-RA-336912" target="_new">Xeljanz</a> (tofacitinib) was the first new oral RA drug in a long time upon its approval in 2012.</p><p>"Anti-TNFs have a strong reputation in RA &ndash; rheumatologists have significant experience with them and they are generally considered to have high efficacy with significant long-term safety data available," Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Jacoba Procter said.</p><p>One key opinion leader (KOL) told Datamonitor for its RA market update earlier this year that "Enbrel has got 16 years of safety data &#8230; Most patients say they want the drug which has had the longest clinical experience."</p><p>While some patients stop responding to one TNF therapy, it is common for rheumatologists to move them to another anti-TNF biologic. KOLs told Datamonitor that they typically prescribe a non-anti-TNF biologic only after patients fail two TNF inhibitors. </p><p>"I prescribe [subcutaneous] Actemra to patients who fail the first or second anti-TNF," another KOL said in Datamonitor's RA market report. "But I never use Actemra as a first-line biologic &#8230; since no other mechanism of action has beaten anti-TNFs in a clinical trial; anti-TNFs to me would still be the standard."</p><p>Ms Procter notes that Pfizer's JAK inhibitor Xeljanz has not done as well commercially as the market expected, because the oral drug was not priced at a significant discount to biologics for which companies offer rebate programs.</p><p>"Also, RA patients are used to injectable formulations and would rather stick with established therapies over Xeljanz," she said.</p><p>In that same vein, Dr Procter said a test to identify patients who respond to anti-TNF therapies probably would not have a big impact on biologic sales, because only about 30% of RA patients respond poorly to TNF inhibitors &ndash; even if they respond initially and fail treatment months later &ndash; and there are few non-anti-TNF alternatives for non-responders.</p><p>Dr Jeng said the use of a diagnostic that identifies patients who won't respond to TNF inhibitors will depend on how well the test works. </p><p>"If it catches only half of the 30% of non-responders, that's not very exciting," he said, noting that tests to identify the best drugs for patients are more compelling in cancer where making sure people get targeted therapies is a matter of life and death. </p><p>And in autoimmune diseases like RA, few good targets have been identified, so personalized medicine seems to be a long way off.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
