<p>Neuralstem is moving forward with development of its spinal cord-derived stem cell treatment for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) following mostly positive Phase II results for the product.</p><p>The firm's NSI-566 stem cell treatment met primary safety endpoints in the Phase II study in 15 patients &ndash; with a maximum dose of 16 million transplanted cells being well tolerated. But the product did not fare as well with reaching secondary efficacy goals. </p><p>At the nine months post-surgery point patients treated with NSI-566 showed a 47% response rate to the stem cell treatment, as measured by either near-zero slope of decline or positive slope of ALSFRS score in seven out of 15 patients and by either a near-zero decline, or positive strengthening, of grip strength in seven out of 15 patients. (ALSFRS is a standard clinical test used to evaluate the functional status of ALS patients. The average ALSFRS score for responders at 9 months after treatment was 37. Non-responders scored an average of 14.)</p><p>Furthermore, lung function as measured by Seated Vital Capacity showed that responder patients remained within 94% of their starting scores, versus 71% for non-responder patients. </p><p>Analysts at BioMedTracker (BMT), an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, said the top-line data results were in-line with expectations given that this study tested only 15 patients.</p><p>The BMT analysts said: "We would like to see further details of the baseline characteristics of the responders vs non-responders as well as a breakdown of the dose response. We expect that patients with better baseline characteristics would be more likely to respond to treatment, but also have a slower process of decline overall." </p><p>They noted that while it is positive that a subset of patients showed functional stability on ALSFRS and Seated Vital Capacity, "it will be important to see what type of biological activity and stabilization of the cells occurred and how this correlated with responders vs non-responders. It is likely these types of analyses will lead to an improved design in the next planned studies. </p><p>"We believe that the high unmet need in ALS warrants the further study of NSI-566 given the positive safety profile following transplantation," the BMT analysts concluded. </p><p>Neuralstem plans to commence a later-stage, multicenter trial of NSI-566 for ALS this year.</p><p>Investors seemed wary of Neuralstem's hit-and-miss Phase II results; sending shares of the company down 36% on 12 March, the day top-line results were reported. The company's stock closed at $2.37 per share on the same day, the lowest figure for Neuralstem this year so far. </p><p><b>Related stories: </b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-NPS-gets-orphan-status-in-Europe-Neuralstem-raises-20-million-Salix-completes-buyout-of-Santarus-349100" target="_new">Neuralstem raises $20m</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Neuralstem-shares-move-on-spinal-cord-injury-trial-go-ahead-339099" target="_new">Neuralstem shares move on spinal cord injury trial go-ahead</a></p>
