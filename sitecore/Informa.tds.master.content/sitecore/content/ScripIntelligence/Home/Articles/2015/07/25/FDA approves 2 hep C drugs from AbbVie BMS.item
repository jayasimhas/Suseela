<p>The FDA was on a roll on 24 July, granting five approvals, including to two hepatitis C virus (HCV) medicines: AbbVie's Technivie (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Daklinza (daclatasvir).</p><p>Technivie is indicated in combination with ribavirin as a treatment HCV genotype 4 (GT4) infections in patients without scarring and poor liver function, or cirrhosis.</p><p>AbbVie's new medicine, which the firm priced at $76,653 for the wholesale acquisition cost, is the first and only all-oral, interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral treatment approved in the US for adults with GT4 chronic HCV infection.</p><p>HCV affects about 3 million Americans. GT4 is one of the least common forms and is historically difficult to treat.</p><p>Technivie, AbbVie said, patients with GT4 HCV an "opportunity for a cure."</p><p>"Physicians have previously had limited options when it comes to treating people living with GT4 chronic hepatitis C," noted Dr Tarek Hassanein, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine.</p><p>The three agents that make up Technivie &ndash; ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir &ndash; are the same compounds in AbbVie's Viekira Pak, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">approved</a> this past December in the US to treat HCV genotype 1 infection. </p><p>Technivie was approved under a priority review, which shortened the regulatory review process from the normal 10 months to six. </p><p>The drug also was dubbed a breakthrough therapy by the FDA in 2014, which also helped move the medicine through the regulatory process quicker.</p><p>Technivie's approval was based on data from AbbVie's open-label Phase IIb PEARL-I study, which demonstrated 100% sustained virologic response rates at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR-12) in patients who received the drug plus ribavirin for 12 weeks. </p><p><b>Daklinza</b></p><p>The other HCV drug that won the FDA's nod on 24 July was BMS' Daklinza (daclatasvir) 60mg, which is for patients with genotype 3 (GT3).</p><p>The drug is indicated for use with Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).</p><p>Daklinza, an oral medicine, is intended to be taken once daily for 12 weeks &ndash; a treatment regimen that may be a solution to improving the standard of care for GT3 patients, said Dr Chris Boerner, US commercial head at BMS.</p><p>The drug's approval was based on BMS' pivotal open-label Phase III ALLY-3 trial of Daklinza plus sofosbuvir, which demonstrated SVR-12 in 90% of treatment-na&iuml;ve and 86% of treatment-experienced chronic HCV GT3 patients. </p><p>The SVR12 rates were higher, at 96%, in GT3 patients without cirrhosis, regardless of treatment history, BMS said. </p><p>In the more difficult-to-treat patients with cirrhosis, SVR-12 rates were reduced &ndash; 63% &ndash; which was achieved without the use of ribavirin.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
