<p>Gilead Sciences has underscored that the Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) patent battle in India is far from over and that its licensing deals with seven partners stand unaffected. The company has just had one of the patent applications for its hepatitis C therapy rejected.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indian firm BDR Pharmaceuticals indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that it was preparing for a potential launch of a cut-price generic version of sofosbuvir, in view of the patent rejection.</p><p>Gilead said that the main patent applications covering sofosbuvir were still pending before the Indian Patent Office and the rejection related to the patent application covering the ''metabolites of sofosbuvir''. </p><p>''We are pleased that the Patent Office found in favour of the novelty and inventiveness of our claims, but believe their Section 3(d) decision to be improper. Gilead strongly defends its intellectual property. The company will be appealing the decision as well as exploring additional procedural options,'' Gregg Alton, Gilead's executive vice president (corporate and medical affairs), said. </p><p>While a clarification from Gilead on what these procedural options may be was not immediately available, legal experts suggested that the company could perhaps take recourse to Section 77 of the Indian Patent Act, if applicable, where the Patent Controller has certain powers of a civil court in matters such as ''reviewing his own decision on an application made within the prescribed time and manner''. </p><p>''The review request route may be faster,'' these experts said, adding that the patent rejection order appeared incongruous in some parts.</p><p>India earlier this week rejected one of Gilead's patent applications for Sovaldi essentially on the grounds that it falls under section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act and fails to meet the conditions therein <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-Sovaldi-patent-rejection-what-now-and-next-356154%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 15 January 2014)</a>. The order, however, acknowledged the novelty and inventive step of the present set of claims concerning the sofosbuvir patent.</p><p>Under Section 3(d), salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, and other derivatives of known substances are presumed to be the same substance as the original chemical and thus not patentable, unless it can be shown that they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.</p><p>The Sovaldi patent rejection raised the prospect of the arrival of cut-price versions of the product, with some experts suggesting that ''genuine open competition'' from Indian companies that opted to stay out of the license deal seven firms agreed with Gilead in September 2014 may now be possible, rather than the ''managed competition'' permitted by Gilead through the licenses. </p><p>The licensing deals in question were signed with seven India-based firms including Cipla and Zydus Cadila to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a>. </p><p>''Licensees may now look at whether they made the right commercial decision to enter into a license given that one of the two main blocking patents has been refused,'' Tahir Amin, co-founder and director of intellectual property-focused not-for-profit group I-MAK, which had filed a pre-grant opposition against the Sovaldi patent application, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Significantly, BDR chairman and managing director Dharmesh Shah told <i>Scrip</i> that his company had secured a ''big order'' for the product's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the ''next few months'' would enter the Indian market with sofosbuvir at a ''very competitive'' price. Mr Shah declined to share any further details, including whether the generic version was developed using a non-infringing process.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gilead said that the latest patent proceedings would not impact its commitment to enabling access to its hepatitis C medicines in India and other developing countries, and that its generic licensing program with Indian partners ''continues as normal''. </p><p>''We welcome the news that on 13 January 2015 the authorities in India granted sofosbuvir regulatory approval in an unprecedented four months &ndash; the first country in Asia to approve sofosbuvir - recognizing the need to bring this innovative new medicine to patients in India as quickly as possible,'' Gilead's Mr Alton added.</p>
