<p>The Indian Society for Clinical Research has defended the quality of drug research being conducted in India. </p><p>The defense comes in the wake of the European Medicines Agency's call for hundreds of formulations of generic medicines whose European marketing authorizations relied on clinical studies performed by Indian contract research organization GVK Biosciences to be suspended in the EU. The EMA began its review in September 2014 at the request of the European Commission after an inspection by the French medicines agency (ANSM) revealed data manipulations in studies conducted at GVK's Hyderabad site.</p><p>While it could not comment on the specifics of the GVK case, the ISCR, whose members include several leading foreign firms and clinical research organizations, said that such incidents should "not be allowed to tarnish the image of India as a high quality destination" for clinical research. "We would like to stress that the overall quality of research being done in India is of a very high quality and this has been established in independent studies [and] also in the fact that India has had several US FDA and [EMA] audits of sites with no critical findings,'' the ISCR told <i>Scrip's </i>sister publication<i>, Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>.</p><p>''We have an important responsibility to the thousands of patients in India who live in constant hope of better and newer medicines and for them alone we need to ensure that India's clinical research agenda is not impacted by such developments.'' </p><p>One industry expert, though, voiced concern that the fact that the EMA's concerns relate to manipulation of data and data integrity might lead some to question how Indian bioequivalence studies are conducted by CROs and/or drug companies. The expert, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: ''Every company/CRO has internal guidance for quality assurance/maintaining data integrity as required by regulations and GCP. However, each company/CRO needs to have internal systems/processes to prevent/detect misconduct/fraud.''</p><p>The expert also said it would be critical to see how the regulator viewed sponsor responsibility in such cases.</p>
