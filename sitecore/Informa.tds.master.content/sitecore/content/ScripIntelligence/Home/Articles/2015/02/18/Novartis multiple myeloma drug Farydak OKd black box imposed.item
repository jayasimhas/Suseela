<p>The FDA has given Novartis the green light to market Farydak (panobinostat), a potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor, as a treatment for multiple myeloma, a disease that affects about 21,700 Americans each year, killing 10,710. </p><p>But the approval wasn't smooth.</p><p>The FDA imposed a black-box warning on Farydak's labeling to alert patients and prescribers that severe diarrhea and severe and fatal cardiac events, arrhythmias and electrocardiogram changes have occurred in patients receiving the drug.</p><p>Because of those risks, Farydak was approved with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy consisting of a communication plan.</p><p>In addition, Farydak's approved indication is not what Novartis initially sought.</p><p>The company had submitted its application for the drug as a treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.</p><p>But that indication was rejected in November 2014 by the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, which voted 5-2 Farydak's benefits of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) did not outweigh its risks (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-rejects-Novartis-multiple-myeloma-drug-panobinostat-354907" target="_new">07 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Increased-deaths-may-hang-up-Novartis-panobinostat-at-ODAC-354848" target="_new">04 November 2014</a>).</p><p>So Novartis submitted additional information to the FDA to support the use of Farydak as a treatment for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior standard therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. </p><p>That submission, however, ended up delaying the FDA's decision by three months (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-delays-verdict-for-Novartis-panobinostat-355264" target="_new">26 November 2014</a>).</p><p>After that, Sagient Researcher&rsquo;s <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the likelihood Farydak would be cleared by the FDA at 67%, which is 15% below the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Since Farydak was OK'd under the FDA's accelerated approval program, Novartis must now submit the results of a confirmatory study backing up the drug's efficacy and safety.</p><p>The FDA's approval is based on efficacy and safety data in a pre-specified subgroup analysis of 193 patients who had received prior treatment with both bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent during the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter global Phase III registration trial, called PANORAMA-1.</p><p>The study found that the median PFS benefit increased in Farydak patients who had received prior treatment with both bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent, 10.6 months versus 5.8 months in the placebo group.</p><p>Additionally, 59% of Farydak-treated participants saw their cancer shrink or disappear after treatment, versus 41% in the patients who got bortezomib and dexamethasone alone. </p><p>Farydak works by inhibiting the activity of HDACs &ndash; slowing the over-development of plasma cells in multiple myeloma patients or causing the cells to die.</p><p>"Farydak has a new mechanism of action that distinguishes it from prior drugs approved to treat multiple myeloma, making it a potentially attractive candidate agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma," said Dr Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
