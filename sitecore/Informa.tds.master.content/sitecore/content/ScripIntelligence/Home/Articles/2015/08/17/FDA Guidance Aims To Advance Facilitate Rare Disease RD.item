<p>Even though orphan drugs have been declared the new blockbusters &ndash; with several companies cashing in big on the products &ndash; the FDA said most firms pursuing rare disease treatments still need some guidance in addressing certain particular common challenges. </p><p>To that end, the FDA on Aug. 14 issued a new draft guidance document, <i>Rare Diseases: Common Issues in Drug Development</i>, aimed at advancing and facilitating the development of medicines to prevent and treat rare diseases and conducting more efficient and successful programs through a discussion of selected issues commonly encountered by drug makers.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM458485.pdf" target="_new">draft guidance</a>, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) told <i>Scrip</i>, is consistent with and part of an "important goal" established among FDA, patient organizations and the industry under the 2012 reauthorization of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, or PDUFA V: expansion of the rare disease program in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, training of reviewers about unique difficulties in developing medicines for orphan conditions and outreach to stakeholders to bring greater transparency and clarity to how the US regulatory agency views and responds to those "special" challenges. </p><p>"Taken together, these activities are designed both to encourage and facilitate continued development by companies already working in rare diseases and to provide clear and specific guidance that will encourage broader participation in this important area of drug development," BIO said.</p><p>The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) praised the FDA for recognizing some of the "special considerations that must be addressed in developing medical products for small patient populations" in its draft guidance, declaring it was "encouraged" by the document, although the group noted it had not yet thoroughly reviewed it and said it needed to study it closer. </p><p>While the <i>Orphan Drug Act</i> (ODA) of 1983 defines a rare disease as a disorder or condition that affects less than 200,000 patients in the US, the FDA noted that most of those conditions affect far fewer than 200,000 people.</p><p>There are an estimated 7,000 rare diseases affecting about 30 million Americans.</p><p>Regulators pointed out that many rare disorders are serious conditions with no approved treatments, "leaving substantial unmet medical needs for patients."</p><p>That's why lawmakers put certain incentives into the ODA to make developing drugs for small numbers of patients financially viable.</p><p>For instance, the 1983 law grants an additional seven years of exclusive marketing rights to the first drug with an orphan drug designation that wins US approval, which bars the FDA from approving another medicine in the same class for the same condition during that period. </p><p>According to the FDA, experience has shown that exclusivity is one of the "strongest incentives" for encouraging R&D for treatments of rare diseases and conditions.</p><p>While all drug developers run into similar challenges during the R&D process, those issues frequently are more difficult for firms pursuing rare disease treatments, especially those areas where there is little medical experience, the FDA said.</p><p>The issues rare disease manufacturers face also are more acute with increasing rarity of the disorder, the agency said, acknowledging certain aspects of drug development that are feasible for common conditions may not be feasible for rare diseases.</p><p>By having an adequate understanding early on of a rare disease's natural history and pathophysiology and a drug candidate's proposed mechanism of action, companies can more efficiently and adequately address those issues during the course of drug development &ndash; from discovery to confirmatory efficacy and safety studies &ndash; and have more productive meetings with the FDA, regulators said in the new draft guidance.</p><p>Rare disease drug developers also early in the R&D game should mull over what will be needed for nonclinical pharmacotoxicology to support the proposed clinical investigations, the standard of evidence to establish safety and effectiveness and the drug manufacturing considerations, the FDA said in its draft guidance, which is open for public comment over the next 60 days. </p><p><b>Natural History Database</b></p><p>The FDA also on Aug. 14 said it was making $250,000 available to NORD to support the development of a natural history database.</p><p>The FDA said only NORD, which is developing its own Internet-based data collection tool, which the agency said has promise to further the accumulation of natural history data for many rare diseases, was eligible to apply for the grant. </p><p>Knowledge of natural history &ndash; the course of a disease in the absence of a clinical intervention &ndash; makes possible the design of successful and efficient drug development programs, the FDA said.</p><p>Regulators said the development and successful implementation of a natural history database will have "profound and far-reaching effects" on development of therapies for rare diseases. </p><p>"As a basis for solid natural history knowledge of a disease it may help to make a clinical development program for a candidate therapy appear feasible, and thus a more attractive area to pharmaceutical companies for devoting a portion of their drug discovery resources" &ndash; leading to a greater number of medicines, the FDA said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
