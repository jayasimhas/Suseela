<p>AstraZeneca's MedImmune unit has licensed a cancer vaccine from Inovio for potential use with some of its immunotherapy drug candidates in yet another deal in the immune-oncology (IO) space.</p><p>MedImmune will acquire exclusive rights to Inovio's INO-3112 immunotherapy, which targets cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18, which it intends to study in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its own pipeline for HPV-driven cancers. MedImmune is paying Inovio $27.5m up front, plus development and commercial milestones that could reach $700m. MedImmune will fund all development costs, while Inovio is entitled to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on any INO-3112 product sales. </p><p>INO-3112 is already in Phase I/II trials in cervical and head and neck cancers; it generates killer T-cell responses against HPV-16 and -18-driven tumor cells. </p><p>Combining IO drug candidates with a cancer vaccine is a growing trend in the field, driven by emerging evidence that suggests that their benefits are enhanced in combination with a strong tumor-specific T cell response. </p><p>Under the deal, MedImmune and Inovio will also develop up to two additional DNA-based cancer vaccine products not included in Inovio's current product pipeline. MedImmune will have the exclusive rights to develop and commercialise these, while Inovio will receive development, regulatory and commercialisation milestone payments and royalties on any sales. </p><p>Inovio and MedImmune area already collaborating on two R&D products in infectious diseases, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Inovio-MedImmune-partner-under-45m-DARPA-Ebola-contract-357725" target="_new">including Ebola</a>, both funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). </p><p>
