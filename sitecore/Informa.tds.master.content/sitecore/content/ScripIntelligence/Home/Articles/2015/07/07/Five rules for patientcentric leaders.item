<p> <b>Patient-centricity is a phrase that keeps popping up in our day-to-day industry exchanges, but no one company has fully determined how to address the inclusion of patient voices in the various levels of business. Paul Simms, chair of pharma-focused events and reports producer eyeforpharma, discusses here how reputation still plays a large part in the measuring of a company's patient-centric efforts and what his five golden rules are for leaders or wannabe frontrunners of the &quot;patient-centricity movement.&quot;</b> </p><p> <img src="-/media/07E3AF4365944D2F82CFB19B04FFF055.ashx"> Paul Simms, chair of eyeforpharma<br><br> Recently, I joined a meeting of GlaxoSmithKline executives who had gathered to seek external advice about how to &quot;renew&quot; the relationship between pharma and the medical profession. <br><br> GSK was hit very hard in the wake of revelations that its Chinese sales teams had bribed doctors to favor its medicines. Whilst this article is not presenting any evidence, the feeling in the rest of the industry is that GSK took the rap. It was the fall guy, taking the blame for everyone's indiscretions. <br><br> The company was hit so hard it had no choice but to retreat. Other than the initial and highly necessary announcements on immediate reforms to its sales force (in particular removing the link between sales reps' compensation and the volume of prescriptions written out by their physician customers), it has been in hibernation. Until May this year, GSK chief Sir Andrew Witty was about as discreet as the boss of a major public company can possibly be. <br><br> And that was exactly the right thing to do. <br><br> The company has instead spent a lot of time quietly examining what it stands for and what sort of changes it should make internally. The fact that it didn't rush to claim that it had patched it up within a few days has, in my opinion, given GSK a strong degree of credibility as it gears up to face the world once again. And, mindful that all eyes are looking in its direction as it prepares its next move, its patience could be rewarded. So long as it is prepared to admit some big mistakes were made, it has an opportunity &ndash; a chance to explain its reforms in a very genuine and dignified manner, to a guaranteed audience. <br><br> Really, it's an opportunity for the whole pharma industry. As hard as it may be, admitting wrongdoing is the first step to true salvation. <br><br> In an era when trust is becoming the most important yardstick of success, the need for our leaders to come across as genuine is one of the most vital requirements. As members of our elite begin to embrace their social responsibilities and pro-actively communicate their patient focus, it's important that we keep a few lessons in mind, lest we assimilate into the stodgy status quo where pharma's reputation refuses to recover. <h2> 1. Find the genuine voice </h2><br><br> I recently asked a group of four pharma CEOs if they felt they were true &quot;patient-centric leaders.&quot; Three of them gave the same answer: not yet; they're on the right path, but they have a long way to go. The fourth, Gitte Aabo, who runs LEO Pharma, showed us a little more. &quot;You can't drive change in your organization unless you really believe in it. For me personally, I had a revelation when I was chief financial officer of the company and I'd mistakenly thought that it was all about the numbers. We are not about profits: we are about making profits in order to provide better solutions for patients. Now, having realized this, I must be an example to everyone else. So I get out of my office, I spend time with patients. Can I claim to be a true patient-centric leader? Well, I'm doing my utmost.&quot; <br><br> Her passion, personal story and genuine reasons for striving for a patient-first organization were on full display. <br><br> If you don't have a story that packs a punch, you need to get out of the way. The four large companies whose ultimate leaders have already delegated this are Pfizer, UCB, Merck and Sanofi, all of whom have elevated patient centricity to a senior level by introducing the role of chief patient affairs officer or similar. And these are not simply fancy titles for non-executives. These people have strong personal mission statements and define success as literally making themselves redundant through having achieved major internal change. <h2> 2. Get out there </h2><br><br> I talk to far too many senior leaders who have a strong passion that comes across very well during our one-to-one conversations, but who are reluctant to make their stories public. The pharmaceutical industry suffers from a lack of courageous leadership, so we need people to fill that vacuum. This is an opportunity and undoubtedly you will be respected for speaking out. <h2> 3. Become intolerant </h2><br><br> We all know that good news doesn't travel. The unfortunate truth is that your inspiring messages of patient centricity just aren't going to go very far. So consider defining your outlook by what you will no longer accept. For example, is it okay for an employee who makes an incredible financial contribution to the company, but doesn't care about the patient, to remain in their job? Is it all right for R&amp;D bosses not to meet potential customers? Can you be ruthless in your patient leadership? <h2> 4. Start now </h2><br><br> Too many leaders wait until they retire before they focus on the altruistic aspect of healthcare they find most motivating. Yes, of course, the moment you step off your perch, you'll have the privilege of time. You'll have all those advocates and allies you've built up along the way. But what you'll also have is far less direct influence in the world over which you previously held a bird's eye view. What we're sorely lacking are leaders who are willing to go public on their initiatives while still in office, aligning that to the work of their parent organization. <h2> 5. Lead the industry </h2><br><br> Not just your company. This is the natural next step in your career progression. After all, true patient centricity means enabling the patient to find the most effective treatment &ndash; even if it's provided by your competitor. A recent conversation with David Epstein of Novartis gave me a glimpse into some of the genuinely entrepreneurial, open-minded, forward-thinking patient and healthcare-focused initiatives that the company will soon be announcing. As an industry that is often accused of being lemming-like, constantly benchmarking and best-practicing ourselves into a state of mediocrity, these bolder initiatives can make a huge difference as long as they're not treated as mere side-projects. <br><br> <i>Paul Simms is chair of eyeforpharma, a pharma-focused events and reports producer. </i>  </p>
