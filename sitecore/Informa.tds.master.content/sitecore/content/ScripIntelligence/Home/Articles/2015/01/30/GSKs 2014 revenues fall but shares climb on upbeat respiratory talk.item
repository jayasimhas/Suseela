<p>GlaxoSmithKline shares closed 2% up as investors were pleasantly surprised by better than expected earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014. As anticipated, total revenue for the year dropped 3% to &pound;23.0bn following "challenging trading conditions particularly in the US primary care market," said CEO Sir Andrew Witty.</p><p>GSK expects US headwinds to continue to impact performance in 2015, particularly during the first half, following patent expiries of key lung drug Advair. However, the CEO said that US respiratory market share had risen during the first few weeks of the year, following pricing adjustments, but it was still "early days."</p><p>GSK is on course to close its mega asset-swop deal with Novartis in the first half, despite "some small divestments" that it found out last week would have to be conducted. It hopes the $20bn transaction will give it a much-needed shot in the arm. Following its close, Sir Andrew is not ruling out a major corporate restructuring of the company. "I don't have a religious commitment to any specific kind of corporate structure," he said on the conference call accompanying the results announcement. "It would be disingenuous of me to say that the Novartis transaction doesn't give us options for different structures that may enhance shareholder value." But he reminded participants that this was the same message he had imparted when the deal was first announced last year. "This is not something new," he said.</p><p>With regards to GSK's HIV joint venture ViiV, for which it is considering an IPO, Sir Andrew says he is in no rush to make a decision on when, where or even if a deal will be done. Meanwhile, GSK has hired three banks to help it evaluate the move, media reports suggest. </p><p>"GSK's Q4 results beat consensus core EPS by 3%," noted Berenberg analysts. And at &pound;6.2bn, "Q4 sales were 2% better than our forecast." In addition, "Respiratory sales did not disappoint versus forecasts. Advair in particular delivered Q4 sales of &pound;1.1bn versus our forecast of &pound;1.0bn, a 7% beat. Anoro (&pound;11m) and Breo (&pound;38m) continue to contribute little to the franchise, but at least did not miss our forecasts."</p><p>GSK said it would not release 2015 guidance until the completion of the Novartis transactions and intends to hold a capital markets day in the second quarter to go through the "new" GSK in more detail.</p>
