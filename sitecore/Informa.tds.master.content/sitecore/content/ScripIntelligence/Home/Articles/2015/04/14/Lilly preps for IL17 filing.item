<p><p>Competition in the autoimmune space continues to heat up as Eli Lilly & Co announces further positive results for its interleukin-17a blocker ixekizumab, edging in closer to Novartis' already approved Cosentyx (secukinumab). </p><p>Lilly released positive data for the closely-watched compound on 20 April, reporting results from the SPIRIT-P1 study in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The trial tested ixekizumab against placebo in patients whose disease has been active within the last six months and who had never been treated with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The study showed that ixekizumab was statistically superior to placebo with a higher proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 score, which is a standard measure that indicates a 20% reduction in a patient's signs and symptoms.</p><p>Lilly only reported topline results, but intends to report full data from the trial at an upcoming medical meeting. The Indianapolis-based pharma intends to file for approval based on the additional late-stage data, including another Phase III trial that began enrolling in December. </p><p>The firm has already reported positive results in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and intends to file with the FDA in the coming months. </p><p>Lilly will be lagging behind Novartis, which <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-adds-another-Cosentyx-approval-with-FDA-nod-356289" target="_new">gained approval</a> for its IL-17a blocker in January. Ixekizumab will be entering a crowded market that is already dominated by the anti-tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) like Enbrel (etanercept) and Humira (adalimumab), as well as Johnson & Johnson's Stelara (ustekinumab). Yet, the TNF inhibitors have plenty of unpleasant side effects and physicians have long been looking for alternatives that could offer patients a better drug experience. </p><p>Many other companies are vying to enter the IL-17 space as well &ndash; Amgen and AstraZeneca currently have their own candidate in Phase III, as does <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BI-enters-psoriasis-fray-by-knocking-out-Stelara-357415" target="_new">Boehringer Ingelheim</a>. </p><p><p>
