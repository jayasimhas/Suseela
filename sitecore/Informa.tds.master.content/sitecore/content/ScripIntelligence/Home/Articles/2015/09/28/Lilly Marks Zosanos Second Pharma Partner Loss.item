<p>Zosano Pharma Corp. is trading at a fraction of its initial public offering price after the transdermal drug developer revealed that it has parted ways with Eli Lilly & Co. &ndash; the second big pharma partnership that the company has lost this year.</p><p>Fremont, California-based Zosano will discontinue development of its daily drug patch ZP-PTH for severe osteoporosis to focus on its weekly ZP-PTH patch. The decision was based on feedback from Japanese regulators that would have required extra studies, which would have delayed commercialization by one year. The company also said the weekly patch product came out on top as it reassessed the best market opportunities for its technology. As a result, Zosano and Lilly agreed to terminate their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lilly-boosts-osteoporosis-franchise-Zosanos-IPO-prospects-355377" target="_new">December 2014 agreement</a> related to ZP-PTH that was worth up to $440m. </p><p>The drug candidate uses Zosano's microneedle patch technology to deliver a proprietary formulation of parathyroid hormone 1-34 (PTH or teriparatide), the active ingredient in Lilly's <i>Forteo</i>.</p><p>Novo Nordisk <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zosano-program-still-holds-promise-after-Novo-exit-359266" target="_new">backed away from its diabetes drug collaboration</a> with Zosano in July. The companies were working on a microneedle patch to deliver the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) antagonist semaglutide, which is a follow-on product to Novo's blockbuster <i>Victoza</i> (liraglutide). </p><p>Investors were optimistic about Zosano's prospects for signing a new partner for the semaglutide program, but shareholders seemed to lose faith in the company when it announced the end of its Lilly alliance after the stock market closed on Sept. 28.</p><p>Zosano <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Spark-ignites-investors-one-of-years-first-five-biotech-IPOs-356490" target="_new">went public at $11 per share</a> in February &ndash; two months after it signed the collaboration agreement with Lilly &ndash; and now its stock is trading at about a third of the company's IPO price. Zosano shares closed at $3.74 on Oct. 2, bringing its market cap to $44.8m &ndash; $30.9m below the company's pre-Lilly deal termination value on Sept. 28.</p><p><p><p><p>
