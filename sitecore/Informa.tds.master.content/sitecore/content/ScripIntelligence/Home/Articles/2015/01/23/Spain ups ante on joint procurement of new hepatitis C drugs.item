<p>Amid mounting pressure to provide access to the costly new hepatitis C drugs, the Spanish health ministry has confirmed it is pushing for progress on the joint procurement of such products with other EU member states. Companies will be paying close attention to how the situation unfolds as it could set the bar for which treatments come under the scope of a new agreement that allows member states to wield their combined purchasing power to get a better price for expensive new drugs.</p><p>Access to the new drugs, including Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Janssen's Olysio (simeprevir), has become an increasingly politicized matter in Spain ahead of this year's general election, putting the government is under pressure . Seeking to combine its purchasing power with that of other European countries is one of a number of measures it is looking at. The Joint Procurement Agreement, signed last June by 14 member states, allows EU member states to come together to negotiate a better price for medicines, vaccines, medical devices and lab tests to counter pandemics and cross-border health threats (<a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vaccines-meds-lab-tests-all-can-be-bought-under-EUs-procurement-deal-355647" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 15 December 2014</a>). Four signatories to the agreement can trigger a joint procurement, although the European Commission also has to agree. </p><p>Pharma firms may be dismayed to learn that hepatitis C does indeed come under the scope of the agreement. "Hepatitis C is in the remit of the Serious Cross Border Health Threats Decision (1082/2013) as a communicable disease, so Joint Procurement could be used to procure in common countermeasures/treatments for Hepatitis C," the commission told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Dr Alexander Natz, secretary general of EUCOPE (the European Confederation of Pharmaceutical Entrepreneurs), is worried that this sets the bar too low for which products could come under the agreement and therefore could be the target of joint procurement. "Member states need to define what constitutes a serious cross-border healthcare threat. Hepatitis C is a very serious disease, but its transmission rate is not high enough for it to be classed as a cross-border emergency."</p><p>Dr Natz is also concerned that a price obtained through joint procurement could end up as an upper limit for subsequent health technology appraisals and national pricing and reimbursement negotiations and processes in individual member states. He also points out that there could be antitrust issues in member states bundling together their purchasing power.</p><p>The commission was unable to comment on whether or not it was close to agreeing to a joint procurement, or which countries were at the negotiation table. Nor would the Spanish health ministry say with whom it was in talks. Indeed, there is little transparency about which countries are in negotiations and what exactly they are talking about. Portugal initiated talks about joint procurement back in July 2014, shortly after the joint procurement agreement was signed. Meanwhile, France rejected procurement talks, according to the <i>Consejo General de Colegios Oficiales de MÃ©dicos</i> (Spain's General Council of Medical Colleges). However, France paved the way for 14 member states to get together and discuss the price of Gilead's Sovaldi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/France-enlists-EU-help-to-squeeze-Sovaldi-price-352910" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16 July 2014</a>). Later in the year it announced what it said at the time were the lowest prices in Europe for Sovaldi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/France-gets-cheapest-Sovaldi-in-Europe-355218" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 24 November, 2014</a>).</p><p>
