<p>The FDA on 30 April granted approval of GlaxoSmithKline's Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) as a once-daily inhaled treatment for asthma in adults.</p><p>But the agency rejected the medicine for use in adolescents 12-17 years with the disease, declaring in a complete response letter the data submitted do not show adequate risk-benefit to support US approval in that population.</p><p>Regulators said additional data would be required to further demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Breo in adolescents.</p><p>Shares of GSK slipped 1.5% on the news, before closing at $46.15, down 64 cents, or 1.4%. </p><p>But shares of its partner, Theravance, were hit harder &ndash; dropping 7% on 30 April, before closing at $16.25, down 82 cents, or 4.8%.</p><p>Breo Ellipta &ndash; a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) &ndash; previously was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKTheravance-US-Breo-win-pleases-investors-343079" target="_new">approved</a> in the US to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>The FDA approved Breo in asthma for adults at two strengths: 100mcg/25mcg and 200mcg/25mcg. The drug is administered once-daily using the GSK's Ellipta dry-powder inhaler.</p><p>Dr Darrell Baker, head, of GSK's global respiratory franchise noted that Breo is the London-based firm's second asthma treatment approved by the FDA in the past year, with regulators giving the nod in August 2014 to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-GSKs-Arnuity-Ellipta-in-asthma-353487" target="_new">Arnuity Ellipta</a> (fluticasone furoate inhalation powder), a once-daily inhaled corticosteroid maintenance treatment of asthma, as prophylactic therapy in patients 12 years or older.</p><p>The FDA's decision on Breo in asthma followed the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Breo-adult-asthma-use-rejects-adolescents-357398" target="_new">advice</a> of the agency's outside advisers, who voted 16-4 in favor of Breo's approval in adults and 18-2 against marketing the drug for adolescents at a 19 March meeting.</p><p>At the joint meeting of the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committees, the panel voted 18-2 the efficacy data provided substantial evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for Breo in adults with asthma.</p><p>But the committee voted 16-4 in declaring the efficacy data were not sufficient in adolescents.</p><p>The panel also voted 17-3 GSK's data adequately demonstrated Breo was safe in adults. But in a 19-1 vote, the advisers said safety was not adequately shown in adolescents.</p><p>The panelists also called for the FDA to require a large LABA safety study in all patients 12 years or older due to the FDA's previous concern of those agents.</p><p>Breo's labeling already carried a black-box warning about an increased risk of asthma-related deaths associated with LABA agents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
