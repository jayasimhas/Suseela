<p><p>Mallinckrodt is making a $1.3bn investment in its highly specialized hospital business with the acquisition of privately held Therakos from investment firm The Gores Group. </p><p>The deal complements an earlier acquisition the company made and allows it to piggyback off of existing sales efforts to expand the new product's reach. </p><p>The company paid the hefty sum to the investment group to get its hand on Therakos' extracorpeal photopheresis (ECP) immune therapy treatment. The system uses a unique drug/device combination to mix a patient's blood with the drug uvadex methoxsalen and expose it to ultraviolet light. Patients require 25 to 40 treatments annually. </p><p>It is currently approved in the US to treat skin manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) that have made no progress on other treatments. There are 60 patents in the US Orange Book, according to the company, as well as a total of 130 patents worldwide. </p><p>The system is approved in the EU for a variety of other applications including graft-versus-host disease and Crohn's disease. Mallinckrodt is hoping to expand the system's label in the US and eventually achieve sales of $500m for the product based on the new indications. </p><p>The product is currently used in more than 350 to 400 academic medical centers and hospitals globally. Mallinckrodt is hoping to use its existing hospital sales force to expand the reach of the product. The company put the sales team in place when it acquired Ikaria for $2.3bn in March. Ikaria's lead product is Inomax, a respiratory system for infants used in the neonatal unit of hospitals. The team pushing Inomax currently serves more than 800 hospitals.</p><p>"Therakos is quite simply another excellent fit with Mallinckrodt's strategy," said Mallinckrodt President and CEO Mark Trudeau on an Aug. 10 call with investors. "[The deal] further diversifies our hospital portfolio with another durable, high value, high margin product offering; it broadens our hospital touch points from multi-modal surgical pain management and critical care respiratory therapies to include innovative immune therapies; and enlarges our global footprint in profitable international markets."</p><p>Mallinckrodt isn't worried about competition for the product and sees little that will get in the way of the already-marketed product being a successful addition to its portfolio. </p><p>"There really is nothing like this particular ECP system. There are competitive systems &ndash; primarily outside the US &ndash; but this is a closed system. So, essentially a patient is introduced to the system, everything is done in a closed loop; blood plasma, white blood cells, red blood cells, the drug, nothing is open. And so, it really minimizes the risk of infection. It also reduces significantly the time that a patient is involved in the process," Trudeau noted. He also added that the product is widely reimbursed, both in the US and elsewhere. </p><p>The deal was also a sound one for the investment group, which picked up the Therakos business from the former Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics in 2012 for an undisclosed sum. The Gores Group buys assets, adds management structures to them and then sells them off as a separate company. </p><p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter and will contributes $165m to $185m to Mallinckrodt revenues in 2015. </p><p><p><p>
