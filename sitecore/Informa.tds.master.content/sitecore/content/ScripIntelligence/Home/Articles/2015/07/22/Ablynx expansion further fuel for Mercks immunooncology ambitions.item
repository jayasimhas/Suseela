<p>Merck & Co is expanding its immuno-oncology collaboration with Ablynx of Belgium to address an increased number of immune checkpoint modulator targets.</p><p>"Merck has seen our nanobody technology is delivering as we expected, which is good news, and that's what's encouraged them to expand the partnership," Ablynx CEO Edwin Moses told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The original collaboration, announced in February 2014, focused on the discovery and development of five pre-defined Nanobody candidates (including multi-specific Nanobody combinations) directed towards immune checkpoint modulator targets for evaluation as immunotherapies for cancer. Ablynx <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-and-Co-turns-to-Ablynx-again-to-help-restock-RandD-349743" target="_new">received &euro;20m upfront last February</a>, with significant milestone payments scheduled. The first of these becomes due "when we see the first signs of very positive preclinical data. It's possible that from those first five programs, the first could reach a milestone stage by the end of this year." Dr Moses believes these initial programs are "roughly a couple of years away from the clinic".</p><p>"We are impressed Merck has decided to significantly extend its collaboration after c.18 months as this suggests reassuring progress developing the original immuno-oncology candidates, in our view," said analysts from Jefferies. "We believe this alliance offers further validation of Ablynx's platform technology, and underscores management's ability to crystallize its value."</p><p>They note:"This Merck collaboration has the potential to be Ablynx's biggest deal worth up to c.&euro;4bn, along with the possible &euro;1.7bn from the original deal."</p><p>With the latest expansion, Ablynx is now responsible for the discovery and development of up to 12 additional nanobody programs against individual protein targets and target combinations (mono-specific and multi-specific nanobodies) through to the <i>in vivo</i> preclinical proof-of-concept stage, after which Merck will have the option to advance any drug candidates.</p><p>Under the new agreement, Ablynx will receive a &euro;13m upfront payment as well as further research funding over the term of the collaboration. Ablynx is also eligible for additional fees, depending on the number of programs for which Merck decides to exercise its licensing option, plus development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to &euro;340m per program, as well as royalties on any commercialized Nanobody products. Merck will be responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration.</p><p>"Based on what we've just done, we'll have the next set of nanobodies ready for testing in preclinical systems in the next 12-18 months. It's a very rapid process."</p><p>"Immuno-oncology remains a key area of focus for Merck," said Dr Joseph Miletich, senior vp of discovery R&D at Merck Research Laboratories. "The expansion of this ongoing collaboration with Ablynx allows us to increase our ability to evaluate the potential of more immune checkpoint targets for the treatment of cancer."</p><p>"Merck is learning more about immune oncology every day from all its clinical trials, and now there is the potential to look at obvious combinations of different nanobodies and also less obvious ones. This expansion means there can be up to 17 programs running simultaneously, so Merck can be more speculative, if it chooses to be, and try things that are based on knowledge that it is gaining on a daily basis."</p><p>"With a 'land grab'/partnering strategy for immuno-oncology assets by larger players, positive findings from this alliance could further see crystallization of value for Ablynx in this field beyond the Merck collaboration," add Jefferies' analysts.</p><p>Merck and Ablynx also have a separate collaboration which began in 2012 "to develop a nanobody to a particular ion channel that could be important in pain," said Dr Moses. Ablynx received &euro;6.5m upfront and could receive up to &euro;448m in milestone payments. </p><p>"We also have a number of different programs running with Merck Serono &ndash; six different programs in a range of therapeutic areas &ndash; the most advanced is in the clinic in Phase Ib. It's a bi-specific for psoriasis and we're hoping to see some data from that later this year. We've got a long term program with Boehringer Ingelheim that started in 2007, and we expect the first of those to enter the clinic in the next couple of months."</p><p>Ablynx's lead program is the anti-Il-6R nanobody ALX-0061, which is in the same class as Roche's Actemra. It is partnered with AbbVie in a deal which saw the Belgian firm pocket $175m up front in 2013 for the rheumatoid arthritis candidate that is in Phase IIb. </p><p>"We're running the Phase IIb with cash we received from AbbVie and if those data are good then AbbVie takes that product on into Phase III." </p><p>AbbVie <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-bets-big-on-Ablynx-arthritis-candidate-346753" target="_new">has promised up to $665m in milestones payments</a> plus double digit royalties under the deal, which will see Ablynx complete Phase II development before handing it over to AbbVie for Phase III if ALX-0061 meets pre-defined success criteria.</p><p>
