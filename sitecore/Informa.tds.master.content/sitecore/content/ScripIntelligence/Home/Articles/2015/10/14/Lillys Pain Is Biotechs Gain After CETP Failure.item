<p>The failure of Eli Lilly & Co.'s cholesterol drug evacetrapib was a major blow to the company and will likely be a hit to Merck & Co. as well, but it wasn't a loss for everyone &ndash; Amgen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi stand to make major gains from the loss. </p><p>Lilly announced the morning of Oct. 12 that an independent data safety monitoring board recommended that it stop the Phase III ACCELERATE trial due to futility &ndash; meaning the 13,000-patient outcomes trial was not showing signs of efficacy at the interim analysis and was not worth continuing. </p><p>Lilly will <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Suffers-From-Lillys-Evacetrapib-Failure-361000" target="_new">unwind all ongoing trials</a> of the drug and take a $90m hit on the loss. For Lilly, this raises serious questions about whether the company can deliver on its late-stage pipeline and if there are really any innovative products left in its arsenal. </p><p>The drug is part of a class that has become a thorn in the side of big pharma. Evacetrapib is a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. This class of drugs has been pursued by various big pharmas over the last decade because of its ability to raise good HDL cholesterol dramatically. Things have not worked out as had once been hoped for this class of drugs. </p><p>So why are Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi benefitting? The short answer: they now have less competition.</p><p>These three companies are the proud developers of two recently approved cholesterol drugs &ndash; drugs that are not CETP inhibitors. Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) and Sanofi/Regeneron's Praluent (alirocumab) have a completely different mechanism of action from the CETP inhibitors and are meant to target the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PSCK9) pathway instead. </p><p>Repatha and Praluent prevent the PCSK9 protein from binding to LDL receptors on the liver's surface, allowing for more bad LDL cholesterol molecules to be removed from the blood. Genetic studies have shown that people with loss-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene have low LDL levels as well as low rates of cardiovascular disease &ndash; prompting the development of the PCSK9 inhibitors.</p><p>The two drugs were approved by FDA this summer to investor fanfare and even more controversy. The US regulatory agency gave these two compounds the green light for their ability to significantly lower the bad LDL cholesterol, but put major constraints on the patient population. </p><p>Some of the things that excited investors about these products were the exact issues that prompted FDA to put restrictions on the drugs. These drugs have shown really compelling efficacy and are able to lower LDL levels significantly. While this sounds like an overwhelming positive, the science has yet to show that these dramatic decreases in LDL won't do harm as well. Cholesterol drugs are typically used in large populations to help prevent heart disease and therefore could have larger implications if they turn out unsafe. </p><p>For that reason, FDA has limited the patient population to high-risk individuals who can't get their cholesterol under control with the widely used statins that are already on the market. The regulatory agency has requested that these companies conduct large cardiovascular outcomes trials to make sure that this class of drugs really does prevent heart problems. </p><p>Another issue that caused both excitement and controversy was PCSK9 pricing. These drugs are expected to be particularly highly priced &ndash; as they are hard-to-develop injectable biologics; the high price is upsetting to most stakeholders, but could mean a significant bump in revenues that would please investors. </p><p>Lilly's (and maybe still Merck's) CETP inhibitor could have meant some serious competition for this new class of drugs. The CETP inhibitors would likely have garnered approval for a wider patient population and have the added positive of oral administration &ndash; meaning they are easier to take for patients and much easier (and less costly) to manufacture for developers. </p><p>The addition of these drugs to the market would have brought the added benefit (or detriment) of price controls, as increasing competition in a market always pushes the price down. </p><p>Analysts agree. "Oral CETPs were the biggest commercial risk to subcutaneous. And a significant oral competitor just failed," wrote Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat in an Oct. 12 alert. </p><p>Morningstar analyst Damien Conover added in his own Oct. 12 note that the decreasing competition from CETP inhibitors makes him increasingly more confident in his $12bn peak sales estimate for the PCSK9s. </p><p>So for now, investors in Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi can breathe easy, knowing that these potential blockbusters will not be thwarted before they even take off &ndash; at least until Merck presents the data from its own cardiovascular outcomes trial for its CETP inhibitor in 2017.</p>
