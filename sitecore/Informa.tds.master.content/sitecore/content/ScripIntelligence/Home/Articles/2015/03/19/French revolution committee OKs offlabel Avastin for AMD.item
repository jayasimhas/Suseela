<p>France has fulfilled its promise to make Roche's anticancer drug Avastin (bevacizumab) available off-label to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), even though two other products &ndash; Novartis's Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Bayer's Eylea (aflibercept) &ndash; are already approved for this use. The aim of the move is to save money by using the much cheaper Avastin in place of the two authorized drugs.</p><p>On 24 March the French regulatory body ANSM announced that its benefit-risk evaluation committee had recommended that Avastin should be used for wet AMD under a "temporary use recommendation" (RTU), on the grounds that it is non-inferior to Lucentis in terms of efficacy and showed "no significant difference" as regards systemic adverse effects.</p><p>Controversial legislation passed last year allows the health authorities to issue an RTU even where another product is already available for that indication. Although this is not explicitly stated, the aim of the legislation is to save money on the drugs bill where specific products are considered too expensive. French politicians said last year that the reimbursement of Lucentis cost &euro;430m in 2013.</p><p>France is not the first country to pass legislation allowing off-label use for financial reasons: Italy did so last year, and it is understood that some AMD patients have already been given Avastin, but France's decision to use the formal RTU process could result in more widespread and consistent use of the product in this indication. </p><p>Roche said it would comment specifically on the committee's recommendation as soon as it had received the official letter or communication from the president of ANSM. More generally, it noted that "the use of unlicensed therapies, where licensed therapies exist, undermines the regulatory system designed to protect patients, and is a deterrent to innovation and the development of new medicines". </p><p>Recent developments to encourage the off-label use of Avastin for economic reasons, it said, "mark a departure from putting patient safety at the heart of the regulatory framework in Europe. We are opposed to any efforts that would override informed clinical decision-making by approving or encouraging off-label use of compounded bevacizumab for economic purposes."</p><h2>Committee vote</h2><p>ANSM said it had presented an evaluation of all the available data to the benefit-risk evaluation committee at its meeting on 19 March, on the basis of which the committee delivered a unanimous vote in favour of Avastin's use in wet AMD. Some of the information was provided by Roche, which had been asked by ANSM last year to supply all scientific data relating to the use of the product, particularly in terms of safety, efficacy and any research currently under way (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/One-in-the-eye-for-Roche-as-French-seek-off-label-Avastin-354901" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 6 November 2014).</p><p>"The different studies and meta-analyses comparing Avastin and Lucentis in this indication were presented to the members of the committee on the initial evaluation of the benefit-risk profile of health products on 19 March 2015," ANSM declared. "These studies showed the efficacy of Avastin in the treatment of neovascular AMD and its non-inferiority compared with Lucentis in terms of functional efficacy (visual acuity)."</p><p>As for the general tolerance (systemic effects) of Avastin, it said "no significant difference was shown between Avastin and Lucentis, apart from the occurrence of gastro-intestinal effects. At local level the undesirable ocular effects observed (inflammatory or traumatic effects) were those of all anti-angiogenic products administered to the eye, such as intra-ocular (endophthalmic) infections mainly related to the method of preparation of Avastin. This will be strictly controlled once the RTU has been put in place."</p><p>A treatment monitoring protocol has been drawn up, focusing particularly on the prescribing and dispensing conditions as well as the method of preparation, ANSM said. A key issue with using Avastin in wet AMD is that it has to be reformulated from large vials into smaller pre-filled syringes. </p><h2>Against EU law?</h2><p>The legislative moves by France and Italy have angered the wider pharmaceutical industry, which believes they contravene EU legislation on drug authorization procedures. Industry also fears that the laws will be used to allow the prescribing of other products where governments want to save money on the drugs bill, and that other countries might be tempted to follow suit. </p><p>Richard Bergstr√∂m, head of the European industry federation EFPIA, said last month that such moves were turning the EU regulatory system "upside down". EFPIA and two other industry bodies have filed a complaint against the Italian law with the European Commission (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Italys-off-label-rule-turns-EU-system-upside-down-says-EFPIAs-Bergstrom-356704" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 11 February 2015). </p><p>The moves are part of an ongoing saga that last year saw Roche and Novartis fined by the Italian competition authority for allegedly colluding to exclude Avastin from the ophthalmology market. The authority said that Roche collected "significant" royalties from sales of Lucentis and that both companies profited from sales of the product. Last December, the regional administrative court in Rome dismissed the companies' appeal against the &euro;180m fine, although they vowed to fight on (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Roche-Novartis-continue-fight-against-Italian-fine-despite-court-setback-355495" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 8 December 2014).</p>
