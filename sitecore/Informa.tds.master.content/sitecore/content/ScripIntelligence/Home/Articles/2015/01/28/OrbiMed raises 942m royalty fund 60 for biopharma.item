<p>OrbiMed has raised $942m for its second health care royalty and credit opportunities fund and Carter Neild, a partner in the New York-based investment firm, tells <i>Scrip</i> that about 60% of OrbiMed Royalty Corporation II will be invested in biopharmaceutical royalty streams and debt arrangements.</p><p>The new fund is 50% larger than OrbiMed's first royalty-focused fund, which raised about $600m. In addition to the biopharma-focused deals, about 40% of the fund's investments will involve medical device, diagnostic and health care information technology companies and OrbiMed expects to invest about $20m to $150m per deal. Mr Neild said 30% to 40% of investments will be in ex-US markets. </p><p>A variety of endowments, foundations, pension funds and institutional investors backed OrbiMed's second royalty investment fund, which exceeded the firm's target amount. About 70% of the investors have participated in OrbiMed&rsquo;s other funds.</p><p>Health care-focused OrbiMed has $14bn under management in royalty, venture capital and public equity investment funds. The firm closed its fifth VC fund totaling $735m in October 2013 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/OrbiMed-and-NovaQuest-close-healthcare-funds-worth-1.2bn-347789" target="_new">1 November 2013</a>).</p><p>"We do everything in health care from venture capital to public equity investing," Mr Neild said. "We invest in companies in every major market."</p><p>OrbiMed's recent VC investments include Aduro Biotech and Clementia Pharmaceuticals &ndash; two recent funding deals during a venture capital boom in early January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-venture-capital-off-to-a-659m-start-in-2015-355964" target="_new">7 January 2015</a>). The firm also has backed Naurex and Ascendis Pharma in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Naurex-leads-VC-funding-surge-with-80-Series-C-355396" target="_new">3 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Prodrug-formulator-Ascendis-raises-60m-to-fund-late-stage-trial-355373" target="_new">2 December 2014</a>).</p><p>So far, OrbiMed's other funds have not co-invested with its royalty fund, but Mr Neild noted that "we would like to."</p><p><p><p><p>
