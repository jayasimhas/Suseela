<p>Endo International sent Salix Pharmaceuticals a $175 per share bid to acquire the gastrointestinal disease-focused pharma company that trumps the already accepted offer of $158 per share from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which expects to complete its ongoing tender offer for outstanding Salix shares by 1 April.</p><p>The trade-off for investors: Endo's bid gives shareholders $45 in cash and 1.4607 Endo shares per outstanding Salix share while Valeant's offer is all cash. The corresponding deal values are $11.2bn versus $10.1bn. In addition to cash, Endo believes its proposal also gives Salix investors "the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of a global leader in specialty pharmaceuticals" via 40% ownership of Endo if the two companies are able to close a deal in the second quarter of 2015.</p><p>Raleigh, North Carolina-based Salix said it will "carefully review and consider the proposal and pursue the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company's stockholders."</p><p>Valeant said that the specialty and generic drug maker is "committed to our all-cash agreed transaction, which delivers immediate and certain value to Salix shareholders." </p><p>The deal was announced in February after speculation that Salix was in talks with a buyer, which pushed the company's stock considerably higher (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-confirms-10.1bn-acquisition-deal-for-Salix-356886" target="_new">23 February</a> and <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Rumor-speculation-and-Salix-356750" target="_new">13 February 2015</a>). Salix closed up 7% at $168.61 per share on 11 March after Endo's offer became public knowledge.</p><p>Dublin-based Endo proposed its acquisition of Salix in a letter from president and CEO Rajiv De Silva to the Salix board of directors on 11 March. Mr De Silva served as president of Valeant until 2013, working alongside the Canadian company's M&A deal-hungry chairman and CEO Michael Pearson, whose $54bn hedge fund-backed proposal for Allergan was rejected in November in favor of a $66bn bid from Actavis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The Endo CEO also has taken an aggressive path to buying what the company sees as attractive assets. Auxilium Pharmaceuticals rejected a merger with QLT and accepted Endo's $2.6bn bid in October after Auxilium initially spurned a $2.2bn offer from Endo (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Endo-wins-over-Auxilium-QLT-dropped-354371" target="_new">9 October 2014</a>). </p><p>Last year, Endo also acquired Paladin Labs, Boca Pharmacal, Grupo Farmaceutico Somar and Dava Pharmaceuticals for more than $3.5bn in combined deal values (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Endo-not-planning-to-halt-buying-spree-354384" target="_new">9 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Endo offered to help Salix pay the breakup fee outlined in its acquisition agreement with Valeant in light of Endo's higher value offer.</p><p>Endo investors seemed unconvinced by the value of the company's largest ever possible M&A deal, however. Endo closed down 1.4% at $87.76 per share on 11 March, bringing its market cap to $15.6bn versus Salix's $10.8bn market cap.</p><p>Valeant closed 3.9% lower at $193.71 with a $65.1bn market cap.</p><p><p><p><p>
