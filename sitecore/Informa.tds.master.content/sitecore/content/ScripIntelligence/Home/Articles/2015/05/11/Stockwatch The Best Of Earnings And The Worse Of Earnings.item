<p>Last week, approaching the end of this third-quarter earnings season, it seemed that all the good and all the bad events that investors could expect happened in the same week. On the positive side, the acquisitions of the biotechnology companies Dyax Corp. and ZS Pharma, Inc. were announced, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. licensed its Phase III-ready product to Sanofi, and the NASDAQ Biotchnology Index (NBI) finished the week just into positive territory after a gut-wrenching down-day on Thursday. </p><p><p>I was, however, left feeling not so much that the party was in full swing but rather that an attendee who is usually the life and soul of the party had shown up in the dying embers of the evening. While third-quarter earnings season continues to be a bit of a mixed bag, it appears that the medical conference season may be the late entrant that is supporting the sector's expectations.</p><p><p>The week started off well enough with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Lands-Dyax-But-Refuses-To-Give-Up-Baxalta-361340" target="_new">Shire Plc's acquisition of Dyax</a> and Incyte Corp's third-quarter estimate-beating earnings announcement. By the end of the week, however, Incyte was the villain rather than the stock market hero. The analysts from Jefferies pointed out following Incyte's earnings announcement that, <i>'Jakafi</i> [ruxolitinib] sales maintain strong foundation as pipeline progresses'. By the end of the week Incyte and partner Merck & Co. updated the clinical results on the IDO inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Incyte-and-Merck-Push-IO-Drug-Forward-361028" target="_new">epacadostat in combination with Keytruda</a> (pembrolizumab). Blockbuster expectations for greater efficacy in advanced cancers were not dashed but they were severely dented, and Incyte's share price finished, like the NBI, only slightly up on the week.</p><p><p>As the week wore on, disappointing third-quarter earnings announcements seemed to take the edge off the week's earlier M&A activity. AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., fresh from a marketing trip to Europe last month to entice unsuspecting investors onto its share register, hit them with disappointing sales not just for its recently acquired product <i>Makena</i> (hydroxyprogesterone caproate), for which it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AMAG-buying-once-bankrupt-Lumara-for-up-to-1bn-354203" target="_new">paid up to $1bn</a> and generated sales of $65m last quarter, but also for the even more recently acquired Cord Blood Registry which cost $700m but for which AMAG recognized only $14m in sales in the last quarter. AMAG could generate extra revenue by giving lessons in (a) overpaying for underperforming assets, (b) damaging shareholder value by a lack of due diligence in M&A transactions and (c) the dangers of raising debt for acquisitions in a week when a near-term US interest rate rise looked more imminent.</p><p><p>Perhaps the worst outcome for the sector during last week was the profit warning at Sanofi. Ahead of its investor relations seminar, Sanofi softened up its investors by cancelling expectations for earnings growth through 2017 as a result of its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lantus-Loss-Drags-Down-Sanofis-Diabetes-Franchise-361296" target="_new">declining diabetes franchise</a>. Sanofi's lack of prowess in diabetes seems to be repeatedly testing its investors with its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Sanofis-insulin-war-354807" target="_new">commercial missteps in the US</a>, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lucky-MannKind-bags-Sanofi-as-Afrezza-partner-353335" target="_new">disastrous licensing of Afrezza</a> &ndash; MannKind Corp's inhaled insulin, and the commercial disappointment of its GLP-1 receptor agonist <i>Lyxumia</i> (lixisenatide), licensed from Zealand Pharma A/S. In response to Sanofi's announcement (and Novo Nordisk's A/S weak third-quarter results), the analysts at Jefferies updated their previous day's research with a note entitled 'Diabetes 2025: deep dive turns into nose dive'. Not content with making a bad commercial situation worse, Sanofi demonstrated at best a scattergun approach to product licensing or at worse an AMAG-like approach when it announced the licensing of a replacement for <i>Lyxumia</i> from <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-Looks-To-Hanmi-Deal-To-Bolster-Diabetes-Franchise-361386" target="_new">Hanmi Pharmaceuticals</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/No-Break-For-Sanofi-Seals-Another-Diabetes-Deal-361414" target="_new">Lexicon's SGLT-1/2 inhibitor</a>: the latter had remained on the shelf at Lexicon for over a year having been passed over by more discerning licensors.</p><p><p>In the distant heyday of last summer, the mere anticipation that a company was going to present data at a medical conference was enough to send the share price up, and even if the results were no more than neutral, those gains would be maintained and a secondary share offering supported. The market is now thankfully more discriminating and I would expect most other investors to have, like me, established the junk email rule for any company announcement that contains the phrase "presents at conference". It appears that many of bluebird bio, Inc.'s investors are not as sophisticated, though, since a press release that preceded the abstracts for the forthcoming American Society for Hematology (ASH) conference was accompanied by a share price plummet that had knock-on effects on most of the gene therapy space.</p><p><p>For me the biggest surprise in bluebird's announcement was not that its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/bluebird-Grounded-By-Results-But-Still-Has-Potential-To-Soar-361401" target="_new">gene therapy vector does not work in all patients</a> or that one dose may not result in a complete cure, but that after announcing the preliminary results from the dosing of eight beta-thalassemia (BT) and one sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients at last year's ASH conference, the abstracts for the ASH conference 12 months later will provide data on only two new BT and no new SCD patients. Who says that the sector &ndash; and bluebird's $2.7bn valuation &ndash; are based on rock-solid foundations?</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Incyte and Merck.</p><p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest is the investment adviser for the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for four life science</i>&ndash;<i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p><p>
