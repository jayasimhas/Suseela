<p>Gilead Sciences president and chief operating officer John Milligan shed a little light on the company's strategy of negotiating US payer reimbursement deals for its newest hepatitis C drug Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), noting a shift from exclusive coverage to shared access to patients.</p><p>Dr Milligan addressed Foster City, California-based Gilead's quickly changing reimbursement strategy on 13 January during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco &ndash; one day after the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Prime Therapeutics revealed that it would cover both once-daily Harvoni and AbbVie's twice-daily, four-pill product Viekira Pak. Gilead's president said that such deals, which he referred to as parity agreements, are what both companies prefer to negotiate going forward.</p><p>The Prime contract follows close behind a deal that AbbVie negotiated with the PBM Express Scripts, which gave Viekira (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir) exclusive reimbursement for the treatment of patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>). </p><p>In January, Gilead negotiated exclusive coverage with the PBM CVS/Caremark for Harvoni and Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) to treat all HCV genotypes and with the health plan Anthem for exclusive reimbursement for Harvoni (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gileads-CVS-exclusive-may-best-AbbVies-Express-Scripts-hepatitis-C-deal-355940" target="_new">6 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-gives-Viekira-dependent-2015-guidance-as-Anthem-chooses-Harvoni-356035" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>).</p><p>"In the recent week, we have seen more [health] plans interested in parity access," Dr Milligan said during the breakout Q&A session following his formal JP Morgan presentation. "We see AbbVie more interested too, which is a reversal."</p><p>Dr Milligan noted that the volume of sales achieved after Sovaldi's US FDA approval in late 2013 &ndash; $7.3bn in the US in the first nine months of 2014 &ndash; was closer to the high volume that Gilead expected to see for Harvoni after the one-pill, two-drug fixed-dose combination was approved in October (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-wins-OK-for-Sovaldi-but-1000-a-day-price-criticized-348611" target="_new">7 December 2013</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">10 October 2014</a>). </p><p>That's why, after Harvoni's launch, Gilead went to payers to negotiate pricing appropriate for rapid and broad prescribing for the drug.</p><p>"We're pleased with the pricing and the access we're getting. We're very happy with where we've come out in this process," Dr Milligan said. "We have access to more patients [for Harvoni] than ever before [with Sovaldi]."</p><p>He declined, of course, to reveal the discounts offered to CVS, Anthem and Prime versus the $84,000 and $94,500 costs for a 12-week course of Sovaldi and Harvoni, respectively. Each contract is too different with discounts based on the amount of access provided to patients to give a general discount rate, Dr Milligan said.</p><p>Hepatitis C drug pricing and reimbursement is critical for Gilead given the instant blockbuster status of Sovaldi, which has diversified the company's revenue base beyond its historical reliance on HIV medicines. </p><p>HIV products provided 76% of Gilead's revenue in the first nine months of 2013, but the company's revenue almost doubled by the same period in 2014 when 44% of sales came from HIV medicines and 48% came from HCV drugs.</p><p>Dr Milligan said during his formal JP Morgan presentation that the process of gaining reimbursement for Sovaldi in Europe is going well. </p><p>The UK's health technology appraisal (HTA) body NICE found Sovaldi cost effective in August and the drug should be on the market there in the first quarter of 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NICE-gives-Gileads-Sovaldi-green-light-353395" target="_new">15 August 2014</a>). Gilead also negotiated a Sovaldi reimbursement scheme in France in November that could set the standard for other HCV therapies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/French-Sovaldi-price-deal-sets-the-standard-355223" target="_new">24 November 2014</a>). </p><p>Based on its EU successes for Sovaldi, the company believes that Harvoni could become available in Europe relatively soon.</p><p>"Harvoni price negotiations in Europe are going much faster than Sovaldi negotiations," Dr Milligan said.</p><p><p><p><p>
