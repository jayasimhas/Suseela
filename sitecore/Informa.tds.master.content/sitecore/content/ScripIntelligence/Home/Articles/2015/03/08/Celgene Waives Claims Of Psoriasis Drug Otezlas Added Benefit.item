<p>Celgene GmbH's psoriasis drug, <i>Otezla</i> (apremilast) offers no added benefits over its rivals already on the market, says Germany's Federal Joint Committee, G-BA, the body in charge of the AMNOG benefit assessments. However, it confirmed that the drug is able to be prescribed and reimbursed because it has lower treatment costs than its competitors.</p><p>The company seems to have planned for such a decision: "Knowing the formal-methodological requirements for obtaining an additional benefit status, the manufacturing company had already waived claims to an additional benefit when submitting its dossier," it said in a statement this week.</p><p>Because the GB-A found that Otezla is cost-effective and has annual treatment costs that are already lower than those for appropriate comparator treatments, price negotiations with the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV) will start, Celgene noted in an Aug. 6, press release. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had previously noted that, "Otezla's pricing in psoriasis is expected to be in line with its pricing in psoriatic arthritis, where Celgene is thought to have priced the drug at approximately a 30% discount to available therapies Amgen's Enbrel and Humira."</p><p>The GB-A's outcome follows the same verdict from Germany's Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG), which said in May that as a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients, Otezla showed "no added benefit" over currently available products. IQWiG said at the time it examined two dossiers to determine whether Celgene's drug provided benefits over the respective comparator therapies, but neither dossier contained the relevant data for assessment.The comparator drugs considered included AbbVie's <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) and <i>Enbrel</i> (etanercept), Johnson & Johnson's <i>Stelara</i> (ustekinumab) and <i>Simponi</i> (golimumab) and infliximab. </p><p>Gerwin Winter, general manager of Celgene, said the demand for Otezla in Germany is strong. "Since February, when Otezla was launched in Germany, already more than 1,500 patients have been treated with the new drug," he said in a statement commenting on the GB-A's decision. "This strong demand and the positive feedback provided by physicians and patients confirm that Otezla fills an important gap in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis thanks to its unique efficacy and tolerability profile and simple oral application."</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare has forecast that sales of the drug will reach $24m in Germany by 2022. It has estimated that Germany will be the second most lucrative market for the Celgene with this product, after the U.S. &ndash; where sales are expected to reach $195m*. Total sales for Otezla are predicted to reach $270m by 2022. </p><p>The biggest challenge for Celgene's product is that though the drug's "oral formulation may appeal to patients who are reluctant to initiate biologic therapy, its cost and the fact that it does not offer any efficacy advantages over the longstanding biologics, with which physicians have extensive experience, will restrict uptake," Datamonitor analysts noted. </p><p>Otezla, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), was approved in Europe in January 2015. It is only currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but Celgene is testing the drug in a number of other indications, including: Phase III trials in ankylosing spondylitis and Beh&ccedil;et syndrome; and Phase II trials in ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies of the drug in asthma were suspended in 2005.</p><p>*<i>Datamonitor Healthcare's market forecasts for Otezla by country include numbers for the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.</i></p><p>
