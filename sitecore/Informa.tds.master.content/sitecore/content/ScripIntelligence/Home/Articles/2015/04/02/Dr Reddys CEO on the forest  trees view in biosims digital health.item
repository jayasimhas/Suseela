<p>G V Prasad, CEO of Dr Reddy's Laboratories, is known as much for his big picture view &ndash; a trait he believes he absorbed from Dr Reddy's founder chairman and his father-in-law, the late Dr Anji Reddy &ndash; as he is for an eye for detail.</p><p>''I learnt to see the forest from him [Dr Anji Reddy], but my father is very detail-oriented, so I learnt to see the trees from him,'' Mr Prasad told <i>Scrip</i> in a recent interview at his office in Hyderabad.</p><p>If big picture issues such as unfolding developments in the biosimilars space and pharma's flirtation with non-traditional partners such as Google and Microsoft for innovation are things that engage him, he's also open to being held accountable for each employee's actions in the backdrop of India's new Uniform Code of Pharmaceuticals Marketing Practices (UCPMP). Tapping into new emerging markets is on Dr Reddy's agenda too, he indicated.</p><p>But first the big picture issues. Mr Prasad notes how the biosimilars game is not quite a ''generic plus'' model as was probably generally envisaged once upon a time.</p><p>''Everybody is going full hog in terms of trial design and trial size..it's largely shifting to a big pharma model &ndash; not a generic plus model but an innovator minus model,'' he says.</p><p>Asked whether Teva's tbo-filgrastim filed under the 351(a) biologics license application (BLA) process [since at the time of filing the US biosimilar approval pathway had not yet been established] may be at a disadvantage, with Sandoz's filgrastim biosimilar [filed as a 351(k) biosimilar biological product application] receiving the backing of a FDA panel <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-biosimilar-1st-to-win-FDA-panel-backing-355993%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 January 2015)</a>, Mr Prasad noted that both products need detailing or some kind of payor relationship. </p><p>''Incrementally, I don&rsquo;t think anybody has a clear advantage. How market shares will develop is still up in the air. I don&rsquo;t think we have a view on it. The EU and US are diverging on interchangeability and the game has not played out yet,'' he said. </p><p>In 2012, Teva got US approval to market tbo-filgrastim, a short-acting recombinant form of G-CSF, but the FDA held that the drug, sold as Granix, is not a biosimilar because it was reviewed under the agency's 351(a) biologics license application process and not as a 351(k) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tomatotomahto-Teva-tbo-filgrastim-OKd-but-FDA-says-not-biosimilar-to-Neupogen-334470%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 August 2012)</a>. Teva's filgrastim in Europe (marketed as Tevagrastim) is regarded by regulators there as being biosimilar to Neupogen.</p><p>On any potential lessons therein for Dr Reddy's, he maintained it was too early to say and that ''the game is too rich for any generic company to say that they have figured it out''.</p><p>Dr Reddy's, on its part, is ''aggressively'' pursuing biosimilar registrations in emerging markets. Mr Prasad attributed a perceived slowdown in new product introductions to a ''little bit of distraction'' in trying to servicing the Merck relationship for ''first world markets''.</p><p>Biosimilar versions of Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) are potential products on the horizon for Dr Reddy's, he indicated, adding that the company was also now approaching things ''globally'', distinct from previous efforts to work on India trials and launch plans quickly. </p><p>''We are looking at it from an emerging markets plus India kind of approach. Our own philosophy has changed on how we do trials, so we are trying to harmonize that,'' he added. </p><p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories has an alliance with Merck Serono, a unit of Merck KGaA, to co-develop, manufacture and commercialize a basket of oncology biosimilars, primarily focused on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-and-Merck-Serono-sew-up-oncology-biosimilars-alliance-331494%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 6 June 2012)</a>. </p><p>Mr Prasad also indicated that it may be just too early to draw sweeping conclusions on the supposed limited uptake of biosimilars, including their acceptance on tenders in formularies in certain markets, as alluded to by some innovator firms. </p><p>In emerging markets, Mr Prasad notes that tender uptake had been faster than in self paid/prescription markets, where it is much slower. </p><p>''Tender is driven on price &#8230; if there is a viable product approved, equivalent, it quickly switches. Tender uptake is not bad. If you classify emerging markets where tenders are there, uptake will be much faster &ndash; Latin America, Middle East, various countries. The whole challenge is getting the registration,'' he said. </p><p>In 2013-14, Dr Reddy's reported biologics revenues of INR2.15bn ($35m), as against INR1.5bn in the previous fiscal year. Products launched include rituximab, filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and darbepoetin and markets covered for some of these, in addition to India, include Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Jamaica and Myanmar. </p><h2>Digital health</h2><p>Significantly, beyond current businesses, an area that appears to get the Dr Reddy's boss both charged up and concerned is developments in the digital health space and how pharma companies, in general, including Dr Reddy's, are behind the curve.</p><p>''As CEO, I'm very concerned about our lack of innovation outside pharmaceuticals&#8230; and we will face a very uncertain future if we don&rsquo;t look at those trends&#8230;..those weak signals happening. Digital health is going to change the future of healthcare and companies like Google and lot of other start-ups are doing very exciting things. I actually hired a manager to think about this,'' Mr Prasad said. </p><p>While Dr Reddy's is studying the space &ndash; developments in digital health, diagnostics and devices &ndash; Mr Prasad says that in the next five years he would be very surprised it some ''dramatic things'' don't happen in the healthcare space, akin to driverless cars. </p><p>Last year Google unveiled a prototype of a self-driving car, with two seats, no steering wheel and peak speed of 40km per hour. Novartis's Alcon unit had previously signed up with Google to license the latter's "smart lens" technology, which could lead to medical innovations such as constant blood sugar monitoring via the eye, or adaptive focusing of contact lenses <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Google-and-Novartis-in-smart-lens-pact-352875%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 15 July 2014)</a>. More recently scientists at the University of California, San Diego, were reported to have developed a temporary tattoo-based glucose sensor for non-invasive glycemic monitoring.</p><p>Mr Prasad sees healthcare moving from curing diseases to maintaining health through online and real time devices and diagnostics. </p><p>''As a CEO, when I look at the horizon, I can see this storm brewing...it's digital health, advances in genomics, the low cost of sequencing, big data that integrates all this. It's a perfect storm.''</p><h2>Accountability</h2><p>Alongside the forest view, Mr Prasad is also all for the onus of compliance being on the CEO under India's code of marketing practices for the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>''I'd like to be held accountable for every employee's action. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with that. I would welcome myself to be under scrutiny for marketing practices,'' he said, when asked what if a medical representative down the line reports wrongly or then takes things into his own hands.</p><p>India's new Uniform Code of Pharmaceuticals Marketing Practices (UCPMP) is to be effective, initially voluntarily for six months from 1 January 2015. If not implemented effectively, the government may consider making it a statutory code. The code specifies, among other things, that that the managing director/CEO of a company is ''ultimately responsible'' for ensuring adherence to the code <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-marketing-code-puts-onus-on-CEO-355821%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 24 December 2014)</a>. </p>
