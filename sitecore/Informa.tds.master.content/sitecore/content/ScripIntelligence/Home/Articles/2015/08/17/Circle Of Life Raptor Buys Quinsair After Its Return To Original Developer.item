<p>Quinsair (inhaled levofloxacin) &ndash; originally known as Aeroquin &ndash; took a circuitous route to its new home at Raptor Pharmaceuticals, which will pay Tripex Pharmaceuticals $68.4m up front and up to $350m in milestone fees plus a small royalty for the cystic fibrosis (CF) drug.</p><p>The inhaled antibiotic is approved in the EU and Canada as a twice-daily therapy to help CF patients manage chronic pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following a series of acquisitions that put Quinsair in the hands of Allergan, rights to the drug were returned to its original developer about four years after the original deal.</p><p>Aeroquin was developed by Mpex Pharmaceuticals, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Axcan-to-acquire-Mpex-gaining-Phase-III-candidate-aerosol-antibiotic-for-CF-patients-314156" target="_new">was acquired</a> by Aptalis (formerly Axcan) in April 2011. Forest Laboratories bought Aptalis for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-bets-on-growth-with-2.9bn-Aptalis-buy-349184" target="_new">$2.9bn in January 2014</a>, just a month before Actavis agreed to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Not-so-puzzling-Actavis-Forest-pieces-fit-strategic-gaps-350116" target="_new">pay roughly $25bn</a> for Forest. Then, earlier this year, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">Actavis bought Allergan</a> and took on the brand-name specialist's name.</p><p>Mpex CEO Daniel Burgess went on to found <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/VCs-dump-67.5M-into-Rempex-rump-Mpex-for-ESKAPE-efflux-pump-inhibitors-323591" target="_new">Rempex Pharmaceuticals</a> after the Axcan deal to develop assets that weren't sold in that transaction. Tripex is the third firm in Burgess's series of startups. The shell company was established by Mpex's shareholders when Allergan decided earlier this year to return Quinsair to its original developers. </p><p>The European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended in December that the EMA should approve Quinsair for CF patients. The EMA granted marketing authorization in March and Health Canada approved the product in June. </p><p><b>Raptor's Strategy</b></p><p>Raptor will launch Quinsair in both markets during the first half of 2016. The company also plans to discuss a path to approval with the US FDA next year.</p><p>Novato, California-based Raptor specializes in therapies to treat rare diseases and the company already markets <i>Procysbi</i> (cysteamine bitartrate), which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Raptor-rises-on-US-Procysbi-OK-342653" target="_new">approved in the US</a> in 2013 and later in the EU to manage nephropathic cystinosis. </p><p>Raptor also is developing RP-103, a delayed-release version of Procysbi, to treat <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Raptor-rises-as-RP103-misses-Huntingtons-endpoint-350166" target="_new">Huntington's disease</a>, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children, and various mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>The company anticipates that its existing sales team, which has experience with CF and anti-microbial products, will be able to market Quinsair with additional hires as needed, according to Raptor vice president of corporate strategy and communications Kim Lee.</p><p>Raptor also is evaluating Quinsair's potential to treat bronchiectasis and nontuberculous mycobacteria lung infections and may initiate a clinical trial in at least one of the indications in 2016. </p><p>"The Quinsair acquisition is transformational for Raptor and delivers on our strategic focus to develop and commercialize therapies that bring significant relief to patients and families living with life-threatening diseases," Raptor president and CEO Julie Anne Smith said in a statement issued after the stock market closed on 20 August.</p><p>Smith told <i>Scrip</i> last year that Raptor was considering whether to take some internal preclinical programs into the clinic or <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Interviews-with-future-Raptor-CEO-Smith-Epirus-CEO-Munshi-Clinical-updates-from-Alkermes-BioLineRx-Targacept-352951" target="_new">acquire outside assets</a> that complement the company's strategic focus on rare diseases. </p><p>Chief financial and accounting officer Michael Smith said during an Aug. 20 conference call that the Quinsair transaction "does not preclude us from continuing to review potential opportunities as they arise and we continue to evaluate other assets."</p><p>Investors expressed support for the company's strategy on 21 August, sending Raptor's stock 5.8% higher to close at $12.72 per share, which was notable since broader stock indices &ndash; the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq &ndash; fell more than 3% based on global economic concerns.</p><p>The Quinsair acquisition will not change Raptor's guidance for 2015, which anticipates $80m to $90m in revenue for the year. The deal also shouldn't have a major impact on the company's $193m cash balance as of June 30, since as much as half of the upfront fee promised to Tripex and a portion of the future milestone fees may be paid in Raptor stock.</p><p><p><p><p>
