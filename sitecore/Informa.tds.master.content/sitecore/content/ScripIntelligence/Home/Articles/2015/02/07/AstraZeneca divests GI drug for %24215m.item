<p>AstraZeneca continues efforts to streamline its non-core commercial portfolio with the divestment of global rights, outside the US, to Entocort (budesonide), a gastroenterology medicine for patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. </p><p>Tillotts Pharma, part of the Zeria Group of Japan, will pay AstraZeneca $215m to acquire the rights to sell and develop Entocort capsules and enema formulations outside the US. The transaction does not include the transfer of any AstraZeneca employees or facilities.</p><p>AstraZeneca has a partnership with Par Pharmaceutical for the commercialization of Entocort in the US.</p><p>Entocort is currently available in over 40 countries, with total product sales of $53 million outside the US in 2014. A regulatory submission for Entocort in Japan is anticipated in the coming months.</p><p>"Our agreement with Tillotts reinforces our strategic focus on selected therapy areas and puts this important medicine in the hands of a company with specialist expertise in gastroenterology, which will benefit patients," said Luke Miels, executive vice president, Global Product and Portfolio Strategy and Corporate Affairs at AstraZeneca. </p><p>"Entocort perfectly complements our Asacol portfolio marketed in 50 countries worldwide through our own European affiliates, our Japanese parent company Zeria Pharmaceutical and our trusted network of marketing partners," commented Thomas T�th von Kiskér, CEO of Tillotts. The company hopes that adding Entocort to its portfolio will enhance its ability to compete in Europe and globally for further licensing deals and acquisitions.</p><p>As AstraZeneca will no longer retain an interest in the ex-US rights to Entocort, the upfront receipt will be reported in Other Operating Income in the company's financial statements for 2015. The transaction is expected to complete in the second half of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions, and does not impact AstraZeneca's financial guidance for 2015.</p><p><b>Entocort details</b></p><p>In capsule formulation, Entocort is a first-line therapy indicated for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission of mild to moderate active Crohn's disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon. As an enema, Entocort is indicated for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission of distal ulcerative colitis in the rectum, sigmoid colon and descending colon.</p>
