<p> Blend Therapeutics added $21m in equity and debt financing to its Series B venture capital round to advance the Watertown, Massachusetts-based company's Pentarin platform for the development of biologic-drug conjugates encapsulated in nanoparticles. </p><p> Blend has raised $39.8m to date, including its initial $16m Series B round in late 2012 and a $2.8m Series A completed in early 2012. The expansion of its Series B round was supported by an unnamed new investor and Blend's prior backers, including New Enterprise Associates, Flagship Ventures, NanoDimension and Eminent Venture Capital. An institutional investment firm provided the debt financing. </p><p> Blend recently licensed novel bi-podal biologic-targeting ligands from a private biotechnology company to support its Pentarin platform, which will conjugate a targeting ligand to a therapeutic payload with a chemical linker to create miniaturized biologic-drug conjugates (mBDCs). The mBDCs are encapsulated in nanoparticles to create Pentarins, a new class of cancer therapies that can penetrate deep into solid tumor tissue. </p><p> &quot;We look forward to conducting [investigational new drug (IND) application] enabling studies to advance our lead Pentarin drug program BTP-277 and completing IND-enabling studies of our novel, personalized cisplatin BTP-114 from our longstanding R&amp;D in platinum drugs,&quot; Blend president of research and development Richard Wooster said. </p><p> BTP-114 is a novel cisplatin prodrug that is designed to preferentially accumulate platinum at the tumor site, deliver a concentrated therapeutic effect and target specific cancers. </p><p> <b>Actavis rises on fast Namenda IR appeal</b> </p><p> Actavis closed up 3.9% at $265.23 per share on 7 January after it was revealed that the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the company's motion for a fast appeal of a New York judge's December ruling, which will prevent Actavis from stopping distribution of immediate-release (IR) Namenda (memantine) before generic versions of the Alzheimer's disease drug become available in mid-2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/NY-judge-requires-Actavis-to-keep-Namenda-IR-on-market-355623" target="_new">12 December 2014</a>). </p><p> The higher court approved an expedited briefing schedule for Actavis's appeal of the decision issued by Judge Robert Sweet in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Sweet said Actavis must continue to distribute twice-daily Namenda IR pills while the company attempts to switch Alzheimer's patients to once-daily Nameda extended-release (XR). </p><p> New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued Actavis for antitrust violations based on the company's plans for a &quot;hard switch&quot; of patients from Namenda IR to Namenda XR before less costly generic versions of the twice-daily immediate-release pills hit the market (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Actavis-faces-New-York-antitrust-lawsuit-over-Namenda-XR-switch-354047" target="_new">20 September 2014</a>). </p><p> The appeals court denied Actavis's request to stay Judge Sweet's ruling in the antitrust lawsuit while the appeal is ongoing, but the company's president and CEO Brent Saunders said Actavis is &quot;pleased that the appeals court has agreed to hear this on an accelerated basis and optimistic that the court will overturn the lower court's unprecedented ruling.&quot; </p><p> Following its $25bn acquisition of Forest Laboratories last year, Namenda is Actavis's highest-grossing brand name drug franchise with $427.6m in third quarter 2014 sales. The US FDA approved Namzaric, a fixed-dose combination of Namenda XR and Aricept (donepezil), in late December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merry-Christmas-Four-US-FDA-approvals-and-a-CRL-355850" target="_new">27 December 2014</a>). </p><p> <b>Tetragenetics, MedImmune partner on antibody drug discovery</b> </p><p> Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Tetragenetics will use its ion channel production technology called SionX to produce up to five ion channel antigens for AstraZeneca's biologics development group MedImmune to use in its antibody drug discovery programs. SionX allows for high density expression of recombinant ion channels for antibody drug discovery that's not possible with low levels of ion channel expression in standard cell lines. </p><p> &quot;Combining our unique antigens with MedImmune's advanced antibody discovery platforms and skills has the potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of new antibody therapeutics for a wide variety of diseases in which ion channels are implicated, such as those involving inflammatory conditions,&quot; Tetragenetics CEO Douglas Kahn said. </p><p> MedImmune will have non-exclusive access to ion channel antigens from Tetragenetics, which will receive undisclosed upfront license fees and research funding as well as milestone payments associated with preclinical research, clinical development and product sales. </p><p> <b>Naia launches with regional, global platform and licensed assets</b> </p><p> Greenbrae, California-based Naia Limited launched on 5 January to develop and commercialize therapies in various indications for regional and global unmet needs. The company did not disclose how much money has been invested in the startup initially, but one of Naia's first investors is Egypt-based Pharco Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest pharma companies in the Middle East. </p><p> &quot;We will undertake progressive licensing efforts on a local and regional basis to expedite access to new therapeutics while extracting maximal value. We expect that this approach will translate into opportunities for more affordable therapeutics,&quot; said Naia co-founder, chairman and CEO Daniel Perez. </p><p> Naia consists of an international management company based in the Cayman Islands with separate holding companies focused on development activities for specific compounds and therapeutic areas. Naia will targets emerging markets, such as the Middle East, Latin America and Asia-Pacific as well as certain strategic opportunities in development markets. </p><p> The company's rare disease pipeline includes GLP-1 XTEN (NB1001) and GLP-2 XTEN (NB1002) receptor agonists licensed from Amunix Pharmaceuticals for up to $70m in milestone payments for each drug candidate. Both will be developed to treat short bowel syndrome. </p><p> Naia's metabolic disease drug candidates includes NC 101, which was acquired in an undisclosed transaction, and NB1001. The company will run a Phase II study for NC101 in patients ith type 2 diabetes and abnormal liver function as well as a Phase Ib study for NB1001 in type 2 diabetes. </p><p> <b>Boehringer, BioMed X collaborate in COPD epigenetics</b> </p><p> BioMed X and Boehringer Ingelheim will collaborate on the identification of novel therapeutic concepts for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The partners' new research group will extend an invitation to early career scientists from academic institutions to submit project proposals focused on epigenetics and COPD. </p><p> Boehringer and BioMed X, which operates an open innovation laboratory at the University of Heidelberg in Germany, will jointly select proposals deserving of funding and mentorship provided by academia and Boehringer. BioMed X will coordinate the epigenetics and COPD research group, which plans to recruit another pharma partner. </p> <p><p><p><p>
