<p>The soap opera-worthy saga of unrequited love featuring generics companies Teva, Mylan and Perrigo took a completely unexpected twist at the start of this week when Teva and Allergan agreed to get together. Teva is buying Allergan's generic pharmaceuticals business &ndash; the company formerly known as Actavis &ndash; for $40.5bn.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">deal with Allergan led to Teva simultaneously dropping its pursuit of Mylan</a>, much to Mylan's relief. But Mylan is continuing its wooing of Perrigo, which is wholly unimpressed by the interest.</p><p>The deal was apparently negotiated in just three weeks. What persuaded Allergan's CEO to divest a business that he was seemingly so dedicated on building? Brent Saunders cited the long identified need for consolidation in the generics sector and an attractive offer by sweet talking Teva. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> had some fun speculating on what the master dealmaker might <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-36bn-from-Teva-what-should-Allergan-buy-next-359644" target="_new">spend the proceeds on</a>. </p><p>However, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hikma-sixth-largest-US-generics-firm-following-Roxane-buy-from-Boehringer-359660" target="_new">another significant generics acquisition</a> &ndash; announced just a day after the Teva/Allergan Generics marriage &ndash; also demonstrated the many and varying dynamics that drive M&A in the sector. Hikma, the Jordanian-founded, London-listed generics company, agreed to buy Boehringer Ingelheim's US generics business Roxane for $2.65bn.</p><p>The leadership table of generics firms has changed considerably in recent years, and big firms are continuously jockeying for position at the top. Some have chosen to get out of the rat race, designating generics as 'non-core' and shedding their assets to competitors. However, others have decided that cheap debt and patent expiries outweigh the increasingly tight margins and justify the pursuit of economies of scale; these companies are fully committed to staying the course. </p><p>Hikma's latest acquisition makes it the sixth largest generics player by revenue in the US. There is no business like the US generics business, according to CEO Said Darwazah. "If you want to grow fast, there is no other market that can provide you with this kind of opportunity," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Is Hikma now an even more attractive M&A target? Yes, said Mr Darwazah, but it seems Hikma is experienced in fending off over-amorous suitors.</p><p>
