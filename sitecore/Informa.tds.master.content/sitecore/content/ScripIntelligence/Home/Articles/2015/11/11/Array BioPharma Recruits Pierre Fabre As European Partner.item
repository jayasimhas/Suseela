<p>The ability of Pierre Fabre to compete in the near term against oncology heavyweights like Novartis and Roche was key to selecting the French company to commercialize and further develop Array BioPharma's MEK inhibitor binimetinib and BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in Europe and emerging markets.</p><p>With the compounds suddenly divested to it earlier this year and Phase III clinical studies involving the two agents nearing completion, Array BioPharma needed to sign up marketing partners quickly, and it announced a partnering deal with Pierre Fabre, France's third largest pharmaceutical company and a seasoned oncology development and marketing company, on Nov. 16. </p><p>The US company also wanted a partner that would prioritize its drugs, and Pierre Fabre fitted the bill here too, with its maturing anticancer portfolio and several anticancer monoclonal antibodies, cardiovasculars and schizophrenia agents in Phase II development, but none likely to come to the market in the near term, according to Informa PLC's <i>Pharmaprojects</i> database. The French company's oncology sales totaled more than $200 million in 2014.</p><p>Top-line data from the NEMO study involving binimetinib use in NRAS-mutant melanoma is expected to be released in a matter of weeks, and top-line data from the COLUMBUS study involving binimetinib plus encorafenib use in BRAF-mutant melanoma is due in the first half of 2016. Binimetinib is also being studied in the Phase III MILO study in patients with low-grade serous ovarian cancer, and all three Phase III studies are funded to completion by ex-developer Novartis.</p><p>Multiple regulatory submissions for both drugs are expected later in 2016, including submissions for a combination of the two agents in BRAF melanoma, and binimetinib could be commercialized by the end of 2016, Array's CEO Ron Squarer said in a Nov. 16 analysts' briefing. </p><p>Array BioPharma is currently planning to market the two small-molecule kinase inhibitors in the US itself, and has been looking for commercialization partners ever since Novartis divested both products to it so that the Swiss company could satisfy anticompetitive concerns of the European Commission and the US Federal Trade Commission. </p><p>These concerns arose when Novartis bought GlaxoSmithKline's oncology portfolio in an asset swap completed earlier this year, and the Swiss company decided to keep GSK's marketed MEK inhibitor <i>Mekinist</i> (trametinib) and BRAF inhibitor <i>Tafinlar</i> (dabrafenib). Novartis was told to divest its two investigational products by the competition authorities because the only other similar marketed kinase inhibitor was Roche's BRAF inhibitor <i>Zelboraf</i> (vemurafenib), and new entrants into this market segment were not expected. Binimetinib was originally licensed from Array and was returned, and encorafenib was licensed by Novartis to the US company. </p><p>Pierre Fabre markets a maturing portfolio of anticancers including <i>Navelbine</i> (vinorelbine) and <i>Javlor</i> (vinflunine), and since a restructuring of its pharmaceutical business at the end of 2014, its pharmaceuticals division has been looking for external collaborators and partners to supplement its own internal R&D. The French company has a medical and commercial infrastructure that can quickly be put to use to market Array BioPharma's products, and to make them a priority.</p><p>"We have been in discussions with Array BioPharma for a number of months, and clearly the footprint of Pierre Fabre was exactly what Array BioPharma wanted," commented Frederic Duchesne, CEO of the pharma division, Pierre Fabre Pharmaceuticals in a Nov. 16 interview. The company operates throughout Europe and has subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico, China, Australia, Russia and Vietnam and many countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>"Part of our strategic plan is to reinforce our portfolio of marketed and late-stage products, and the Array BioPharma deal should lead to products on the market in two to three years," Duchesne said. </p><p>"But it's too early to say where the products will be definitely positioned among the different approaches that are now available to treat Braf melanoma, we will have to wait for the results of clinical studies," he continued. </p><p>Squarer suggested the companies might be able to differentiate the small-molecule anticancers from other approaches in terms of better tolerance, with lower levels of fever and rash. And no other MEK inhibitor is indicated for use in NRAS-melanoma, so if the results of the NEMO study are positive, binimetinib could be in a strong position, he added.</p><p>Array BioPharma has retained marketing rights in the US, Canada, Japan, Korea and Israel, but has received an upfront payment of $30m and could receive up to $425m in milestone payments and double-digit sales royalties from Pierre Fabre for development and commercialization rights in all other markets in Europe, Asia and Latin America. </p><p>It's the second payment Array BioPharma has received recently for the two anticancers &ndash; it received a $85m payment from Novartis when it completed the acquisition of the two products in March 2015. Array BioPharma and Pierre Fabre will split future development costs 60:40, with clinical trials in colorectal cancer and further studies in melanoma likely to be the first new indications to explore. </p><p><p><p>
