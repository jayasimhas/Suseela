<p> <p> Now that the abstracts from the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting have been made public, it's important for investors to take a close look at what data is going to get stocks moving. Immunotherapies have been a particularly hot area over the last few years and big pharma has been at the forefront of the space. If you don't have time to pore over the 5,000 or so abstracts available, here are some of the big pharma highlights: </p> <p> <b>POPLAR</b> </p> <p> Roche hopes to be one of the key players in the immuno-oncology race, but is a step behind both Merck &amp; Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Yet, the big pharma is hoping the data from its tree-themed clinical program will help once it finally gets to market. The company has been further diversifying its program by focusing on biomarkers and companion diagnostics. </p> <p> Roche announced the interim results from Phase II POPLAR study in abstract 8010. The study compares RG7446 (MPDL3280A) vs docetaxel in patients with second-line or third-line non-small cell lung cancer. The drug previously received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in NSCLC patients who were also expressed the PD-L1 gene and progressed despite standard therapies &ndash; patients were randomized based on their level of PD-L1 expression. </p> <p> At the median point of the study, the data shows that RG7446 reduced the risk of death in the overall population of the study by about 22%, with patients on the drug having an overall survival of 11.4 months compared with 9.5 months for the docetaxel-treated patients. </p> <p> Those patients with increasing PD-L1 expression showed improved efficacy &ndash; patients on the Roche drug had a 53% reduced risk of death and a 44% increase in progression-free survival, while those with lower expressions of PD-L1 did not appear to benefit from RG7446. </p> <p> The abstract concluded that the biomarker could give clinicians a better understanding of which patients would respond to the immunotherapy vs standard of care. </p> <p> Investors should also keep an eye on the FIR study, a single-arm Phase II trial of RG7446 in NSCLC. The trial screened more than 1,000 patients, but only included 205 based on PD-L1 tumor status. Like POPLAR, the study showed that patients who expressed PD-L1 were more likely to respond to therapy. </p> <p> Roche will also present several other abstracts at the meeting in Chicago, including several Phase I studies for the drug. </p> <p> <b>ARCTIC</b> </p> <p> AstraZeneca's own PD-L1 inhibitor MEDI4736 showed strong efficacy in early stage studies, including a Phase Ib trial in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. The open-label dose-escalation study showed that of 31 patients who were on therapy for at least 18 weeks, 26% had a partial response, while 35% had stable disease. </p> <p> Clinicians will be focusing closely on safety for this combo; approximately 31% of 61 patients had severe adverse events, while 18% of patients had adverse events that led to discontinuation. The abstract noted that increasing doses of tremelimumab and constant doses of MEDI4736 resulted in a higher frequency of discontinuation. </p> <p> In another Phase I study testing MEDI4736 as a monotherapy in NSCLC, the drug was shown to be relatively safe with only 6% of 198 patients experiencing severe adverse events. Discontinuations occurred in 2% of patients. </p> <p> The British pharma is hoping to make MEDI4736 the cornerstone of its oncology division, with aspirations of using the drug in multiple combination therapies. AstraZeneca has estimated previously that the drug could have peak sales of $6.5bn annually once all combos are included. </p> <p> The company has more than 60 abstracts at ASCO this year, including six oral presentations. One of those presentations will be on the safety of the triple combination of MEDI4736 with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib.MEDI4736 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and AstraZeneca has recently entered into a collaboration with Celgene to study the drug in combination for multiple types of blood cancers. </p> <p> <b>CTL019</b> </p> <p> Novartis has been making waves with its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy &ndash; another corner of the hot immunotherapy space that has the oncology world buzzing. Clinicians are paying close attention to safety with these compounds due to risk of cytokine release syndrome, which can lead to fevers and inflammation and be extremely severe. Several smaller biotechs are also in the CAR-T space, but so far the big pharma is leading the charge. </p> <p> The company is presenting two studies that include its CAR-T therapy at the upcoming ASCO meeting. </p> <p> In a Phase IIa trial of CTL019 in 18 evaluable patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma at three months, the drug showed a 67% overall response rate. At median follow-up of six months, 59% of patients showed progression-free survival. </p> <p> In a Phase I trial of the drug in patients with multiple myeloma who have already undergone stem cell transplantation. The trial only included four subjects, one of which was not evaluable due to cytokine release syndrome. One of those patients experienced progression of disease at 43 days, while the other two continued responding to treatment after day 100. One of the responding patients was CD19 negative &ndash; the trial indicates that CAR-T therapies could be efficacious in these patients. </p> <p> <b>KEYNOTE-028</b> </p> <p> Merck is making an impressive showing at the meeting with its already-marketed immunotherapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab). There will be a wide array of presentations on the drug, including a Phase Ib trial of the drug as a monotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer who were PD-L1 positive. </p> <p> Patients were given the drug every two weeks for two years, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Twenty-six patients were enrolled. </p> <p> One patient in the trial achieved complete response, while two experienced tumor shrinkage and six patients achieved stable disease. </p> <p> &quot;Given these promising monotherapy data and results from checkpoint inhibitors in non-melanoma indications to date, we believe that future studies of pembrolizumab in gynecological cancers will involve combinations with chemotherapy or other agents. Patients with advanced gynecological cancers currently have poor outcomes, so we believe the bar for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody approval in these indications will be relatively low,&quot; noted BioMedTracker analysts. </p> <p> <p> See more highlights from the ASCO abstracts <a target="_new" href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Good-Bad-Ugly-the-ASCO-abstracts-are-out-358413">here</a>. </p> <p><p><p>
