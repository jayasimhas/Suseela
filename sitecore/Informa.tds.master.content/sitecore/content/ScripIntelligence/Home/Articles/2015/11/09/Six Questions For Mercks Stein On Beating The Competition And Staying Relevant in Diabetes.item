<p>During the European Association for the Study of Diabetes meeting in Stockholm this week, the severity of the current disease crisis was impressed upon delegates at every turn. Few presentations failed to include dire warnings of the increasing diabetes epidemic, followed by reminders that over half of those diagnosed with the disease are inadequately treated on current therapies.</p><p>Fortunately then, diabetes is one of the most active and competitive areas of drug development, with a number of top pharma companies vying to produce the next blockbuster for treatment of the disease and its accompanying ailments. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> caught up with Dr. Peter Stein, vice-president of late stage development for diabetes and endocrinology at Merck &Co.'s Research Laboratories, in Stockholm, to discuss latest developments for the big pharma in diabetes , how it hopes to stand out in the growing crowd, and what are the challenge of bringing diabetes therapies into emerging regions. </p><p><b>Scrip: What does Merck consider to be the biggest challenges currently in diabetes? And how is the company meeting them?</b></p><p><b>Peter Stein:</b> There are a lot of challenges in diabetes but progress in the management of the disease has come a long way in the last 20 years. When I started my fellowship, there were just two classes of agents in the US and now we have many classes and there has certainly been lots of advances. That said, we still have a need for agents that can really provide control, drugs that can be added to other agents, or be combined with other products.</p><p>We know that many patients do not achieve diabetes control and around half of patients are not at glycemic goals. The current tools are not optimal; we need to be able to get more patients at the right level of glycemic control. We know patients are continuing to suffer the accompanying effects of diabetes, retinopathy, neuropathy etc., so there is still a need for treatments directed at the complications and therapies that prevent them. Then we also see large numbers of patients dying from the macro vascular complications associated with disease, such as heart attack and stroke. There is a need for new therapies in this area as well.</p><p>The broad range of problems associated with diabetes is really the biggest challenge. </p><p>And this is me talking about type 2 diabetes, I haven't even touched on the many needs of type 1 patients. We really don't have fundamental therapies to treat type 1 diabetes at all to prevent patients going on to see loss of beta cells in the autoimmune process. And we need better insulins that can reduce the risks of hypoglycemia. At Merck we are of course working on medicines we think will benefit type 2 patients but we are also working on strategies for addressing the unmet needs of type 1 patients. </p><p><b>Scrip: How is Merck addressing increasing competition in diabetes, particularly in type 2 disease?</b></p><p><b>PS:</b> What has helped to get us to where we are now is that a lot of research has gone on both in the academic arenas, at the NIH and at other nationally funded organizations in Europe, and at pharmaceutical companies. But in terms of our strategy we have over the past decade developed a strong commitment to the disease, with a lot of investment, and people with great expertise in the biology of the disease. </p><p>Our approach has always been very much science driven. Where does the science lead us in terms of targets? What do we think the best areas are where we can intervene to help patients? Our method has been the same for quite a long time; we invest in research that leads us to developing the right drugs to benefit patients. Merck has such a strong tradition in that science and how it is the basis to successful drug development and we will stand by this tradition and continue to invest heavily in diabetes. </p><p>The evidence is there, we have a very rich pipeline: we have three different projects in Phase III; projects at Phase II; and a very broad range of discovery projects. We are very excited about the opportunities we have in diabetes.</p><p><b>Scrip: What are the company's goals in diabetes for the rest of this year and going into 2016?</b></p><p><b>PS:</b> We have a number of programs in the later stages of Phase III, for example omarigliptin [Merck's once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes], which we presented data for at EASD (on Sep. 16), we are looking to file this drug in the US in the second half of this year. We have an insulin glargine program for which we are also looking towards a filing for soon, also we have a Phase III program in collaboration with Pfizer and that is going very well and we hope to bring it towards a filing, not this year, but in the near future.</p><p><i>[In 2013, Merck and Pfizer Inc. partnered to develop the latter firm's experimental type 2 diabetes drug ertugliflozin, both as a stand-alone product and in combination with other drugs, including Merck's blockbuster Januvia (sitagliptin).]</i></p><p>We have a lot coming up this year and next to advance our pipeline. Of course we have earlier phase programs that we will continue to move forward in a reasonably quick fashion, but those are programs that always take time to develop. We are hoping to see advances across the whole spectrum of diabetes medicines we have. </p><p><b>Scrip: How important is diabetes as a therapy area to Merck? Will it remain a key area of focus?</b></p><p><b>PS:</b> Of course my personal bias is that it is number one. We all recognize that there are many areas with substantial unmet need. Merck has made great advances in oncology and other areas as well. The company is always focused on where the science drives us. That said, we have a strong belief that there are unmet needs still in diabetes and we have been working very hard trying to fill these treatment gaps and improve on diabetes therapy all round. Januvia is a great example of how we have advanced the treatment of type 2 diabetes; we hope omarigliptin can also contribute to that. Our current portfolio and investment in this disease area speaks for itself in regards to the importance of diabetes to Merck. </p><p><b>Scrip: How is Merck raising its diabetes portfolio's profile in emerging markets? What challenges do these markets present?</b></p><p><b>PS:</b> One of the things that is pretty clear is that diabetes, which was maybe 20 years ago really a disease of the US and other westernized regions, has seen a dramatic rise in many emerging economies, for example in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and China. If you look at the number of patients with diabetes in China, it is remarkable and very worrisome. Our approach has been to see if our medications can be useful for the treatment of diabetes worldwide. Januvia is a drug that can be useful to patients wherever they are. We are seeing patients use it all over the world. The best approach we can have is just to continue to bring innovative therapies to patients and given that the disease is emerging, we will see that we can help patients not just in the US or Europe but all over the globe. </p><p>In these emerging regions there are unique challenges. We have to work closely with healthcare agencies in those markets to help them understand the value of our medications; there are resource issues in some of these countries; and as with everywhere in the world there is an important need for physician education. There are a number of roles we have to play working with the various parties; these include academic organizations and patients organizations as well. As best we can we have to make sure agents that could be helpful to patients get to those patients. </p><p><b>Scrip: What do you predict will change or affect the diabetes space the most in the next 5-10 years?</b></p><p><b>PS:</b> There are new therapeutics coming along that are very exciting. Glucose-responsive insulin, that's a long way off, but it's an example of the kind of really innovative therapies that could make a huge difference to how patients with diabetes are managed.</p><p>We have seen the development of many new drug classes but over time we are going to further understand how to use these new drugs. The body of information that is emerging about the right targets, combinations, management, in the coming years we will help us better understand the disease. There are some very large comparative trials ongoing that will also help further this understanding. I'm not sure I could point to a single thing. There is so much activity in diabetes right now. Had you asked me that question 20 years ago I could have told you exactly what the big developments would be because there was not much going on. In the last 10 years or so though I couldn't pick just one thing that I would say changed the face of treatment, there have been many developments. The same can be predicted of the next ten years. We have so much research in such diverse areas of diabetes. </p><p>
