<p>Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, provided an undisclosed upfront payment and may invest more than $300m in milestone fees to use PROTAC, Arvinas Inc.'s targeted protein degradation technology, to create novel drugs against multiple disease targets. </p><p>Full financial terms of the agreement were not revealed, but New Haven, Connecticut-based Arvinas will earn tiered royalties on any drugs commercialized under the agreement. Genentech also may commit to additional fees and royalties to expand the collaboration to additional disease targets. Neither the diseases nor the specific targets subject to the companies' agreement were disclosed.</p><p>"Our PROTAC technology represents a completely novel approach to the targeted therapy of cancer and many other diseases, and we are delighted to be working with Genentech on their targets of interest," Arvinas president and CEO Manuel Litchman, a Novartis veteran who took the company's top <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Arvinas-appoints-new-president-CEO-356158" target="_new">leadership spots in January</a>, said in a statement.</p><p>Traditional therapies that inhibit proteins work on only about a quarter of the proteins in the body, but Arvinas claims that its PROTAC technology can expand the number of proteins that can be targeted for drug development. </p><p>The company's proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are bi-functional small molecules that target proteins for degradation and removal from a cell. PROTACs are designed to induce the cell's own protein degradation machinery to bind to the targeted protein and label it for removal from the cell.</p><p>Genentech senior vice president and global head of partnering James Sabry noted the potential of PROTAC and said in the Arvinas announcement of the companies' collaboration that "Genentech is very interested in protein degradation as a therapeutic approach to address difficult disease targets." </p><p>Genentech is the second company to make its interest in the PROTAC technology publicly known after Merck & Co. paid Arvinas an undisclosed upfront fee and agreed to provide up to $434m in research funding and milestone payments in April. Similarly, Merck's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Arvinas-gains-Merck-as-first-partner-for-protein-tech-357696" target="_new">disease targets were not disclosed</a>, but the big pharma can add targets to the agreement for additional fees. </p><p>Arvinas is a young company that raised $15m in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Arvinas-raises-19.25m-for-novel-protein-degradation-approach-346874" target="_new">Series A venture capital</a> and $4.25m from the state of Connecticut in 2013 after its technology platform was spun out of Yale University, where PROTACs were shown in animal models to degrade proteins associated with cancer, inflammation, autoimmune and rare diseases.</p><p>Genentech's Sabry told <i>Scrip</i> last year that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Reporters-notebook-Sound-bites-from-BIO-2014-352503" target="_new">the company is negotiating</a> a lot of specific development partnerships and platform technology-based collaborations, and he noted that there are a lot of good biotech ideas to consider right now, because of the recent rise in stock market and venture capital investment in the industry.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
