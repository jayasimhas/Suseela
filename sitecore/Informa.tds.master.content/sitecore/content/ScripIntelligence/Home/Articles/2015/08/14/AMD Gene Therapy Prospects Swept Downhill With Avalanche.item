<p>Avalanche Biotechnologies was true to its name on Aug. 14, opening down 16% on the previous day's close at $11.64 and continuing to slide to as low as $9.36 by mid-afternoon trading. As the company revealed that it would not be progressing into Phase IIb with its lead candidate, any lingering hopes of a gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration reaching the market any time soon were soundly dashed.</p><p>Avalanche's steep descent has come after a vertiginous climb since it launched an IPO at $17 per share a little over a year ago. Its stock closed at $27.99 on the first day of trading, continuing to rise over the rest of 2014. However, since peaking at more than $60 in January 2015, the share price has succumbed to two major landslides. </p><p>The most recent came in June after the firm announced "positive" top-line data for its lead product, the investigational gene therapy AVA-101 for wet age-related macular degeneration. Avalanche's CEO and co-founder Thomas Chalberg said at that time that the company would begin a Phase IIb study later in 2015. </p><p>However, as <i>Scrip</i>'s Stockwatch columnist Andy Smith <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Avalanche-warning-359058" target="_new">highlighted at the time</a>, the Phase IIa study, despite the company's positive spin, gave cause for concern over the reliability of its results. </p><p>The following month, Chalberg resigned suddenly, and now the company says it will not launch that Phase IIb study. Instead it will go back to do more preclinical work to refine the dosing and delivery of AVA-101 and another candidate, AVA-201, which delivers the same sFLT-1 expressing gene as AVA-101 but using a next-generation AAV vector delivery method. </p><p>In an Aug. 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said: "Overall we did not observe evidence of a complete and/or durable anti-VEGF response in the majority of subjects treated with AVA-101 as administered in the Phase IIa study." It said it would continue to analyze the trial results to understand this further. </p><p>In the meantime the "more detailed analyses" of the trial data Avalanche has done since its June announcement "gave us more information about some of the factors, including dosing and administration variability, that may have contributed to the Phase IIa study results," said interim CEO Hans Hull, in an apparent admission that the study results from the Phase IIa trial were less than reliable. In a statement lodged with the SEC, Avalanche provides details that could explain the surprisingly good visual acuity outcomes for patients treated with AVA-101 in comparison with the control, <i>Lucentis</i> (ranibizumab): three patients who had marked visual acuity loss in the control group and unusual complications that could have skewed the statistics given the small sample group. </p><p>Last year, Avalanche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Avalanche-eyes-640m-windfall-in-Regeneron-deal-351616" target="_new">partnered with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc</a>. in a deal for which it has to date booked $8m out of a touted $640m in upfront and milestone payments. It appears unlikely that Regeneron will take up its exclusive, time-limited option to negotiate rights to AVA-101 following the Phase IIa trial. </p><p>Regeneron and partner Bayer AG sell <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept), which dominates the anti-VEGF market for wet AMD alongside Roche Holding AG/Novartis AG's Lucentis, with controversial off-label use of Roche's anticancer <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab), similar to Lucentis, providing further competitive pressure. </p><p>Lucentis and Eylea booked 2014 sales of $4.3bn and $3.0bn, respectively, across their ophthalmic indications. The therapies, while representing a breakthrough for the disease since their launches in 2006 and 2011, respectively, involve repeated injections into the eye. Gene therapies, on the other hand &ndash; if they work &ndash; could allow for far less frequent, or even one-time-only injections. </p><p>Avalanche's return to preclinical studies removes the front-runner, though. It leaves Oxford BioMedica, with its Phase I RetinoStat, as the leader in gene therapy for wet AMD. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-lacks-megadeal-motivation-alongside-lackluster-Q1-351511" target="_new">Sanofi declined to exercise a license option</a> on that product in 2014.</p>
