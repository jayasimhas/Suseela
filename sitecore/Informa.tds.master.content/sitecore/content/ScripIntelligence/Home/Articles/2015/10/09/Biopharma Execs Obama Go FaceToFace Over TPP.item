<p>President Barack Obama heard firsthand from a half dozen or so biopharmaceutical executives during an Oct. 8 White House face-to-face meeting about the industry's disappointment in the administration for agreeing to a minimum of five years of exclusivity protection for innovator biologics against biosimilars in the final Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal rather than the 12 years required in the US by law.</p><p>Mark Grayson, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), told <i>Scrip </i>that during the meeting, the biopharma executives emphasized to Obama the role "strong" intellectual property protection plays in the discovery and development of new treatments and therapies, and that by "failing to secure" 12 years of data protection for biologics, the next wave of innovation would be compromised and the development of new critically-needed medicines would be disrupted.</p><p>Interestingly, neither PhRMA president and CEO John Castellani nor Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) president and CEO Jim Greenwood were among the biopharmaceutical industry leaders at the White House, the trade groups confirmed to <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>AdvaMed CEO Stephen Ubl, who will be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Odds-On-Favorite-Ubl-Confirmed-As-Next-PhRMA-CEO-360696" target="_new">taking the reins</a> as the next PhRMA chief when <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Castellani-to-depart-PhRMA-group-elects-Mercks-Frazier-chairman-357923" target="_new">Castellani departs</a> at the end of the year, also was not at the meeting, Grayson said. </p><p>Merck & Co. Inc. chief Kenneth Frazier, the new chairman at PhRMA, however, was in attendance. </p><p>Neither PhRMA nor BIO were happy with the TPP deal, whose negotiations among the 12 participating nations &ndash; Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam &ndash; were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">finalized on Oct. 5</a>.</p><p>Obama, along with the leaders of the other 11 countries, must now sell the TPP package to their nations' citizens and lawmakers.</p><p>In the US, once the text of the TPP document is finalized, it is expected to be made available to the American public for 60 days before the House and Senate give it an up-or-down vote &ndash; the only option Congress has under the so-called <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-gets-his-fast-track-to-seal-trade-deals-359110" target="_new">trade promotion authority</a>, often referred to as fast-track, which does not permit lawmakers to filibuster or amend the trade agreement.</p><p>A White House official told <i>Scrip</i> Obama met with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry leaders on Oct. 8 as part of the president's effort to make his case about why the TPP would benefit American workers, businesses, strategic interests and the US economy as a whole. </p><p>But Obama may have a tough time getting all sides to buy into the TPP.</p><p>Even his own former secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is hoping to be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 White House bid, came out against the trade agreement &ndash; declaring during an Oct. 7 interview on <i>PBS NewsHour</i> she thinks there are "still a lot of unanswered questions" about the TPP.</p><p>"I am not in favor of what I have learned about it," Clinton said.</p><p>One thing she said she was particularly "worried" about in the TPP is that the "pharmaceutical companies may have gotten more benefits," while patients and consumers got "fewer."</p><p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Oct. 8 Obama was not upset about Clinton's departure from the TPP, even though she'd actually taken part in the early negotiations when she led the State Department.</p><p>"The president understands that presidential politics are tough, and he understands that it is the responsibility of individual candidates to distinguish themselves, to give voters a reason to vote for them and to support their vision. That means distinguishing themselves from their competitors, and in some cases, that means distinguishing themselves from the current occupant of the office. That's part of the business," Earnest said.</p><p>Some lawmakers who were on board earlier also have backed away from the TPP, including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), who declared on the Senate floor he was particularly concerned about what appeared to be a lack of protection for US intellectual property &ndash; pointing specifically to the provisions that govern data exclusivity for biologics. </p><p>US Trade Representative Michael Froman on Oct. 5 emphasized the five years agreed to in the TPP was the floor and that the participating nations' governments will have the ability to use certain "mechanisms" to boost that figure if they so choose.</p><p>"The agreement recognizes that we can travel on different roads but end up at the same outcome," Australian trade minister Andrew Robb told reporters on Oct. 5. "And we can travel with some common elements, and the minimum standard for data protection is common to all of us. But at the same time, the deal agrees or recognizes that the existing systems of different countries are able to reach the same outcome."</p><p>"It's a remarkable effort that all 12 of us feel we can go back and sell what is a truly transformational agreement," Robb said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
