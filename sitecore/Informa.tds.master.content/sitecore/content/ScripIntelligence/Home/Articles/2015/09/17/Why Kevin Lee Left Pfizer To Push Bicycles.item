<p>The pharma wires have been busy recently with news of droves of big pharma executives leaving their posts to take up the top spot at small biotech companies. The latest is Dr Kevin Lee, the former chief scientific officer of the Rare Disease Research Unit at Pfizer. Here he tells <i>Scrip's</i> Sukaina Virji what prompted him to leave the glamorous life of a big pharma executive and take up his new job as chief executive officer of tiny Cambridge, UK-based biotech Bicycle Therapeutics.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Pfizer to Bicycle Therapeutics is a major career move. Why did you make it?</b></p><p><b><i>Kevin Lee:</i></b> I joined Pfizer in early 2012, but prior to that I was with GSK where I led epigenetics research and was responsible for the creation of the EpiNova DPU. A part of that work got me very interested in rare disease, in particular rare cancers, and then Pfizer gave me the opportunity to set up and establish a company strategy in rare diseases, and work in the Boston area, so I went over and became the head of the rare disease unit. </p><p>Then Bicycle came along with a very compelling opportunity which encompasses a whole host of diseases. Right now we're working in oncology but the application is very broad and the technology is immensely powerful. It was an opportunity I couldn't walk away from. I have a real opportunity to shape this company on a platform that is well-validated and incredibly powerful.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> There has been lots of movement from big pharma to small biotech CEO roles recently. Why is that?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> Prior to my time at GSK, I worked in biotech. I set up Cambridge Biotechnology (acquired by Biovitrum) and Neurosolutions. So I had a good feel for the biotech environment and [moving back into biotech] was something that I was fully intending to do when the time was right and the right opportunity came along. I can't really comment on other people's motivations.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> What's the biggest change when you move from big pharma to small biotech?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> Speed. The ability of these guys to move projects forward is unbelievable. Completely different timescales. The ability of these guys to make decisions quickly and get experiments done quickly. It's very different.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> What value inflection points are coming up for Bicycle?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> The company has been working on a new paradigm, this Bicycle Drug Conjugate &ndash; BDC &ndash; approach which is similar to the antibody drug conjugates &ndash; ADCs &ndash; that have gone before them. The advantage of the BDCs [over ADCs] is they are so much smaller in size, 20-folder smaller, so they can penetrate tissues incredibly well. In terms of targeting solid tumors with cytotoxic agents, I think this is going to be the platform of choice moving forward. There another thing we can do with the Bicycles. Unlike antibodies, which hang around for a long time and people do use that to their advantage, in the case of Bicycles we can control their half-life and make them very short acting. That way we can get them into tumors quickly, deliver the cytotoxin and then have removed from the body very quickly. A kind of hit-and-run approach. In our preclinical models this certainly seems very successful. A lot of what we're going to be doing over the next few months is driving these molecules towards the clinic. We have one development candidate, and we're choosing a second by the end of the year. Then we have to go through preclinical development, and hopefully deliver these candidates into the clinic in the 12-18 month time period. </p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> What is the company's funding situation?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> The company was founded in 2009. There is a lot of technology that has been ruined by pushing it forward before it was ready for prime time. In the case of Bicycle, the investors were very clever in that they let the technology evolve over the last few years so it could be optimized properly without putting undue pressure on the platform. The platform is now fully optimized, and it's mind-blowing. That's what led to the first real funding round for the company last October, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bicycle-raises-20m-series-A-from-prime-investor-syndicate-354428" target="_new">$32m was raised</a> from Atlas Venture, Novartis Venture Fund, SR One, SV Life Sciences and Astellas Venture Management.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> How long will the money last?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> Right now it's slated to last two years, but we're going to push our candidates through aggressively so this could change. We're looking to accelerate rather than string out our money.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip:</i> What are Bicycle's therapeutic priorities?</b></p><p><b><i>KL:</i></b> Our focus right now is in oncology but the platform has such broad applicability that we will be exploring how best to maximize its potential through a range of academic and corporate partnerships. We have one collaboration ongoing which is going very well with Thrombogenics in diabetic macular edema. We hope in the next year or so that the compound will be moving towards the clinic. Watch this space as I expect we will be entering more of these collaborations. [The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Bicycle-Therapeutics-names-business-chief-358461" target="_new">hired a chief business officer</a>, Arvind Hundal from Zealand Pharma, in May this year.]</p><p><p>
