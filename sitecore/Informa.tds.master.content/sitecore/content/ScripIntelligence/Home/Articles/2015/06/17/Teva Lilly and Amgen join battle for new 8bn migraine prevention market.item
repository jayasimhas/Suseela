<p>New biologicals targeting the CGRP pathway could prove to be the biggest thing to hit the migraine market since the triptans in the 1990s, mid-stage data presented at the recent American Headache Society meeting in Washington suggest. </p><p>The Washington DC meeting heard new Phase IIb data from two products from Teva and Lilly, TEV-48125 and LY2951742, together with open-label extension data from a Phase IIb study of the current leader, Amgen's AMG-334, in preventing episodic migraine that has experts excited. Meanwhile, a fourth competitor, Alder Therapeutics, has similar product ALD-403 also in Phase IIb development.</p><p>Analysts expect that, if ultimately successful, the new products will catalyse growth in the migraine segment, which has only been a little enlivened since the genericization of the triptans by the arrival of Allergan's Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA). While triptans remain the mainstay for acute treatment of migraine, apart from Botox, the current prophylaxis market is dominated by older beta-blocker products and newer anticonvulsants, for which side-effects are often a concern.</p><p>Indeed, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat believes this new drug class could become very lucrative &ndash; estimating it to reach $8-10bn. He points out that Botox brings in about $300m sales in migraine prophylaxis at a cost of about $2,500/year despite its marginal efficacy in this indication, whereas the CGRPs should probably command an annual price of about $10-12,000. It is thought there are between 7.3 million to 14 million candidates for migraine prophylaxis in the US, accounting for around a third of all migraine patients. </p><p><b>CGRP</b></p><p>All four of the new wave of products are monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor (see table), which are additionally being developed for related headache indications including chronic migraine, and chronic and episodic cluster headache. Episodic migraine is divided into low frequency (<10 months="" of="" pain="" a="" month)="" or="" high="" frequency="" (10-14="" days="" pain="" a="" month),="" while="" chronic="" migraine="" is="" defined="" as="" 15="" or="" more="" days'="" migraine="" pain="" a="" month.=""></10></p><p>CGRP is a potent neuropeptide thought to play a prominent role in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine and, by blocking CGRP, the products are thought to inhibit the transmission of the pain signals that lead to migraine headaches.</p><p>CGRP has been targeted before in migraine&ndash; most notably by Merck & Co with its failed telcagepant, which was dropped at the Phase III stage in 2011 because of liver toxicity problems. Other earlier oral candidates from Merck & Co, Boehringer Ingelheim and Bristol-Myers Squibb also stalled. But these differed in that they were small-molecule oral antagonists designed for treatment of acute symptoms, not prevention; it is hoped that the newer MAbs may circumvent the safety issues, while capitalizing on the therapeutic benefit of the anti-CGRP strategy. </p><table><h2>The anti-CGRP Products Compared</h2><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Target</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Type of MAb</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Dosing</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Phase III plans</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AMG-334</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CGRP receptor</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>fully human</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>subcutaneous</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>STRIVE trial due to being in July in episodic, PhIIb in chronic</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>LY2951742</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CGRP</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>humanized</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>subcutaneous</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PhIII due by Q1 2016 in episodic and chronic</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>TEV-48125</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CGRP</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>humanized</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>subcutaneous</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PhIII planned in episodic and chronic but no timeline</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ALD403</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CGRP</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>humanized</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>intravenous (sc formulation in earlier development)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2H start in chronic and episodic </p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p>Overall, the results so far suggest that Teva's offering may have the edge on efficacy based on the primary endpoint data, but the safety data for all are looking positive. "Amgen's 12-month data suggests that these drugs are very safe &#8230; and this has calmed down fears of an unexpected safety signal showing up in Phase III," said Mr Raffat. There is also early evidence that some patients may be hyper-responders to the therapies, he adds, and even that non-hyper responders may become so upon further therapy, which would bode well for the continuous dosing in the class. </p><h2>TEVA data</h2><p>In Teva's study, 297 US patients who had an average of 11.4 monthly migraine days and 12.5 headache days per month were randomized to receive TEV-48125 dosed at 225mg or 675mg, or placebo, once monthly. Patients were permitted to continue using other preventive migraine medications if in stable doses. </p><p>Both doses of TEV-48125 met the primary endpoint defined as decrease in monthly migraine days at month three relative to baseline compared with placebo. The reductions were &ndash;3.46 for placebo, &ndash;6.27 for the lower 225mg dose (p < 0.0001)="" and="" &ndash;6.09="" for="" the="" higher="" 675mg="" dose="" (p="">< 0.0001).=""></p><p>The secondary endpoint, defined as decrease monthly headache days relative to baseline, was also met: the 225mg dose with p<0.001 and="" 675mg="" with=""></0.001><0.001.></0.001.></p><p>Further analyses showed that the drug's benefits were swift. Both doses showed a significant separation from placebo in the first month after a single administration of the drug. Also the benefits were more pronounced in patients who did not take any other preventative treatments during the study. </p><p>The data "enhance a growing body of evidence that support advancing the development of TEV-48125 to Phase III", said Teva's president of global R&D and chief scientific officer, Michael Hayden.</p><h2>Lilly's study</h2><p>Lilly's LY2951742 also met the primary endpoint in its Phase IIb study in more than 400 patients with episodic migraine (between four and 14 migraine headache days per month). </p><p>The study evaluated four different doses of LY2951742 (5mg, 50mg, 120mg and 300mg) given in a once-monthly, subcutaneous injection with a primary endpoint to assess whether at least one dose of LY2951742 was better than placebo in the prevention of migraine headache. </p><p>Overall, LY2951742 produced a significant reduction in migraine headache days and a safety and tolerability profile at month three, confirming the previous results seen in a Phase 2a study. The most common adverse events were injection site pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, dysmenorrhea and nausea</p><p>The data suggest that the 120mg dose should be taken forward into Phase III &ndash; trials in both episodic and chronic migraine are now planned and should begin no later than the first quarter of 2016. </p><p>Lilly has already begun two Phase III trials with LY2951742 in cluster headache, for which indication it has been granted Fast Track Designation from the FDA. </p><h2>Amgen data </h2><p>Meanwhile, Amgen released positive interim results from its open-label extension of its international Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of AMG 334 for the prevention of episodic migraine. It announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Life-left-in-CGRP-inhibition-as-Amgens-migraine-offering-heads-to-Phase-III-358444" target="_new">the primary endpoint data</a> earlier this year, when it announced that it would be taking the drug into Phase III later this year. </p><p>The 383 patients (out of 483) who entered the open-label phase received AMG 334 70mg monthly and experienced a sustained reduction in monthly migraine days at week 52: an average of a -4.9-day reduction from a baseline of 8.7 mean monthly migraine days, regardless of treatment received during the blinded phase. The 50% responder rate (>50% reduction in monthly migraine days) was 62% at 52 weeks. Additional responder rates were as follows: at 52 weeks the 75% responder rate was 38% and the 100% responder rate was 19%. </p><p>Safety and tolerability remained similar to the blinded phase of the study. The most commonly reported adverse events included fatigue, influenza, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia and back pain, with no Grade 4 or 5 adverse events. Less than 5% of patients discontinued the study during the open-label phase due to adverse events.</p><h2>Alder Therapeutics</h2><p>Separately, the fourth competitor Alder Therapeutics presented at the International Headache Society meeting in May six-month follow-up data for its proof-of-concept study for ALD403 in 163 patients with frequent episodic migraine who had on average nine headache days per month. </p><p>Patients were given a single intravenous dose of 1000mg of ALD403 or placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean change in migraine headache days from baseline to weeks 5-8, and patients were followed for 24 weeks for additional safety and efficacy analyses.</p><p>The updated results showed that a single intravenous dose produced efficacy over six months for the preventive treatment of migraine.</p><p>Over three months, the proportion of patients with a 50%, 75%, and 100% reduction in migraine days for ALD403 and placebo was 61% vs 33% (p < 0.001);="" 33%="" vs="" 9%="" (p=""><0.001); and="" 16%="" vs="" 0%="" (p=""></0.001);>< 0.001),=""></p><p>And after six months, the proportion of patients with a 50%, 75%, and 100% reduction in migraine days for ALD403 and placebo was 53% vs 28% (p < 0.001);="" 26%="" vs="" 7%="" (p=""><0.002); and="" 11%="" vs="" 0%="" (p=""></0.002);><0.002),></0.002),></p><p>ALD403 was well tolerated and there were no differences from placebo in terms of adverse events or laboratory safety data, Alder said.</p><p>Alder plans to begin a pivotal trial in chronic and frequent episodic migraine using the iv formulation, and a Phase IIb in frequent episodic migraine using a self-administered formulation in the second half of this year. It also expects to report top-line Phase II data for the product in chronic migraine. </p><p><p>
