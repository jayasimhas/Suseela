<p>During his annual State of the Union (SOTU) address, President Barack Obama said he was launching a new "precision medicine" initiative with the goal of better tailoring therapies to a person's unique characteristics &ndash; their genetic makeup.</p><p>The president himself provided no details about the initiative or how it will be funded.</p><p>The National Institutes of Health was mum on the matter, other than a few tweets by the agency's chief, Dr Francis Collins, and directed all questions to the White House, which provided some insight on 20 January, although not much &ndash; only disclosing the president's proposal would invest in precision medicine. But it did not reveal a total dollar amount that will be sought or where Mr Obama plans to pull the money from to back the program. </p><p>"The president's proposal will engage patients and healthcare providers in delivering this new era of medicine," the White House said. "Recent advances in genomics and digital data have produced powerful new discoveries about health and disease that have made it possible to design highly effective, targeted treatments for cancer and other diseases."</p><p>"Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development," Mr Obama said during his address before a joint session of the House and Senate. "I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine &ndash; one that delivers the right treatment at the right time."</p><p>He pointed to cystic fibrosis as one disease "once thought unstoppable" where precision medicine has already had some big breakthroughs.</p><p>In a blog posted on the White House website on 20 January, the administration highlighted how CF patient Bill Elder's life has been prolonged thanks to an "innovative" medication that targets the underlying cause of the disease for a small subset of patients.</p><p>The White House was referring to Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Kalydeco (ivacaftor), noting the drug used to treat Mr Elder, who sat with First Lady Michelle Obama during the SOTU, was developed under a collaboration with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.</p><p>Kalydeco initially was approved in the US in January 2012 for CF patients 6 years or older with at least one copy of the G551D mutation (scripintelligence, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">1 February 2012</a>).</p><p>The drug, whose labeling has since been expanded for use in patients with other mutations, was the first medicine given the FDA's blessing to treat the underlying cause of CF, a rare, life-threatening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, which causes poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kalydeco-expanded-in-CF-patients-with-R117H-mutation-355875" target="_new">30 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-broader-use-of-Kalydeco-in-CF-350192" target="_new">23 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The disease causes a buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, which can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage.</p><p>Mr Elder has battled CF since he was eight years old, the White House said, noting he is now a medical student in Ohio.</p><p>"His story is a testament to the promise of precision medicine, an emerging approach to treatment that takes into account patients' individual characteristics, and a kind of research the president hopes to expand," said Tanya Somanader, deputy director of digital content for the White House Office of Digital Strategy. </p><p>Stories like Mr Elder's shows that "science can deliver breakthroughs for patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases," declared Mary Woolley, president and CEO of the advocacy group Research!America, whose members include the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization. "The remarkable ability of our nation's researchers to advance precision medicine to hone targeted treatments to improve individual patient outcomes is another compelling example of what can be achieved through public-private partnerships."</p><p>But she insisted current funding levels for federal health agencies has put researchers "at an extreme disadvantage in pursuing studies that have the potential to cure disease and improve quality of life, and tax policies have stymied the development of new drugs." </p><p>None of the members of Congress gathered at the Capitol's National Statuary Hall after the SOTU who were asked by <i>Scrip</i> about the precision medicine initiative had seen details of the proposal.</p><p>"It's all platitudes," insisted Representative Tim Murphy (Republican-Pennsylvania). </p><p>But other members of Congress have shown interest in pursuing precision medicine, also known as personalized medicine.</p><p>Indeed, the chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan) convened an entire hearing around the topic this past July as part of his 21st Century Cures Initiative, which is intended to find new ways to accelerate the nation's discovery, development and delivery processes for new medicines (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/From-science-to-bedside-Personalized-mediciines-challenge-353006" target="_new">24 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Scrip-100-Lawmakers-seek-RandD-enterprise-overhaul-for-faster-cures-353964" target="_new">16 September 2014</a>).</p><p>After President Obama's SOTU address, Mr Upton, who partnered with Representative Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) on the 21st Century Cures Initiative, urged lawmakers &ndash; Republicans and Democrats together &ndash; to "get the job done" on tackling issues like life-saving cures and innovation, among other things. </p><p>The White House said President Obama also is proposing to nearly double the federal investment in antibiotic discovery to address the global threat of infectious disease created by rampant spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. </p><p>In addition, in his upcoming fiscal year 2016 budget request, the White House said the president plans to ask lawmakers to continue to invest in Alzheimer's research and the multi-agency BRAIN Initiative &ndash; a collaborative project unveiled in April 2013 between the US government and the private and academic sectors aimed at shedding light on the complex links between brain function and behavior (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">1 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">17 September 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">4 April 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BAM-Obama-aims-for-job-creation-economic-growth-with-brain-initiative-341691" target="_new">2 April 2013</a>).</p><p><p><p>
