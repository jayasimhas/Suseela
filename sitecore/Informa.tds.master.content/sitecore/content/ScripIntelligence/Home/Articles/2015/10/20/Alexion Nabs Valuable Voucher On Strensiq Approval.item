<p>Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. not only gained the FDA's approval on Oct. 23 for Strensiq (asfotase alfa) as a treatment for patients with perinatal-, infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia (HPP), but the win also garnered the company a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV), potentially putting hundreds of millions of dollars in the firm's pocket.</p><p>Shares of Alexion rose $5.24 on Oct. 23, or 3.1%, before closing at $171.16, up $4.40, or 2.6%.</p><p>Holders of the PRVs, which are awarded by the FDA on the approval of designated applications for medicines aimed at treating rare pediatric or neglected tropical diseases, can use them on a subsequent application that otherwise would not have qualified for a priority review or the companies can sell them.</p><p>PRVs are valuable because the bearers can shave off at least four months of the time it takes the FDA to examine a marketing application, which means a product can get to the US market much faster, banking cash for the drug maker.</p><p>United Therapeutics Corp. nabbed the highest amount so far in selling a voucher &ndash; bringing in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVieUnited-Therapeutics-350m-Voucher-Deal-Smart-Move-360034" target="_new">whopping $350m</a> for its rare pediatric disease PRV under a deal in August with AbbVie Inc.</p><p>Before that, Retrophin Inc. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-paying-big-for-FDA-voucher-Retrophin-snags-245m-358627" target="_new">hauled in $245m</a> for its rare pediatric disease PRV, which it actually <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Voucher-FDA-approval-lure-Retrophin-to-buy-Cholbam-357371" target="_new">acquired</a> just two months earlier when it exercised its rights to purchase the newly approved Cholbam (cholic acid) from Asklepion Pharmaceuticals for $27m, plus 661,278 shares of the former firm's common stock.</p><p>Sanofi SA bought Retrophin's voucher.</p><p>Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">paid $67.5m</a> in July 2014 for BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s voucher &ndash; using it to gain a swifter approval of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab), which was the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitor cleared for the US market, coming in more than a month ahead of Amgen's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">Repatha</a> evolocumab. </p><p>Gilead Sciences Inc. in November 2014 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-pays-unprecedented-125m-for-Knight-priority-voucher-355151" target="_new">paid $125m</a> for Knight Therapeutics Inc.'s tropical disease PRV, which the latter firm gained when the FDA approved the company's leishmaniasis drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Impavido-in-leishmaniasis-Knight-wins-priority-voucher-350770" target="_new">Impavido</a> (miltefosine).</p><p>Privately held Wellstat Therapeutics Corp. won a rare pediatric disease PRV in September when it gained approval of its hereditary orotic aciduria treatment <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/AstraZeneca-Scores-Voucher-On-Wellstats-Xuriden-Approval-360306" target="_new">Xuriden</a> (uridine triacetate). But Wellstat had already sold that voucher to London-based AstraZeneca plc in September 2014 for an undisclosed amount &ndash; so it's not known publicly whether Gaithersburg, MD-based company made out alright on the deal or is now kicking itself for acting too quickly on the PRV.</p><p>The FDA has awarded two other PRVs &ndash; one to Novartis AG in April 2009 on the approval of its malaria product Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine), and the other to Johnson & Johnson Inc. subsidiary Janssen Biotech Inc., which it gained in December 2012 on the approval of its tuberculosis drug Sirturo (bedaquiline).</p><p>J&J's Janssen has yet to use or sell its voucher.</p><p>While Novartis actually was the first to snag a PRV, it was all for naught, since it essentially went to waste when the company failed to gain a quicker approval for a broader use of Ilaris (canakinumab) &ndash; a lesson AbbVie may want to keep in mind when picking which drug it wants to use its voucher.</p><p><b>Strensiq Approval </b></p><p>Strensiq, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is the first therapy approved in the US to treat HPP, a genetic, chronic and progressive ultra-rare metabolic disease, in which patients experience devastating effects on multiple systems of the body, leading to debilitating or life-threatening complications.</p><p>Without treatment, many newborns and infants with HPP fail to develop a normal rib cage and die from respiratory failure, and young children with HPP can suffer from rickets and muscle weakness, said Michael Whyte, medical scientific director of the Center for Metabolic Bone Disease and Molecular Research at Shriners Hospital for Children in St. Louis, and the lead investigator for the Strensiq trials.</p><p>He noted that in clinical studies, 97% of severely affected newborns or infants were alive at one year after Strensiq treatment, versus 42% of historical control patients.</p><p>Whyte also said that treatment with Strensiq up to seven years also often markedly improved overall health. </p><p>He said significant corrections of the skeletal complications were documented in young children with HPP treated for five years with Strensiq, and all had better mobility and function, with most achieving the normal range for healthy peers.</p><p>"I am more than gratified by this progress," Whyte declared. </p><p>The FDA examined Alexion's biologics license application (BLA) for Strensiq under a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-grants-priority-review-to-Alexions-ERT-asfotase-alfa-357030" target="_new">priority review</a>, granted this past March.</p><p>The ERT is designed to address the underlying cause of HPP by aiming to restore the genetically defective metabolic process, thereby preventing or reversing the severe and potentially life-threatening complications of life-long dysregulated mineral metabolism, according to Alexion.</p><p>The BLA was supported by data from 71 treated patients with HPP enrolled in three prospective studies and their extensions, as well as two retrospective natural history studies.</p><p>In May 2013, the FDA designated Strensiq a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Unsurprising-FDA-breakthrough-designation-for-Alexions-hypophosphatasia-drug-343564" target="_new">breakthrough therapy</a> &ndash; a status aimed at expediting the regulatory process of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
