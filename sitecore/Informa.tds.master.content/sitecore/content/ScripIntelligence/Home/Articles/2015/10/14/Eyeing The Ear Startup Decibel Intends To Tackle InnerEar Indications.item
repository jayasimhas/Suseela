<p>Hearing indications represent a very underserved space for drug therapies, and even the companies that do participate often do so with just a single, isolated program or candidate. Third Rock Ventures thinks it will be able to build the "definitive" inner ear specialist, through internal R&D as well as licensing, with start-up Decibel Therapeutics, which announced a $52m Series A financing on Oct. 15.</p><p>In an interview, interim CEO Kevin Starr, a partner at Third Rock, noted that patients with hearing loss have very limited options for care &ndash; basically just hearing aids and cochlear implants. Based upon the research of four scientific co-founders and nearly three years of preclinical development in stealth mode, Decibel hits the ground running with three preclinical candidates it expects to enter the clinic in the next few years.</p><p>The key to success will be developing and acting upon a deeper understanding of the workings of the inner ear and how to deliver drugs to that area, Starr explained. At present, Boston-based Decibel is not providing specifics on the types or classes of drugs it is working on, other than revealing that at least its initial candidates will be transtympanic injections, which are administered at a key site behind the outer ear.</p><p>"Our goal is to come in at a very large industrial scale and really create a platform for multiple therapeutics to address this space, which affects literally hundreds of millions of people across the world today," he said. "There are a handful of companies doing things in hearing, but they've generally been one-off product approaches and our view is that's actually not going to be good enough in this space. It's a tremendously complicated set of circuits that exist in the inner ear and it requires a substantial investment in research and development to actually understand the dynamics and the pharmacology of what is happening inside the inner ear. Nobody really has invested in this space to date, so we view this as a pioneering approach at the scale that we're going after."</p><p>Hearing aids address the need for amplification, a problem of the outer ear, while cochlear implants do provide a therapeutic benefit for some patients with inner ear issues, but Decibel hopes to make inner ear therapy more available across indications and the general population. One of its goals is to develop drug therapies that will augment the effectiveness of cochlear implants and also allow implants to be smaller and more broadly applicable.</p><p>Of its three near-term programs, the closest to the clinic is one that would address ototoxicity &ndash; the hearing loss that can result when children receive aminoglycoside therapy for cystic fibrosis or platinum therapy for cancer. Starr said Decibel anticipates that it may be able to partner this program with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.</p><p>"We believe we have preclinical therapeutics that we can advance into the clinic that could protect the inner ear from the ravages of those particular treatments and allow those kids, once they get cured or treated for their disease, to go on without the hearing deficit," he said.</p><p>The second program focuses on noise-induced hearing loss, which can result from military service, heavy industrial work or proximity to a bomb blast. "Profound noise effect causes synaptic regression in the ear," Starr explained. "We believe we can restore those synapses to complete the circuit and restore functional hearing. We've actually demonstrated that preclinically."</p><p>In the third program for combination therapy with cochlear implants, the exec said Decibel already has conducted initial conversations with device makers about partnering.</p><p>"Implants are very inefficient because those who are deaf are missing a lot of the apparatus to process signals with high fidelity," he said. They're missing hair cells, synapses and neurons &#8230;. Our approach is to increase neurons, and if we do that the fidelity that will be received from those signals will change dramatically and therefore the size of the implants can be reduced dramatically and the application of those for populations that are just missing high-frequency sound, not full sound, could be miniaturized [to] where they could be available to broad populations."</p><p>Those programs are central to Decibel's strategy for its first three years, which the $52m is intended to finance through certain value inflection points. GlaxoSmithKline PLC's venture arm SR One participated in the round, but that activity does not confer any downstream rights or options for Decibel technology. "SR One has a minority stake in the round, which came about due to a lot of synergy, where they were doing some work in the hearing space along with us and rather than try to fragment the space, we said 'let's get together and do this,'" Starr noted.</p><h2>Longer-Terms Goals Include Tinnitus, Presbycusis</h2><p>Decibel's longer-term drug-development goals are to address tinnitus, presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) and restorative processes to regenerate the hair cells and synapses that drive inner-ear function. The expectation is that those programs may come to fruition during the company's fourth through sixth years, Starr said.</p><p>The initial programs all stem from research done by the company's scientific co-founders and by Third Rock's own researchers, but partnering and in-licensing may play a significant role in Decibel's future. Starr envisions a situation in which Decibel establishes itself as the partner of choice for hearing-loss programs due to breadth of knowledge and capabilities.</p><p>"Our approach at Decibel is to create the definitive company," he said, "so we're setting up significant lab operations with a new understanding of what happens in the cochlea, how you get drugs there, how you distribute drugs there, the pharmacokinetics of the drugs once they're in in the inner ear. Nobody's really done that at a large scale. Once we put that platform in place, which I think will take us about 10-15 months, our ability will be very unique in the industry to optimize drugs for delivery into the inner ear for therapeutic approaches."</p><p>"Many of the companies that right now are moving single products forward don't actually understand the PK inside the inner ear, so they're not optimized, they don't have dose-response curves et cetera," he continued. "We will be the logical place for many partners to come and either join forces with us or in-license. We'll become the company that really knows how to translate these early signals or therapeutic approaches into optimized translational drugs into the ear that ultimately will make a big difference for patients."</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet" target="_new">The Pink Sheet</a> Daily. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p>
