<p>After a few decades of searching for viable means for delivering gene therapy, Biogen Idec's Olivier Danos said the field finally is at a point where experimental treatments can be delivered on a commercial scale.</p><p>Biogen announced in late September that it selected Dr Danos to serve as senior vice president of gene therapy to lead the company's investments in the increasingly popular area. He's in charge of piecing together the technology the company needs to develop its own therapies and he told <i>Scrip</i> that Biogen will announce more deals in the space very soon.</p><p>Dr Danos has many years of academic and industry experience with gene therapy. Among his commercial roles, Dr Danos was senior vice president of molecular medicine, synthetic biology and gene regulation at Kadmon Pharmaceuticals prior to joining Biogen. Before that he was director of the Gene Therapy Consortium of the University College of London and led a gene therapy research team at Necker Hospital in Paris. He is the former president and was a founding member of the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy. </p><p><b>Biogen invests in early programs</b></p><p>Biogen recently announced a partnership with San Rafael Hospital and the Telethon Foundation in Italy to work with the Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET) on gene therapies for hemophilia A and B, but the collaboration was in the works before Dr Danos joined the company (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tecfidera-pushes-Biogen-revenue-40-higher-in-2014-356453" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>). </p><p>A year earlier, Biogen entered into a partnership with Sangamo BioSciences to develop treatments for inherited blood disorders known as hemoglobinopathies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-SangamoBiogen-AdamasForest-ZymeworksLilly-Sunesis-349218" target="_new">10 January 2014</a>).</p><p>But while hemophilia is one of Biogen's areas of expertise &ndash; the US FDA approved the company's Alprolix [coagulation factor IX (recombinant) Fc fusion protein] for hemophilia B and Eloctate [antihemophilic factor (recombinant) Fc fusion protein] for hemophilia A in 2014 &ndash; Dr Danos said there are a lot of opportunities for gene therapies beyond blood disorders (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/US-yes-for-Biogen-Idec-hemophilia-drug-Alprolix-350954" target="_new">31 March</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Biogen-hemophilia-A-therapy-Eloctate-352194" target="_new">8 June 2014</a>). </p><p>"Biogen is the right place in terms of culture, expertise and size to take something that is still early-stage and still in the academic lab and bring it to patients," he said. "There are unmet medical needs that are very likely to be met by gene therapy, if you do it right."</p><p>Biogen was involved in gene therapies in the 1990s, but abandoned the effort since the technology was far from ready for commercial applications. The company is reinvesting in the field to link its internal capabilities with external advances in the field, and to consider how Biogen may get into new therapy areas beyond multiple sclerosis and hemophilia.</p><p><b>Gene therapy potential emerges</b></p><p>"The first and foremost reason [that gene therapy is gaining momentum] is that the technology has become robust enough during the past five to 10 years," Dr Danos said. "Everything which had been done before was done from very crude bench types of processes. Now they've moved to a stage where it's beginning to look like something industrial. We could provide real treatments, real drugs for patients."</p><p>Now that there are several platforms for delivering gene therapies through adeno virus vectors (AAVs) or lentiviral vectors &ndash; the latter being the delivery method for TIGET's preclinical programs &ndash; gene therapy has become a viable commercial product, assuming that ongoing clinical trials prove that the therapeutic candidates are effective, possibly curative, treatments.</p><p>"It's about robustness and reproducibility. We can definitely show some efficacy in things like hemophilia. There are a handful of those for which we now have proof of biology in the clinic," Dr Danos said. "And all of a sudden, it becomes a product that's approved in Europe. That changes [the minds] of investors and provokes all kinds of excitement."</p><p>UniQure's Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec) was approved in Europe to treat the rare inherited disease lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) in 2012 and the drug's marketer Chiesi recently priced the product at &euro;1.1m ($1.2m), making it the most expensive pharmaceutical product in the world (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-gene-therapy-Glybera-finally-gets-CHMP-nod-in-Europe-333061" target="_new">20 July 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/How-much-Eyes-water-as-first-gene-therapy-Glybera-approaches-the-market-355304" target="_new">27 November 2014</a>).</p><p>"The whole team at Biogen has been exploring gene therapies. We're now about to narrow our focus down to a few therapeutic areas to apply it," Dr Danos said.</p><p>Academia doesn't have the capabilities needed to turn gene therapies into products and smaller biotech companies also are unlikely to commercialize gene therapies on their own. That's why, Dr Danos said, larger companies like Biogen and their colleagues in big pharma must invest in the field to get gene therapies to patients.</p><p>Novartis announced partnerships with Intellia Therapeutics and Caribou Biosciences in the gene editing field in January, and Pfizer signed an agreement with Spark Therapeutics to co-develop gene therapies for hemophilia in February (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-to-use-gene-editing-tool-with-CAR-T-therapies-355979" target="_new">7 January 2015</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gene-therapy-rising-Bluebird-soars-at-ASH-Pfizer-builds-platform-355514" target="_new">9 December 2014</a>). </p><p>But Spark plans to develop its lead gene therapy program for inherited retinal dystrophies on its own. The company recently completed an initial public offering to pursue what could be the first US FDA-approved gene therapy and the biotech company had one of the most successful IPOs of the past two years (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Spark-ignites-investors-one-of-years-first-five-biotech-IPOs-356490" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Much more work needed</b></p><p>But despite recent advances and stepped up investments in gene therapy, the field still has many challenges to overcome. </p><p>"We know that the technology allows us to do a number of things, but not everything, so there still are a lot of challenges. We want to be important players in [overcoming those challenges] as well," Dr Danos said.</p><p>While it seems that AAVs and lentiviral vectors can be produced on a mass scale, the best manufacturing platform has not been identified. Also, AAV vectors and lentiviruses may be efficient means of delivering gene therapies, but they can trigger unwanted immune responses, so additional viral and non-viral delivery methods must be explored. </p><p>And in the emerging area of gene editing, companies have yet to determine the best way to translate that technology into commercial therapies. </p><p>Gene editing and gene therapy also have a lot of scientific questions that need to be answered, such as: how to trigger homologous recombination in a cell (sharing of genetic information between two similar strands of DNA or RNA) without causing too much toxicity; how to find the right gene therapy dose based on the best level of protein expression; and how to turn gene therapy or gene-editing treatments on or off based on efficacy and toxicity.</p><p>"Whoever is going to be able to do that will unlock a lot of value," Dr Danos said, but he noted that "there are things that are doable today and that can be brought to patients right now with the technology we have."</p><p><p><p><p>
