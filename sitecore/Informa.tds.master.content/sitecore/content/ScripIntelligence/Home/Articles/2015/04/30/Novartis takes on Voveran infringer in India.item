<p>Foreign firms continue to take legal action against trademark infringers in India. </p><p>This time it is Novartis which has hauled to court a less known local firm that allegedly infringed on its leading non-steroidal anti-inflammatory brand, Voveran (diclofenac sodium).</p><p>Voveran is among the top ranked brands in the pain and inflammation therapeutic segment in India and reported sales of INR2.40bn ($37.8m) for the 12 months to January 2014 as per IMS data.</p><p>The alleged infringer, Saint Michael Biotech, has apparently been manufacturing and selling a drug with "almost the same ingredients" under a deceptively similar trademark, Voviram SR-100, Novartis' counsel previously indicated.</p><p>Novartis then said that Saint Michael was guilty of "infringement, passing off, unfair competition and dilution" of its trademark. The Swiss multinational also submitted that it had carried out an investigation in the market through a private investigator which brought to light the infraction by Saint Michael.</p><p>Last year, the Delhi High Court, in an interim order, restrained Saint Micheal from manufacturing, selling, or advertising directly or indirectly or even dealing in medicinal preparations under the trademark Voviram.</p><p>The court, at that time, permitted the appointment of "court commissioners", to visit the manufacturing site of Saint Michael Biotech in Uttarakhand and the premises of a pharmaceutical distributor in Delhi and seize any infringing material. "The same will be seized and released to the defendants, on superdari, after an inventory in respect of the same is made," the court then said.</p><p>It also permitted police assistance in the event of any "impediment" in accessing the sites.</p><p>In April this year, the Delhi High Court noted that the parties had arrived at "a settlement."</p><p>Novartis' counsel indicated that an "appropriate application" in this regard would be filed shortly, according to details in a court order dated 21 April.</p><p>Industry experts indicate that a settlement in such cases could imply that the alleged infringer agrees to take the infringing goods off the market as per certain agreed terms, though Novartis declined specific comment.</p><p>Novartis told <i>Scrip</i> that it is "premature" to comment on any queries as the matter is currently "subjudice."</p><p>Saint Michael could not immediately be reached for a response.</p><p>The case is now expected to be listed on 18 May.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Delhi High Court <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Merck-KGaA-takes-on-counterfeiters-in-India-357693%5d" target="_new">blocked</a> what appeared to be an attempt to market fake versions of a clutch of Merck KGaA products on the domestic and export markets. </p>
