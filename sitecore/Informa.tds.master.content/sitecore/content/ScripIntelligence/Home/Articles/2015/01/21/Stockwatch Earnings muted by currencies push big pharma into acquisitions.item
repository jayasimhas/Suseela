<p>With the recent distractions of the annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference, Shire's acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-paying-5.2bn-for-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-356071" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 January 2015</a>) and the many fundraisings vying for investors' attention, you could have been forgiven for not realising that the full-year 2014 earnings season is already well under way (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-Amgen-Biogen-BMS-Celgene-Novartis-Pfizer-and-Roche-356329" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 January 2015</a>). With events like those, something as prosaic and anodyne as profitability has probably taken a back seat in investors' minds. However, reporting season may be about to rudely remind them that earnings and M&A are linked to each other as well as to last and this years' hot button issues of tax inversions and currency translations, respectively. </p><p><p>The phony earnings season actually started the week before the JP Morgan conference with AbbVie announcing its 2015 full-year earnings guidance, which met analysts' consensus estimates. Most investors took AbbVie's conservative guidance, which incorporated expectations on continuing US dollar strength and a competitive Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir) launch in HCV, as a negative sign and the AbbVie share price finished 2.7% down on the trading day after the after-hours announcement (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-gives-Viekira-dependent-2015-guidance-as-Anthem-chooses-Harvoni-356035" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 09 January 2015</a>).</p><p><p>A similarly negative investor judgement for more logical reasons was handed down when Johnson & Johnson (J&J) announced its fourth-quarter 2014 results and full-year 2015 guidance. Having beaten consensus estimates for the last few years courtesy of the strength of its pharmaceutical division, J&J announced sales last quarter that missed analysts' estimates by $300m, partly because of adverse currency movements (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJs-rising-sales-face-currency-hits-in-2014-2015-356274" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 21 January 2015</a>). Worse still, the mid-point of its 2015 earnings per share guidance was just five cents ahead of analysts' consensus expectations for the year &ndash; hardly the effusive confidence we have come to expect from the world's biggest healthcare company. But J&J's caution is more than justified by the continued strength of the dollar against the euro and the likely virtual exclusion of the source of much of last year's pharmaceutical growth &ndash; Olysio (simeprevir) for the treatment of HCV infection &ndash; by the expected dominance of more potent combination therapies from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie. In anticipating a slowdown in prescriptions of Olysio due to the warehousing of patients ahead of the Gilead and AbbVie launches, we had been decreasing our J&J holding. We further accelerated that divestment when the exclusory formulary dynamics, the like of which led previous developers of recently launched but uncompetitive HCV antivirals (Vertex and Merck & Co) to delete their products from the market (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vertex-bows-out-of-hepatitis-C-race-to-focus-on-cystic-fibrosis-349667" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 30 January 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-dares-stay-in-hepatitis-C-as-another-drug-dies-356307" target="_new">22 January 2015</a>), seemed likely to have a similarly drastic effect on Olysio. I don't mind being right for the wrong reason.</p><p><p>When J&J sneezes, many other companies catch colds. The weakness in J&J's medical devices and diagnostics division seemed to be mirrored in a number of companies including Wright Medical Group, Stryker and Sequenom, all of which disappointed either with their Q4 2014 results or with their 2015 guidance. Not content with executing its HCV franchise last year, Vertex also reported sales from its new cystic fibrosis franchise that were below analysts' consensus estimates for Q4 2014 and lower guidance for the full-year 2015. These sets of disappointing results were offset to some extent by positive pre-announcements from Emergent BioSolutions, Pharmacyclics, Actavis, Regeneron and Acorda.</p><p><p>What do we have to look forward to for the bulk of the earnings season yet to come? Well, if you are invested in a profitable Swiss or US pharmaceutical company (as we are), you may not be looking forward to its guidance for the year, which will be dented by the strength of its home currency and probable further euro weakness. What is the easiest way for a company to attack these currency headwinds? The answer is to buy a company or division with sales and earnings. With this in mind, the strong financial results of medical device company Covidien must have swollen the chest of its soon to complete inversion acquirer Medtronic: with the addition of sales and earnings growth, plus a lower tax rate, what's not to like?</p><p><p>For many other companies yet to report, the negative effect on earnings of restrictive formulary drug pricing and foreign exchange rates is likely to result in M&A activity in 2015 at least at the level of 2014 just to keep up with investors' expectations. Companies like Pfizer which need to find their target, but have yet to do so, should be active. We will live in more exciting times.</p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include NPS Pharmaceuticals, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Pharmacyclics, Actavis, Regeneron, Covidien, Medtronic and Pfizer.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest manages the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for three life science</i>&ndash;Â <i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p>
