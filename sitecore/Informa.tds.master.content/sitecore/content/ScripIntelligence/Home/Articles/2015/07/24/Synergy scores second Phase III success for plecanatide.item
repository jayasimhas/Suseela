<p>Synergy Pharmaceuticals gained 9.2% to reach $8.97 per share in mid-day trading on 30 July based on the second set of positive Phase III data for plecanatide in the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC).</p><p>A top-line analysis showed that both plecanatide doses met the 1,337-patient clinical trial's primary endpoint &ndash; the percentage of intention-to-treat patients who were durable overall responders compared to individuals who received a placebo during the 12-week treatment period: 20.1% for 3mg of plecanatide, 20% for 6mg and 12.8% for placebo (p=0.004, both doses). Diarrhea was the most common adverse event, but the incidence rate was lower than seen in late-stage trials for approved CIC drugs, as noted following the first Phase III study.</p><p>Diarrhea in the second Phase III was reported by 3.2% of patients treated with 3mg of plecanatide and by 4.5% of patients in the 6mg plecanatide group compared with 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. Only 1.1% of the people in both plecanatide dose groups discontinued treatment due to diarrhea versus 0.4% in the placebo group. </p><p>The incidence of diarrhea is a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Synergy-rockets-on-Phase-III-constipation-data-359029" target="_new">big improvement</a> versus the 16% diarrhea rate for patients treated with Linzess (linaclotide), which is marketed by Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Ironwood stands to earn a low single-digit royalty from plecanatide sales and its stock also rose on 30 July by 1.8% to $10.59 in mid-day trading. Synergy and Ironwood settled a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ironwood-and-CSO-sued-by-Synergy-over-guanylate-cyclase-receptor-agonists-324902" target="_new">patent dispute</a> in 2012, which gave Synergy rights to Ironwood's method of use patents. </p><p>Both Linzess and plecanatide target the guanylyl cyclase C receptor. Plecanatide is an analogue of uroguanylin, which is a gastrointestinal (GI) peptide in the small intestine that regulates GI activity.</p><p>New York-based Synergy said when the first set of Phase III plecanatide results were released that it would seek US FDA approval for the oral drug in the fourth quarter of this year, but now the company says a new drug application (NDA) will be filed in January.</p><p><p><p><p>
