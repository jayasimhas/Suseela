<p>Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Praluent (alirocumab) and Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) not only are the guinea pigs for how the FDA will handle the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor applications, but the drugs also are expected to be trailblazers in the marketplace for what's coming behind them &ndash; notably Pfizer's bococizumab, which is catching up fast to the two leaders. </p><p>The FDA is expected to act on Praluent by 24 July and Repatha by 27 August.</p><p>The drugs are intended to bring low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) under control when statins have not been enough to do the job. </p><p>But until the results of ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) are available, it's unknown whether the PCSK9s prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks, strokes and CV-related death.</p><p>How broad the FDA decides to go with the initial labeling is widely expected to guide prescriber uptake and payer reimbursement, ultimately affecting the products' competitiveness against other cardiovascular medicines &ndash; emerging agents, like Esperion Therapeutics' oral ATP citrate lyase inhibitor ETC-1002, and older drugs, such as statins &ndash; and setting the stage for the overall success for all PCSK9s in the CV marketplace.</p><p>In addition to Pfizer's drug, other PCSK9 inhibitors in development include Lilly's LY-3015014, Alnylam's ALN-PCS, Betagenon's O-304, Kowa's K-312, Alder Biopharmaceuticals' AD-306 and Affiris' ATH-04, ATH-05 and ATH-06, according to <i>Citeline</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>. Roche, HQL Pharmaceuticals and Liphorus also have PCSK9s for CV indications in preclinical development. </p><p>Pfizer also has additional PCSK9 inhibitors in early development, <i>Citeline</i> tracking data show.</p><p>Louisa Joseph, an analyst with <i>Scrip</i> affiliate <i>Datamonitor</i>, anticipated that uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors likely will be rapid within the high-risk familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) population &ndash; patients with a genetic condition that causes unusually high levels of LDL-C, often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; where Praluent and Repatha are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9s-are-coming-But-who-will-get-them-359579" target="_new">expected to gain their initial US approvals</a>. </p><p>The consistent positive safety and efficacy results from the drugs' Phase II and III trials likely will drive prescribing in those high-risk patients, in which statins generally are less effective, Ms Joseph said. </p><p>But with Praluent's and Repatha's safety and efficacy profiles comparable throughout the clinical trials, the first-to-market status, dosing and pricing are expected to be the main distinguishing features between the two drugs, Ms Joseph said.</p><p>"Praluent's potential first-to-market status in the US may be important, allowing it to gain a stronger hold of the small FH population before Repatha is approved," she said.</p><p>With payers already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">complaining</a> about the expected high costs of PCSK9s, which are estimated to run about $10,000 per patient per year &ndash; although some have put that amount as high as $12,000 annually &ndash; Ms Joseph said Praluent's low-dose option may be more favorable and appealing to payers than Repatha's high-dose injections, potentially driving uptake.</p><p>Dr Ned Braunstein, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Regeneron, told the FDA's outside expert advisers at a meeting <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">last month</a> that most patients were expected to start on Praluent at the 75mg dose, with the 150mg dose intended to be reserved for the more difficult to treat patients.</p><p>Praluent's lower dose is expected to cost about half of what it would be for the higher dose of that medicine or for Repatha.</p><p>Amgen also has proposed two dosing options: 420mg once monthly or 140mg every two weeks.</p><p>Repatha's once-monthly and high-potency injection could gain the competitive edge over Praluent by offering patients a more convenient treatment regime, Ms Joseph said. </p><p>Dr Peter Chang, principal scientific analyst at Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, said he anticipated the CVOT results and more details on the convenience of Repatha's eventual monthly device to impact how the dosing issue plays out. </p><p><b>Lucrative dyslipidemia market</b></p><p>The results of the CVOTs will likely be the determining factor for whether the FDA will permit PCSK9s to be marketed in the more lucrative dyslipidemia population &ndash; an indication for which the commercial potential could be very high for the drugs if the studies are successful &ndash; and will be vital for prescriber uptake, Ms Joseph said.</p><p>While Praluent and Repatha may be first to gain the FDA's approval, Pfizer's bococizumab is not far behind, and its CVOTs, known as SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2, are expected to be completed in April and January 2018 &ndash; putting the studies just a few months after Amgen's FOURIER and Sanofi's and Regeneron's ODYSSEY CVOTs are anticipated to finish up in late 2017.</p><p>So, Ms Joseph said, it's likely that all three drugs could be approved for the wider dyslipidemia populations at around the same time. </p><p>"Therefore, despite bococizumab's expected late-to-market status for the FH population, it could be able to actively compete on a level playing field with Praluent and Repatha for a share of the wider dyslipidemia market," she said. </p><p>But Ms Joseph also acknowledged that by the time bococizumab comes to the market, Praluent and Repatha are likely to already be established drugs with high-risk FH patients &ndash; making Pfizer's CVOTs that much more important for gaining market share in the dyslipidemia population.</p><p><b>Other market competition</b></p><p>How well the PCSK9s fare in the CVOTs also will likely determine whether prescribers choose those medicines over drugs in other classes, like the experimental cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, Dr Chang said.</p><p>But prescribers and patients also may simply prefer oral drugs over the injectable PCSK9 inhibitors, depending on various factors, including details from the CVOTs, patients' starting LDL-C levels and their level of CV risk, he said.</p><p>While ETC-1002 does not lower LDL-C as well as the PCSK9 inhibitors, Esperion's oral drug, for which the firm is expected to have an end-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA in the third quarter, has demonstrated a very good effect in combination with Merck's Zetia (ezetimibe), Dr Chang pointed out, although he said more details are needed on the PK interaction with high-dose statins.</p><p>Like the proposed use for the PCSK9s, Zetia is used as an add-on therapy to statins to further lower LDL-C levels, Ms Joseph noted.</p><p>But Zetia has shown only a 20% further reduction of LDL-C, while the PCSK9s have demonstrated superior reductions of 40%-60%, she said.</p><p>And considering the high-risk patient population, the PCSK9 inhibitors increased efficacy may give those compounds a competitive advantage over Zetia, which could limit the latter drug's prescribing to the lower-risk patient population, Ms Joseph said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
