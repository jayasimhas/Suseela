<p>Earnings season is upon us. Key motifs that will recur in pharma company briefings will include recent rhetoric on drug pricing (with pharma executive likely to emphasize how they are offering real value with innovative therapies); the threat &ndash; or for many, such as Amgen, Pfizer or Boehringer Ingelheim, the opportunity &ndash; of biosimilars given that a slew of blockbuster monoclonal antibodies are reaching or nearing loss of exclusivity; and the negative impact of currency trends on US dollar-reporting firms' sales and earnings. The perennial favorite of analyst question time, M&A intentions, will surely rear its head more than once, too.</p><p>In advance of the company announcements, <i>Scrip</i> has highlighted below some key points to watch for.</p><h2>Company Specific </h2><h2>Biogen</h2><p>The focus at Biogen Inc. when it reports third-quarter results on Oct. 21 will be on the sales of blockbuster multiple sclerosis therapy <i>Tecfidera</i> (dimethyl fumarate). With the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biogens-Kingsley-Take-Blame-For-Tecfidera-Sales-360901" target="_new">recent departure of Tony Kingsley</a>, executive vice president of global commercial operations, fueling speculation that the drug is about to show disappointing quarterly performance once again, and ongoing jitters among doctors &ndash; and investors &ndash; about cases of the rare but potentially fatal brain condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, any growth at all would be a positive boon. </p><h2>Lilly</h2><p>Following a strong few months as summer came to an end, Eli Lilly & Co. saw its star brought back to earth with a jolt when it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Suffers-From-Lillys-Evacetrapib-Failure-361000" target="_new">announced on Oct. 12</a> the discontinuation of its Phase III candidate for dyslipidemia, evacetrapib. Nevertheless, the company was buoyed just a couple of days later by results from the fourth of four key Phase III trials of its investigational oral JAK inhibitor baricitinib, which exceeded expectations in showing its superiority to AbbVie's standard of care TNF inhibitor blockbuster <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) in rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p>Previous positives have included data on newer diabetes therapies. Lilly and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim reported strong data for their jointly developed type 2 diabetes drug <i>Jardiance</i> (empagliflozin) in a highly anticipated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study in mid-September. The positive results from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study are expected to have an immediate impact on sales of Jardiance. Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note about Lilly's upcoming 3Q results, "The impressive EMPA-REG results should boost Jardiance sales and the high degree of awareness of the results already (especially amongst specialists) should allow for this upside to come sooner than expected." Credit Suisse expects the CV trial results to increase use of Lilly and Boehringer's drug and as a result it raised its target price for Lilly (Boehringer is a privately held business) to $105 per share, up from $89 per share, before lowering it to $99 following the evacetrapib news. </p><p>An update on another late-stage, high risk, pipeline asset is also expected in the firm's 3Q earnings announcement. Solanezumab, which is currently in Phase III for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is being closely watched by investors and it is hoped it will help "transform the company." Lilly will report its third quarter results on Thursday Oct. 22. </p><h2>Shire</h2><p>Shire PLC has been very quiet since announcing its unsolicited bid for Baxalta Inc. in early August. The occasion of its third-quarter earnings announcement on Oct. 23 could see it make further pronouncements on the deal (Baxalta's own quarterly report comes on Oct. 29). Recent speculation is also suggesting that the firm may be preparing a bid for another firm, with Radius Health Inc. the current favorite, which could result in a partial eclipse of the earnings news. Management will also be questioned on its broader strategy, not least because of its relatively high sensitivity as a specialty drug firm to drug pricing issues.</p><h2>Novartis</h2><p>The recently restructured Novartis AG unveils third-quarter results Oct. 27 with analysts keen for further comment on Novartis' interest in exploring outcomes-based reimbursement models for the likely heart failure blockbuster <i>Entresto</i> (sacubitril/valsartan) and prospects for a similar approach for its multiple sclerosis therapy <i>Gilenya</i> (fingolimod). The Swiss group's biosimilar strategy is a key topic after the FDA this month accepted Novartis' submission for its biosimilar of Amgen's Enbrel (etanercept). Earlier this year its generics unit Sandoz launched the first biosimilar in the US &ndash; Zarxio, a copycat version of Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim). Other key themes include plans for the acute heart failure drug serelaxin and commercialization plans for IL-17 blocker Cosentyx (secukinumab) in treating psoriasis and prospects for expanding it into treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Comment on slowing growth in China and the outlook for emerging markets generally will also attract investor attention.</p><h2>Sanofi</h2><p>Third-quarter results for Sanofi SA to be released on Oct. 29 will include a webcast with Q&A &ndash; but expect probing analyst questions to be deferred to the planned Nov. 6 Meet Management Paris Seminar when newly installed CEO Olivier Brandicourt will outline the board's strategic plans. Focus will be on why the inhaled insulin product <i>Afrezza</i> (insulin human) is failing in the marketplace, the commercialization plans for its PCSK9 inhibitor <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab), and how France's largest drug maker plans to deal with a lacklustre pipeline and sluggish performance by long-acting basal insulin <i>Toujeo</i> (insulin glargine). Toujeo was the second-generation product supposed to help disperse the major cloud over Lantus, Sanofi's top-selling drug which comprises about 20% of sales and faces increased pricing pressures, competition and biosimilar threats. Also of interest is the durability of Sanofi's partnership with MannKind Corp, Afrezza's originator. Many analysts say CEO Brandicourt plans to announce the need for job cuts in the US. His predecessor Chris Viehbacher is likely to be referred to again as having left a tainted legacy.</p><h2>AstraZeneca</h2><p>Expect AstraZeneca to talk about its diabetes business during its Q3 call with investors on Nov. 5. The British pharma suffered a major setback to its diabetes franchise in mid-October when FDA rejected the combination of its DPP-4 inhibitor <i>Onglyza</i> (saxagliptin) with its SGLT-2 inhibitor <i>Farxiga</i> (dapagliflozin), requesting further data. AstraZeneca has said previously that it expects sales of the combination to contribute approximately $3bn of the $8bn in diabetes sales it hopes to produce by 2023 &ndash; part of its plan to reach $45bn in total revenues. Investors will be interested to hear how the company intends to handle FDA requests and what the setback will cost ultimately. </p><h2>Arena</h2><p>Arena Pharmaceuticals finally conceded defeat, firing its long-time CEO Jack Leif in early October in hopes of putting in place management that could turn around the company. Arena wouldn't reveal any of its plans for "lifecycle management" of its obesity drug Belviq (lorcaserin), but is expected to talk about plans for further development during its third quarter call with investors on Nov. 2. Expect to hear the biotech talk about the development of lorcaserin in smoking cessation. </p><p><h2>Bayer</h2><p><p> Bayer's group results may be affected by a slowdown in its crop science business, now one of only three business units along with pharma and consumer health since performance materials were spun out in September. Agrochemical firms like Monsanto and Syngenta have reported declining sales and a squeeze on profits in the third quarter because of low crop prices and currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries like Brazil. Charges and adjustments associated with the Covestro spin-out and other divestments could also complicate Bayer's financial reporting this time around. The less-than-expected &euro;1.5bn ($1.7bn) proceeds from the Covestro IPO is likely to come up for discussion even though the IPO's bumpy ride was mostly due to turmoil in German stock markets because of the emissions scandal at another German multinational, Volkswagen AG. Bayer originally thought it would raise &euro;2.5bn from the Covestro IPO.</p><p><p><h2>Sector Themes</h2><p><h2>Reinvestment?</h2><p>Under pressure already from certain quarters to spend money on building their pipelines for future success at the same time as delivering shareholder returns today, US companies can expect a spotlight to be shone on the destination of their profits also by Democratic senators and other advocates of drug pricing accountability this quarter. As the question of drug pricing continues to grab national and international headlines, it is likely that companies will be called on to explain the level of reinvestment in R&D that they make. Traditional biopharma companies looker better in this light than firms like Valeant, but an easy ride is assured for none.</p><p><h2>PCSK9 Prospects</h2><p>It's too early for sales of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab; Sanofi/Regeneron) and <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab; Amgen/Astellas) to have made a significant impact on the P&L sheets. Praluent was approved in the US in late July and in Europe in late September; Repatha received its green light in the US in late August and in Europe in late July. However, analysts will be pushing executives for as much detail as possible on early usage and uptake data, and on how they intend to position the drugs for future market expansion, and how they might respond to emerging data on cardiovascular outcomes for the broader class of treatments for dyslipidemia.</p><p><h2>Immuno-Oncology</h2><p>Sales of the flagship new PD-1 inhibitors, Merck's <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) will be closely scrutinized. But beyond the initial commercial performance of the drugs, industry players could reveal more about their vision for combination immuno-oncology therapies, and importantly, how such therapies could be priced, and how companies in the space will manage the complex network of partnering relationships that it is now proliferating.</p><p><h2>Biosimilars</h2><p>This year has seen significant advances in the market for biosimilars. In early September, Novartis's generics business Sandoz launched the US's first biosimilar <i>Zarxio</i>, a version of Amgen's neutropenia drug <i>Neupogen</i> (filgrastim). Meanwhile, in Europe (where biosimilar filgrastim has been available for years), February saw the launch of biosimilar versions of Johnson & Johnson/MSD's <i>Remicade</i> (infliximab) in key markets following the blockbuster product's loss of exclusivity in countries including the UK, France and Germany. Although the US is by far the biggest market for the blockbuster injectable anti-TNF drug for inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, latest quarterly data on the impact of the biosimilar in those markets will be pored over by analysts trying to figure out how a bigger wave of biosimilar monoclonal antibodies might affect originator company sales in Europe over the next few years.</p><p><h2>Is your migraine therapy in Phase III yet?</h2><p>The race to bring the first injectable anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody to the market for difficult-to-treat migraines is well underway, and the potential advantages of the various contenders, including long-lasting action and a lack of serious side effects, could come up in third-quarter discussions. Lilly's anti-CGRP antibody LY-2951742 is in a Phase III study in patients with cluster headache, while Amgen's AMG-334 is in Phase III in episodic migraine and in Phase II in chronic migraine. The US company has recently recruited Novartis to help in the product's ex-US development. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' anti-CGRP MAb TEV-48125 and Alder BioPharmaceuticals' ALD403 are expected to enter Phase III shortly, and will pile on the pressure to achieve first place. Alder did in fact announce Oct. 13 it has started a pivotal Phase III study of ALD-403 in patients with frequent episodic migraine, and expects to start a second pivotal study, in patients with chronic migraine, in 2016.</p><p><p>
