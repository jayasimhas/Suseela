<p>The European Medicines Agency is jamming the "revolving door" between its experts and the pharmaceutical industry. According to newly updated rules, experts and committee members who declare intentions to work for a pharma company will have to cease their involvement in any medicines assessment. NGOs have welcomed the move, but say the EMA still needs to go further to guarantee real transparency and independence from the industry.</p><p>According to the agency, committee discussions are "delicate and confidential" and "employment in a pharmaceutical company is incompatible with an involvement in agency activities." The perception of a committee member's conflict of interest can be as damaging to the agency as an actual conflict of interest, it acknowledges.</p><p>So from now on, when a committee member or expert tells the agency they are to work with industry, regardless of whether a contract has been signed, the EMA will immediately restrict that person from further involvement in agency activity. It will also look into whether the person involved and their move to industry could have compromised the integrity of any ongoing or past scientific reviews.</p><p>The move comes as an update to the agency's policy on handling declarations of interests of scientific committee members and experts, which underwent a major revision in 2014 and which came into force in January 2015. This stated that any committee member or expert intending to engage in "occupational activities" with a pharmaceutical company must inform the EMA and refrain from any activities that may affect the pharmaceutical company involved. Additionally the EMA may impose any additional condition or limitation on the person concerned. However, in the name of consistency and balance, the EMA decided it needed to issue further guidance.</p><p>The revolving door between industry and the agency has been a concern for some time. For example, last year, Corporate Europe Observatory, a campaign group that seeks to expose the influence that corporations have on EU policy making, was concerned about the hiring of Stefano Marino as head of the EMA's legal department. Mr Marino, hired by the EMA in 2013, had enjoyed a long career in industry, including roles at Menarini and Sigma-Tau as well as a position at the industry association, EFPIA. CEO was concerned about Mr Marino's role in the drafting of the EMA's controversial policy on access to clinical data and it questioned whether Mr Marino's interests had been adequately assessed. It also wondered if the restrictions in place "in place [were] enough to prevent undue influence over the agency's decision-making process." </p><p><b>response</b></p><p>Health Action International (HAI) and the European Consumer Orgainsation (BEUC), which sit on the EMA's Patients' and Consumers' Working Party, have welcomed the move. It "shows the agency is serious about revolving doors and confirms its commitment to address potential conflicts of interest &#8230; Safeguarding the independence of the decision making process is vital to maintain consumers&rsquo; confidence in regulators and ultimately in the safety of the medicines on the market," said BEUC.</p><p>Nevertheless, the agency apparently needs to do more. According to HAI, the EMA's policy on conflicts of interest has actually been weakened. The cooling off period for most conflicts was reduced from five to three years and arbitrary distinctions between indirect and direct conflicts were reinserted during the EMA's sign off procedure, points out HAI's Ancel.la Santos Quintano. The EMA needs to address this and make all declarations of interest proactively available in a database, she said. The agency could also do more to avoid revolving doors, particularly at management level by applying pre- and post-employment restrictions for a certain period, added Ms Santos.</p><p>Most importantly. if the agency truly is to be independent, it has to restructure its budget to phase out direct financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. "The EMA&rsquo;s independence will always be compromised if it continues to rely on pharmaceutical companies to survive. In 2014, 86% of its budget came from industry fees," said Ms Santos.</p><p>BEUC acknowledged that the EMA has made considerable efforts to improve its transparency and conflict of interest policy. However, it has noted the increase in the number of companies seeking scientific advice. "We ask that those staff members involved in the scientific advice stay far away from approval procedures," it said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European pharmaceutical industry federation, EFPIA said it supports the EMA's move to restrict the involvement of its experts in scientific assessments. "It is important that the public should have no doubt about the impartiality of the agency's scientific assessments," it said.</p><p>
