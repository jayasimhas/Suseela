<p>Shares of Lilly took a 1.6% hit on 23 February after the company revealed it was delaying the US and European submissions for the firm's basal insulin peglispro until after 2016 because of liver concerns &ndash; an action that had some on Wall Street declaring the drug dead and buried. </p><p>Lilly&rsquo;s stock closed at $71.09, down 79 cents, or 1.1%.</p><p>The Indianapolis, Indiana-based pharma said it needs to generate additional clinical data to understand and characterize the increases in liver fat observed in some patients who got peglispro in the company's Phase III trials. </p><p>Lilly emphasized there's been no drug-induced liver impairment or Hy's Law cases observed in the 3,900 patients given peglispro in the firm&rsquo;s trials.</p><p>Because of the delays in seeking approval, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, lowered its likelihood peglispro will make it to the market in type 1 diabetes to 55%, which is 5% below the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p><i>BioMedTracker</i> put the likelihood of peglispro gaining approval in type 2 diabetes at 57%, which is 3% below the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>While the company is disappointed with the delay, "we feel it is important to gain a better understanding of the potential effects" of the drug on the liver before asking regulators to review the applications for approval, said Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly's diabetes unit.</p><p>The delay is good news for rival Sanofi, which markets Lantus (insulin glargine). </p><p>Shares of Sanofi got a slight bump on 23 February, closing the day at $50.22, up 12 cents.</p><p>But the French firm&rsquo;s investors were not as cheerful this past September when results of Lilly&rsquo;s Phase III IMAGINE-1 and IMAGINE-3 trials showed that peglispro topped Lantus in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels at weeks 26 and 52 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Lillys-insulin-shows-superiority-over-Lantus-but-drug-safety-a-concern-353737" target="_new">05 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Patients in IMAGINE-1 continued treatment beyond 26 weeks, and the HbA1c superiority for the compound was maintained at weeks 52 and 78, Lilly said.</p><p>But until Lilly can show its drug is safe, Sanofi has room to breathe, with the filings for peglispro likely now at least two years out. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
