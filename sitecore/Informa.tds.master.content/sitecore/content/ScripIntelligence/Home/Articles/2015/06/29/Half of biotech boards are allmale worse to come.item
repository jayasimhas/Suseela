<p>Not only is gender bias as prevalent in fledgling biotech companies as it is in big pharma, the problem isn't going to get better any time soon if the pattern of recent appointments continues, a new report says. </p><p>Released on 26 June by executive search firm, LifeStream, <i>Investing in Biotechnology Management</i> looked at 110 private biotech companies funded by venture capitalists in a six-month window covering Q4 2014 and Q1 2015. Key finding included: </p><ul><li>Only three biotechs had as many (or more) women on their boards than men;</li><li>Over half (51%) had no women on the board; and</li><li>In 90% of the companies, women comprised less than 20% of the board.</li></ul><p>There were, however, two rays of hope for women executives.</p><p>The first is that women actually get to be CEOs in biotech: of the 110 funded companies, ten (9%) had women CEOs, a much <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Correction-Gender-biases-at-Actelion-Bayer-and-BI-not-significant-358957" target="_new">higher proportion than the 3%</a> within the biggest European and North American pharma companies. The only woman CEO in any of the top 20 Asian pharmaceutical companies is Vinita Gupta at Lupin in India, and she has the distinct advantage of close family links on the company board.</p><p>The second glimmer is that corporate venture capital groups tend to have a higher proportion of female partners: an earlier Lifestream report on prominent venture capital partnerships found that just 9.6% of partners were women. Amongst corporate VC, however, that figure was doubled. "That is having some influence on the landscape," LifeStream founder Karl Simpson told <i>Scrip</i>, "because those women are representing the investors on more biotech boards. </p><p>Another part of the report indicated that gender diversity is filtered at ascending levels of seniority. Analyzing 308 recent senior executive appointments to biotechnology companies, the report showed that while 32% of appointments at vice-president level went to female candidate, that figure fell to 27% among senior vice-presidents, fell further to 17% among the C-suite appointments, and further still to 15% among the board of directors.</p><p>The report says that many in the pharmaceutical industry see this pattern as a positive sign, arguing that the current gender imbalance will improve as a female enriched cohort moves through "the pipeline".</p><p>But Karl Simpson is not entirely convinced that "the pipeline" is whole solution. He thinks that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies might accelerate personnel diversity development if they applied a little more rigor and focus to their appointments process.</p><p>"Companies can be successful in achieving their diversity goal," he says, "as long as they have one."</p><p>"Then they have to look harder, and be more rigorous in their search &#8230; We always advocate that the process is rigorous and structured: internal recruitment groups and nomination committees sometimes need to embrace this more fully."</p><p>The problem, as he sees it, is partly at least due to dependence on personal networks to draw up rosters of potential candidates. </p><p>"Diversity representation on shortlists and, consequently on the appointment itself tend to represent the most familiar universe &ndash; essentially, the status quo. Front-of-mind lists rarely present the breadth of diversity that a more rigorous search would reveal, but they are the starting material for a lot of recruiting."</p><p>Increasing the focus of role specifications would also help, he believes. </p><p>"Often, tasks defined in a job description are not always actually required in a job. Demanding that a CEO must have previously raised financing, for instance, is likely to favor status quo candidates. But is it really necessary if the existing CFO has that experience? What is important is that the team can deliver." </p><p>He points to the example of Annalisa Jenkins, now CEO of venture-backed Dimension Therapeutics in Cambridge, MA. In a long career at Merck Serono, she had absolutely no reason to raise venture capital: "But does that disqualify her from bringing pharma experience to Dimension?" </p><p>Mr Simpson believes that, across pharma and biotech, it is important that recruitment is undertaken in a more mindful manner: "Usually, there is no institutional prejudice of any kind. But sometimes there is a tendency to stay with the status quo. Its unconscious decision making, going with what you feel."</p><p>The move to mindfulness must start in the top tier of the company, he adds. "It works where it's a top-down approach, so if the board isn't bought into it, then more balanced diversity can happen &ndash; but it's not going to infiltrate the whole organization."</p><p>
