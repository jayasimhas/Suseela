<p>Finland's Fimea has become the latest national regulatory agency in the EU to issue a formal statement supporting the switching of patients from a reference biological product to a biosimilar version &ndash; and vice versa &ndash; on the grounds that there is no evidence that doing so causes any adverse effects. </p><p>It has been argued, Fimea says, that a switch from an original biological medicinal product to a biosimilar version is risky. But in what it describes as a recommendation to the local healthcare system in Finland, the agency says that switches between biological products are common and "usually not problematic", for example in the context of hospital tendering process. </p><p>"For the time being", it continues, there is no evidence for adverse effects due to the switch from a reference product to a biosimilar, and "the theoretical basis of such adverse effects is weak". In a claim that has in the past been challenged by some originator firms, Fimea says that the risk of adverse events with switching "can be expected to be similar to the risk associated with changes in the manufacturing process of any biological product". Fimea's current position, therefore, is that "biosimilars are interchangeable with their reference products under the supervision of a healthcare person", the agency said. </p><p>Fimea's statement, published on 22 May, was not unexpected: Pekka Kurki, research professor at the agency, told <i>Scrip</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dutch-take-the-lead-on-biosimilar-switching---others-to-follow-357882" target="_new">last month</a> that it was working on an official position and that it should be ready before June. Its declaration is further evidence of a clear shift among EU member states towards support for switching as a way of fostering greater use of biosimilars. </p><p>The Dutch regulatory agency, the MEB, led the way in April when it updated its position on biosimilars to permit switching provided it was done with the involvement of health professionals and that the patient was informed of the switch. </p><p>Portugal's regulator Infarmed seems to be taking a similar approach. At an April 23-24 conference organized by the European Biosimilars Group (part of the European Generic medicines Association), Infarmed vice-president Helder Mota-Felipe suggested there was no particular problem with biosimilar switching among products provided the patient was closely monitored. </p><p>If infliximab, for example, is on a hospital's formulary, the hospital should consider all available infliximab products, including biosimilars, "and then buy the cheapest one", Mr Mota-Felipe said. If the original is cheaper, the hospital should buy that one, "but if you start on the biosimilar and the original becomes cheaper, you can switch to the original". </p><h2>No substitution</h2><p>Despite the growing regulator support for switching in Europe, there is still a general reluctance to go further and countenance automatic biosimilar substitution in the pharmacy.</p><p>In its official position, Fimea says that "automatic substitution at the pharmacy level is not within the scope of this recommendation". France's 2014 social security financing law, which was passed at the end of 2013, did include a provision allowing substitution under strict conditions, but it came under criticism from both R&D and biosimilar companies, and the decree implementing the provision has not yet been published. </p><p>Nonetheless, the pressure for greater use of biosimilars will only increase as payers and patients become more familiar with the concept and as more biologicals come onto the market, turning the screw on limited healthcare budgets. </p><p>Fimea notes that the idea behind the development of biosimilars is to "increase competition and provide more therapeutic options by reducing the regulatory requirements associated with marketing authorisation, thereby enabling the development of biological medicines similar to the reference medicine". </p><p>However, it continues, "as the manufacture of biosimilars is also very challenging and expensive, the prices of biosimilars are likely to remain relatively high. It is unlikely that competition in biosimilars will be equal to competition in generic medicines after the expiry of patent and data protection rights."</p><p>Despite such limitations, the agency says, the prices of biosimilars are expected to be lower than those of the reference medicines, whose prices are in turn likely to fall because of biosimilar competition.</p>
