<p>Robert Califf, President Barack Obama's nominee to lead the FDA, is expected to have a fairly easy time of it when he goes before a Senate panel at a confirmation hearing on Nov. 17 &ndash; so much so that he's still planning to speak later that day at the annual Conference on Clinical Cancer Research hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research (FOCR) and the Brookings Institution.</p><p>FOCR spokesman Ryan Hohman told <i>Scrip</i> Califf would simply be speaking at a later time in the afternoon rather than as the lunchtime keynoter &ndash; switching his plans after getting word his confirmation hearing was set for Nov. 17 with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA.</p><p>So the FDA commissioner contender apparently doesn't anticipate one of those 11-hour marathon sessions like what White House seeker Hillary Clinton endured last month answering questions at the House "Benghazi" hearing.</p><p>Even though most have expected Califf's confirmation is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Califf-Praised-As-Thoughtful-Choice-To-Lead-FDA-360469" target="_new">all but assured</a>, he's likely to be grilled more at his Senate HELP Committee hearing than Obama's first FDA commissioner, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">Margaret Hamburg</a>, who faced few tough questions in May 2009 &ndash; addressing mostly inquiries about improving food safety and tackling the burden of tobacco in the US, although she did acknowledge she was hoping to gain authority at the agency to approve biosimilars, which, of course, regulators did obtain the next spring under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i>.</p><p>The job of approving biosimilars is expected to get more difficult as biologics become more complex &ndash; something that will now be Califf's responsibility to figure out, if he's confirmed.</p><p>The FDA also is wrangling with how it will handle communications about unapproved, or off-label, uses of medical products &ndash; something that is being forced on the agency through <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Want-To-Promote-Off-Label-Pick-Your-Battlefield-359838" target="_new">recent court rulings</a>.</p><p>Califf also will be responsible for implementing whatever provisions make it through Congress under lawmakers' latest efforts to overhaul the US biomedical research enterprise &ndash; legislation that has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">passed the House</a> but has yet to be introduced in the Senate.</p><p>Califf, a cardiologist and former Duke University professor, who joined the FDA in February as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Dukes-Califf-takes-deputy-job-at-FDA-next-chief-356386" target="_new">deputy commissioner</a> for medical products and tobacco, already has been at acting commissioner <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/User-fees-Cures-elections-FDA-bracing-for-the-crash-359689" target="_new">Stephen Ostroff's side</a> during the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Wants-Better-PDUFA-Fees-Goals-Alignment-Predictability-361027" target="_new">negotiations</a> for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Educating-Califf-Eyes-opened-on-PDUFA-patient-advocates-359451" target="_new">renewal</a> of the latest round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>.</p><p>FOCR chair Ellen Sigal earlier this year also noted the new FDA commissioner will be confronting an inability to attract and retain the best and the brightest scientists for the agency, due to poor salaries and what she called "convoluted" hiring practices, in which divestiture of investments is complex.</p><p>FOCR is among the organizations that have wholeheartedly backed Califf's nomination.</p><p>But Califf has his critics, too &ndash; notably Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Prices-Trade-Deal-Hot-For-1st-Democratic-Debate-361005" target="_new">accused</a> the FDA nominee of having "extensive ties" to the drug industry.</p><p>"At a time when millions of Americans cannot afford to purchase the prescription drugs they need, we need a new leader at the FDA who is prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies and work to substantially lower drug prices. Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that Dr. Califf is not that person," asserted Sanders, a member of the Senate HELP Committee.</p><p>Sanders criticized the fact that the "multimillion-dollar" clinical research center at Duke that Califf oversaw while he was there received more than 60% of its funding from drug and medical device makers and that he had co-authored scientific papers with pharmaceutical company researchers. </p><p>At the Nov. 17 hearing, Sanders is expected to bring up Califf's most recent financial disclosure form, which listed seven drug companies and a device maker that paid him for consulting and six others &ndash; including Merck & Co., Novartis AG and Eli Lilly and Co. &ndash; which the senator contended "supported his university salary."</p><p>A petition against Califf by the activist social change organization Credo Action had received nearly 139,000 signatures as of Nov. 9 &ndash; reaching 92% of the group's 150,000 signature goal.</p><p>"We need an FDA chief with the guts to stand up to the pharmaceutical companies," Credo said, insisting Califf is "the ultimate industry insider" &ndash; calling for Americans to tell the Senate "No big pharma ally as FDA chief."</p><p>"Califf is simply too connected to industry," Credo charged. "If he becomes the next head of the FDA, his former sponsors and friends in the pharmaceutical industry will have a friendly ear in a major position of power, threatening our financial well-being and physical health. This is exactly how big corporations go about capturing control."</p><p>"The Senate must block this nomination," the group demanded.</p><p>But Califf has won support from several in the medical community &ndash; including <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> editor Jeffrey Drazen, who insisted it is "impossible to argue" the FDA commissioner nominee "has a pro-industry bias." </p><p>"Califf's experience, his proven leadership abilities, his record of robust research to guide clinical practice and his unwavering dedication to improving patient outcomes are unsurpassed qualifications for the post of commissioner of the FDA," Drazen wrote in an Oct. 28 <i>NEJM</i> editorial. "We strongly endorse his nomination and urge the Senate to act favorably on it."</p><p>Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, also has been a big supporter for Califf to take the reins at the FDA &ndash; telling <i>Scrip</i> in September the former Duke professor is someone who could "shake things up" and is the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/A-Califf-Regime-The-Disruptor-FDA-Industry-Needs-360491" target="_new">disruptor</a> the drug and device regulatory agency needs to move it away from "years of stagnation."</p><p>American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown also praised Califf's nomination &ndash; calling him the "perfect person for this job."</p><p>And National Health Council CEO Marc Boutin said his group could "think of no better person" who fits the bill of FDA chief than Califf.</p><p>Califf also gained the backing of nearly 70 other organizations, including the Milken Institute's FasterCures, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy and Research!America, who declared the candidate was the right leader at this "transformative moment in science."</p><p>But even with all of that support behind him, as confirmation hearings go, some unexpected questions may arise for Califf pertaining to information uncovered during the vetting process, which may keep him longer at the Senate HELP session than he may have anticipated &ndash; but unlikely for 11 hours.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
