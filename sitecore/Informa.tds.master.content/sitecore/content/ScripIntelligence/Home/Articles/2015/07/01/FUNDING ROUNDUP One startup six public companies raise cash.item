<p>'Tis the season to raise money, apparently.</p><p>Many private and public drug development companies started the year with fundraising to finance research and development in 2015 and beyond. Private US biotechnology companies have been especially active, raising at least $715m in venture cash as of 9 January, so that the industry is well on its way to beating the $1.1bn VC total raised in the first quarter of 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-venture-capital-off-to-a-659m-start-in-2015-355964" target="_new">7 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Blend-raises-VC-cash-Actavis-gets-quick-Namenda-appeal-and-three-new-deals-355997" target="_new">8 January 2014</a>). </p><p>The table below details one new venture capital deal and six large public company financings announced between 7 and 9 January.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Financing terms</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Use of proceeds</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Surface Oncology;</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Atlas Venture led a $35m Series A round with participation from Fidelity Biosciences, Lilly Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Amgen Ventures, Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research and former Bristol-Myers Squibb R&D head Elliott Sigal. Dr Sigal will have a seat on the new company's scientific advisory board. He's also on the board of directors for cancer therapy startup Adaptimmune in the UK (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/UK-biotech-Adaptimmune-raises-104m-series-A-to-build-US-style-company-354114" target="_new">25 September 2014</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Surface is developing next-generation cancer immunotherapies that target newly understood mechanisms responsible for enabling tumor cells to evade detection by the immune system. The company plans to identify candidates for clinical development in 2015 based on preclinical therapies designed to improve the effectiveness of antigen presentation; to block the activity of suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment; or to counter the impact of specific inhibitory cytokines and metabolites.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>The Medicines Company;</p><p>Parsippany, New Jersey</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The Medicines Company priced an offering of convertible senior notes with a 2.5% annual interest rate and due in 2022 with a total aggregate principal amount of $350m. The notes are convertible through 15 October 2021 at a rate of 29.8806 shares per $1,000 in principal amount, valuing the shares at $33.47 each, which is a 35% premium to the company's 7 January closing price of $24.79.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The company expects to earn $336.6m in net proceeds or up to $387.1m if notes for an additional $50m in principal amount are sold to meet excess demand. The specific use of proceeds was not disclosed.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Alder BioPharmaceuticals;</p><p>Bothell, Washington</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Alder priced 6m shares at $29.50 each for gross proceeds of $177m. The company will fund several programs, but it continues to seek a new partner for clazakizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), after losing Bristol-Myers Squibb's backing in 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alder-slides-as-Bristol-Myers-dumps-clazakizumab-353680" target="_new">3 September 2014</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>In addition to its $67.6m in cash and investments as of 30 September, Alder will use the proceeds from its offering to spend $68m on Phase IIb and III clinical trials for ALD403, which targets CGRP for migraine prevention; $13m on preclinical development of ALD1613, an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) inhibitor for Cushing's disease; and the rest on other research and business activities.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Avalanche Biotechnologies;</p><p>Menlo Park, California</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Avalanche priced 2.4m shares at $59 each for $141.6m in gross proceeds, including 390,000 shares sold by some of the company's shareholders for $23m. The company is trading at more than three times its $17 initial public offering price from August (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/TABLE-Avalanche-outperforms-with-the-weeks-best-IPO-353161" target="_new">2 August 2014</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The company will use $30m to fund R&D for AVA-101, its Phase IIa gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD); $25m to fund manufacturing and process development for AVA-101 and other gene therapies; $15m for other preclinical and clinical programs; and the rest for working capital.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cempra;</p><p>Chapel Hill, North Carolina</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Cempra priced 5.25m shares at $24.50 each for net proceeds of $120.6m. The company took advantage of a 7.3% stock price increase on 5 January after it reported the first set of positive Phase III results for its antibiotic solithromycin (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Cempra-rises-on-first-Phase-III-solithromycin-results-355944" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The cash will fund continued development of solithromycin in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and gonorrhea, and Taksta in bone and joint infections. The money also will be used to fund commercial preparations for solithromycin in CABP and general expenses.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Stemline Therapeutics;</p><p>New York City</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Stemline is selling 3.8m shares at $15.75 each for gross proceeds of $59.85m.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The cash will fund clinical development of SL-401 and SL-701, preclinical research and general expenses. SL-401 targets the interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R) present on cancer stem cells and tumor bulk, and it is being tested in a wide range of hematologic cancers. The immunotherapy SL-701 is being evaluated in the treatment of adults with a first occurrence of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Alcobra;</p><p>Tel Aviv, Israel</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Alcobra is selling 6.5m shares at $4 each for $26m in gross proceeds. The company's stock price was cut by more than half in October after lead drug candidate metadoxine (MDX) for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) failed in a Phase III clinical trial (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Alcobra-tumbles-on-Phase-III-ADHD-results-for-metadoxine-354315" target="_new">6 October 2014</a>).</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The company's new cash will fund ongoing development programs, including Phase IIb trials for MDX in pediatric ADHD and Fragile X syndrome.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
