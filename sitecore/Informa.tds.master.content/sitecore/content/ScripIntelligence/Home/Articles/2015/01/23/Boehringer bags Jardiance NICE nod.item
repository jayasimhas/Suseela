<p>Boehringer Ingelheim has won NICE's recommendation in draft guidance for its type 2 diabetes drug Jardiance (empagliflozin), but the company, which is third to the UK market, may find gaining market share tough.</p><p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, has recommended Jardiance for use on the NHS in combination with metformin, but only if a sulfonylurea is contraindicated or not tolerated, or the person is at significant risk of hypoglycemia or its consequences. The institute has also recommended Jardiance as part of a triple therapy regimen in combination with metformin, and either a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione. Lastly, NICE has recommended Jardiance in combination with insulin with or without other antidiabetics.</p><p>NICE noted that there were very small differences in costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) between Jardiance and key comparators, which included other SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors. The institute had previously deferred making a decision on Boehringer's drug because the company had not presented these comparisons in its dossier (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NICE-jury-out-on-Boehringers-antidiabetic-Jardiance-353633" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 29 August 2014).</p><p>However, with little differentiation on price, or efficacy, Boehringer is likely to find it tough competing in the UK market. It is the third SGLT-2 inhibitor to gain NICE approval after AstraZeneca's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) and Johnson & Johnson's Invokana (canagliflozin). Datamonitor analyst Rajan Sharma commented, "The class is generally seen as undifferentiated from a clinical perspective by physiciansÂ so launch order will be the key to commercial success, as evidenced by Forxiga leading the UK SGLT-2 inhibitor market."</p><p>Jardiance costs &pound;36.59 for a pack of 28 pills, and an estimated &pound;477.30 per patient per year. Forxiga costs the same, while Invokana costs is &pound;39.20 for 30 100mg tablets and &pound;49.99 for 30 300mg tablets. </p>
