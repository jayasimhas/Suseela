<p>GlaxoSmithKline's novel anti-inflammatory losmapimod has failed to reduce major cardiac adverse events in heart attack patients in a Phase III study that some have said was a bit of a bet. </p><p>An interim review of data from the first part of the LATITUDE-TIMI 60 study in 3,503 patients has given no sign of efficacy for the primary endpoint and so does not support investment in the larger part B of the study as currently designed, GSK said. </p><p>In Part A of the stepwise trial design, 3,503 patients presenting with a heart attack were randomised to receive three months of twice daily oral treatment with either 7.5mg of losmapimod or placebo in addition to standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite measure of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (including time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death, and myocardial infarction, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent coronary artery revascularization).</p><p>Even so, GSK has yet to decide to fold. The interim assessment also revealed an efficacy signal in a sub-population of patients (n=866) classified with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with reductions between 30% and 50% in the pre-specified endpoints of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure, and the composite of the two were observed. However, due to the small number of events (59), this was not significant.</p><p>GSK said it would assess the findings over the next few months to evaluate all options for future development. The full results from Part A of LATITUDE-TIMI 60 will be submitted for presentation at a scientific meeting. </p><p>As a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, losmapimod is practically the only such product in clinical development in heart disease (Array BioPharma has a candidate in Phase II for cardiomyopathy, among other indications), although there are around six similar products in Phase II for a range of other therapy areas, including Alzheimer's, cancer and chronic obstructive coronary disease., </p><p>The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 is associated with the acute inflammation and cellular injury that occurs in the blood vessels and in the heart during and immediately after an acute coronary syndrome, GSK says.</p><p>Analysts at Sagient's BioMedTracker said the results were disappointing but added that "the study was a gamble in any case, since it is not clear whether targeting such inflammation pathways has a benefit in ACS, and the Phase II study only had positive results on some biomarkers". </p><p>Further details of the signal in STEMI patients are needed to determine whether further study for the product is warranted and in the meantime the analysts are lowering their likelihood of approval score by 7% to 40%. </p><p>
