<p>Teva has agreed to pay $512m to settle a class-action lawsuit in which direct purchasing firms asserted Cephalon, which the Israeli company acquired in 2011, paid generic competitors in 2008 more than $200m to keep cheaper versions of the narcolepsy and sleep apnea drug Provigil (modafinil) off the US market.</p><p>The US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania must approve the settlement, which is the largest in US history involving direct purchasers of prescription drugs. </p><p>Teva still faces more lawsuits stemming back to the Provigil deals Cephalon made, which actually involved Teva, along with Mylan and Ranbaxy.</p><p>One of those suits was filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has insisted the so-called reverse payment settlements between innovators and generic firms, also called pay-for-delay deals, cost US consumers $3.5bn per year, or $35bn over a decade, because they end up paying for the more expensive brand-name drugs when the cheaper copycat versions are not available.</p><p>The Generic Pharmaceutical Association, however, has asserted the agreements have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-settlements-saved-Americans-25.5bn-GPhA-says-344815" target="_new">saved US consumers</a> billions of dollars.</p><p>The US Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-Antitrust-applies-in-pay-for-delay-but-gotta-prove-it-344160" target="_new">June 2013</a> declared the pay-for-delay agreements subject to antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>While the justices did not declare the deals presumptively illegal in its ruling in <i>FTC v Actavis</i>, the court said the agreements have the potential for genuine anticompetitive effects because they permit a brand-name drug company to eliminate the risk of competition, maintain a monopoly and share the benefits of the monopoly with its potential competitor. </p><p>The FTC case against Teva goes to trial in June.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
