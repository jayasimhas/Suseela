<p>The results of another poll have shown Americans are fed up with the high prices of prescription drugs in the US &ndash; with 72% calling the costs of their medicines "unreasonable" &ndash; and want certain actions to be taken to rein in what biopharmaceutical makers charge.</p><p>The nonpartisan, nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation reported that while most Americans, 62%, said prescription drugs developed in the past two decades have helped to improve the lives of those that take the medicines, 74% of the responders said biopharmaceutical firms put profits before patients &ndash; demonstrating the industry has a long way to go to improve its image.</p><p>The Aug. 20 Kaiser report follows similar results of a survey the organization released in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Poll-Drug-costs-Americans-top-concern-358014" target="_new">April</a>, in which Americans reported that drug costs remained their number one concern.</p><p>There's already been an ongoing fight in Washington over high drug prices &ndash; triggered last year when a group of lawmakers questioned the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-the-volume-stupid-350860" target="_new">$1,000-per-pill price</a> for Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) &ndash; which is expected to heat up with the 2016 presidential and congressional elections.</p><p>Drug costs are part of Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) Democratic bid for the White House, although he already had been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Drug-price-yellow-signs-market-canaries-or-lemons-355217" target="_new">probing the issue</a> for several years.</p><p>He most recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">took aim</a> at Canadian drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals for significantly hiking the prices of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) and Isuprel (isoprenaline) after acquiring the drugs from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February &ndash; with the medicines' costs jumping from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, respectively.</p><p>Others seeking to take the White House also have taken shots at the biopharmaceutical industry, including Sanders' rival, Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The high prices of some drugs also prompted Princeton economics professor Uwe Reinhardt to declare that biopharmaceutical makers, particularly specialty firms, are "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Economist-Pharmas-Are-Government-Protected-Fragile-Little-Birds-359948" target="_new">fragile little birds</a>" protected by the government, which he said "carefully shields" the companies from the "harsh vagaries of truly free, competitive markets.</p><p>The innovator biopharmaceutical trade groups &ndash; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) &ndash; have tried to counter the criticism against high drug prices by insisting the US needs a health care system that recognizes the value of products, rather than focusing on costs and has blamed insurers and pharmacy benefit managers for not fully covering Americans' medicines. </p><p>But the results of the Kaiser poll would suggest Americans aren't buying PhRMA's and BIO's arguments.</p><p>Of those who responded to the Kaiser survey, 86% said drug manufacturers should be required to disclose how they set their prices, with 81% declaring that by doing so, costs could be kept down.</p><p>Costs of medicines also could be better controlled if the US federal government was permitted to haggle with biopharmaceutical firms to get lower prices on products covered by Medicare, 72% of the responders said, with 83% declaring such negotiations should be taking place.</p><p>Americans also overwhelmingly said makers of expensive medicines for conditions like HCV and cancer should have limits placed on what they can charge for their products in the US, with 76% arguing for such measures.</p><p>Most of those who responded to the Kaiser survey, or 72%, said Americans should be permitted to buy their prescription medicines from Canada and import them into the US &ndash; an argument that has been ongoing for more than a decade on Capitol Hill, backed strongly by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).</p><p>The responders to the survey, however, were nearly evenly split when it came to requiring Americans to pay a higher share of a drug's costs when they choose a pricier version of a medicine.</p><p>Kaiser reported that in most questions, the political affiliation made little difference, with the exception of allowing the government to negotiate on Medicare drugs, which was favored by a somewhat higher share of Democrats than Republicans, 93% versus 74%.</p><p>Robert Zirkelbach, senior vice president of communications at PhRMA, insisted Medicare Part D plans "already negotiate significant discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers resulting in substantial savings." </p><p>He pointed to a report from the Congressional Budget Office, which conducts nonpartisan analyses for Congress, that said proposals for Medicare to negotiate prices "would have little, if any, effect on prices" because "private drug plans are already negotiating drug prices."</p><p>Zirkelbach argued that it's not drug prices but the costs of disease that threatens the sustainability of the US health care system.</p><p>"Without new medicines to treat and cure disease, costs will go up even more," he told <i>Scrip </i>in a statement. "Alzheimer's alone will bankrupt the health care system unless new medicines are developed that can prevent or delay the onset of disease."</p><p>"Patients all over the world are living longer, healthier and more productive lives thanks to innovative medicines," Zirkelbach said.</p><p>BIO said the Kaiser report was "another example of narrowly focusing the debate on the value of medicine on one aspect &ndash; cost &ndash; while ignoring the benefits these medicines bring to patients and our healthcare system."</p><p>"As the conversation continues regarding the best path forward to improve healthcare in America, we must avoid a short-sighted approach that all too often refuses to recognize the tremendous value of biopharmaceutical innovation," the trade group insisted in a statement to <i>Scrip</i>. "We must recognize the long-term value of specialty medicines to cure disease, prevent suffering and reduce healthcare costs. Patients are counting on us."</p><p>BIO also argued that it's "time to rethink health insurance coverage and payment in order to keep pace with innovative treatment advances and recognize the long-term value of these medicines." </p><p>"The insurance industry's inherently discriminatory practices work against patients in need of these breakthrough medicines," the biotech group asserted. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
