<p>After several months of discussion and a series of hearings, roundtables and "listening sessions" with various stakeholders and experts, lawmakers are on the verge of revealing bipartisan legislation aimed at finding new and successful ways to accelerate the nation's discovery, development and delivery processes for new medicines.</p><p>The so-called 21st Century Cures Initiative, which initially was launched this past May, is expected to impose certain reforms on the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Time-to-go-big-on-cures-innovation-lawmakers-declare-351611" target="_new">5 May 2014</a>).</p><p>The initiative is being led by Representatives Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, and Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), a member of the panel. </p><p>The lawmakers have vowed to get their legislation through the House and Senate and to President Barack Obama by the end of the year.</p><p>"But that's a tall task," acknowledged Dr Francis Collins, director of the NIH.</p><p>While Representative Upton is "sympathetic to the idea of providing more resources" to the NIH and the FDA, the House E&C Committee is an authorization panel, which does not have the ability to determine funding, Dr Collins pointed out during a "fireside" chat at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. </p><p>Indeed, funding federal agencies is handled by the respective House and Senate appropriations committees &ndash; leaving some to wonder if the 21st Century Cures legislation will simply be more unfunded mandates, in which the FDA and the NIH are given more responsibilities, but no way to cover the costs, therefore, squeezing their budgets even tighter (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-spending-could-be-tightened-under-Republicans-354942" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The former Senate appropriations chair, Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat), had skin in the game, because she represents Maryland, which houses the FDA and the NIH, many of whose employees are likely constituents of the lawmaker (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-budgeting-Is-it-madness-NIH-chief-senator-explain-350253" target="_new">26 February 2014</a>).</p><p>Now, though, the Senate and the House have new appropriation committee leaders, "so it's a whole new game," Dr Collins said. </p><p>While there's been much disagreement in recent years among Democrats and Republicans, one area in which most lawmakers agree is sustaining US biomedical research, Dr Collins insisted, although he acknowledged his agency has been struggling for the past decade under a flat budget and has been confronting the spending cuts Congress imposed under sequestration &ndash; something the NIH chief said has kept him up at nights (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-chief-laments-demise-of-US-biomedical-edge-356149" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-chief-cranks-it-up-with-captains-of-industry-353164" target="_new">04 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Nonetheless, Representatives Upton and DeGette said they want to close the gap between the science of medicine and the regulations that impact the volume and fate of new therapies. </p><p>"Our legislation will modernize all of these categories, removing outdated hurdles that can prevent innovation from flourishing or from fleeing the United States," the two lawmakers wrote in a 13 January op-ed posted on <i>CNN's</i> news website, giving a peek into some of what they plan to include in their bill.</p><p>They provided no details on how they plan to pay for their proposals, which they said includes investing in the future of science.</p><p>Representatives Upton and DeGette said they want to modernize clinical trials to streamline the approval of drugs and devices &ndash; insisting the "old approach" of automatically applying a therapy to a broad group of patients is "no longer the best path forward, particularly for those diseases for which we do not have a treatment or cure."</p><p>The two lawmakers said their bill would seek to better integrate the patient perspective into the regulatory process &ndash; building on the FDA's Patient-Focused Drug Development program.</p><p>They said their legislation also would promote better access to and sharing of information, such as genomic and other clinical data, to foster more collaboration among researchers &ndash; something also called for by a panel from the Institute of Medicine (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-chief-laments-demise-of-US-biomedical-edge-356149" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Representatives Upton and DeGette said their bill would seek to better incentivize new drugs and devices for unmet medical needs by streamlining the premarket process, while establishing mechanisms to better capture real-world evidence post-market. </p><p>"We can also examine incentives, such as exclusivity or simplifying the reimbursement process, to produce drugs and devices for diseases with unmet needs," the lawmakers said.</p><p>While Dr Collins said he believes the two lawmakers are "sincere" about "trying to do something that will help," he said what would benefit his agency the most and accelerate the pace of R&D "would be to turn around the gradual budget slide, which is keeping us from being able of doing all of the things that our scientific community is capable."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
