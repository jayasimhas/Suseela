<p>Two segments in the Indian industry &ndash; bulk drugs and medical devices &ndash; are expected to receive significant government backing as part of efforts to stem the flow of imports. </p><p>In the case of the bulk drugs, the high dependence on Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) imports and the potentially crippling effect this could have on India's own medicines security should there be any realignment in Indo-China relations has put the spotlight on the segment. </p><p>Sudhansh Pant, joint secretary at India's department of pharmaceuticals, referred to how imports from ''a particular part of the world'' were dominating in the import basket in the segment and that even from a ''strategic point of view for the country'' the government was looking at ways and means to encourage and incentivise bulk drug production in the country.</p><p>''Maybe in the form of a package of incentives or also linked to the Make in India campaign which is to encourage domestic manufacturing, '' Mr Pant said at BioAsia 2015 in Hyderabad. </p><p>The ''Make in India'' campaign seeks to project the country as a manufacturing hub of choice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised an environment of trust and confidence for investors under that effort.</p><p>A white paper by the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association (IDMA) referred to how imports of APIs and advanced intermediates has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over the past decade from $800m in 2004 to about $3.4bn currently, with China estimated to contribute around 58% of these imports by value <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Chinese-API-imports-eclipse-Indian-plants-354950%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 10 November 2014)</a>. </p><p>The IDMA paper also highlighted the closure of more than 10 fermentation API units in India including those for gentamycin, pravastatin, cyclosporin A, cephalosporin C, bleomycin and vitamin B12 between the early 1960s to the late 90s, in the backdrop of the surge in Chinese imports over the years.</p><p>Indian firms have long cautioned that any ''deterioration'' in the relationship with India's Asian neighbour could potentially lead to ''severe'' shortages in the supply of essential medicine and that China could easily raise prices of some the APIs where it enjoys a monopoly.</p><h2>devices</h2><p>In the area of devices, Mr Pant referred to how domestic production was largely focused on low end devices such as syringes and catheters, with a 70-80% dependence on imports for high tech devices.</p><p>''Very soon some recommendations are expected which will kick-start the domestic medical devices industry,'' he added, but gave no specifics.</p><p>A committee in the government is also working towards developing a potential national list of essential devices, along the lines of the national list of essential medicines (NLEM) in the drugs segment. Drugs on India's NLEM are under price control.</p><p>India recently announced its intent to amend the Drugs And Cosmetics Act 1940 and upgrade and introduce provisions for trials and regulations of medical devices <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-set-for-wide-ranging-policy-review-in-2015-355926%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 5 January 2015)</a>. The Department of Health and Family Welfare proposes to introduce the Drug and Cosmetics (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Budget Session (due this month) of the Parliament. </p><p>A new Medical Devices Technical Advisory Board chaired by the Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research to advise the central and state governments on technical matters pertaining to medical devices, has also been proposed. The bill also incorporates a separate chapter to regulate the import, manufacture, sale and distribution of medical devices.</p><p>India has also recently eased norms in the medical devices sector permitting foreign direct investment up to 100% under the automatic route, though some local firms have urged the government to ensure that foreign firms don't merely use this as opportunity to set up local arms to facilitate imports.</p>
