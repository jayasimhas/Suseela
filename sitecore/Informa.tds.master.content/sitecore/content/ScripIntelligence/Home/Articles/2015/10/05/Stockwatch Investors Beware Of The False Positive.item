<p>On the cusp of third-quarter earnings season and after nine weeks of an often savage stock market sell-off, the market bounced last week. With algorithmic trading and dark pools influencing the volume and prices of shares traded in the more opaque portions of the stock market, a three-day market bounce might be as believable as the official figures on the growth of the Chinese economy. </p><p>Some of last week's announcements from the sector &ndash; on which future expectations are supposed to be based &ndash; suggest that company announcements might have had a different effect on share prices had their true meanings been known.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Can-Verastem-Recover-After-Failure-360710" target="_new">Verastem, Inc. announced the failure</a> of its lead focal adhesion kinase inhibitor of cancer stem cells, VS-6063 (defactinib), at the fourth DSMB review in the COMMAND registration-directed study in 308 mesothelioma patients. Downgrades from the analysts at Jefferies and Mizuho followed with the latter describing the result as 'a severe blow' to the company. Less than two months ago, however, the analysts at Mizuho had re-iterated their 'buy' recommendation heading into the interim analysis, while in May the analysts at Jefferies had suggested that 'futility, which would result in early termination of the trial' had a probability that 'was very low'. Never having invested in Verastem, I had not reviewed the previous data that had brought Verastem to the fourth interim analysis of whatever is meant by a registration-directed study. Generalist and other investors may have relied on summaries by the company of VS-6063's clinical activity. In the future it is to be hoped that statements like 'interesting signs of clinical activity' (for VS-6063 in ovarian cancer), and an 'encouraging early signal in mesothelioma' (from Verastem's September's presentation following the World Conference on Lung Cancer) will be consigned as euphemisms for small sample statistical noise that implies no clinical activity and have in Verastem's case, resulted in a 83% loss in value. </p><p><p>The 'positive' superlative as applied to clinical trial results has recently been transformed from adjective to oxymoron. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/XenoPort-Sinks-On-Psoriasis-Drug-Safety-No-Big-Gain-For-Fumarates-360463" target="_new">XenoPort, Inc's recent 'positive' announcement</a> of its Phase II study of XP23829 in psoriasis was followed last week by the 'retirement' of its CEO, founder and director ('retirement' having more than one meaning), the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/XenoPort-Puts-A-Brave-Face-On-Failure-360802" target="_new">halt of further development of XP23829</a> and a work force reduction. There was also an inverse correlation between XenoPort's announcements and its share price since the 'positive' clinical trial result was met with a 28% fall in its share price whereas last week's dropping of XP23829 was followed by a 24% rise. </p><p><p>As the week drew to a close Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. gave a master class on announcement revision. Amicus saw its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amicus-to-seek-quicker-market-paths-for-Fabry-drug-357400" target="_new">share price soar over 40%</a> earlier in the summer when it announced that positive feedback from the FDA had encouraged it to file an NDA before the end of the year for its lead chaperone drug migalastat for Fabry disease. However, the Amicus share price dropped by more than 50% last Friday when it announced a surprise delay to the NDA submission after additional information was requested by the FDA and the possibility that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Misreading-FDA-Meeting-Minutes-Reality-Sinks-Amicus-360807" target="_new">accelerated approval may also be at risk</a>. As the analysts from JP Morgan put it, there were 'questions of management credibility'. Quite. I remember seeing the company last summer and left the meeting still feeling that the rhetoric on a more permissive FDA which 'would evaluate the totality of the data' (a euphemism for at least one failed study) was at odds with the exit of its partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc, and the share price plummet in the previous year when the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amicus-hit-hard-on-FDA-advice-for-more-migalastat-work-before-NDA-344159" target="_new">FDA advised Amicus to complete its Phase III</a> study before submitting its NDA. </p><p><p>Likewise, biosimilar company and recent IPO Coherus BioSciences, Inc. announced that CHS-1701 &ndash; its biosimilar version of Amgen, Inc's <i>Neulasta</i> (pegfilgrastim) &ndash; met the primary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint of absolute neutrophil count. However the announcement also went on to explain that 'the area under the curve portion of the PK (pharmacokinetic) results remains under review'. A glance at the <a href="http://media.globenewswire.com/cache/33333/file/37780.pdf" target="_new">graph provided with the announcement</a> would suggest that one of the two PK profiles of CHS-1701 was quite different from the other, let alone those of <i>Neulasta</i>. In its announcement Coherus discussed its sharing of the data with the FDA, which had not recommended a repeat of the study. Coherus was at pains to point out that the FDA indicated 'the study may support our BLA as their review will be predicated on the totality of the evidence'. A number of interpretations of this statement come to mind. Firstly, that the Office of Generic Drugs may have a much more liberal policy on reproducibility than the rest of the FDA, or secondly, that the Coherus staff at the meeting, like those of Amicus, may have either been out of the room or just not listening when the FDA critiqued the PK profiles of CHS-1701. Nevertheless, the soothing 'positive top-line results' words from the analysts at JP Morgan ensured that the share price of its client Coherus finished the day up just over 10%.</p><p><p>If the recovery in the life science sector is partly based on the use by companies and their analysts of adjectives like 'positive', 'encouraging' and 'interesting', when they turn out to be anything but, we should probably not expect the bounce from last week to be anything other than temporary.</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Amgen.</p><p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest is the investment adviser for the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for four life science</i>&ndash;<i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p>
