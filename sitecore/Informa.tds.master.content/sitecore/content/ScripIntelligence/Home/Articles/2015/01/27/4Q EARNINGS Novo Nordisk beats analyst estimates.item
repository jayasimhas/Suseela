<p>Novo Nordisk has posted better than expected results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2014.</p><p>The company's sales rose by 8% year-on-year, largely thanks to Victoza (liraglutide) and Levemir (insulin detemir). Analysts had predicted sales of DKK88bn (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-AbbVie-AZ-Gilead-GSK-Lilly-Merck-Novo-Nordisk-and-Sanofi-356426" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 28 January 2015), but Novo managed to bring in revenues of DKK88.8bn ($13.5bn). Sales of Victoza rose 16% bringing in DKK13.4bn, while Levemir sales rose 23% to DKK14.2bn. </p><p>Meanwhile, analysts had predicted fourth-quarter earnings per share of DKK2.46, which the Danish company managed to beat, posting 4Q EPS of DKK2.51. EPS for the full year increased 8% to DKK10.07.</p><p>Operating profits were up 13% for the full year to DKK34.5bn, while net profits rose 5% to DKK26.5bn.</p><p>As a result, the company has maintained its 2015 guidance estimates. It expects sales to grow 6-9% in 2015, which includes modest contributions for newly launched products Saxenda (liraglutide) and Xultrophy (insulin degludec/liraglutide). </p><p>However, despite a forecast operating profit growth of 10% the company has said it expects net financial losses of DKK5bn. This, it said, "reflects losses associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts, particularly following the appreciation of the US dollar versus the Danish krone compared to the average prevailing exchange rates in 2014."</p><p>Novo also expects US rebates to cut into profits in 2015. A recent analysis of data generated through <i>Scrip</i>'s annual number crunch of the pharmaceutical industry, the <a href="http://www.scrip100.com" target="_new">Scrip 100</a>, flagged up the same trend (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Scrip-100-Novo-Nordisks-US-sales-growth-comes-at-a-price-356409" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 27 January 2015).</p><p>Meanwhile, the company plans to pay dividends of DKK5 per share, and has also laid out plans for a DKK15bn share buyback program.</p><p>President and CEO Lars Rebien SÃ¸rensen said that the company was pleased with its financial performance in what has been "a more challenging year than usual." He added, "2015 will be an important year for us with the first launches of Saxenda and Xultophy as well as significant results from our late-stage development portfolio."</p>
