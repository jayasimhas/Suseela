<p>The European Medicines Agency has revoked eight class waivers for pediatric investigation plans (PIPs) in a bid to encourage companies to develop more new medicines for use in children. The agency has also confirmed nine class waivers on its current list of class waivers, which means there continues to be no requirement for PIPs for medicines for treating these diseases, and it has updated 15 class waivers on the list.</p><p>The changes to the class waiver list are the most extensive revisions that the EMA has made to the list, to date. The revoked and revised class waivers will come into effect in 2018. The EMA said that the revised list aims to better balance the need to support the development of medicines in children while avoiding exposing children to unnecessary studies.</p><p>Class waivers have been revoked for all medicines for the treatment of: </p><ul><li>liver and intrahepatic bile duct carcinoma; </li><li>kidney and renal pelvis carcinoma; </li><li>coronary atherosclerosis, peripheral atherosclerosis, vascular dementia and vascular cognitive disorder/impairment; </li><li>Parkinson's disease (non-juvenile);</li><li>Huntington chorea (a neurodegenerative genetic disorder); and </li><li>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. </li></ul><p>The EMA explained that the waivers have been revoked because new information, which has become available since the class waivers were initially granted, shows that these diseases can also occur in children.</p><p>The review of the class waiver list was the result of a long process of scientific scrutiny, Dr Jordi Llinares, head of product development scientific support at the EMA, said at a July 23 press briefing. "I am very reassured that the decision [on the revised list] is very well justified and robust" as it involved not only strict scientific scrutiny but also collaboration and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, Dr Llinares said.</p><p>The nine class waivers on the current list that have been confirmed are: </p><ul><li>the class of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma modulators, including dual and multiple PPAR modulator medicinal products (eg, thiazolidinediones, glitazars, triple modulators) for treatment of type II diabetes mellitus;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of primary and secondary osteoarthrosis;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of organic amnestic syndrome (excluding amnestic syndrome caused by alcohol and other psychoactive substances);</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular oedema;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of climacteric symptoms associated with decreased oestrogen levels, as occurring at menopause;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of Alzheimer's disease;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of erectile dysfunction;</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (excluding chronic lung diseases associated with long-term airflow limitation, such as asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, primary cilia dyskinesia, obstructive lung disease related to graft-versus-host disease after [bone-marrow] transplantation); and</li><li>all classes of medicinal products for treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.</li></ul><p>With regard to the 15 class waivers that have been revised, the EMA explained that the changes take into account the characteristics of the medicines as well as of the diseases. Where scientifically relevant, the agency has granted a waiver for a defined group of conditions. For example, the class waiver previously granted to medicines for the treatment of primary gout now states that it applies to class of Colchicum alkaloids (colchicine and its derivatives) medicinal products for the treatment of primary gout. </p><p>Most of the revised waivers relate to oncology. The revision has resulted in the waivers now being restricted to existing classes of medicinal products based on scientific data, which shows that these classes of medicines are either potentially not effective in children or that they offer no significant benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients, said Koenraad Norga, vice-chair of the EMA's pediatric committee.</p><p>The changes to the class waiver list were adopted by the EMA's pediatrics committee (PDCO) at its meeting on 17 July. The EMA explained that the PDCO's opinion will be further transformed into an EMA decision that will come into effect in 2018. This means that from 2018, all applications for new medicines or variation of marketing authorization will be validated against the EMA's revised class waiver decision. Companies developing medicines that are not covered by the revised list of class waivers will have to submit a PIP or seek a product-specific waiver.</p><p>The EMA said that the changes mean that more medicines will be reviewed by the agency for potential development for use in children.</p><p>The PDCO will continue to revise the class waiver list as more information on medicines and diseases becomes available. Previous revisions included the revocation of two class waivers in 2008 and in 2009.</p><p>According to the PDCO, the previous class waiver list had resulted in "insufficient opportunities" for the agency to consider the potential benefits of some new medicines for children. For example, between 2012 and 2014, out of 26 new anti-cancer medicines that were authorized for use in adults, only 14 had a development plan for use in children.</p><p>The PDCO also noticed that new medicines with "unprecedented benefits in terms of efficacy in life-threatening diseases" were being developed and proposed for adults only. "These new medicines presented completely novel pharmacological properties, and their medical plausibility in the range of conditions relevant for the pediatric population could not be reviewed [due to the presence of class waivers]," the EMA said. </p><p>These problems also became obvious to pediatric patient representatives and academic stakeholders, who repeatedly raised the issue that a number of medicinal products for which class waivers had been granted may likely have significant benefit for children. "The situation led to increasing concerns about how to serve public health objectives in pediatric populations with a high burden of disease," the EMA said.</p><p>This story has also been published in<i> Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>.
