<p> Eisai has won its appeal against NHS England's decision to remove the company's breast cancer drug, Halaven, from the Cancer Drugs Fund. The appeal was largely based on the new &quot;heavily flawed&quot; evaluation process, which is unfit for purpose, said Gary Hendler, President and CEO, Eisai EMEA, and President, Eisai Oncology Global Business Unit. </p> <p> Had the company's appeal failed, the drug would have been delisted on 12 March. Eisai may have won the battle but it has not necessarily won the war. Despite the successful appeal, the final decision on whether to keep Halaven on the list is not due for another week. </p> <p> The decision to uphold the appeal could be good news for companies that rely on the fund to get their drugs to patients, as it highlights the process's flaws and the need for a rethink. Mr Hendler hopes that the appeal will help the fund learn from its mistakes. </p> <p> The Cancer Drugs Fund was created to provide funding for innovative oncology medicines rejected by NICE, England's Health technology appraisal institute. It was only intended as a stop gap until a new system was in place to address the poor uptake of cancer drugs in the UK. However, no such system has yet been devised and the financial burden of the fund is becoming increasingly heavy. The fund overspent in both 2013 and 2014. </p> <p> In response to the problem, NHS England added a controversial cost-effectiveness assessment on top of the clinical benefit assessment. It was designed to eliminate products from the fund to make it more sustainable, and it proved very unpopular with industry. In January, 12 drugs, including Halaven, were threatened with delisting from the fund after undergoing the new assessment. </p> <p> Eisai's appeal was largely based on problems with the evaluation process. One point hinged on the so called &quot;prioritization tool&quot; used to score the drug according to its cost and clinical benefit. If a drug scores under three, the drug is delisted, and if it scores three or more the company may be invited to renegotiate the price, or the product may be left as it is on the list. That tool has never been validated by the medical or HTA community, or by academia, says Mr Hendler. He also complains that the rating of three to determine whether a drug is in or out was never outlined in proposals and came as a surprise to the company. &quot;It's a completely arbitrary number, plucked out of thin air,&quot; he says. </p> <p> Halaven scored below three for its indication as a third line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This suggests that the drug has an insufficient clinical benefit, despite the fact that in pivotal Phase III trials, Halaven demonstrated survival benefit over conventional chemotherapies for advanced breast cancer. &quot;That can't be right, and that was obviously another point in our appeal.&quot; The appeals panel agreed and said the scoring was inconsistent with regulatory approval. </p> <p> Eisai also complains that the decision not to even evaluate Halaven's other indication as a second line treatment was unfair and unreasonable. The scoring for clinical benefit is partly affected by how the data are published; if they are published as an abstract rather than in a publication, the product is penalized. At the time of the evaluation, the data for Halaven's second indication had only been published as an abstract. Nevertheless, full data were due to come out in the Journal of Oncology very close to the date of the evaluation. The firm had sent a copy of the publication to the evaluators and the journal confirmed that publication would happen soon. This was not enough, and the panel declined to score the drug. Happily, by the time the appeal came around, the data had been published. &quot;Think how pedantic that is and how it affects women getting their drugs just because of a publication deadline. It's not right,&quot; said Mr Hendler. </p> <p> Eisai has not had to renegotiate on price, and Mr Hendler is adamant that the issues surrounding access to Halaven have never been about price. He points out that the drug is one of the most affordable on the Fund. It costs &pound;2,599 for a three week cycle. Its price was based on the launch price of Taxotere (docetaxel), which is now 15 years old. &quot;This was not about price. It was about the process and the fact that they valued our clinical benefit inappropriately,&quot; he said. </p> <p> The Cancer Drugs Fund will run until 2016 with an increased budget of &pound;340m. A taskforce, which includes industry, patient groups, clinicians and charities, is trying to think up a better way of appraising and commissioning cancer drugs. </p>
