<p><p>Eli Lilly & Co. and Boehringer Ingelheim launched <i>Abasaglar</i> (insulin glargine), previously called <i>Abasria</i>, a biosimilar version of Sanofi's best-selling product <i>Lantus</i> (insulin glargine) in its first two major European markets, the UK and Germany, at the end of August, hoping to grab some of the &euro;6.4bn ($7.2bn) in global sales that Lantus generated last year.</p><p><p>In the UK, the net pharmacy price of Abasaglar is at a 15% discount to Lantus. The biosimilar is priced at &pound;35.28 ($54) for five 3 ml cartridges (100 units/ml) while Lantus is priced at &pound;41.50 for 5 cartridges. In Germany, the pharmacy list price for 10 cartridges of Abasaglar is around &euro;20 ($22) below the price of Lantus.</p><p><p>Still, the actual price paid is subject to individual rebate contracts agreed between health insurers and the manufacturers, and Abasaglar is expected to be discounted further. These contracts are not made publicly available. Boehringer Ingelheim is also pursuing the development of a number of other biosimilar products based on monoclonal antibodies marketed by originators.</p><p><p>Abasaglar is the latest of a number of biosimilars to be launched in Europe by various drug makers that now include biosimilar versions of human growth hormone, filgrastim and, more recently, the TNF-inhibitor infliximab (Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s <i>Remicade</i>). Biosimilar infliximab is marketed in Europe by Hospira Inc. and Celltrion Inc. and their distributors.</p><p><p>Abasaglar completes a suite of diabetes products being co-promoted by the Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim alliance in Europe that previously lacked a long-acting insulin analog. The companies will now compete with similarly broad portfolios of diabetes therapies marketed by rivals such as Sanofi and Novo Nordisk AS. </p><p><p>Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim said the launch of their biosimilar insulin glargine means diabetic patients could be offered products from the duo at many more steps along their diabetes journey.</p><p><p>Abasaglar has also been launched in Lithuania, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the companies confirmed. The product was approved by the European Commission in September 2014 following CHMP clearance in June 2014.</p><p><p>But differences in the timing of patent expiries for Lantus in different European countries means that introduction of Abasaglar has been staggered. It was also approved earlier this year for marketing in Japan.</p><p><p>In the US, the introduction of a biosimilar version of Lantus by Lilly and its partner is expected in 2016, but will depend on the outcome of an ongoing patent dispute. </p><p><p>Sanofi said earlier this year it was expecting launches of biosimilar competitors to Lantus in the second half of 2015. Lantus sales were up 6.3% at &euro;230m ($251m) in Western Europe in the second quarter of 2015.</p><p><p>Although still early days, Lilly said customers were responding positively to having another treatment option. In the UK, the US company has developed tools to help health care professionals understand biosimilars, including a video and slide kit.</p><p><h2>Fruits Of 2011 Alliance</h2><p><p>Boehringer Ingelheim and Lilly are co-promoting Abasaglar and several oral diabetes therapies in 17 countries as part of a diabetes alliance set up by the two companies in January 2011. In other countries, the two are exclusively commercializing the products they brought to the alliance.</p><p><p>The pact was one of the largest risk-sharing collaborations to be entered into when signed in 2011, with Lilly gaining access to two oral drugs, the DPP4 inhibitor linagliptin and the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin, while Boehringer Ingelheim entered a new therapeutic area with the help of Lilly, which has a long history in marketing diabetes therapies.</p><p><p>Sanofi has not been idle, having launched the Lantus follow-on product <i>Toujeo</i> (insulin glargine) in the UK in August, at the same price per day as Lantus. The French multinational hopes it can switch patients from Lantus to Toujeo, thereby limiting the revenue lost to biosimilars, though some analysts and investors are skeptical the company will be able to limit the impact significantly. Other companies developing an insulin glargine biosimilar include Merck & Co. Inc. in its collaboration with Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd., that have a version in late-stage Phase III clinical studies.</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in 'The Pink Sheet' DAILY.
