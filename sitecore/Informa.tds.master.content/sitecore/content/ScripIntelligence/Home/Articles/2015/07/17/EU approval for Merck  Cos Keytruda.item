<p>The European Commission has approved Merck & Co's anti-PD1 immune checkpoint therapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for the treatment of advanced melanoma in adults.</p><p>Keytruda was first launched last October in the US and has additionally been filed there for use in EGFR mutation-negative and ALK rearrangement-negative NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-containing chemotherapy (the PDUFA date is set for 2 October 2015). It received its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EUs-CHMP-green-lights-three-immune-oncology-drugs-358565" target="_new">CHMP positive opinion</a> in May, together with Opdivo in NSCLC.</p><p>The EU approval is based on data from the KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002 and KEYNOTE-006 studies which evaluated it across treatment lines, prognostic factors, tumor characteristics, and BRAF mutational status in advanced melanoma. </p><p>The EU nod comes just a day after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BMSs-Opdivo-gets-second-EU-approval-359551" target="_new">approved by the EC in a second indication</a>, squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo received its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BMS-secures-1st-European-approval-for-PD-1-drug-Opdivo-cleared-for-melanoma-359064" target="_new">EU melanoma approval</a> in both first-line and previously treated advanced patients, last month, when it became the first PD-1 inhibitor approved in Europe for any cancer indication.</p><p>The two products are integral to the new immunological front in the war on cancer. The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are expected not only to expand their range of indications beyond melanoma and NSCLC to a wide variety of cancers, but they are also expected to form the backbone of most future IO drug combinations. Thanks to their efficacy and relatively manageable toxicity they are deemed an excellent choice to pair with other IO drugs as well as other targeted cancer therapies.
