<p>Greater use of prescription drugs by Medicaid beneficiaries with non-communicable diseases, like diabetes, hypertension and asthma, can result in reduced spending for the program in overall medical costs, such as hospitalizations, economic researchers reported on Sept. 8 in the Washington public policy journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p>The information from the study could help policymakers make better decisions when they evaluate whether to make changes to prescription drug benefits, such as increasing cost-sharing or restricting formularies, for the nearly 70 million Medicaid beneficiaries, lead author Christopher Roebuck, president and CEO of Hunt Valley, MD-based RxEconomics, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"Without complete knowledge of the economic benefits of prescription drug use, policy makers cannot make informed decisions about how to efficiently allocate scarce health care dollars," Roebuck and his co-authors said in the article, <i>Increased Use Of Prescription Drugs Reduces Medical Costs In Medicaid Populations</i>.</p><p>Federal and state spending on Medicaid, which totaled $449bn in 2013, has been a "constant source of fiscal concern," they said.</p><p>And with Medicaid directors having more latitude about patient cost-sharing, they may choose to raise co-pays on prescription drugs as a way to shore up budget shortfalls in the program, Roebuck said in an interview.</p><p>While that may bring in more money for Medicaid, "we know that when you raise co-pays that leads to a reduction in prescription drug use," he said. "Medicaid directors need to know that decrease in prescription drug use may lead to increases in medical costs. This paper gives them an idea of what they might expect from decreases or increases of prescription drug use." </p><p>Using detailed eligibility information and claims data on the use of inpatient and outpatient services and prescription drugs for 1.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries in 11 states with eight non-communicable diseases &ndash; hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, seizure disorder and gastroesophageal reflux disease &ndash; for 2008 through 2010, Roebuck and his colleagues discovered that a 1% increase in overall prescription drug use was associated with decreases in total non-drug Medicaid costs by 0.108% for blind or disabled adults, 0.167% for other adults and 0.041% for children. </p><p>They noted the combined inpatient and outpatient spending from increased drug use in Medicaid were similar to an estimate for Medicare by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which determined in 2012 that a 1% increase in drug use results in a 0.20% reduction in spending on other types of medical care.</p><p>The CBO, which provides nonpartisan analyses and budget estimates to Congress, left the door open for additional work to be done to determine if the magnitude of offsets found in Medicare could be similar for other programs, like Medicaid and the Veterans Administration, Roebuck said.</p><p>He noted the published literature examining drug use by Medicaid beneficiaries was sparse and what existed was old. </p><p>So, Roebuck said, "I wanted to fill that void, and so my colleagues and I set off to do that."</p><p>"We believe that the estimates presented in this article will be of critical use in evaluating Medicaid policies that affect prescription drug use," the co-authors insisted.</p><p>While Roebuck acknowledged some members of Congress may turn up their noses to the results of his study &ndash; thinking the numbers are small &ndash; he emphasized that when multiplying the 0.108%, 0.167% 0.041% by the high numbers of beneficiaries using the medicines, the overall reductions in medical care costs could be "very substantial."</p><p>Roebuck said he was interested in conducting a follow-up study examining the impacts of greater use of the newer drugs available to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) on overall medical costs. </p><p>"It's a hot topic and an important one," he said.</p><p>But Roebuck noted that because Medicaid claims data are still relatively thin for the HCV drugs like AbbVie's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">Viekira Pak</a> (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir) and Gilead Sciences' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">Harvoni</a> (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir), it may be another year or 18 months until such a study could be started. </p><p>He said he'd also like to eventually pursue an evaluation of the impact to the overall medical care costs from the use of another class of newly approved medicines that have grabbed the attention of payers and policymakers alike: the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors, which are used to bring low-density lipoprotein cholesterol under control in high-risk patients when statins are not enough.</p><p>So far, the FDA has approved two PCSK9s: Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab) and Amgen's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">Repatha</a> (evolocumab).</p><p>Before the drugs were approved, private payers, like <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">CVS</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Innovative-Value-Based-Pricing-Strategies-Biopharmas-Savior-360173" target="_new">Express Scripts</a>, expressed concerns the PCSK9s could break the U.S. health care system's bank if the FDA expands the medicines' labeling for use in broader populations.</p><p>"This is obviously another hot topic," Roebuck said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
