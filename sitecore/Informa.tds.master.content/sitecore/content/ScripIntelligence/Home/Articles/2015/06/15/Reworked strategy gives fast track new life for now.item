<p>For the second time in one week, the House on 18 June passed the fast-track bill that President Barack Obama has sought to give him trade promotion authority (TPA), allowing him to send negotiated trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with no ability for lawmakers to amend or filibuster the agreements.</p><p>The TPA bill barely squeaked by in a 218-208 vote, with 28 Democrats jumping on board &ndash; joining a majority of Republicans in the House.</p><p>The legislation now returns to the Senate, which initially adopted it, but now its path forward in that chamber also may be in doubt.</p><p>The bill actually got stuck in the House last week, but was revived under a strategy to separate it from another measure, known as trade adjustment assistance (TAA), a provision intended to provide US workers adversely affected by trade deals with job training, career counseling, wage supplements and other support.</p><p>Last week, President Obama suffered a major blow when the top Democrat in the House, Representative Nancy Pelosi (California), refused to back his trade agenda &ndash; declaring the fast-track bill was moving too fast and needed to be slowed down because of concerns over what was being included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement, a pact between Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand and the US, which has been in negotiations since 2009. </p><p>In trying to upend the TPA legislation, Ms Pelosi led a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Caution-biopharma-wacky-Washington-wild-ride-ahead-358932" target="_new">vote against the TAA</a>, a measure she actually supported but was willing to see go down to stop the fast-track bill from going forward.</p><p>When the Senate initially voted on the TPA, it had linked TAA to the measure, so the package had to be passed together as one package by the House.</p><p>But House Speaker John Boehner (Republican-Ohio) used a procedural measure to get around the mess and brought the TPA bill back up for a separate vote without the TAA on 18 June &ndash; all with the blessing of President Obama.</p><p>But several Democrats in the Senate said they would not support the TPA without the TAA attached &ndash; fearing the latter would be set aside completely after the former was adopted &ndash; so the fast-track bill could again go down.</p><p>"The president has been clear that he wants both TPA and TAA at his desk for his signature as soon as possible. The only strategy that we support moving through Congress is one that includes both of those pieces getting to his desk for his signature," said Eric Schultz, White House principal deputy press secretary.</p><p>But Mr Schultz would not say whether President Obama would sign TPA before TAA gets done. </p><p>He insisted Mr Obama had "good, constructive conversations" on 17 June with House and Senate Democrats, where he again urged support for the TPA.</p><p>"We feel confident that the procedural snafus that we&rsquo;ve all experienced over the past few weeks are in the process of getting untangled," Mr Schultz told reporters on 18 June.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
