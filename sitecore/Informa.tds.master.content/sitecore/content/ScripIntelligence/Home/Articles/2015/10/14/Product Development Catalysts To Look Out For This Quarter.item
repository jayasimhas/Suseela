<p>The last quarter of this year will see major catalyst events for around 20 drugs, latest research from Sagient's BioMedTracker shows. Big pharma companies expecting data read-outs or regulatory action before Christmas include both Mercks, AstraZeneca and AbbVie, while advances are expected for three treatments for pancreatic cancer and two novel antibiotics, among others. </p><p>Here <i>Scrip</i> takes a look of a few of the more interesting events still likely to hit by the year end. </p><h2>Way Crystal Clear for AstraZeneca Gout Therapy?</h2><p>Most imminently, the FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee will review AstraZeneca's <b>lesinurad</b> on Oct. 23, seeking approval for the chronic treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Lesinurad is the first-in-class oral non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that inhibits the URAT1 transporter-mediated uptake of uric acid, leading to more excretion of uric acid in the urine and lower blood levels, but its clinical data have been mixed. </p><p>The NDA filing is based on the Phase III CLEAR 1, CLEAR 2, and CRYSTAL studies. Lesinurad was tested at the 200 and 400 mg dose levels, but because of renal-related adverse events associated with the 400 mg dose, AstraZeneca is applying for approval for the 200 mg dose alone. </p><p>In CLEAR 1 and CLEAR 2, lesinurad was evaluated in combination with allopurinol in symptomatic gout patients not achieving target serum urate (sUA) levels on their current allopurinol dose. In both trials, Lesinurad 200 mg in combination with allopurinol met the primary endpoint with a significant higher proportion of patients reaching the target sUA goal of <6.0 mg/dl="" at="" month="" six="" compared="" with="" allopurinol="" alone="" (clear="" 1="" -="" 54%="" vs.="" 28%;="" clear="" 2="" &ndash;="" 55%="" vs.=""></6.0></p><p>In the CRYSTAL study, lesinurad in combination with febuxostat (Takeda Pharmaceutical's <i>Uloric</i>) showed that a greater sUA lowering to the target for tophaceous gout of <5.0mg l="" compared="" with="" febuxostat="" alone="" at="" all="" months="" except="" at="" the="" time="" of="" the="" primary="" endpoint,="" month="" six="" (56.6%="" vs.="" 46.8%,="" non-significant).=""></5.0mg></p><p>Despite lesinurad failing to demonstrate statistical significance in the CRYSTAL study, it did show some nominal improvement in lowering sUA to below 5.0 mg/dL by month six. Given the need for more second-line therapies to add to the relatively weak probenecid and a reasonable safety profile at the 200 mg dose, the FDA should have some interesting discussions about the risk to benefit ratio for patients who do not reach sUA targets with allopurinol or febuxostat alone and require alternative therapies.</p><p>The product is also awaiting EU approval.</p><p><b>Related Stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AZs-lesinurad-misses-in-Phase-III-gout-at-lower-dose-358953" target="_new">AZ's lesinurad misses in Phase III gout at lower dose</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AstraZenecas-Lesinurad-data-make-CLEAR-case-for-lower-dose-355084" target="_new">AstraZeneca's Lesinurad data make CLEAR case for lower dose</a></p><h2>EARTH To AstraZeneca</h2><p>AstraZeneca also has plans to announce top-line results from its Phase II EARTH Explorer 2 study of <b>mavrilimumab</b>, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting in November 2015. Mavrilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the alpha subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.</p><p>The company has previously reported positive top-line results for mavrilimumab from the Phase IIb EARTH Explorer 1 study, which met its primary endpoints with an impressive 73.4% (p<0.05) acr20="" response="" for="" the="" highest="" dose="" of="" mavrilimumab="" as="" compared="" with="" placebo.="" those="" numbers="" compare="" favorably="" with="" pfizer's="" currently="" available="" tofacitinib="" (xeljanz)="" which="" reported="" a="" 52.6%="" acr20="" response="" at="" six="" months="" in="" a="" similar="" study="" population.=""></0.05)></p><p>However, the competitive advantage of mavrilimumab is questionable because of its intravenous route of administration compared with the oral tofacitinib. As such, results from EARTH Explorer 2 which is comparing mavrilimumab to Johnson & Johnson's injectable anti-TNF drug golimumab (Simponi) will be of especial interest because they will further reveal mavrilimumab's therapeutic profile and marketability in the already-competitive intravenous rheumatoid arthritis market.</p><h2>Hypersensitive Or What?</h2><p>Also early next month, Merck & Co might finally get an answer for use of its anesthetic product <i>Bridion</i> (sugammadex sodium injection) in the US; the product has been long available in Europe and Australasia. </p><p>The selective relaxant binding agent provides rapid and complete reversal of neuromuscular block induced by rocuronium or vecuronium is used as part of general anesthesia during surgical procedures, but has been struggling to get on the US market since 2008 (when it was a Schering-Plough product) because of hypersensitivity concerns. </p><p>Merck submitted further safety data, but a series of Complete Response Letters ensued, and now the product's back before an FDA panel, scheduled for Nov. 6. Undoubtedly a large focus of this panel will be on the operational concerns of the hypersensitivity trial performed by Merck &ndash; will the company have done enough? </p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Mercks-troubled-sugammadex-gets-new-adcomm-PDUFA-359654" target="_new">Merck's troubled sugammadex gets new adcomm, PDUFA</a> July 28, 2015</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-expects-3rd-sugammadex-rejection-FDA-cancels-adcomm-357296" target="_new">Merck expects 3rd sugammadex rejection; FDA cancels adcomm</a> March 15, 2015</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/REJECTED-FDA-snub-of-sugammadex-another-setback-for-Merck-346783" target="_new">REJECTED: FDA snub of sugammadex another setback for Merck</a> Sept. 23, 2013</p><h2>AbbVie In GBM</h2><p>Another FDA panel meeting is set for Nov. 19 for AbbVie's <b>ABT-414</b>, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody-drug conjugate, currently in Phase II development for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an indication for which it has US and EU orphan designations. </p><p>The Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee will meet to consider the choice of indications studied, patient populations included, and possible study designs in the development of ABT-414 for pediatric use. To date, the results for the drug in this population are limited, but generally positive, and so the panel is expected provide a more substantiated path forward for ABT-414 for brain cancer.</p><p>Pediatric patient populations bring a different set of challenges as childhood tumors frequently appear in different locations and behave differently than brain tumors in adults, often requiring age-dependent treatment options.</p><p>ABT-414 is also in Phase I/II development for the treatment of solid tumors.</p><h2>Pancreatic Cancer</h2><p>Meanwhile, progress is expected for three products with potential against another intractable tumor, pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Threshold Pharmaceuticals and Merck KGaA expect to release data from the Phase III MAESTRO study of <b>evofosfamide</b> for the treatment of pancreatic cancer this quarter. Evofosfamide is a prodrug derivative of a previously used cancer drug that is designed to be activated in the hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions present in the tumor microenvironment. MAESTRO is evaluating evofosfamide in combination with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in previously untreated subjects with metastatic or locally-advanced unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. It is currently also in Phase III for sarcoma, and in earlier-stage development for a variety of other tumor types. </p><p>Although both sponsors have extensive development programs, top-line results from the MAESTRO study will signify the first pivotal data release for this indication (and possibly for the drug &ndash; data from sarcoma studies are expected in the fourth quarter as well) and will play a key role in potential regulatory filings.</p><p>MAESTRO, which is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment, has overall survival as its primary endpoint. Notably, a Phase II study evaluating the same combination therapy showed a numerical overall survival benefit that failed to reach statistical significance (although the study was not powered to do so), but crossover from the comparator to treatment arm likely reduced the observed benefit. </p><p>Merrimack Pharmaceuticals is awaiting an Oct. 24 PDUFA action date for what looks set to be its first product on the market. <b>MM-398</b> is a nanoliposomal encapsulation of the cytotoxic drug, irinotecan, which is designed to reduce the toxicity of irinotecan to normal tissues while increasing its anti-tumor efficacy. Promisingly for MM-398's prospects at the FDA, Merrimack released positive results, in May 2014, of the NAPOLI-1 Phase III study of MM-398 alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who previously received gemcitabine-based therapy. In contrast to the lackluster monotherapy results, the combination therapy arm had an encouraging median overall survival (OS) of 6.1 months over 5-FU/leucovorin alone (4.2 months). </p><p>FibroGen's <b>FG-3019</b>, a fully-human monoclonal antibody targeting connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to inhibits its central role in causing diseases associated with fibrosis, is in development in several programs in fibrotic diseases and cancer. </p><p>One Phase II study of particular interest aims to convert inoperable pancreatic cancer to operable cancer using FG-3019. In the 40-patient trial evaluating FG-3019 given with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer, treatment will last up to six months and may be increased based on preliminary results, which are expected late this year and will determine the program's future. </p><p>The combination therapy may shrink the tumor size enough to enable surgical removal free from major blood vessels, thereby increasing the chance of survival in these late-stage patients. An earlier dose-finding trial of FG-3019 combined with gemcitabine and erlotinib in pancreatic cancer demonstrated a dose-related increase in survival.</p><p>The preliminary results may be announced in the fourth quarter as previously guided, or a full disclosure will be made at the ASCO GI meeting in January 2016. Other ongoing programs for FG-3019 include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><h2>Cempra's Solithromycin Playing Solitaire</h2><p>Further pivotal data for Cempra's "pipeline-in-a-pill" <b>solithromycin</b> (CEM-101) are set to report by the end of the year. This next-generation oral and intravenous fluoroketolide is currently in late-stage development for moderate to moderately-severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Cempra is developing solithromycin to address the full range of CAP severity: as a replacement for azithromycin in patients with milder CAP, and as a replacement for azithromycin plus a cephalosporin in more serious patients, without the risks for tendon rupture and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection of moxifloxacin or other fluoroquinolones. </p><p>In August, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for both the oral and IV formulations, and positive pivotal data have already been released from a Phase III study of the oral formulation against moxifloxacin (SOLITAIRE-Oral). Now, Cempra is anticipating top-line data from the pivotal IV study (SOLITAIRE-IV) by the end of 2015. </p><p>The problem for the company was that during the course of SOLITAIRE-Oral, the FDA changed its guidelines regarding CAP clinical trials to recommend enrolment of at least 75% PORT III and higher patients, i.e. those falling higher on the pneumonia severity index. The &ndash;Oral study only enrolled 50% of these higher-risk patients, although that may be sufficient for the oral formulation targeting milder CAP. </p><p>But SOLITAIRE-IV is enrolling approximately 863 patients with 25% PORT Class II, 50% PORT Class III and at least 25% PORT Class IV CABP which should address higher-risk patients. The primary endpoint is non-inferiority to moxifloxacin of early response at 72 hours in the intent to treat (ITT) population, which is specified by the proposed FDA guidance.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/ICAAC-2015-Cempra-CEO-Sees-Solithromycin-Potential-Beyond-Infectious-Diseases-360601" target="_new">ICAAC 2015: Cempra CEO Sees Solithromycin Potential Beyond Infectious Diseases</a></p><h2>Other Antibacterials </h2><p>Finally, top-line results are expected for Summit Therapeutics' novel oral antibiotic, SMT19969, that may support its potential as a differentiated antibiotic for treating <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection (CDI). Unlike other broad spectrum antibiotics, Summit believes SMT19969 selectively targets <i>C difficile</i> without causing damage to the natural gut flora. A Phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects showed that major bacteria groups were largely unchanged with the exception of Clostridia after repeat doses of the drug for ten days. Following this outcome, the FDA designated SMT19969 as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and granted fast track designation.</p><p>Summit recently completed enrollment of 100 patients in a Phase II trial comparing SMT19969 to vancomycin for CDI. Subjects will receive treatment for ten days and be evaluated for the primary endpoint of sustained clinical response. This is a composite endpoint defined as clinical cure at Day 12 and no recurrence of CDI within 30 days after the end of treatment. If positive, the data may support SMT19969's potential as a differentiated antibiotic for treating CDI.</p><p>Click <a href="http://www.biomedtracker.com/ReportDetail.cfm?ReportID=646" target="_new">here</a> for access to the full BioMedTracker report Q4 2015 Outlook Report. </p><p>
