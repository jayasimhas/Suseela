<p>Amgen executives didn't shed a lot of light during the company's second quarter earnings conference call on issues at the top of investors' minds: commercial expectations for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab) and the strategy for growth beyond existing research and development programs.</p><p>Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen's growth strategy has become increasingly important, since revenues from its top-selling biologic Enbrel (etanercept) are growing largely through price increases rather than higher demand, and because the arthritis blockbuster as well as the neutropenia therapy Neupogen (filgrastim) and anemia drug Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) are losing sales to competitors. Still, Amgen's executive team remained vague about the company's plans to combat those concerns.</p><p>Even so, investors sent Amgen's stock up 2.1% in after-hours trading on 30 July to $175.25 per share, because the company's second quarter revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $5.37bn and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) rose 8% $2.57. Analyst consensus was $5.32bn in revenue and $2.43 in EPS. </p><p>Global product sales increased 6% to $5.23bn versus $4.95bn during the second quarter of 2014 despite foreign currency exchange impacts plaguing big pharma and large biotech companies.</p><p><b>Sales gains (and some losses)</b></p><p>The sales gains were driven by price increases for Enbrel and Neulasta (pegfilgrastim), while Amgen noted increased revenue based on higher unit demand for the bone strengtheners Prolia (denosumab) and Xgeva (denosumab), Sensipar/Mimpara (cinacalcet) for hyperparathyroidism, the cancer drugs Vectibix (panitumumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib), and Nplate (romiplostim) for thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Sales declined 14% for Neupogen, 4% for Epogen (epoetin alfa) and 7% for Aranesp due to increased US competition. Epogen's slide was caused by the shift of patients to Aranesp, which is losing patients to Roche's lower-priced Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta), which is distributed in the US by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Galenica-and-Roche-strike-Mircera-deal-358642" target="_new">Galenica</a>. The Epogen sales slip was offset by higher pricing, but Amgen didn't report a price increase for Neupogen, which will face biosimilar competition from Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">Zarxio</a> in the US later this year.</p><p>"We view Amgen as being in a transformative stage as the company takes measures to maintain market share with mature products while simultaneously launching new branded products and expanding into the biosimilars market," William Blair analyst John Sonnier said in a 30 July research note.</p><p>Amgen's second quarter pricing and volume gains were enough for the company to increase its full-year earnings guidance. Amgen now expects to generate $21.1bn to $21.4bn in 2015 revenue versus the previous estimate of $20.9bn to $21.3bn. Non-GAAP EPS is forecast to be between $9.55 and $9.80 compared with prior guidance of $9.35 to $9.65.</p><p>"Not only are we delivering strong financial results, but our new product story continues to take shape as well," Amgen chairman and CEO Robert Bradway said during the company's earnings call. </p><p><b>Repatha on the path to approval</b></p><p>Amgen's biggest competitors at the moment, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with partner Sanofi, won US FDA approval for their cholesterol-lowering PCSK9 inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent (alirocumab)</a> on 24 July for adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases &ndash; a label that was narrower than investors hoped. </p><p>Amgen's Repatha won <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Surprise-as-Amgen-pips-RegeneronSanofi-to-first-PCSK9-inhibitor-approval-359541" target="_new">approval in the EU</a> a few days earlier with a somewhat broader label and the FDA is set to make a decision on the biologic by 27 August.</p><p>Analysts peppered Amgen's commercial and R&D executives with questions about what the US Repatha label might look like and how pricing and access negotiations are going with US payers, but executive vice president of commercial operations Tony Hooper and executive vice president of R&D Sean Harper revealed little new information.</p><p>"I'm not going to speculate about the label that the FDA's going to grant us at this time. We're very close to this process right now with the agency back-and-forth, and I think it's just not our place to speculate on the label they're going to grant us," Dr Harper said.</p><p>As far as reimbursement in the US, Mr Hooper would say only that "we've had some preliminary discussion with payers on a very broad medical basis," because Amgen is not able to negotiate with payers until Repatha has FDA approval. </p><p>"Our position has always been that the choice given to both patients and physicians is the most important thing in our marketplace, so we will continue to strive to look for choice," he said.</p><p><b>Sources of new growth</b></p><p>But beyond Repatha and other recently approved Amgen therapeutics, including expanded labels for Kyprolis in multiple myeloma and Vectibix in solid tumors, investors want to know where Amgen is looking for growth besides its in-house R&D pipeline.</p><p>When Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum asked Mr Bradway about Amgen's acquisition strategy, the CEO said the company is focused on its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2Q-EARNINGS-Amgen-cutting-up-to-2900-jobs-to-reinvest-in-pipeline-353095" target="_new">growth plan</a> announced in 2014, which includes up to 2,900 job cuts so that Amgen can reinvest money in R&D priorities and newly approved products. He also noted that the company has returned money to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks.</p><p>As for any business development activities, Mr Bradway said, "Our focus is on earlier-stage transactions that we think could bring innovation to the company &ndash; that we can add value to &ndash; but we have flexibility in the balance sheet if attractive opportunities arise that are of a larger size."</p><p>Amgen still is in the process of absorbing its $10.4bn acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-cutting-300-Onyx-jobs-19-months-after-merger-357212" target="_new">300 layoffs</a> in March related to the late 2013 transaction.</p><p>However, the company raised suspicions about its merger and acquisition intentions when it announced on 30 July that it appointed former Schering-Plough CEO and current Warburg Pincus partner and managing director Fred Hassan to Amgen's board of directors. </p><p>Bank of America analyst Ying Huang asked during the company's earnings call if the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Profile-Fred-Hassan-pharma-titan-gooseberry-picker-and-secret-geography-geek-355567" target="_new">serial dealmaker's</a> appointment to the Amgen board was an indication of the company's M&A plans "or are we reading too much into the tea leaves?"</p><p>Mr Bradway responded: "I think you're over-reading the tea leaves there. As I said, I think Fred shares our excitement about innovation that's emerging here and the long-term growth prospects for the company."</p><p><p><p><p>
