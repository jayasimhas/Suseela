<p>An Indian court has maintained a restraining order against certain BDR group firms in a patent infringement case concerning Bristol- Myers Squibb's anticancer, Sprycel (dasatinib), though it appears to have left the door somewhat ajar on whether or not the monohydrate form of the compound is covered in the suit patent.</p><p>The court, which held that <i>prima facie</i> certain objections of the defendant (BDR) were "without any substance" and not considered to be "vital enough" to doubt the validity of the suit patent, noted that BDR had not launched the product in the market and no "loss or irreparable harm" will be caused to it if it is restrained from doing activities that it had not yet commenced. </p><p>"On the other hand, grave prejudice will be caused to the plaintiffs (BMS) if the defendants are allowed to manufacture and market generic dasatinib in which the patentee has the exclusive rights in IN203937 under Section 48(a) of the Patents Act, 1970 especially at the time when the defences raised by the defendants are <i>prima facie</i> less credible and do not warrant any alteration of the already existing status quo in the form of the interim injunction," Judge Manmohan Singh said in an order dated 29 June.</p><p>The ad-interim injunction against BDR has been in operation since 4 December 2009 and the court observed how no application for vacation has been filed by the defendants for more than five years. </p><p>"No request was made by the defendants to the court during this period to know their interest or intent to launch the product. Proxy war in the court at this stage cannot be permitted to allow. The conduct of the parties is obviously paramount. Thus, the balance of convenience tilts in favour of the plaintiffs otherwise," the judge said in the 86-page order.</p><p>BMS could not immediately be reached for a comment while BDR did not respond to an e-mail query right away.</p><p>BMS has also filed infringement cases against three other generic firms and injunctions are operative in two cases.</p><p>The court, though, mentioned that BDR is at liberty to move a fresh application for compulsory license (CL) with the Controller of Patents or seek voluntary license with BMS as per law but added that the liberty granted is not tantamount to allowing or disallowing such applications as BDR has to comply with the due process.</p><p>In 2013 India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/India-rejects-compulsory-license-application-for-Sprycel-347730%5d" target="_new">rejected</a> BDR's CL application for Sprycel. India's controller general of patents, designs and trademarks, Chaitanya Prasad, then said that BDR did not follow the "scheme of the law" as well as the procedure mandated by the law. Controller Prasad had also referred to the "deliberate intent" on the part of BDR to refrain from entering into "any kind of dialogue" with the patentee for securing a voluntary license.</p><h2>Monohydrate</h2><p>In the current case, BDR also argued that the BMS product is the monohydrate version of the dasatinib which is not covered by the suit patent and is the matter of a separate application. </p><p>Judge Singh noted that the "sum and substance" of BDR's plea is that the monohydrate form of the compound is not covered in the suit patent and the firm's product which is the reproduction of the monohydrate form of dasatinib would not infringe the patent. </p><p>"This question of the scope and ambit of the monohydrate version is relevant and necessarily required to be adjudicated once the defendants point out elaborately the differences claimed in the subsequent patent filed by the plaintiffs as claims relating monohydrate form of dasatinib and relate it with the claims of the suit patent and how they are different from each other and relate all these with alterations in the consequential products and its working."</p><p>At this stage, the judge, though, said that where BDR had yet to launch dasatinib in either form after obtaining the license to manufacture the same, the question of distinction of monohydrate form or otherwise "lends no support" to the defendant's plea. </p><p>The judge said that the onus lay upon the defendants to explain the differences by carving out the two patents filed by BMS and thereafter relating with the products which are available in the market whether of the defendants or other parties in either of the forms. Only then can the onus shift to the plaintiffs, he said.</p><p>The court, however, observed that <i>prima facie</i> if BDR maintains the position that the monohydrate version of dasatinib is not covered in the suit patent and that its product is the monohydrate which is yet to be launched, then there was "no occasion" for BDR to contest the suit patent so vehemently or challenge its validity on several scores though it is their statutory right. </p><p>"On the contrary, the defendants are doing so which means that there are some more facts which are to be brought into light and the defendants are also unsure as to whether the suit patent covers all forms of dasatinib or not." </p><p>The judge said that the BDR's defences were <i>prima facie </i>not credible but "vague or bald" which require more "factual" foundation. </p><p>"The patent No. IN 203937 is an old patent and has been on the register for 15 years. It is settled law that in the case of old patents there is a kind of presumption of validity in the form of the continuance and perpetuity arises unless controverted with the strong evidence to the contrary." </p><p>There has also been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition or a revocation filed against IN 203937, he added.</p><p>BMS's patent application for the crystalline monohydrate form of dasatinib dated 4 February, 2005 is currently pending before the Indian Patent Office.</p><p>The court also rejected a clutch of other arguments put forth by BDR including that BMS's patent and the claims are obvious in view of existing prior art; the suit patent lacks utility and is hence invalid; and also objections under Section 3 (d). </p><p>Section 3(d) of India's Patent Act broadly deals with incremental inventions that are not patentable unless they show improved efficacy or unless a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.</p>
