<p>India's health ministry has swung into action to tackle the sharp spike in deaths due to influenza A H1N1 amid allegations of short supplies of key medicines - a situation which manufacturers claim is a result of the government's own 'restricted' sales policy.</p><p>India reported 485 deaths due influenza A H1N1 between January and 12 February this year, with the latest death toll estimated to be over 600, according to reports in the local media. This is more than double last year's figure of 218 swine flu-related deaths and 937 cases.</p><p>While India's new health minister JP Nadda has been monitoring the situation closely, a government statement dated 18 February underscored that there was ''no shortage of drugs or any other logistics''. The health secretary is scheduled to hold a meeting with both drug and vaccine manufacturers on the issue, the statement added.</p><p>This even as India's National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), some days ago, issued a notice urging manufacturers to ensure ''adequate stock'' and ''smooth supply'' of drugs such as oseltamivir, zanamivir and rimantadine. </p><p>''It has been reported to this office that the medicines used for swine flu - oseltamivir, zanamivir and rimantadine - are in short supply in the country. The non-availability of these vital drugs may lead to high risk of complications to patients infected with H1N1 virus. You are advised to rush stock wherever short supply is reported in the country'' the NPPA said in a note dated 13 February addressed to firms such as Strides Arcolab, Cipla, Hetero Drugs and Ranbaxy, among others. The note originally showed up with a 2013 dateline, only to be updated to 2015 subsequently. </p><p>Manufacturers have been asked to provide both stock and supply positions of these drugs on a monthly basis.</p><p>Industry sources, however, claim that the alleged shortages were a result of the government's own policy &ndash; restrictions on the manner in which the products such as oseltamivir can be sold.</p><p>''Otherwise there is no shortage&#8230; capacities are plenty even though demand is seasonal. Because of the restrictions, no retailer/stockist is keen to stock the product,'' one manufacturer told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Industry has in the past claimed that while it is urged to hold adequate inventory of the drug to meet any emergency, the government's restricted sales policy has resulted in large stocks nearing date expiry or then date expired stock being destroyed. </p><p>Drug manufacturers claim that the government must consider freeing up sales of products like oseltamivir, allowing these to be available across chemists' stores. They argue that even if the government plans to rapidly expand the number of retailers/wholesalers who can stock Schedule X drugs, it remains to be seen whether trade would be keen to willingly participate.</p><p>Amid fears of irrational use and the chances of the emergence of resistant strains, India had previously permitted the retail sale of oseltamivir through chemists who hold a licence to stock and sell drugs specified under schedule X of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules against medical prescriptions. Under schedule X, patients are required to produce two copies of the prescription, one of which will need to be retained by the chemist for about two years. Every distributor, stockist and dealer holding stocks of drugs such as oseltamivir would also need to submit to the concerned licensing authority in the state or Union territory, a monthly statement, with details on the quantity of such drugs available with them. </p><p>There are close to 2,500 Schedule X retailers/wholesalers as per government data, with local media reports suggesting that the government plans to ramp up the number of licensed chemists for such products.</p><p>There have also been concerns over the sale of certain diagnostic kits and other items at 'exorbitant' prices with the spread in the H1N1 outbreak. The government is reported to have placed orders to increase the national stockpile of diagnostic kits and procure 10,000 additional masks and 60,000 doses of oseltamivir.</p><h2>Vaccines</h2><p>The Drugs Controller General of India has also urged seven firms - Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech, Panacea, Novartis, Sanofi Pasteur, Abbott and GlaxoSmithKline &ndash; to ''take all necessary measures'' to ensure that there is adequate supply of H1N1 vaccines and the trivalent seasonal flu vaccine especially in the affected areas.</p><p>While the government appears to have made little effort, thus far, to take much of industry into confidence on the supplies issue, the 18 February statement noted that guidelines framed by the government for vaccination of healthcare workers had been approved and provided to the states for dissemination to the health institutions treating H1N1 influenza patients. </p><p>''An expert group comprising eminent doctors has also issued an advisory stating that the vaccine is not recommended for the general public at this juncture,'' the government statement added.</p><p>Some vaccine manufacturers indicated that the government had not yet reached out to them to revive plans for additional production of H1N1 vaccines, despite the spurt in H1N1 cases. </p><p>''Whatever production is being done is based upon our marketing diligence and requirement from private market. There have been couple of sporadic enquiries from the state governments, but without any follow up,'' Serum Institute told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>In 2010 Serum launched a cut-price, indigenously developed intranasal H1N1 flu vaccine, Nasovac, but the prospects of the product were apparently stymied in part due to government red tape <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Red-tape-hurt-vaccine-sales-says-Serum-as-it-readies-new-intranasal-trivalent-flu-product-328644%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 27 March 2012)</a>.</p><p>Serum also told <i>Scrip</i> that its intranasal trivalent vaccine which offers protection against H1N1, H3N2 and B/Brisbane virus was available in ''very limited'' quantities. ''In fact, for the lack of demand and [that] the product was expiring, we destroyed about 184,000 doses of our trivalent vaccine at the end of December 14,'' the Pune-based said.</p><p>While Sanofi's Vaxigrip is available on the Indian market, the latest position on supplies of other flu vaccines such as Abbott's Influvac could not immediately be ascertained. On the availability of Novartis' Agrippal and Fluvirin vaccines, the company only said that all vaccine stocks imported by it in India for the market had been distributed.</p>
