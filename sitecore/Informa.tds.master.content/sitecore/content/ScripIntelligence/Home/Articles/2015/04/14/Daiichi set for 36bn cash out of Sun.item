<p>Things appear to have come full circle for Daiichi Sankyo in India - at least concerning Ranbaxy.</p><p>After making headlines in June 2008 with the buyout of Ranbaxy in a transaction then worth between $3.4bn and $4.6bn, the Japanese major had last year <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-turnaround-specialist-Sun-snaps-Ranbaxy-in-4bn-deal-351127%5d" target="_new">handed over the reins</a> of the troubled firm to India's distressed asset turnaround specialist and Sun Pharma founder, Dilip Shanghvi. </p><p>Now, almost seven years since the Ranbaxy saga began, Daiichi plans to cash out of Sun Pharma. It's expected to make a neat package too with the exit from Sun, which currently boasts a market cap of around $41bn. </p><p>Post the acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun, Daiichi had become the second largest shareholder in Sun Pharma with a holding of around 9%. The Japanese firm was also permitted to nominate one director to Sun&rsquo;s board. </p><p>On 20 April, Daiichi Sankyo said that its board had approved a resolution to sell "entire or part" of its holding of Sun Pharma shares.</p><p>Daiichi said that from the perspective of the improvement of "corporate value", it had performed a "review" of the Sun Pharma shares and reached a conclusion to sell the shares entirely or partially. </p><p>"After the sale, Daiichi Sankyo will not be a major shareholder of Sun Pharma. However, the existing business partnership with Sun Pharma will remain unchanged," it said.</p><p>Daiichi held 214,969,058 shares of Sun Pharma as of 16 April and will sell these shares on Indian bourses, it said. Daiichi's stake is worth around $3.6bn at Sun's closing price of INR1044.10 (+0.66%) on 20 April on the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p><p>"Daiichi Sankyo will make an announcement concerning the effect of any gain or loss on the sale of Sun Pharma shares when results of operations for the fiscal year ending in March 2015 are announced," it added.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that Daiichi's proposed exit from Sun appears to be a plain financial transaction, aimed at recovering its investment following the Ranbaxy deal. </p><p>"Probably just a transaction to offset any loss. Why lock funds in a financial asset?" Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Sun's spokesperson maintained that neither Sun nor its promoters would be buying Daiichi's holding. Some news agency reports said that stake sale had commenced at a price range of INR930-1043.80 per share.</p>
