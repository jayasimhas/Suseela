<p><p>Pfizer Inc. will deprioritize development of its oral Janus kinase inhibitor <i>Xeljanz</i> (tofacitinib) in Crohn&rsquo;s disease, ankylosing spondylitis and potentially psoriasis, the company announced Oct. 27 during its third quarter sales and earnings update. </p><p>Pfizer will focus further development of the drug on psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Xeljanz has been approved since November 2012 to treat rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed to respond or are intolerant to methotrexate. </p><p>The decision comes as sales of the drug in RA, while growing, have failed to meet the expectations of some investors. Third quarter sales of Xeljanz increased 50% over the year-ago period to $127m. </p><p>Nonetheless, sales have fallen short in a category dominated by blockbuster injectable tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. The brand has struggled to gain traction, in part because of safety issues, including a black box warning on the risk of serious infections and malignancies. </p><p>Pfizer announced its decision to scale back the development plans after receiving a complete response letter from FDA for its supplemental new drug application to expand the use of Xeljanz to psoriasis, citing worries about safety. At the same time, the market landscape is changing, with new drugs and potentially biosimilar anti-TNFs poised to enter the market, making the competition even more fierce.</p><p>Eli Lilly & Co. has plans to file the JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib for the treatment of RA by the end of the year; the drug has demonstrated superiority to AbbVie Inc.&rsquo;s market-leading anti-TNF <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) with a strong safety profile in clinical trials. </p><p>Pfizer, meanwhile, is investing R&D resources increasingly in oncology, where it has ambitions to grow into an immuno-oncology leader, and thus the decision to cut its losses with Xeljanz is a frugal one.</p><p>The company is moving forward with development of Xeljanz in ulcerative colitis, where it has already released positive Phase III data from two induction trials and is awaiting results from an additional Phase III <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/9/21/Pfizer-Eyes-Xeljanz-Expansion-To-Ulcerative-Colitis?" target="_new">maintenance study</a>. Data from that trial are expected at the end of 2016.</p><p>CEO Ian Read said the company has not made a decision about development in psoriasis and plans to discuss the application and complete response with FDA. However, he noted, &ldquo;We recognize overcoming the issues raised may be difficult.&rdquo;</p><p>The Xeljanz complete response was one of two recent regulatory setbacks for Pfizer; the firm also received a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-Rejects-Pfizers-Xeljanz-In-Plaque-Psoriasis-361066" target="_new">complete response letter</a> for Hospira Inc.'s Retacrit, a proposed biosimilar to epoetin alfa.</p><p><p>
