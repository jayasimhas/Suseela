<p>Working hard to re-boot its cancer strategy, Sanofi SA of France has entered its latest multi-year collaboration in the field, this time with German biotech BioNTech AG to discover and develop up to five immunotherapies, each consisting of a mixture of synthetic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). </p><p>After failing to transition its cancer portfolio from chemotherapy to targeted cancer drugs, Sanofi is relying on a recent collaboration, signed in late July, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. to vault it into the promising field of immuno-oncology. But it has also entered smaller alliances, like that announced on Nov. 3 with privately-owned BioNTech, a Mainz, Germany-based immunotherapy pioneer of disruptive technologies ranging from individualized mRNA based medicines, innovative Chimeric Antigen Receptors and T-cell Receptor-based products, as well as novel antibody checkpoint immunomodulators.</p><p>Under their deal BioNTech &ndash; founded by clinicians and scientists in 2008 - could receive more than $300m in development, regulatory and commercial milestones and other payments per product, plus up to double-digit royalties on net sales of any commercialised products. The biotech also has the option to co-develop and co-commercialize two of the five mRNA therapeutics products with Sanofi in the EU and US.</p><p>Sanofi has been one of the last big pharmas to jump into the immuno-oncology space. It hopes to catch up through alliances with fast-growing biotechs that offer cutting edge technology. </p><p>"Sanofi has strategically launched a number of inter-company collaborations in this area in recent months. Our collaboration with BioNTech has the potential to lay the foundation for a unique therapeutic modality in immuno-oncology," Sanofi's global head of R&D Elias Zerhouni said in a statement.</p><p>Asked how this latest alliance would play into its Regeneron collaboration, a spokesperson for Sanofi replied: "The BioNTech and Regeneron collaborations are complementary, providing two distinct approaches for the development of immuno-oncology therapies." Sanofi will not need to offer the products generated under the BioNTech partnership to Regeneron, they added. </p><p>BioNTech said the alliance with France's biggest drug maker could prove "groundbreaking".</p><p>"Through using our broad suite of mRNA technologies and extensive tumour immunology understanding, it will allow us to develop a completely new class of cancer immune-therapeutics with Sanofi, which we believe will have a profound and deep impact on the treatment of cancer,&rdquo; Ugur Sahin, CEO of BioNTech, said in a statement. </p><p>Its latest arrangement does not overlap with BioNTech's other immunotherapy activities, such as CAR-T, mRNA cancer vaccines, other RNA applications or immunomodulatory antibodies and will allow it to still add to existing collaborations with Genmab A/S and Eli Lilly & Co. </p><p>In April this year BioNTech teamed up with Eli Lilly to discover cancer immunotherapies, using new targets as well as those already identified by BioNTech. The targets were not identified, however. Lilly paid $30m cash up front and invested $30m in BioNTech's TCR and chimeric antigen receptor-focused division Cell & Gene Therapies GMBH. </p><p>That deal was announced the same week as news BioNTech and Denmark-based Genmab would jointly develop and commercialise bispecific antibodies under, with BioNTech providing some of its almost 200 immunomodulatory antibodies and Genmab employing its DuoBody platform, which generates and purifies bispecific human IgG1 antibodies. Genmab paid $10m up front and could hand over $5m in the near-term if certain of BioNTech&rsquo;s assets are chosen for further development. </p><p>
