<p> Antony Mattessich, managing director of Mundipharma, never planned on a career in pharma. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/BD56684AA60B45308A473C8A5480D5CC.ashx"> </p> <p> Since 1992, he has held positions across Asia, the US and Europe at big pharmas including Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck &amp; Co. He joined Mundipharma as the MD of subsidiary Napp Pharmaceuticals, becoming regional director for Mundipharma Europe in 2011 prior to taking on his current role. But before then he was in quite a different field: terrorism research. </p> <p> In this latest edition of our executive profile series, Mr Mattessich talks to <i>Scrip</i> of his experiences as an outsider, the benefits of jumping in at the deep end, and his distaste for gadgets. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What are the key things that shaped you when growing up?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>Antony Mattesich</b></i>: My father grew up in a post-war Italy as a Croatian refugee. He came to the US in the 50s but a recurrent theme he faced was being an outsider. He was an Italian-speaking Croat, then in Italy even though he spoke the language, he'd grown up in Croatia and in the States it was still like that as well. So growing up with a father who was really an outsider and moving around every couple of years myself, to all sorts of different parts of the US, gave me a sense of being a contrarian. Never drinking the &quot;Kool Aid&quot; as other people do, you are forced to have an outside perspective. </p> <p> I think Mundipharma, as a company now, is contrarian. We don't look at things like a big company does and we don't look at things like a generic firm, which is basically just to knock off what other people have done. It's a great experimental environment to be in. The private area and the entrepreneurial spirit of the owners allows you to look at things from a different perspective and say, &quot;Okay we're not going to be able to compete with a big pharma company and we're much more sophisticated and capable than a generic company, so we must approach business at a different angle.&quot; </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b> In my life in general, my biggest influence is clearly my father, growing up seeing that with as much against him as he had he was still able to get done what he did, was a big thing. For example, he moved to the US not being able to speak English, so instead he got a degree in engineering because he understood numbers. He was definitely an inspirational character. </p> <p> Within the industry though, I would say the guy I took a job with when I left Merck &amp; Co called Quinton Oswald, who at the time worked in South Africa for Bristol-Myers Squibb. This guy was amazing: he was a rugby player, former soldier, never went to university but had a real head for business. He understood how to cleave through all the excess to recognize what a real business concept was. He gave me a job as a general manager out in Malaysia when I was 29, way before I was ready, but he saw that I could survive. So he brought me to the edge of the pool and shoved me in the deep end so to speak. He was there for support when I needed it but for the most part he realized that there was very little damage I could do to the overall Bristol-Myers company by taking over Malaysia. It was a great opportunity to learn and to realize that you have to live with the consequences of your mistakes as well as the benefits of your good decisions. He was instrumental in how I developed. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What is the best advice you've ever had?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b> The best advice was from one of my former reps. He used to play professional football in his youth, was this big powerful African-American guy about 6ft 6. He once told me when I was traveling all over the place, &quot;Look if mom ain't happy nobody can be.&quot; It took me a while to learn this. One of my mistakes at the early stage of my career was not making sure that I was there for my family. That phrase has stuck with me ever since. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: You have risen to a leadership position at Mundipharma but what are your own long term aspirations? Where do you see yourself in 10 years' time?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>I've never been strategic about my career and I have always mistrusted people with very strong ambition. People who just throw themselves into the job they have are the ones who achieve more. I am further along in my career now than I ever thought I would be. At 47yearsold, I am self-actualized enough that I no longer think about what I am going to do next. It's a very comforting feeling because you can deal with people without thinking about what they can do for you. It's more about the enjoyment of the journey. So if I stay working with Mundipharma for the next 10 years, that's fine with me. Yes, this environment needs to continue to be dynamic but I couldn't imagine wanting to do anything else compared to what Mundipharma offers at the moment. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Tell us something surprising about you.</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b> Before I got into pharma I was a researcher; I suppose what you call it today is a sort of terror expert. I actually never had an interest in being in pharma or even really knew what pharma or biopharma was. I was a researcher on terrorism back before it was fashionable. In the Cold War days nobody believed that things happened in the world for any other reason except for actions between the Soviet Union and US. So coming in with an idea that somehow religion informed how politics moved and that terrorism was going to be an important area of research was absolutely not a very popular position to be in. I realized I wasn't going to get a job in that field and I had some ability of languages and had lived overseas for quite a while as a researcher so instead a pharmaceutical company took a chance on me. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What was your first pharma job? </b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>I was a marketing manager in the swine and poultry sales marketing unit at Schering Plough. Pigs and chickens, but I specialized in the swine part of it. My first responsibility was to launch a jumbo pig pump which was basically a large dispenser of gentamicin to give to pigs when they got <i>Ecoli</i>. It was an odd entry into the industry but working with the farmers is an experience that has stuck with me. Certainly in healthcare the payer has become more powerful but it seems like you were getting closer to the experience as a swine poultry sales marketing manager back then. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: If you weren't a pharma executive, what would you be?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>I really love to cook and I'm into organic and local produce. So I would be running a restaurant somewhere in California, using organic products. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What has your proudest moment been?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>It's hard to pick one, they are all sort of similar, but mainly focused around my children. Every time they take steps towards independence or towards winning an ethical battle, those are all my proud moments. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: And your greatest personal achievement?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b> Mainly surviving. Earlier in my career, working through the Asian financial crisis was difficult and rewarding. But looking back across my time in the industry there have been a lot of little victories that have made me feel a real sense of accomplishment. But I try to avoid too much pride, except for when it comes to my children, because I think it destroys the sense of humility you have. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What about your most difficult moment?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>Probably one of the moments I let my pride and confidence get away from me. When I left Bristol-Myers Squibb to go work at Novartis in the US I was aware that the culture was a bit different, but back then I was so confident I could survive in any type of environment that I entered thinking I could change things. I didn't have enough humility to understand that man will never survive a habitat which doesn't suit it. Strength in the individual is never capable of overcoming a whole environment. So as a leader I have always tried to make sure the environment is conducive to the type of people working in the place. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Tell us about one change you effected in your organization that you believe was invaluable?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>The understanding that it's all about creating the right environment in which the right kind of people will flourish. And understanding that you can't force people to do things you want them to do but you can inspire them to do great work. At Mundipharma, we have an upside-down thinking where we push decision making as close to the customer as possible and we flatten our lines of authority so people have this experience of real freedom. But we have an attitude of real accountability to balance that out. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What was your first ever job?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b> Working in a place called Thanksgiving Coffee in 1977. Back then coffee in the US was Sanka; it was horrible. The guy I worked for had enough vision to understand that good coffee would be something people would want. It predates Starbucks. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What is the one gadget that you can't leave home or office without?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i>: I'm on a bit of a crusade to get rid of all these gadgets. When I see my kids, all four of them between the ages of 19 and seven, I feel sorry for them. It's just not as much fun. I'm trying to be disciplined with not keeping gadgets with me on weekends. In the long run people are going to start throwing their gadgets away; they have made for a lot less adventure in life. I try my best to get rid of them where I can. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What is your favorite book, and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>A kids' book called <i>Hooray for Diffendoofer Day</i>. It's a book put together from notes left by Dr Seuss. It's a very anti-establishment book that talks about a school with bizarre teachers that do creative things and where the kids have a sense of creative expression. It's a crazy little book but the theme of it [to look at things differently] is something I like to remember. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What is your favorite piece of music, and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>:</b><i> Diamonds on the Inside</i> by Ben Harper. It's a beautiful piece of music. If I could sing, I'd want to sing like Ben Harper. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Finally, tell us one myth about the industry that you'd like to set straight.</b> </p> <p> <i><b>AM</b></i><b>: </b>I use my parents as a barometer. They are ex-hippies trying to keep the dream alive in Berkeley, California, and when I try to explain to them what I do and that it has some value in the world it still falls on deaf ears. I firmly believe the things we do make the world a better place. There were a lot of excesses in the late 80s, early 90s that have gone and I prefer the way the industry is now. It's a much more regulated and compliant environment where you don't take doctors to strip clubs and things like that. And these changes should be more widely recognized. So I'd like to dispel the myth that we're all bad. We're a vital part of what's good about the world. We might not all good ourselves but we are part of bigger thing generating good. </p>
