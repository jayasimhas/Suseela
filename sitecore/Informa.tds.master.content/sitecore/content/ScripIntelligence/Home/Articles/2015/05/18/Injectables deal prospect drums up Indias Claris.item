<p>Renewed speculation around a potential sell-off of Claris Lifesciences' injectables business saw the firm's shares make strong gains on Indian bourses on 21 May, a day ahead of its scheduled earnings announcement.</p><p>Zydus Cadila, which recently sought shareholder clearance for a fund-raising plan fuelling speculation that it may be prepping for a small to medium sized acquisition, is said to be the forerunner for a potential deal, as per a report in the local media.</p><p>The report claimed that both parties were engaged in "last-minute due diligence" and suggested a "hefty premium" valuation of more than INR30bn ($470m) for Claris's injectables arm. Claris's specialty injectables business reported sales of INR4.05bn in 2014, an increase of 62% over the previous year.</p><p>Shares of Claris ended at INR334 (+18.86%) on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 21 May.</p><p>Zydus said that it is company policy not to respond to speculative news, while Claris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Claris had on 12 February informed Indian bourses that it was not negotiating the sale of stake in the injectables business, and that the board had "neither considered nor taken any decision" in this regard. It, though, had hedged its statement, adding: "For the growth of the business, the company continues to explore and evaluate inorganic and strategic opportunities in various forms from time to time. However nothing definitive in this regard has happened."</p><p>Last month, Cadila said it was seeking shareholder approval to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cadila-fund-raising-plan-stokes-deal-speculation-357884" target="_new">raise up to INR100bn</a> and explained that it has been pursuing both organic and inorganic growth and would require sufficient resources including funds to be available and to be allocated, from time to time. The firm's enabling resolution has since been approved by shareholders. </p><p>While market buzz of Claris's injectables business being on the block has been consistent over the recent past, analysts tracking the development had earlier underscored the import of asset quality in any potential buy by firms like Zydus. They also maintained that any deal attempted by Zydus should ideally be geared towards boosting its US business. </p><p>Zydus, which aspires to be among the top 10 generic companies in the US, has 99 product approvals in the US and has made 260 ANDA filings. </p><p>Claris, which claims to be among the few Indian injectable firms with its own US front end, has 13 ANDAs approved by the FDA and an additional 25 in the registration pipeline. </p><p>The bad run of some top league injectables firms in the US amid the general shortages there, perhaps also adds to Claris's draw. Firms like Hospira had previously been badly hit by GMP compliance issues, leading to shortages of certain products and creating significant opportunities for Indian companies like Agila, now part of Mylan. An FDA enforcement report for the week of 20 May also features a recall by Hospira of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, though that is largely on account of wrong bar coding. Zydus and Hospira have a JV in India, which manufactures oncology injectables.</p><p>The latest buzz around Claris comes close on the heels of the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Carlyle-exits-Indias-Claris-but-umbrella-plays-to-see-interest-358006%5d" target="_new">exit</a> of private equity player Carlyle, ending a nine-year association with the Ahmedabad-based injectables firm. </p><p>Claris Lifesciences' specialty injectables business is currently vested in its wholly owned arm, Claris Injectables, while the company also holds 20% in a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Otsuka-opts-for-majority-JV-as-it-links-with-Claris-for-IV-solutions-337969%5d" target="_new">joint venture</a> with Otsuka and Mitsui & Co for the infusions business in India and emerging markets. </p>
