<p>BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s investors pushed shares of the firm up 6% in morning trading on Oct. 14 after a notice was published early in the <i>Federal Register</i> &ndash; the place where the US government informs the public of federal actions, including plans for public meetings &ndash; confirming the FDA's Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee (PCNS) is set to examine the company's new drug application (NDA) for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy medicine drisapersen Nov. 24.</p><p>But when there was no similar notice anywhere to be found for a PCNS panel review of Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.'s NDA for its DMD drug eteplirsen, investors in the company panicked, driving shares down 12%.</p><p>After all, the company had publicly declared the FDA had "tentatively" set a Nov. 23 meeting for the eteplirsen NDA, so it was hardly surprising investors were in a tizzy wondering where was Sarepta's <i>Federal Register</i> notice?</p><p>By midday, however, Sarepta issued a statement disclosing it had been "verbally informed" by the FDA that the firm had a new tentative date for an eteplirsen adcomm &ndash; Jan. 22, 2016. </p><p>But by then, the damage had been done, with the stock closing at $29.06, down $3.88, or 11.8%.</p><p>Sarepta is not expected to hear from the FDA on the firm's application until <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sarepta-Wins-Priority-Review-For-Duchenne-Drug-Eteplirsen-360112" target="_new">Feb. 26, 2016</a>, so holding the meeting at the same time as BioMarin, whose <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date for drisapersen is two months earlier on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-fates-converge-for-BioMarins-drisapersen-Sareptas-eteplirsen-359173" target="_new">Dec. 26</a>, likely would have put too much pressure on the FDA to be ready to discuss the eteplirsen NDA. </p><p>BioMarin, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioMarin-completes-rolling-NDA-for-Duchenne-drug-drisapersen-358083" target="_new">completed its rolling NDA</a> for drisapersen in April, obtained its drug through the firm's acquisition of Prosensa, which initiated the application last fall.</p><p>In June 2013, the FDA granted drisapersen a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-breakthrough-for-GSKProsensa-DMD-drug-drisapersen-rattles-Sarepta-344477" target="_new">breakthrough</a> therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the regulatory process. The investigational drug also has won orphan drug designation and fast-track status in the US.</p><p>Sarepta <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarepta-rolls-with-eteplirsen-NDA-new-FDA-relationship-358527" target="_new">initiated</a> a rolling NDA for eteplirsen in May, completing it in June, with the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sarepta-Wins-Priority-Review-For-Duchenne-Drug-Eteplirsen-360112" target="_new">accepting</a> the application in August.</p><p>Both companies' NDAs were granted priority reviews.</p><p>But eteplirsen's path to approval has been rockier than drisapersen's &ndash; with Sarepta <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Power-to-the-people-Patients-influence-over-FDA-354799" target="_new">clashing</a> a few times with regulators.</p><p>Indeed, the FDA last year even posted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-to-Sarepta-This-is-what-we-really-meant-354795" target="_new">highly unusual statement</a> on its website clarifying its communications with Sarepta &ndash; asserting the agency had "worked extensively" with the firm on the development of eteplirsen and had "been working intensively" to help the company provide the additional data and analyses needed to support the drug's NDA.</p><p>The FDA's statement likely was a reaction to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Advance-Science-Dont-Pressure-FDA-On-Approvals-Drug-Chief-Tells-Advocates-360907" target="_new">pressure</a> regulators had been under by the DMD community to approve a Duchenne drug, with advocates even filing a "We the People" White House petition &ndash; a platform created in 2011 by the Obama administration to allow any American over 13 years to call on the federal government to take action on requested matters &ndash; in which Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-chief-cranks-it-up-with-captains-of-industry-353164" target="_new">personally responded</a>, pledging that regulators were "willing to explore the use of all potential pathways" for therapies against the disease.</p><p>The bad blood between the FDA and Sarepta eventually led to the company's CEO at the time, Chris Garabedian, resigning, which he did in late March &ndash; an action the firm's board hoped would help mend the biotech's relationship with regulators.</p><p>Meanwhile, BioMarin and Sarepta have been in engaged in a patent interference dispute involving methods of use claims for the DMD drugs.</p><p>BioMarin, however, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioMarin-Scores-Patent-Board-Win-Sarepta-To-Appeal-360762" target="_new">scored a win</a> at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the US Patent & Trademark Office, which determined that Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden, the company's licensor, was the first to invent the methods of use for exon 51 skipping oligonucleotides claimed in its pending '992 patent application and in Sarepta's US granted patent '907, which the latter firm licensed from the University of Western Australia.</p><p>Sarepta has vowed to appeal the PTAB's decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>Shares of BioMarin closed at $103.77 on Oct. 14, up $4.43, or 4.5%. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
