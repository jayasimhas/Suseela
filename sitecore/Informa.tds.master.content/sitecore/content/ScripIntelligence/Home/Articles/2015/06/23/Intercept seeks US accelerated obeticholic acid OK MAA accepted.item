<p>Intercept Pharmaceuticals submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for obeticholic acid, which the firm said is the first medication in decades to seek the agency's approval for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a rare liver disease that primarily results from autoimmune destruction of the ducts that transport bile acids out of the liver, resulting in cholestasis. </p><p>The disease primarily affects women and is the second leading cause of liver transplant among that population in the US.</p><p>Intercept is seeking an accelerated approval in the US.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the chances of Intercept gaining the FDA's nod for obeticholic acid at 97%, which is 10% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Intercept also revealed that its marketing authorization application for obeticholic acid has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency, where the firm is seeking approval of the drug in PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to that drug or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA &ndash; the only product approved to treat the liver disease.</p><p>While UDCA is the standard of care for all PBC patients, a majority continue to experience persistent elevations above the upper limit of normal in the serum marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP), corresponding with increased risk of liver failure, need for liver transplant and death, Intercept said. </p><p>Therefore, the company insisted, "there continues to be a critical need for new treatments for patients with PBC."</p><p>Intercept said its NDA and MAA submissions are based on data from 1,507 patients exposed to at least a single dose of obeticholic acid, including 432 patients with PBC, 290 of whom were treated for at least six months, while 232 got the drug for at least one year. </p><p>All three of Intercept's randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of obeticholic acid in patients with PBC met their primary endpoints with high statistical significance, with improvements seen in secondary endpoints, including markers of liver injury, immunity, inflammation and apoptosis. </p><p>The drug was generally well-tolerated, with primarily mild or moderate pruritus being the most common adverse event.</p><p>The regulatory submissions also are being supported by two clinical databases that include more than 10,000 patients from the Global PBC Study Group and UK-PBC Group, both independently confirming that achieving lower ALP or bilirubin levels is significantly correlated with increased transplant-free survival. </p><p>RW Baird analyst Brian Skorney said he anticipated the FDA to grant a priority review for obeticholic acid in the US for PBC &ndash; an indication he called the red-headed stepchild to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis &ndash; likely setting a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of 26 February 2016.</p><p>But the EMA process, he said, is "somewhat more fluid, as there can be a series of stops and starts to the review clock."</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr Skorney anticipated a launch ultimately towards the end of 2016 in the initial geographies. </p><p>Although approval is not a foregone conclusion, given the use of non-clinical endpoints, he said he believed that Phase III study effect size demonstrated by the drug across a number of endpoints was substantial enough to demonstrate the hurdle of "reasonably likely to predict a benefit" required for a US accelerated approval.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
