<p>Even though the US Supreme Court last week upheld the tax credit subsidies provision of the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), ensuring eligible Americans who enrolled in plans operated by the federal government could keep the benefit, making it more likely they will be able to afford their coverage &ndash; and in so doing, ensuring biopharmaceutical makers and others in the healthcare sector retain their millions of new customers &ndash; there remains some barriers preventing access to care, including to needed medicines, two large drug trade groups pointed out.</p><p>"Unfortunately, what we have seen is a trend of patients being forced to pay an ever growing share of their medicine costs &ndash; far more than they are asked to pay for even more expensive healthcare services, such as hospitalizations," Robert Zirkelbach, senior vice president of communications at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>And, said Erin Estey Hertzog, director of health law and policy at the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), "some of the ways the plans are picking drugs for their formularies are discriminatory, which is contrary to the non-discrimination provisions of the ACA, and maybe set up in a way that discourages people who have certain conditions from enrolling in plans."</p><p>So while the Supreme Court's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supremes-statutory-focused-ACA-ruling-a-win-for-biopharma-359126" target="_new">25 June 6-3 decision</a> may have been aimed at protecting the "affordable" in the ACA, the ruling wasn't a fix-it-all, so the Obama administration has more work to do to ensure the law fully works for patients, Mr Zirkelbach and Ms Hertzog said.</p><p>PhRMA and BIO both have complained to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) about the lack of a robust framework for ensuring the qualified health plans comply with the ACA's prohibition on discrimination in designing the 10 required essential health benefits, of which access to prescription drugs is one.</p><p>In its 20 February <i>Final 2016 Letter to Issuers in the Federally Facilitated Marketplaces</i> &ndash; in which CMS laid out its ground rules for health plans to follow for next year's plans &ndash; the agency specifically noted an example of discrimination as one in which an insurer refused to cover a single-tablet drug regimen or extended-release product that's customarily prescribed as a multi-tablet regimen.</p><p>"Absent an appropriate reason for such refusal, such a plan design might effectively discriminate against, or discourage enrollment by, individuals who would benefit from such innovative therapeutic options," CMS said.</p><p>The agency also said insurers that place most or all drugs intended to treat a specific condition on the highest cost tiers "might effectively discriminate against or discourages enrollment" by patients with that disease.</p><p>Mr Zirkelbach and Ms Hertzog pointed to recent analyses that showed that such problems of discrimination appear to be most prevalent in medicines to treat HIV/AIDS, cancer and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Indeed, a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-When-drugs-may-cause-cancer-A-knotty-challenge-for-FDA-352347" target="_new">June 2014</a> analysis by Avalere Health commissioned by PhRMA showed that in one-third of drug classes for drugs against those three disease areas, more than 20% of the private healthcare insurance plans offered by the ACA exchanges required the beneficiary to pay a co-insurance of 40% or more for all medicines in that class.</p><p>In addition, the Avalere analysis, which examined 123 formularies from the so-called "silver plans" &ndash; where the consumer is responsible for paying 30% the expense costs &ndash; showed that 42% of the insurance policies placed all covered medications for MS in the plan's highest formulary tier, while about 35% placed HIV/AIDS medications on the top tier.</p><p>In an <a href="http://go.avalere.com/acton/attachment/12909/f-017c/1/-/-/-/-/20150211_Avalere%20Planscape%202015_Class%20Tiering%20Analysis.pdf" target="_new">update</a> to that analysis released this past February, Avalere reported the situation had gotten even worse in 2015 for ACA enrollees with HIV and MS, PhRMA's Mr Zirkelbach said.</p><p>Nearly 30% of exchange plans placed all medications in the protease inhibitors or HIV-other classes on the specialty tier in 2015 &ndash; a sharp increase from 2014, said PhRMA, which has been examining some of the barriers ACA enrollee patients have faced as part of the lobbying group's <a href="http://catalyst.phrma.org/burden-on-patients-5-questions-on-access-to-hiv/aids-medicines-in-health-exchange-plans" target="_new">Access Better Coverage</a> series.</p><p>BIO's Ms Hertzog noted there's been some complaints filed by some groups claiming health insurers are discriminating against patients.</p><p>In Florida, the National Health Law Program (NHeLP) and THE AIDS Institute alleged insurers CoventryOne, Cigna, Humana and Preferred Medical violated the ACA and federal civil rights laws by structuring their prescription drug policies in a way that discourages people with HIV/AIDS from selecting their plans. </p><p>"The companies are going out of their way to discourage people with HIV/AIDS from enrolling in their plans &ndash; a blatantly illegal practice," said Wayne Turner, staff attorney with NHeLP.</p><p>"Putting so much of the payment on the patient undermines the concept of insurance," Ms Hertzog told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Americans who enrolled in ACA marketplace plans for 2014 and 2015 were largely left in the dark about what drugs were on the formularies, she said.</p><p>For the 2016 plans, however, CMS is requiring insurers to place their complete up-to-date and accurate formularies online, so Americans will have that information at the time open enrollment starts on 1 November &ndash; a move that was a "big step in the right direction," said Kristin Viswanathan, director of health policy and research at BIO.</p><p>CMS said insurers also must include accurate information on any restrictions on the manner in which an enrollee can obtain the drug, including prior authorization, step therapy, quantity limits and any access restrictions related to obtaining the drug from a brick-and-mortar retail pharmacy.</p><p>PhRMA's Mr Zirkelbach said insurers' step therapy and prior authorization requirements are "significantly more prevalent in exchange coverage than you see in employer coverage."</p><p>Ms Viswanathan noted CMS also is now requiring insurers to provide their formulary information to the agency in a machine-readable format so third-party groups can put together easy-to-interact-with comparisons between the pharmacy benefit offerings of different plans, "with the idea of making this whole process much more user friendly for individual consumers."</p><p>But, she said, the agency is not explicitly requiring the insurers to be transparent about cost-sharing information for the pharmacy benefits in their plans.</p><p>While that information can be found in some cases, the effort needed to find it would likely dissuade the average consumer, she said. </p><p>In addition, added Ms Hertzog, trying to make any sort of cost-sharing comparison is "not feasible" because consumers would have to spend their time calling each of the plans to obtain the information. </p><p>Ms Viswanathan said BIO also has been "strongly" urging CMS to take a much deeper look at the scale and scope of the provider networks that are being established by the plans operating on the ACA exchanges.</p><p>"We think this might be a choke point, a bottleneck for patient access, and it's historically been a place where CMS has not made as much progress ensuring the most appropriate provider for our patients," she said.</p><p>In comments to CMS in January, BIO told the agency it's particularly critical to ensure that individuals with rare or complex diseases have "meaningful access" to a wide range of in-network providers for their care.</p><p>"When we are looking at improving patient outcomes and decreasing overall expenditures across the system, access to appropriate specialists and well coordinated care has to be part of the conversation," Ms Viswanathan said.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supremes-statutory-focused-ACA-ruling-a-win-for-biopharma-359126" target="_new">Supreme's statutory-focused ACA ruling a win for biopharma</a></p><p>In declaring that Congress passed the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) to "improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," the US Supreme Court on 25 June, again, upheld President Barack Obama's healthcare law &ndash; with Chief Justice John Roberts, for the second time, coming to its rescue. The court ruled 6-3 the ACA's tax credit subsidies &ndash; considered the law's linchpin &ndash; can be granted to eligible Americans enrolled in private health insurance plans, whether they bought their coverage through online marketplaces, known as exchanges, run by a state or those operated by the federal government.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Inartful-v-colorful-language-the-SCOTUScare-ruling-359125" target="_new">Inartful v colorful language: the 'SCOTUScare' ruling</a></p><p>Ruling in favor of the Obama administration in upholding the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> on 25 June, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took Congress to task for its poor language in writing the law &ndash; calling it "inartful." But the chief justice also got a scolding from Justice Antonin Scalia, who seemed particularly perturbed that his conservative colleague would jump ship and save Obamacare &ndash; for a second time &ndash; asserting the majority opinion was a "bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery" and "pure applesauce."</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-gets-his-fast-track-to-seal-trade-deals-359110" target="_new">Obama gets his 'fast track' to seal trade deals</a></p><p>President Barack Obama is now closer to being able to declare a major achievement in his second term with a little help from the so-called trade promotion authority, which the Senate delivered to him in a 60-38 vote on 24 June, which will help the White House seal a free-trade deal with 11 other nations &ndash; the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-NIH-spending-boost-comes-at-healthcares-expense-359111" target="_new">White House: NIH spending boost comes at healthcare's expense</a></p><p>While White House officials praised the proposed increases in funding for the National Institutes of Health included in the Republicans' House and Senate spending bills for Health and Human Services, they said those extra dollars would come at the expense of other healthcare programs, including those created under the Affordable Care Act, which would be defunded if the legislation is enacted.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-to-cost-106.4bn-exclusivity-ups-health-costs-359093" target="_new">'Cures' to cost $106.4bn; exclusivity ups health costs</a></p><p>The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that provides budgetary advice to lawmakers, estimated that implementing the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; a bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise &ndash; would cost $106.4bn over five years, with the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health accounting for most of that amount.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Drug-makers-blasted-at-Senate-Trade-vote-359091" target="_new">Drug makers blasted at Senate trade vote</a></p><p>During the 23 June vote in the Senate on a procedural measure in advance of a vote the next day to give President Barack Obama the trade promotion authority he has sought to help him seal a free-trade agreement with 11 Asia-Pacific nations, Senator Bernie Sanders (Independent-Vermont) accused the biopharmaceutical industry of supporting the deal so drug makers could "charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need."</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Senate-spending-bill-to-boost-NIH-funds-cut-CDCs-359094" target="_new">Senate spending bill to boost NIH funds, cut CDC's</a></p><p>A bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education and Related Agencies on 23 June would boost the fiscal year 2016 budget for the National Institutes of Health by $2bn over last year's spending level, but overall HHS funding would be cut by $646m.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-superpowers-time-limits-upheld-biopharma-implications-359072" target="_new">Patent 'superpowers' time limits upheld: biopharma implications</a></p><p>While a 22 June US Supreme Court ruling that was peppered with Spider-Man puns may have provided some comic relief to legal watchers &ndash; although the loser in Kimble v Marvel likely didn't find much to laugh about &ndash; the case may help patent holders and those that enter into licensing rights deals, including biopharmaceutical makers, better understand and be more aware of a nearly half-century old case law rule.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Medicines-coronary-angioplasty-drug-Kengreal-359070" target="_new">FDA OK's Medicines' coronary angioplasty drug Kengreal</a></p><p>The FDA on 22 June gave its blessing to The Medicines Company to market its intravenous antiplatelet agent Kengreal (cangrelor), a synthetic small molecule, as an adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention for reducing periprocedural thrombotic events in patients who have not been treated with an oral P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. </p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
