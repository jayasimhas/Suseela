<p>One of the strictures imposed by the "Troika" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on fiscal miscreants such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain was that the target for spending on pharmaceuticals should be 1% of GDP. But David Talbot, Senior Director of International Government Affairs at Eli Lilly, warned that pharma across Europe as whole could be caught in the cross fire of emergency financial stringencies. </p><p>"Europe is very key to pharma but also very worrisome," Mr Talbot said at the BioEurope Spring meeting in Paris on 9 March 2015. The 1% figure for drug spending was becoming part of political lore in Europe and sets a low bar for healthcare payers, he warned. </p><p>Across the EU, the pharma spend is already only around 1.3% of EU GDP, according to figures collated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations (EFPIA). And in Germany, Europe's biggest single pharma market and the nation providing the impetus for the imposition of spending constraints, the pharma spend is already only 1.15% of German GDP. </p><p>That contrasts with US pharmaceutical spending which runs around 2% of US GDP.</p><p>The EU market remains important for pharma despite the increasing focus on 'emerging markets', Mr Talbot said, because it accounted for 26.6% of global markets for newly launched drugs.</p><p>
