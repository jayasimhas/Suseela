<p>India's Syngene International's initial public offer (IPO) opened for subscription on 27 July, amid generally encouraging reviews and comparisons with China's WuXi PharmaTech. Syngene is the research services arm of Biocon.</p><p>Biocon expects to sell up to 22 million equity shares through the Syngene IPO, including a reservation of two million shares for subscription by Biocon's shareholders. The offer closes on 29 July. The price band has been fixed between INR240 ($3.70) and INR250 per equity share. Post issue, Biocon will hold a 74.5% stake in Syngene.</p><p>Navroz Mahudawala, managing director of Candle Partners, a boutique investment banking firm, told <i>Scrip</i> that he expects Syngene to enjoy premium valuations as there is "no focused CRO" business available in India and that logically it will be benchmarked to WuXi. </p><p>"Wuxi quotes at a price/earnings (P/E) of 28 (x) and has a market cap of $3bn. WuXi itself seems to be growing well - quotes at a forward P/E multiple of 21 (x) - and considering Syngene's past track record, there's no reason why Syngene should not be able to maintain an aggressive growth rate," Mr Mahudawala said. </p><p>He believes Syngene's expected valuations are "fair" and the stock should still list at a premium. At the IPO price band of INR240-250, Syngene is valued at 27-29x its FY15 earnings per share.</p><p>WuXi PharmaTech, which was earlier this year reported to be considering an offer that would take it private, expects net revenues of $790-800m for 2015 as per its full year guidance. In April this year, Wuxi said that it had received a preliminary non-binding proposal letter from a consortium led by founder chairman and CEO Dr Ge Li and Ally Bridge Group Capital Partners that proposes a transaction involving the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the company not already owned by members of the consortium for $46 in cash per American Depositary Share or $5.75 in cash per ordinary share. The latest on this could not immediately be ascertained.</p><p>For the fiscal year ended March 2014, Syngene reported revenues of INR7.07bn, restated profits of INR1.34bn and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of INR2.22bn. For the three fiscals ended March 2014, the firm's revenues, restated profit and EBITDA grew at a compound annual growth rate of 29.9%, 70.5% and 30.6%, respectively, details in the draft red herring prospectus said. </p><p>ICICI Direct.com, which is part of ICICI Securities and offers retail trading and investment services, referred to, among other factors, Syngene's healthy return ratios. Return on equity grew 840 basis points to 20.7% over FY11-15 due to better operational performance, it said. However, it cited the growing trend of global consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry and the potential impact on business prospects as among the key concerns, in addition to Syngene's high dependence on a few customers.</p><p>"The company earns over 70% of its revenue from top 10 clients including about 30% of revenues from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Hence, loss or decrease in business from one or more of these clients may adversely impact its financials," it said. </p><p>Experts such as Tarun Shah, founder of MP Advisors, a strategic business advisory firm, who referred to Syngene as a "mini Lonza" of sorts, however, suggested that Syngene's valuations were "decent" and that global consolidation [which could mean fewer clients] was something that cannot be "wished away."</p><p>"I would not say the offer is grossly overpriced," Mr Shah told <i>Scrip</i>, adding that as long as the clients were reliable, global consolidation concerns were not unusual. </p><p>The draft prospectus refers to Syngene's "multidisciplinary" partnerships, each with a dedicated research center, with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Abbott and Baxter. It also notes the extension of the BMS dedicated centre "engagement" to 2020. Syngene also expects to <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indias-Syngene-eyes-CRAMS-role-listing-by-July-358033%5d" target="_new">evolve</a> into a contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) organization with commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. </p><p>However, not everyone seems to be buying the Syngene story, at least for now. Angel Broking is reported to have cited "no valuation comfort" and referred to how at the upper price band of INR250, Syngene shares are valued at around 23 times its FY2017 estimated earnings per share, which compares with 17-22 times its large global peers.</p>
