<p><b>The partnership between the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency is rightly very strong, but now a broader, global regulatory approach is needed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products worldwide, says Margaret Hamburg, the outgoing commissioner of the US agency</b>.</p><p>Since its establishment 20 years ago, the European Medicines Agency has been a global leader in the regulation of human and veterinary medicines. Its vision, commitment to science, and efforts to improve and strengthen the processes by which medicines are evaluated and approved have driven regulatory excellence to the benefit of consumers in the European Union and worldwide.</p><p>I have had the pleasure of working closely with the EMA throughout my time as commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA/EMA relationship has deepened, evolving from interactions primarily through the International Conference on Harmonisation to one that now includes extensive information sharing, numerous standing cluster meetings to jointly address scientific and regulatory issues, placement of dedicated liaison officers at our respective facilities, and frequent consultation as we face common regulatory policy and strategic challenges. </p><p>The EMA is a critical partner in many of our initiatives. Early in my tenure, we launched the Good Clinical Practices Initiative. More recently, the EMA has become our partner in a Mutual Reliance Initiative, a strategic collaboration to allow the FDA and the EU to better rely on each other&rsquo;s good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspections of human pharmaceuticals establishments.</p><p>Like other regulators, the FDA and the EMA share a commitment to bringing safe and effective treatments to patients, a dedication to science-based decision making, and a deep appreciation for the increasingly global nature of the drug supply chain and its inherent challenges. These fundamental connections have allowed us to build a strong and productive relationship that has a tremendous positive impact on patients&rsquo; lives and public health.</p><p>One can no longer talk about the pharmaceutical industry without acknowledging the increasingly complex global supply chains and the regulatory challenges brought about by manufacturing and distribution. Responding to these challenges mandates that, as regulators, we are committed to ensure our regulatory decisions remain rooted in science-based standards and data. </p><p>Furthermore, globalisation has heightened the need to ensure quality throughout the systems in the development and delivery of pharmaceutical products. A global quality system benefits public health both within and beyond our borders, supports economic development and viability, and strengthens national and international security. As regulators, we must embrace these complex dynamics and look for new ways to navigate these ever changing pathways.</p><p>In this environment, medicines regulators cannot act in isolation; rather, we must continue to build partnerships at the international level to increase our reach. Regulator-to-regulator partnerships remain important but we must also work to strengthen and expand multilateral efforts such as the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, the new forum for senior regulatory leaders around the world to convene around issues of strategic interest. It is such multinational collaboration that will allow a truly global reach and improved regulatory capacity worldwide.</p><p>New challenges are assured. We are already seeing scientific and technological advances woven into products that do not fit neatly into our regulatory structures and approaches. Novel and unexpected complexities in the global medical product supply chains are sure to come, and additional new threats and opportunities of many kinds will most certainly arise. The EMA&rsquo;s leadership is well positioned to manage these and other challenges, today and in the future.</p><p>I have personally enjoyed working with my EMA colleagues these past six years and am convinced the FDA/EMA relationship will continue to strengthen.</p><p><i>Margaret Hamburg will leave her post of commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration at the end of March after almost six years in the job</i>.</p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency. In the run-up to the invitation-only scientific conference that the EMA is holding to mark the anniversary in London on 18 March, you'll be able to read what key individuals and stakeholders in the European pharmaceutical regulatory network have to say about the challenges the EMA and the network are facing and where they are headed as the agency moves into its third decade.</i></p><p><b><i>Previously in the series</i></b><i>:</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Fernand Sauer reviews the first two decades and offers advice for regulators at all levels"</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Fernand-Sauer-reviews-the-first-two-decades-and-offers-advice-for-regulators-at-all-levels-357045" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 3 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A decade of expansion, collaboration and new legislation", by Thomas Lönngren</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-decade-of-expansion-collaboration-and-new-legislation-357061" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 4 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Independence and transparency are the key to fulfilling the EMA's public health commitments", by Health Action International,</i><a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Independence-and-transparency-are-the-key-to-fulfilling-the-EMAs-public-health-commitments-357084" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 5 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A short history of the European Medicines Agency", by Ian Schofield</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-short-history-of-the-European-Medicines-Agency-357112" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 6 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "CHMP chair on HTA, patient involvement and dealing with uncertainty", by Francesca Bruce,</i><a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-CHMP-chair-on-HTA-patient-involvement-and-dealing-with-uncertainty-357139" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 9 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "An increasing impact on the non-prescription medicines market", by Hubertus Cranz,</i><a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-An-increasing-impact-on-the-non-prescription-medicines-market-357198" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 10 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: Trust is the key", by Emily O'Reilly,</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Trust-is-the-key-357223" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 11 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: A quality model that deserves to be replicated, by Richard Bergström & Pär Tellner, </i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-quality-model-that-deserves-to-be-replicated-357249" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 12 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: The generic and biosimilar industries on taking a positive partnership forward, by Adrian van den Hoven, </i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-The-generic-and-biosimilar-industries-on-taking-a-positive-partnership-forward-357280" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 15 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: Twenty years of success &ndash; the EMA and the European medicines agencies regulatory network, by Klaus Cichutek, </i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Twenty-years-of-success---the-EMA-and-the-European-medicines-agencies-regulatory-network-357314" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 16 March 2015.</i></p>
