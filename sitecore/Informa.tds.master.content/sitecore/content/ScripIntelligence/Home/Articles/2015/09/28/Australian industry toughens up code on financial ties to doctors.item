<p>From the beginning of this month, Australian pharmaceutical companies will be required to collect information about any payments they make to health care professionals for consulting services and any financial support they provide for educational purposes, including airfares, accommodation and conference registration fees. </p><p>For a 12-month transitional period, such information will be made public where companies have the permission of the health care professionals concerned. But from Oct. 1, 2016 the public reporting of all such payments will become mandatory.</p><p>The provisions are contained in the 18th edition of the Code of Conduct published by Medicines Australia, the association representing pharmaceutical companies. The updated version was developed following consultation with consumer and doctor groups and other health care member organizations.</p><p>The new transparency measures are in line with those already in place in some European countries including France and the Netherlands, Medicines Australia noted, adding that companies in the US also gather information that is reported to the government and published.</p><p>Medicines Australia said increased transparency in relations between its member companies and health care professionals would "guard against improper influence." Under the code, it said, "patients and other interested people will be able to be reassured that these payments are appropriate and their health care professional will continue to put patients' interests first."</p><p>The association's CEO, Tim James, said the new code was "an important development in building on the established, trusted relationship between patients and health care professionals." A strong working relationship and ongoing knowledge exchange between the Australian innovative medicines industry and healthcare professionals were "critical to better patient outcomes," he declared.</p><p>The payments covered by the updates to the code are:</p><ul><li>Payments for the provision of services by a health care professional &ndash; for example, giving a lecture or presentation, providing advice as a member of an advisory board, or providing advice to a company as a medical expert.</li><li>Sponsorship of medical education &ndash; for example, a company can provide financial support for a health professional to take part in medical education by paying for travel and accommodation to attend an educational meeting, or a registration fee to attend a conference.</li></ul><h2>Recording and reporting</h2><p>Companies must record all payments together with the category of payment, and report them on their websites at six-monthly intervals, with two reports each year covering May to October and November to April. The first report will cover seven months, from Oct. 1, 2015 to April 30, 2016, and is to be published by Aug. 31, 2016. Links to the reports will be placed on Medicines Australia's website.</p><p>The reports will outline the nature and purpose of each engagement, the date and value of the payment, and information about the health care professional including their name and principal practice address. </p><p>All companies must confirm to Medicines Australia that their report includes all payments covered by the code, and ensure that health professionals are aware that information collected about payments and support for education will be published.</p><p>During the transitional period, health care professionals will be able to refuse reporting of the information. However, "because they know that patients value transparency we expect that they will not object to having the information made public," the association said. </p><p>Subsequently, though, they will have no choice in the matter. "From 1 October 2016, the receipt of a payment will be taken as the understanding from the healthcare professional that the payment will be reported," it noted.</p><p>It is possible that a central register of payments will be set up at some point in the future, "provided data can be represented consistently and it can be done in compliance with Australia's privacy laws," Medicines Australia said. </p><p>National health professional and consumer organizations have also voiced support for the transparency changes, according to the association. It was "great to see the support of important health care leaders including the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Consumers Health Forum and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians," it declared. </p><p>George Tambassis, national president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, said: "From the point of view of community pharmacy, the purpose of the code is to ensure that the trust placed in pharmacists by health care consumers is soundly based, and that patients can be confident the medication and advice they receive from their community pharmacist is provided on a transparent, ethical and clinical basis." </p><h2>Compliance and penalties</h2><p>The code, which was originally established in 1960, incorporates the principles set out in the Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Covering all aspects of drug marketing, promotion and educational information, it is overseen by a monitoring committee comprising members from the Australian Medical Association (AMA), the RACGP and the CHF. </p><p>Any breaches of the code can be reported to Medicines Australia, and complaints will be referred to the independent Code of Conduct Committee which includes representatives from the RACP, the AMA, the RACGP, the CHF and the Australasian Society of Clinical and Experimental Pharmacologists and Toxicologists. Breaches of the code can incur significant penalties, including fines of up to A$300,000 ($210,000).</p><p><i>This article has also been published in </i><a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a><i>.
