<p>The Medicines Company (MDCO) bought privately-held anesthesia drug developer Annovation BioPharma by acquiring the last 64% of outstanding shares that MDCO didn't own.</p><p>The parties didn't disclose the transaction value, but MDCO noted in a quarterly earnings report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 7 November that the company bought additional shares of Annovation during the third quarter of 2014, giving it a 34% stake in the venture capital-backed firm, and if MDCO wanted to buy the rest of Annovation's outstanding shares it would have to pay $35.3m in cash plus up to $26.3m in clinical and regulatory milestone fees. </p><p>Annovation's investors also are entitled to low single-digit royalties on sales of drugs developed from the small company's early-stage pipeline. MDCO previously backed Annovation's $8m Series A venture capital round in 2012 alongside Atlas Venture in exchange for an option to buy the young, private company after it demonstrated Phase I proof-of-concept for a lead development program. </p><p>The drug candidate in question is ABP-700, an analogue of etomidate, an intravenous imidazole agent that's used for general anesthesia. The product is designed to be a safe, new anesthesia agent with rapid reversal of the drug's sedative effects following surgery. </p><p>"This is an exciting investigational new agent in an area where there have been few advances over the past 30 years," MDCO chairman and CEO Clive Meanwell said in a statement from the company. "There are approximately 230m surgical procedures per year worldwide, with over 60% in the developed world. This agent has the potential to improve the efficiency of care for all types of patients undergoing surgical procedures, both in the hospital and in outpatient settings."</p><p>Annovation CEO and Atlas partner David Grayzel said the company's focus since its founding less than three years ago has been "novel agents that allow precise and tailored control of anesthesia."</p><p>Data from Phase I clinical trials will be presented in the fall and additional trials are expected to initiate in the second half of 2015.</p><p>MDCO is focused on medications for serious infectious diseases, acute cardiovascular care, and surgery and perioperative care. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
