<p><p>Depomed serves up its latest rejection to Horizon Pharma, once again calling the revised offer "highly-conditional."</p><p>"The Depomed Board believes that the July 21 Proposal substantially undervalues Depomed's business and does not reflect the inherent value of Depomed in light of its standalone prospects. The Board strongly believes that an independent Depomed will create significant and sustainable value for its shareholders both in the short and long-term, through the focused execution of the Company's business plan and strategic vision," wrote the company in a statement. </p><p>Horizon upped its offer for Depomed to $33 per share on 21 July, just days after the target company enacted a poison pill defense that would trigger a flood of shares into the market if any one investors buys more than 10% of the company. </p><p>Depomed argues that the price increase is not an increase at all. "The purported "increase" in your July 21 Proposal is the result of the trading price of Horizon's stock having increased since it made its initial proposal. Therefore, the characterization of your Revised July 21 Proposal as a "price increase" in your public statements last week is disingenuous, in our view," wrote Depomed President and CEO Jim Schoeneck in a 29 July letter. </p><p>"In fact, we believe your decision not to include an exchange ratio for your initial proposal or purported revised proposal, and your decision to pre-announce earnings the day before the July 21 Proposal, misled the market about the substance of your proposal."</p><p>Horizon made its initial offer public on 07 July with an all-stock transaction worth $29.25 per share. The offer stands as a 42% premium to Depomed's closing price of $20.64 on the day prior to the offer being made public.</p><p>Hoizon says the combined company with have pro forma sales of $950m and EBITDA of $350m through the sale of 13 marketed products.</p><p>The initial offer was apparently not Horizon's first attempt at acquiring Depomed, but its third offer to the company. Horizon Chairman, President and CEO Tim Walbert said in a letter to Depomed shareholders that Horizon first approached the company on 27 May and then again on 02 June, but was rebuffed both times.</p><p><p>
