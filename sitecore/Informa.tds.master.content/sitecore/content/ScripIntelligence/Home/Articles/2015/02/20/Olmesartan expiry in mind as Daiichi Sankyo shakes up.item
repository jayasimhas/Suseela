<p>Major Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo has unveiled a fundamental shakeup across its corporate structure that will see a cut in the number of divisions and simplification of reporting lines, as it battens down and cuts costs ahead of olmesartan's loss of exclusivity.</p><p>The sweeping changes are part of a broader effort by Daiichi Sankyo to reduce expenses and ensure growth under a five-year mid-term strategic plan that runs to the end of fiscal 2017 (in March 2018) and calls for a group operating profit margin of 15%-plus and a roughly 10% reduction in selling, general and administrative spending. </p><p>In the biggest changes, the "Japan company" focusing on prescription drugs in the company's largest market, along with two related functions (business management and business intelligence), will be abolished and the functions spun out to other relevant departments</p><p>The 16 national sales branches in Japan will also be consolidated into 14, and the domestic sales and marketing function will now report directly into the president and CEO, with the aims being to improve efficiency and speed up decision-making, the firm said.</p><p>Questioned by <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication, <i>PharmAsia News</i>, Daiichi Sankyo in Japan was non-committal on whether the moves would entail any redundancies or early retirement, but did point out that an early retirement scheme had recently closed (at the end of January). Just over 500 people applied for the program. </p><p>The company also did not release any specific cost-savings targets from the restructuring, although under the current mid-term plan, the aim is to cut SG&A expenses from 59% of net sales in fiscal 2012 to 48% in fiscal 2017.</p><p>Among the other main changes, there will be three remaining divisions - corporate strategy, corporate management and general affairs and human resources - after the restructuring, with the legal affairs and CSR (corporate social responsibility) division to be abolished.</p><p>The secretariat and internal audit departments will report directly to the president and CEO (Joji Nakayama), and there will be further consolidation and simplification of the supply chain organization in Japan, which has already seen the divestment of some facilities.</p><p>The vaccines business strategy function will also be consolidated into the Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo Vaccine joint venture, and parent company vaccines business strategy and intelligence functions abolished, and a new vaccines business oversight department set up. Various vaccine research and related functions will also be transferred to the JV.</p><p>On the corporate R&D side, Japan R&D project management will become part of the global project management system, following on from other reorganization of the discovery function over the past few years. </p><h2>olmesartan challenge</h2><p>All these changes come ahead of the first patent expiries, in the U.S. in October 2016, for the angiotensin II antagonist olmesartan, sold as Olmetec/Benicar and in a range of fixed-dose combinations. </p><p>Olmesartan-containing products logged global sales of JPY219.9bn ($1.85bn; -4%) for Daiichi Sankyo in the fiscal nine months ended 31 December, dominating the group's revenues of JPY838.2bn (+4%, including JPY146.6bn from Ranbaxy Laboratories) in the period. </p><p>While the expiry will lead to a "significant decline" in revenues from the franchise, "generics are unlikely to launch prior to patent expiry" as Daiichi Sankyo has successfully defended its U.S. patents in a case against Mylan Laboratories, Datamonitor Healthcarenotes. </p><p>Despite the olmesartan challenge and the divestment of Ranbaxy to Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (pending final Indian legal clearances), Daiichi Sankyo is looking to new products and its $410m acquisition of Ambit Biosciences last year to help plug the revenue gap, at least in part.</p><p>Ambit brought with it the promising late-stage leukemia drug quizartinib, while the novel anticoagulant Savaysa (edoxaban) has recently been launched in the US for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients. </p><p>Savaysa is facing a number of competitive challenges, however, and Jefferies analysts are predicting global sales across all indications of $1.2bn in 2020. </p><p><p>
