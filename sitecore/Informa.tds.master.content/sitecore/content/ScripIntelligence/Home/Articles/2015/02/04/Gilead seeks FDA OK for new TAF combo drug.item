<p>Gilead Sciences is seeking the FDA's blessing to market a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug the firm is touting as a potential "backbone" for future HIV therapy regimens.</p><p>The product is a combination of emtricitabine (F), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a novel nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. </p><p>Gilead wants to sell two doses of the F/TAF combo in adults and pediatric patients: 200mg/10mg and 200mg/25mg.</p><p>TAF is a novel prodrug of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which the company markets as a single agent under the brand-name Viread, which was approved in the US in 2001. </p><p>TAF, however, has demonstrated high antiviral efficacy at a dose that is 10 times lower, as well as an improved renal and bone safety profile, Gilead said. </p><p>"With its high antiviral efficacy and favorable safety profile, F/TAF may offer an improved backbone for a new generation of HIV regimens," said Dr Norbert Bischofberger, executive vice president of research and development and chief scientific officer at Gilead.</p><p>He said the F/TAF combo gives the Foster City, California-based biotech giant the potential to further optimize therapies for HIV patients who face a lifetime of antiretroviral treatment.</p><p>The new drug application (NDA) for the F/TAF combo is the second product with those agents for which Gilead is seeking the FDA's approval to market in the US.</p><p>The two agents are included in the firm's investigational once-daily single tablet quad regimen, which also contains containing elvitegravir 150mg and cobicistat 150mg.</p><p>Gilead <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Gilead-seeks-FDA-nod-for-new-HIV-quad-354908" target="_new">submitted the NDA for the quad pill</a> this past fall and expects to hear from the FDA by 5 November.</p><p>A marketing authorization application for the quad combination also is under review in Europe for HIV-1. It was fully validated on 23 December 2014.</p><p>Shares of Gilead rose $2.21, or 2.24%, on 8 April, before closing at 99.87, up $1.18, or 1.2%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
