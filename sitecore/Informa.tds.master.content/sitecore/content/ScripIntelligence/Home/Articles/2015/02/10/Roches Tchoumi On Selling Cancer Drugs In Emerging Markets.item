<p> Maturin Tchoumi, managing director of Roche (India) Private Limited, leads the company at a time when drug pricing is a highly sensitive topic, thanks to Turing's headline-grabbing price gouging act and subsequent retraction. </p> <p> While all eyes are on the differential pricing structure for Roche's just launched anticancers Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) and Perjeta (pertuzumab) in India, Tchoumi, in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, refers to how Roche's partnership with the local firm Emcure has led to a &quot;significant increase&quot; in the number of people able to access oncology drugs in India. Roche's &quot;The Blue Tree&quot; programme for its oncology portfolio and pipeline drugs is also expected to move the access needle, he indicates. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/DD1199DA48FC49169EBD195CB8DB9C4C.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>Maturin Tchoumi, MD Roche India</i> </p> <p> Roche, which has had its share of pricing flak in this part of the world, some years ago pared prices and expanded access to products like Herceptin (trastuzumab) via a <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-launches-cut-price-Herceptin-and-MabThera-in-India-but-NGOs-question-its-motives-340595">second brand program</a> in partnership with Emcure. A financing scheme, where patients can potentially stagger payments for medicines, is also now on the cards for certain Roche anticancers. </p> <p> Tchoumi also underscored the need for greater regulatory transparency in emerging nations. This, especially in view of the shift from the model of products being approved first in developed markets to one, as in the case for biosimilars, where within certain emerging markets, companies are able to apply for local or regional approvals long before they submit data to the authorities in developed markets. </p> <p> Roche is locked in a <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Relief-And-Rebuke-For-Biocon-In-Herceptin-Biosimilars-Case-360068">legal battle</a> with Biocon and Mylan over the approval and launch of their biosimilar versions of Herceptin in India. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Roche has been in India for over two decades now and India is a complex place to do business in, what with evolving regulation, markets within the broader market and poor insurance penetration. How would you describe Roche's journey over the years &ndash; any high/low point?</b> </p> <p> <b>Maturin Tchoumi:</b> India has always been important for Roche. We are committed to bringing Roche's innovative medicines and treatment options to patients in India as quickly as possible. </p> <p> Our primary contribution has been to deliver innovation in healthcare by developing medicines that help patients to live longer and better lives. As a company in India, we have a strategy focused on meeting the healthcare challenges of the country. We have successfully brought our innovative medicines to India to ensure that patients in India get the benefit of these drugs. In particular, we have introduced five new innovative molecules for several oncology indications. In addition, we have introduced innovative medicines in the areas of hepatitis C, renal anaemia and transplantation. </p> <p> In oncology for instance, we recognize the need to provide a better and longer life to cancer patients in India, and have always strived to ensure that patients have treatment options when their disease progresses. A notable example was Herclon [the second brand version of Herceptin] &ndash; the first HER2-targeted, monoclonal antibody for breast cancer &ndash; which revolutionized the treatment landscape in India. The addition of Herclon to standard chemotherapy in breast cancer patients improved the overall survival rate substantially. </p> <p> We have now built on the significant impact of Herclon and launched two additional medicines to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Our new drugs, Kadcyla and Perjeta, have helped people with mBC live longer, better lives overall and have delayed the worsening of the disease for longer than previous standards of care. With a focused approach of redefining the standard of care and improving health outcomes, we see our targeted medicines changing the way advanced stages of breast cancer are treated in India. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Pricing is a critical factor in India and Roche has led the dual brand approach for products such as rituximab, trastuzumab with Emcure in India. Has this helped reach more patients? And has &quot;The Blue Tree&quot; program helped move the access needle, especially in areas like funding of cancer treatment?</b> </p> <p> <b>MT:</b> The prices of our products reflect the benefit that the innovation delivers to patients, as well as the costs required to sustain vital innovation that will continue to meet patient needs in the future. </p> <p> Our partnership with Emcure is our endeavour to ensure broader access to our important cancer medicines in India. The partnership with Emcure has led to a significant increase in the number of people able to access the drugs in India. </p> <p> At Roche, we want our medicines to reach all patients who could benefit from them. We offer unique patient assistance programs that enable access to our medicines. People living with cancer have a variety of support needs and we recognize them. </p> <p> For our existing oncology portfolio and pipeline drugs, we have a centrally approved patient access program, The Blue Tree, which helps patients in their fight against cancer from diagnosis till treatment completion. The program is designed to cover various aspects ranging from diagnostics, funding of treatment, information, post-treatment job search, assistance with documentation for reimbursement and free medicines where possible. Our integrated approach to patient support empowers physicians to initiate therapy as early as possible, ensuring optimal outcomes for patients. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Roche has in the past underscored how some regulatory authorities globally publish the data on which approvals are granted as part of a dossier or summary report &ndash; a practice that is apparently lacking in India. But wouldn't such regulatory transparency in developing markets like India also up the risk of a parallel universe of less-informed analysts drawing conclusions, confusing physicians and patients?</b> </p> <p> <b>MT:</b> There is a significant need for regulatory authorities in emerging markets, including India, to share more information about the scientific assessments completed and the conclusions drawn as part of local marketing authorization processes. </p> <p> While the European Medicines Agency is still quite unique in its efforts to explain its decisions and procedures, the availability of European Public Assessment Reports is an important example of transparency in action. The agency's approach ensures authorities in the European member states, physicians, patients, companies and researchers are clear regarding the procedures followed when assessing medicines and can access both its decision and the accompanying scientific rationale. </p> <p> The reason why we need greater transparency today in emerging countries such as India is because we are moving away from the model of products being approved first in developed markets such as the US, Europe, Australia and Canada where transparency of data exists. Instead today, as is the case for biosimilars, within certain emerging markets, companies are able to apply for local or regional approvals long before they submit data to the authorities in developed markets. </p> <p> Crucially, the regulatory authorities in many emerging markets have previously not been required to develop the infrastructure or capacity to comprehensively review complex medicines such as biologics. As such, when the first approval of a complex medicine is in an emerging country such as India, physicians need to be confident that they understand the strength of the data submitted, the scientific assessments completed and the rationale for the decision made by the local authorities. Only by having access to this information, will they be able to make informed treatment decisions with their patients. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: The Gilead licensing model for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) has been heralded by some as balancing both the interests of the innovator and improving access. Would Roche consider a similar approach for any of its breakthrough therapies in markets like India? </b> </p> <p> <b>MT:</b> We recognize that healthcare costs overall are rising in India and demands on already strained healthcare systems are increasing. We are working with all partners in the healthcare system, including regulatory bodies, policy makers and healthcare professionals to find solutions that will be sustainable for all. We are, therefore, working on solutions like differential pricing in India, which we believe will accelerate and broaden access to our medicines. </p> <p> Also, through partnerships like those with Emcure, we are able to ensure broader access to our important cancer medicines in India. We will continue to explore opportunities to work with partners to find comprehensive solutions, tailored to the healthcare needs of India. </p>
