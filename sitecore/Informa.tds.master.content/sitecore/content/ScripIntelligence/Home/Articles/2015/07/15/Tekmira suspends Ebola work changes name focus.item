<p>Once one of the hottest Ebola firms investors couldn't get enough of, Tekmira on 20 July said it was suspending its drug development activities in the space and focusing its efforts on hepatitis B virus (HBV) &ndash; even changing its company name to Arbutus Biopharma, effective 3 August.</p><p>Wall Street took the news in stride &ndash; with the firm's shares getting a slight bounce of 27 cents, then falling 18 cents, before closing at $11.18, down 10 cents.</p><p>Tekmira said it was re-evaluating its $140m development contract with the US Department of Defense (DOD) for the company's Ebola drug, TKM-Ebola, which targets the Kikwit variant of the virus &ndash; different from the Makona variant responsible for the recent outbreak in West Africa, in which nearly 28,000 people have been infected, with about 11,300 dying of the disease.</p><p>In the midst of an earlier outbreak of Ebola in Uganda in 2012, the DOD had issued a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/In-midst-of-Uganda-Ebola-crisis-cash-crunch-halts-DOD-work-Tekmira-Sarepta-hit-333570" target="_new">stop-work order</a> on Tekmira's contract, although the US military two months later gave the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-military-gives-Tekmira-go-ahead-on-Ebola-contract-but-ends-Sarepta-work-335715" target="_new">go-ahead</a> for the company to proceed.</p><p>The FDA also had imposed a hold on the drug, which the agency <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-eases-Tekmira-Ebola-drug-hold-CDC-chief-wary-353255" target="_new">partially lifted</a> in August 2014 &ndash; removing it completely this past April. </p><p>TKM-Ebola currently is being tested in a Phase I trial in healthy human volunteers, Tekmira told <i>Scrip</i>, although the company did not respond to questions about whether the study will soon be shut down.</p><p>In April, the firm reported <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Tekmira-rises-on-positive-Ebola-drug-data-358040" target="_new">positive preclinical data</a> of another version of the drug, known as TKM-Ebola-Guinea, which demonstrated 100% survival of nonhuman primates infected with the Makona strain of Ebola virus, previously referred to as the Guinea strain.</p><p>But last month, the company said its Phase II study of the drug in Sierra Leone, which was being conducted by the University of Oxford on behalf of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, with funding by the Wellcome Trust, was being closed after a futility analysis indicated continuing enrollment was not likely to demonstrate an overall therapeutic benefit. </p><p>Tekmira's drug was used to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tekmira-Ebola-drug-used-in-American-doc-others-354071" target="_new">treat Dr Rick Sacra</a>, an assistant professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, who was evacuated to the US on 4 September 2014 after being infected with Ebola in Liberia where he was volunteering.</p><p>Other Ebola patients also were treated with the experimental medicine, for which the FDA had granted expanded access use for people confirmed or suspected of having the disease during the ongoing outbreak.</p><p>Tekmira said its name change to Arbutus Biopharma, which will go under the Nasdaq ticker "ABUS," comes in light of its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Tekmira-merges-with-OnCore-to-find-hep-B-cure-356084" target="_new">merger</a> earlier this year with OnCore Biopharma.</p><p>Tekmira CEO Dr Mark Murray will continue to lead the combined firm under the new name.</p><p>"We remain very confident in our potential to create value from our industry-leading strategy, team, and pipeline dedicated to developing therapeutic solutions to cure HBV," he said.</p><p>The company said its strategy lies in combination therapies for HBV. </p><p>Tekmira said it plans to have at least four HBV product candidates advancing in clinical development in the first half of next year.</p><p>It said it is planning to modify the clinical program for TKM-PLK1 to study the effect of PLK1 on viral parameters in chronic HBV patients.</p><p>The firm said it also plans to file investigational new drug applications for three other HBV candidates in 2016: a cccDNA formation inhibitor, a core protein inhibitor and a surface antigen secretion inhibitor.</p><p>Tekmira said it is forming a "discrete" business unit to manage, develop and maximize the value of its non-HBV assets, which includes preclinical RNAi product candidates, intellectual property and related "know-how" of the lipid nanoparticle delivery technology platform (LNP) and multiple strategic partnerships exploiting the LNP technology. The new business unit will be independently financed and has a dedicated management team, led by Dr Michael Abrams, who previously served as CEO of AnorMed.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
