<p>Pharmaceutical firms boast a wealth of experience in M&A thanks in no small part to a boom in activity over the past year, but the struggle to prevent value leaking from a deal remains a major challenge. The huge scale of the potential deal between Pfizer Inc. and Allergan PLC dramatically raises the stakes. </p><p>At this stage, it would be easy for those at the top to focus on the terms of a merger, but it's also vital that they do not forget to start thinking in practical terms about how to make it work. So where should they start? </p><h2>People As Assets</h2><p>Workforce stability is often talked about as the greatest business challenge after a merger or acquisition. It's a problem that extends far beyond retention, to performance, engagement, and ultimately, productivity. Yet, even though the majority of executives recognize the importance of getting this aspect of a deal right, in reality, integrating systems and processes effectively almost always comes before the cultural aspect of integration.</p><p>Placing the workforce towards the bottom of a long list of priorities is perhaps a particularrisk for pharmaceutical firms, which can easily get caught up in the value of their intellectual property, and lose track of what makes the company tick. After all, the very thing that raised Allergan to its prominent market status was the ingenuity and scientific acumen of its research teams, the skill of its marketers and the vision of its leadership. What, then, should firms do to ensure that the people the company is built upon are not lost or alienated along the way? </p><p>To employees on the ground, the pressure of being acquired can feel like a loss of identity. The acquiring business is asking them to abandon the emotional attachment to their old company &ndash; one of the most powerful sources of motivation and loyalty &ndash; and instead immerse themselves in an entirely new culture. Worse still, for most, the new culture will be that of a former competitor, and therefore one which the firm will have, in the past, viewed as alien and opposing. </p><p>Alongside the loss of identity, the change will also mean adapting to a new group of supervisors and co-workers, a new set of systems and processes and maybe even a new location. However, there is plenty that companies can do to remove uncertainty and fear, and so improve engagement and empowerment. </p><h2>Fear Of The Unknown </h2><p>Fear of loss is often one of the predominant individual concerns. This can mean loss of money, colleagues, privileges, the job itself, or more generally the loss of a comfortable status quo. While this fear is an inevitable feature of change, it is something that leaders and managers can mitigate against early in the process, if it's a problem that they're focused on solving. </p><p>On a practical and rational level, employees need to understand that the business will continue to support them, and that they will have a role to play which is both important and tangible. This requires placing staff within a new narrative, which extends well beyond the current project. This narrative will be neither that of the old company, nor the new. It will be a story which lays out a vision of their combined future. </p><h2>Practical Steps</h2><p>Even the best-intentioned companies often communicate the dynamics of change too late, without enough detail and through purely corporate channels. Employees will often be aware of changes right from the start &ndash; whether by accident or design &ndash; and insufficient communication leaves them to invent their own stories, something which can be very dangerous. For this reason, speed is of the utmost importance, but speed alone is not enough. </p><p>To execute the new narrative successfully and consistently across the whole business requires a detailed strategy, but individuals also need to be involved, for instance being given responsibility as a team to implement top-level changes. If staff feel they've individually had a hand in authoring change then it immediately ceases to be something alien and threatening. </p><p>To make the change genuinely resonate throughout the entire company, it must be supported at every level. Creating a cohort of respected and trusted leaders from both old and new companies that can be inspired by the company's new narrative gives rise to powerful ambassadors for change. These leaders can then be enabled to take that knowledge to the next level of the business recreating the same process at each level until everyone understands and supports the changes that have taken place and can drive forwards together. </p><p>Any company being acquired has value locked in its people. By not fully embracing the fears, ambitions and expectations of those employees, the dominant firm will be eroding the value of the investment before the deal is even complete. Framing the merger or acquisition in the context of the long-term journey the company is on puts a human face on the change. The overall story is broken up into a multitude of smaller, personal stories. It becomes one of individual heroes, diligently advancing the company, rather than victims left behind in the confusion. </p><p><p><i>Marcus Hayes is Co-founder and Director of culture change consultancy</i><a href="http://#http://www.thestorytellers.com/" target="_new">The Storytellers</a></p><p><p><p>
