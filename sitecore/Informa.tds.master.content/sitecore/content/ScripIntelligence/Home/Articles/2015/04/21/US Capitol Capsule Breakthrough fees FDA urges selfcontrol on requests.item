<p>As enticing as it is to seek the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation (BTD), regulators pleaded with industry on 24 April to use some self-control in submitting their requests &ndash; noting that reviewing such applications has been an added load on the already overburdened, underfunded agency.</p><p>But FDA officials also sent mixed messages at the all-day meeting, hosted by the Washington think tank the Brookings Institution, where regulators and others extolled the virtues of receiving a BTD, such as added high-level agency attention and research and development guidance &ndash; something money can't buy, although some at the gathering hinted fees for breakthrough submissions should be charged. </p><p>The Washington workshop was intended to be a forum at which the FDA clarified the standards for industry in what regulators are looking for in BTD requests, with the idea that making such information clearer, everyone could save time and resources &ndash; the agency and biopharmas alike.</p><p>The BTD program was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> in 2012 under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> to help expedite the regulatory process for medicines aimed at treating serious conditions.</p><p>The FDA has received about 300 BTD requests since 2012. </p><p>A new <a href="http://www.biomedtracker.com/ReportDetail.cfm?ReportID=607" target="_new">analysis</a> from <i>BioMedTracker</i> and <i>Medtrack</i>, both affiliates of <i>Scrip</i>, found that the BTD not only has been successful at speeding innovative drugs to patients &ndash; with 24 medicines with status approved by the FDA, either as original applications, of which there were 16, or as supplements &ndash; but also in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDAs-breakthrough-status-an-investment-magnet-358039" target="_new">attracting investment</a>.</p><p>At the 24 April forum, John Jenkins, director of the FDA's Office of New Drugs, said it "became clear" at a meeting held last summer between the agency and the biopharmaceutical industry that "there was a lot of confusion" about the BTD criteria.</p><p>"So we determined it would be useful to convene a workshop to have greater transparency to understand how the FDA is implementing the program and pull back the veil of the designation process," Dr Jenkins said.</p><p>He said the confusion stems from the BTD statutory language itself, which states that companies must "provide preliminary clinical evidence indicating a potential for substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints."</p><p>The problem, Dr Jenkins said, is the word "substantial."</p><p>"That was put in there intentionally to say the bar is thought to be high but not too high because of preliminary [evidence] and not too low because you don't want everything to be a breakthrough," he explained.</p><p>But "substantial" can be subjective and vague, Dr Jenkins acknowledged. </p><p>The other reason there's been great confusion is because BTDs are reviewed under the investigational new drug application process, "and are therefore protected under the confidentiality laws," he said.</p><p>So unless the BTD applicant makes the outcomes of their requests known, Dr Jenkins said it's very much a "black box" to the public in knowing why some are approved, while others are turned down.</p><p>"Even then, the underlying package of data that were submitted to the FDA and our review and rationale for granting the designation is not made available," he said. </p><p>Without being able to show the public examples of what qualifies as a BTD versus what does not, it "creates a lot of opportunity for not understanding what bar FDA has set for the designation process," Dr Jenkins said.</p><p>Indeed, at the Brookings-hosted forum, the FDA had to rely on some hypothetical cases to spell out why the agency denied BTD requests, although <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ariad-snags-breakthrough-status-on-2nd-try-354272" target="_new">Ariad</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">Bluebird</a> both stepped up and permitted discussions about how they were able to overcome their first denials with revised submissions, which were successful the second time around &ndash; largely due to regulators' guidance along the way.</p><p>Regulators noted that in the first three years of the program, 53% of the BTD requests to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) were denied, while 32% were granted. About 15% of the requests were withdrawn by the companies.</p><p>No figures were reported at the Brookings forum for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p><p>About 72% of the CDER denials were due to trial and analysis issues, said Dr Kim Taylor, an operations research analyst at the FDA. She noted other overlapping issues, such as lack of substantial improvement over other drugs and safety concerns, also played significant roles in the rejections.</p><p>Given the subjective criteria, the FDA recognized early on it needed to have consistency across the divisions reviewing the BTD requests, Dr Jenkins said.</p><p>"Inconsistency is something I hear a lot about from industry," he said. "Of course, when we are consistent when not in the sponsor's interest, they want us to be inconsistent."</p><p>So the FDA has had its Medical Policy Council (MPC) &ndash; a group of high-level regulators, which includes Dr Jenkins, Dr Robert Temple, deputy director for clinical science at CDER, and their boss, CDER director Dr Janet Woodcock, among others &ndash; review the BTD applications and provide advice on the applicants' drug development programs.</p><p>"Even for those that are denied, we often comment on what the development program looks like and how it could be improved," Dr Jenkins said. "So that brings a high level of center engagement into these programs and where we think we've set the bar."</p><p>With there being no fees for submitting BTDs to the FDA and a confidential process, "there's a lot of upside and probably very little downside" for drug makers," he said.</p><p>But therein lies the rub.</p><p>While the FDA has been touting the high-level regulatory engagement on BTD requests &ndash; tempting drug makers to pursue the designation, which could garner them an expedited review of their marketing applications, although there&rsquo;s no guarantee &ndash; the process has resulted in a large amount of work for the agency.</p><p>"And that means that staff time that could be devoted to other work related to application reviews or other programs has to be diverted to run the breakthrough therapy program," Dr Jenkins said.</p><p>He noted that in fact, Congress did not provide any extra funding for the FDA to implement the BTD program &ndash; something the agency is hoping can be fixed in the next round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, or PDUFA VI.</p><p>Dr Jenkins said there's been an "unrealistic optimism" on the part of biopharmas when it comes to BTD submissions.</p><p>"Just as most parents think their baby is cute, most sponsors probably think given the costs and resources required to invest in developing a new drug that their drug is breakthrough," he said.</p><p>Biopharmas suffer from the "Lake Wobegon" self-delusion that all of their drugs are above average, commented Dr George Demetri, a professor of medicine at Harvard and senior vice president of therapeutics at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. </p><p>What's needed, declared FDA's Richard Moscicki, deputy center director for science operations at CDER, is some self-control on the part of drug makers in determining which of their investigational medicines to seek the BTD status.</p><p>Dr Dickran Kazandjian, a medical officer in the FDA&rsquo;s Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, urged manufacturers to contact the agency through an informal mechanism in advance of submitting a BTD request so that regulators can give the firms an idea of whether their data is up to snuff to meet the required criteria &ndash; although there's no guarantee the companies will follow any advice offered, Dr John Powers, an associate clinical professor at George Washington University, pointed out.</p><p>Dr Moscicki reminded manufacturers that even if they don't get the breakthrough status, it's not the end of the road for their drugs.</p><p>"You still could have very good drugs to add to the armamentarium, that while they may not show a substantial improvement, they can be useful and can be developed further and should be if they are in fact effective," he said. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDAs-breakthrough-status-an-investment-magnet-358039" target="_new">FDA's breakthrough status: an investment magnet</a></p><p>The FDA's breakthrough therapy designation is working as intended &ndash; speeding new innovative drugs to patients sooner than otherwise would be the case without the status.
