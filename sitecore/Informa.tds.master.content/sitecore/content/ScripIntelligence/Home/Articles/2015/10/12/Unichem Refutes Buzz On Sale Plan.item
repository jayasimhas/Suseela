<p>India's Unichem Laboratories, with interests in the cardiology, neurology and anti-infectives space, among others, has denied, at least for now, speculation concerning a potential sale of its domestic formulations business.</p><p>"The company denies the same as it is a rumour," Unichem informed the Bombay Stock Exchange on Oct. 12.</p><p>A report in the local media earlier said that the Unichem is at an early stage of exploring the potential sale of its local formulations business and that valuations could be in the region of $1.2 bn. It cited several potential suitors including Mylan, Teva and large local players too. In 2013, Unichem had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indias-Unichem-surges-on-plant-sale-to-Mylan-340089" target="_new">sold</a> a formulations facility to Mylan. </p><p>Unichem's chairman and managing director, Dr Prakash Mody, denied any plan for sale of the domestic business, but seemed to suggest that the company had received some unsolicited interest.</p><p>"In the pharmaceutical business today, there are all kinds of approaches because people do feel everybody wants to increase their market share. So, if they feel companies are good or they are interested in strategic tie-ups these talks keep on taking place. As long as there is nothing serious and nothing out of it, there is no point in making any comments," Mody was quoted as telling a television channel.</p><p>Asked whether other commercial alliances were under consideration for the domestic business, given the generally competitive scenario and a potential expansion in the scope of price caps, Mody told <i>Scrip</i> that this option had not been considered "at the moment."</p><p>Mody had, in the firm's annual report for 2014-15, referred to how he expects more molecules and their combinations to come under price control in the near future as the government has made its "objective clear" by stating that more chronic lifestyle diseases drugs, antibiotics, etc., may come under the price control net.</p><p>Around 16% of Unichem's domestic portfolio (in value terms) is under price control, the firm said in a presentation at the time of its first quarter results for 2015-16. The firm's top 10 brands contribute about 48% of domestic revenues.</p><p>Mody, though, indicated that the realignment of the firm's domestic acute, chronic and cardiac businesses had resulted in gains. </p><p>"The realignment of the portfolio and structure for the present is completed and we see an upswing in our business; however this is dynamic and is subject to changes in the external environment," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Ranked 26th, Unichem grew by 11.1% in August and saw domestic sales of about INR8.66bn ($133.7m) for the 12-months to August 2015, data from AIOCD AWACS, a market research agency that tracks retail sales, said. Unichem reported consolidated sales of INR12.02bn in 2014-15.</p><h2>Consolidation</h2><p>But experts cautioned that speculation around a potential Unichem deal need not necessarily signal an uptick in consolidation in the Indian domestic formulations sector, though such activity is perhaps long overdue. </p><p>"Valuations expectations of sellers are still very high - unlikely we are going to see a flurry of activity till the multiples come down," Navroz Mahudawala, managing director of Candle Partners, a boutique investment banking firm, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He also referred to the "mixed response" to some of the past transactions that global buyers like Daiichi Sankyo [which acquired Ranbaxy - later sold to Sun Pharma] and Abbott [acquired Piramal's domestic formulations business] had done. Valuation expectations, analysts say, skyrocketed post the Abbott-Piramal deal in 2010, which valued Piramal's business at about eight times sales and 30 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).</p><p>Mahudawala said some innovator companies who are acquirers are still "extremely choosy" of the kind of companies they would like to buy and the brands fit with their portfolio. </p><p>"Indian sellers would need to reconcile that the strategic value of the business lies in the domestic formulations business and not in the mixed business plan which includes generic exports, active pharmaceutical ingredients and CRAMS [Contract Research and Manufacturing Services].This is the single most factor which is stopping the consolidation process," Mahudawala declared.</p>
