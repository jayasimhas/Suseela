<p>A young Indian small molecule discovery firm appears to have caught the fancy of none less than oncology giant, Roche, in the high potential indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) inhibitor space.</p><p>New Delhi-based Curadev Pharma has clinched a research collaboration and exclusive licensing pact with Roche for its IDO-1 and TDO (tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygenase) inhibitors &ndash; a deal which could see the Indian firm rake in over $550m in upfront and milestone payments.</p><p>Roche's deal is not really surprising given the huge interest globally in IDO inhibitors for evaluation in combination regimens with other immunotherapy agents, especially programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. The Curadev agreement appears to be structured somewhat along the lines of Roche group firm Genentech's deal with NewLink Genetics in the IDO/TDO inhibitor space last year.</p><p>Curadev's pact with Roche covers the development of its lead preclinical immune tolerance inhibitor and a collaboration with the multinational's research and early development organization to further explore the IDO and TDO pathways.</p><p>"Curadev's preclinical lead compound, a small molecule that shows potent inhibition of the two rate-limiting enzymes in the tryptophan to kynurenine metabolic pathways, has the potential for monotherapy as well as combination with Roche's broad oncology pipeline and portfolio," a statement from the firm said.</p><p>As per the terms of the agreement, Curadev will receive an upfront payment of $25m and up to $530 million in milestone payments subject to the achievement of certain predetermined events and sales levels. It is also eligible to "escalating" royalties potentially reaching double digits for the collaboration's first product developed and commercialized by Roche. </p><p>Milestones and royalties will also be due to the Indian firm on additional products resulting from the research collaboration. Roche is to fund future R&D, manufacturing and commercialization costs and will also provide additional funding to Curadev to support the research collaboration.</p><p>Founded in 2010 by a clutch of professionals from the pharma and biotech space, Curadev is focused on the creation and out-licensing of pre-IND assets and IND packages for drug development. The firm, whose pipeline indicates development activity in the breast cancer and inflammation space, is also working with the University of Greenwich, UK, to create improved cyclodextrin-enabled formulations that are amenable to continuous process chemistry, details on its website said.</p><h2>Competitive landscape</h2><p>There has been significant deal and alliance activity around IDO inhibitors, with almost all the big names vying for a share of potential future action in the space.</p><p>Earlier this year, Bristol Myers Squibb <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Flexus-flips-IDO-inhibitors-to-Bristol-Myers-for-up-to-1.25bn-356901%5d" target="_new">acquired</a> Flexus Biosciences for up to $1.25bn, including full rights to F001287, Flexus' lead preclinical, small-molecule IDO1-inhibitor and an IDO/TDO discovery program that includes its IDO-selective, IDO/TDO dual and TDO-selective compound libraries. </p><p>Last year, NewLink Genetics signed a <a href="http://%5b%20http:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/NewLink-Genentech-deal-could-be-worth-more-than-1bn-354573%5d" target="_new">collaboration</a> worth over $1.15bn in upfront and potential milestone payments under which Genentech is to develop NLG919 and other IDO inhibitors, including programs that combine the drugs with multiple Genentech immunotherapies. </p><p>Genentech also entered an early-stage clinical trial <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Genentech-combo-deal-Incyte-bags-another-anti-PD-bigshot-353108%5d" target="_new">deal</a> with Incyte, to test a combination of Genentech's PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor MPDL3280A with Incyte's oral IDO1 inhibitor, INCB24360 to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p>Incyte has similar deals with AstraZeneca's MedImmune to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MedImmune&rsquo;s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in combination with INCB24360. BMS too has <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bristol-Myers-Incyte-to-study-PD-1IDO1-combination-352007%5d" target="_new">linked up with Incyte</a> on the same product, in combination with its PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab, while Merck & Co signed up with Incyte to study a combination of INCB24360 with Merck's anti-PD-1 candidate MK-3475 (Keytruda) in February last year. </p><p>Keytruda (pembrolizumab), previously known as lambrolizumab/MK-3475, was <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714%5d" target="_new">approved</a> by the FDA last year. </p>
