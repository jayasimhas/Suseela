<p>With approvals of drugs in the US to treat orphan conditions hitting an all-time high in 2014, new legislative efforts with new incentives that have the potential to be enacted in 2015 and science moving at an unprecedented pace because of new molecular research capabilities, big things are happening in rare diseases, officials declared at a 27 February conference hosted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>A little over 30 years ago there wasn't much happening by industry in bringing products to market for rare diseases, with only about 10 orphan drugs approved during 1970s, said Dr Gayatri Rao, director of the FDA's Office of Orphan Product Development.</p><p>But since the enactment on 4 January 1983 of the <i>Orphan Drug Act</i> &ndash; which provides certain incentives, like tax credits and seven additional years of exclusivity for eligible approved therapies &ndash; there have been close to 500 products cleared for the US market, Dr Rao said during the NIH conference, which was convened to mark the international Rare Disease Day, held on the last day of February each year. </p><p>And in 2014, the FDA approved more new molecular entities (NMEs) targeting rare diseases than it had ever done in the agency's history &ndash; 17 biopharmaceutical therapies, or 41% of the NMEs OK'd for the US market by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), she declared (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-2014-a-year-for-orphan-drugs-anti-PD-1s-2nd-chancers-355915" target="_new">5 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-US-and-EU-new-drug-approvals-2014-356938" target="_new">25 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Overall, the FDA approved 48 orphan drugs in 2014, which also included five biologics cleared by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and 25 "repurposed" medicines granted the go-ahead by CDER, Dr Rao said.</p><p>The FDA also received a record high number of requests for orphan drug designations in 2014 &ndash; nearly 450 &ndash; which Dr Rao noted was well over one per day. Of those, the FDA granted about 300, she said. </p><p>To date, the FDA has received over 4,700 orphan status requests, with about 3,200 granted since 1983.</p><p>But Dr Rao acknowledged there is a steep drop off of what gets incentivized through the orphan drug designation and what ultimately makes it to the US market.</p><p>"It takes a lot to get from an animal model through to clinical development and product approval and marketing," she said. </p><p>While some have raised concerns the FDA has not done enough for orphan diseases in children, Dr Rao pointed out the agency last year granted BioMarin Pharmaceuticals the very first rare pediatric disease priority review voucher &ndash; an incentive created by Congress as part of the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act</i> which permits a company that develop a medicine for an orphan indication that meets the criteria and successfully gets that product approved a priority review on a subsequent application. (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Vimizim-BioMarin-wins-1st-rare-peds-disease-voucher-350063" target="_new">15 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The vouchers are transferrable and BioMarin in fact sold the one it possessed for $67.5m to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, which used it help speed the review of their proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">31 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-leapfrogs-Amgen-with-US-priority-review-for-alirocumab-356357" target="_new">29 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Representative Leonard Lance (Republican-New Jersey), co-chairman of the House Rare Disease Caucus, noted the draft legislative package from Energy & Commerce Committee chief Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), revealed on 27 January, contains several provisions aimed at improving the orphan drug development and approval process (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/21st-Century-Cures-leaders-vow-to-work-out-differences-356688" target="_new">11 February 2015</a>).</p><p>"Use your megaphone to tell those who may have lost faith in the legislative process that something big is happening," Representative Lance told advocates at the NIH conference.</p><p>Among those measures is a bill sponsored by the New Jersey lawmaker known as the <i>Modernizing Our Drug and Diagnostics Evaluation and Regulatory Network (MODDERN) Cures Act</i> (HR 3116), which he said would "create a system that rewards efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of rare disease patients by encouraging the development of drugs abandoned in the development process."</p><p>The <i>MODDERN Cures Act</i> would establish a new category of medicines, known as "dormant therapies."</p><p>"These drugs offer promise to treat conditions with unmet medical needs," Representative Lance said.</p><p>Rare diseases often are difficult to diagnose, with about 80% caused by abnormalities in a person's genes, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).</p><p>"Rare diseases are one of the most scientifically complex health challenges we face," said John Castellani, president and CEO of PhRMA, which released a <a href="http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/PhRMA-Decade-of-Innovation-Rare-Diseases.pdf" target="_new">report</a> last week highlighting several advances over the past decade in five rare diseases leading to improvements in patient survival and quality of life: chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, hereditary angioedema and cystic fibrosis. </p><p>Research into rare diseases has benefited several areas of investigation overall, said NIH Director Dr Francis Collins.</p><p>He pointed to the discoveries of his own lab in researching Progeria, an extremely rare genetic disorder that causes children to age rapidly, which has provided insight into the normal processes of aging &ndash; "which affects virtually everybody on the planet."</p><p>Dr Collins emphasized that rare disease research is "difficult, expensive and not the sort of thing you can count on happening just because you want it to."</p><p>It takes time, talent and some serendipity, the NIH chief said, adding that the successful development of new therapies for rare diseases also critically relies on the "whole ecosystem of public and private investment."</p><p>"Science is moving at unprecedented pace because of our ability to uncover the molecular causes of diseases," Dr Collins said.</p><p>And the NIH is leading the way on rare disease research, he said, pointing to the progress of its Undiagnosed Diseases Program, which Dr Collins said has received nearly 10,000 inquiries from patients or their doctors seeking answers to medical mysteries no one else has been able to solve for them, of which 3,000 applications have been approved (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Disease-detectives-NIH-network-to-solve-ultrarare-mysteries-352619" target="_new">02 July 2014</a>).</p><p>"For rare diseases, if NIH isn't working on them, they are not going to get much attention," Dr Collins said.</p><p>But, he lamented, his agency is moving at a much slower pace than it otherwise could be &ndash; not because of a lack of ideas or talent, but because the NIH's funding is limited. </p><p>"It would be wonderful to unleash this engine of discovery," Dr Collins said. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>CDC panel drops preference for MedImmune's FluMist</b></p><p>A panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week dropped its preference for use in children 2-8 years of MedImmune's FluMist, the only FDA-approved intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccine, citing new data showing there was no superior effectiveness of the product over the flu shot.</p><p>The move is a reverse course by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which had recommended FluMist over the injected influenza vaccine in June 2014 after a review of data from several influenza seasons suggested the nasal spray vaccine could offer better protection in the youngsters. </p><p>But data from the 2013-14 flu season showed there was no measurable effectiveness for FluMist in children 2-8 years against the A (H1N1) influenza virus, which was the predominant strain circulating during that season, while the injected vaccine was 60% effective in that age group.</p><p>Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca, blamed the poor performance of FluMist against H1N1 during 2013-14 on a mutation of the strain, which left the vaccine vulnerable to higher temperatures.</p><p>Neither the nasal spray vaccine nor the shot is working well against the predominant strain circulating in the US during the current Northern Hemisphere season, a mutated H3N2 virus, known as A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, which is different than the strain selected last year for the vaccine.</p><p>CDC officials reported last week the shot had slipped from the 26% efficacy in children reported in January to 15%, while the nasal spray demonstrated virtually no efficacy at all (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-vax-only-23-effective-12-most-adults-356168" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">19 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Profits-didnt-drive-flu-vaccine-decisions-US-officials-356531" target="_new">04 February 2015</a>).</p><p>In the overall population, the influenza vaccine was showing only 18% efficacy against the H3N2 mutated strain in the 2014-15 season &ndash; down from 23% reported in January. </p><p>"Although flu vaccine is the best way to prevent influenza infection, how well it works can vary," the CDC said, noting that since it began measuring vaccine effectiveness in 2004-05, estimates have ranged from 10% to 60%. </p><p>The ACIP's recommendation must be adopted by CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden and must then be incorporated into the 2015-16 influenza prevention and control recommendations and published in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, at which point it would become official policy from the agency.</p><p>An advisory panel to the FDA is meeting on 4 March to select the strains for the US vaccines for the 2015-16 flu season.</p><p>A group of expert advisers to the World Health Organization last week recommended the trivalent vaccines for the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere influenza season contain the same strains selected this past September for the Southern Hemisphere: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus. It recommended the quadrivalent vaccines also include the B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.</p><p>The CDC's ACIP last week also voted in favor of including Merck's recently approved human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine, Gardasil 9 in the recommendations for use of HPV vaccines (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Mercks-new-Gardasil-provides-broader-protection-355558" target="_new">11 December 2014</a>).</p><p>In addition, the CDC's panel voted unanimously in favor of recommending the two recently approved meningococcal group B vaccines, Pfizer's Trumenba and Novartis' Bexsero, for vaccination in people 10 years or older at high risk of developing the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-breakthrough-meningitis-B-vaccine-OKd-beats-Novartis-354744" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-meningitis-B-vaccine-Bexsero-OKd-in-US-356346" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Ebola survivor nurse suing Texas hospital</b></p><p>Nina Pham, one of two Dallas nurses who became infected with Ebola after caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the disease, is suing her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian, her lawyer said.</p><p>Ms Pham, who was the first known US transmission of Ebola, is claiming the hospital and its parent company, Texas Health Resources, failed to provide the nurse and her colleagues with the proper training and equipment to care for someone with Ebola, putting the healthcare workers&rsquo; well-being at risk.</p><p>She was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian on 10 October 2014 after reporting a fever (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">12 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Ms Pham and her colleague, Amber Vinson, contracted Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who had been infected in his homeland of Liberia before flying to the US in September. </p><p>When Mr Duncan first arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian's emergency room, the hospital had botched his diagnosis &ndash; sending him home with some antibiotics (scripintelligence.com <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gambling-on-Ebola-1st-US-case-sparks-stock-fervor-354228" target="_new">01 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Botched-Texas-Ebola-case-may-indicate-US-not-fully-prepared-354255" target="_new">02 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Texas-Ebola-mix-up-blamed-on-flawed-electronic-health-record-354276" target="_new">3 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Ebola-disclosures-get-messy-354299" target="_new">05 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Duncan returned to the hospital, but died a little over a week later on 8 October (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">09 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Ms Pham was later transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for care at its special clinical studies unit, which is designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists. Ms Vinson was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta &ndash; the same facility that had cared for the first two Americans to be treated in the US for Ebola, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. Both of the Texas Health nurses recovered from the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/2nd-Texas-nurse-survives-Ebola-discharged-from-hospital-354730" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-drugs-vaccines-advance-US-frets-354531" target="_new">17 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Miracle-ZMapp-or-a-strapping-immune-system-353501" target="_new">22 August 2014</a>).</p><p>This past October, Texas Health acknowledged it had made mistakes in Mr Duncan's initial diagnosis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Texas-hospital-admits-mistakes-in-Ebola-cases-354551" target="_new">20 October 2014</a>).</p><p>But Ms Pham, who was warmly greeted at the White House with a big hug by President Barack Obama after her discharge from the NIH Clinical Center on 24 October 2014, is asserting Texas Health used her to bolster its public image after failing so badly to care for Mr Duncan &ndash; even releasing a video of the nurse in her hospital bed without her permission.</p><p>A spokesman for Texas Health said the hospital is continuing to support Ms Pham and is hoping to resolve the matter amicably.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
