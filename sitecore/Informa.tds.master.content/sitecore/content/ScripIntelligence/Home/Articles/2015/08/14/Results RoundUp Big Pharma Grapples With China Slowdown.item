<p>If there was one overall signal to come out of multinationals' second quarter results, it was that China can no longer be relied upon to be the major driver of growth in emerging markets that it once was, as sales increases are slowing as a result of cost control policies and generic competition. But while several pharma firms' growth in this market fell into single digits in the quarter, the longer term prospects are still seen as positive given strong underlying fundamentals.</p><p>Lower growth in China's overall economy, increasing generic rivalry, official cost controls and greater competition from domestic firms in provincial tenders were some of the factors highlighted by multinational pharma firms in their most recent financial results as behind a general slowing in sales increases in the last quarter.</p><p>In most cases, the changes conspired to drag down into the single digits the often double-digit sales growth that has been enjoyed by such firms in the past, with the slowdown apparently gaining momentum in the last three months.</p><p>Novo Nordisk AS's Jakob Riis, executive vice president China, Pacific & Marketing summed up the prevailing mood succinctly during his firm's earnings briefing: "We just have to get used to that the market will operate with growth rates that are lower than we have seen historically, but growth for sure."</p><p>In the first quarter, there was still generally strong growth across the board for most multinationals, although signs of a slowing down were already beginning to emerge ("Big Pharma 1Q China Growth Roundup: The Winner Is&#8230;" &mdash; PharmAsia News, May 22, 2015 12:28 AM GMT).</p><p>While most MNCs experienced lower growth in China, Eli Lilly & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC actually slid into sales decreases in the second quarter, hit by product mix in addition to the range of factors above.
