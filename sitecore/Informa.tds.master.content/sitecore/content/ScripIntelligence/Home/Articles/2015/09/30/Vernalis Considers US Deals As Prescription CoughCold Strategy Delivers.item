<p><p><p>The UK public company Vernalis PLC now has a US sales force and commercial infrastructure and is looking to leverage those assets with product acquisitions or marketing deals that are complementary to its prescription cough and cold focus, according to company CEO Ian Garland.</p><p><p>"We don't have to acquire products or engage in M&A to make this an attractive business. But if the right opportunities come along at the right price with the right risk profile, we would consider them," Garland said in an interview.</p><p><p>There could also be opportunities to outsource its marketing team in the cough and cold off-season, Garland told a UK analysts briefing Sept. 29. Vernalis has changed its financial year-end to the end of June to coincide with the end of the cough and cold season in the Northern Hemisphere, and the company's unaudited 12-month and audited 18-month results were released before the briefing. Revenues totaled &pound;13.7m ($20.7m) in the 12 months, and the company recorded an operating loss of &pound;8.2m.</p><p><p>Vernalis&rsquo;s current focus on developing long-acting liquid cough and cold preparations for the US market is part of a three-year-old change of strategy for the once new chemical entity (NCE) research-centered UK biotech. It is now developing novel long-acting liquid cough/cold combinations with known ingredients. That change bore fruit Sept. 8, when Vernalis launched in the US its first long-acting liquid prescription cough/cold therapy <i>Tuzistra XR</i> (codeine polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex). </p><p><p>"The US is about the only market where patients can choose to have a premium-priced product," Garland noted. "In government-funded health care systems like those in Europe, patients are not given that choice."</p><p><p>Vernalis is working towards US payers granting Tuzistra XR tier 3 unrestricted access in their plans, and it has achieved that with Express Scripts Holding Co., OptumRx Inc. and Prime Therapeutics; CVS Caremark is reviewing its cough and cold coverage in October, and contracts are being negotiated with other health insurers, Garland said. The product has a wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $499 for a 473 mil (16 oz) bottle, but with co-pay assistance programs, patients are likely to pay as little as $25. </p><p><p>The company also has a pipeline of other cough and cold preparations, with undisclosed constituents, that it intends to market in the US, Garland continued. They include CCP-07, on track to be submitted for FDA approval in 2016; CCP-08, that should complete stability testing in the second half of 2015; and CCP-05 and CCP-06, that are expected to complete proof of concept studies by the end of 2016.</p><p><p>Although it is too early to know if the Tuzistra XR launch has been a success, the company reported that just that one product has the potential to transform Vernalis into a profitable and cash generative business.</p><p><h2>Low-Risk Strategy</h2><p><p>Long-acting liquid cough and cold preparations were targeted as a significant market opportunity because of their low development risk - they represent a gap in the market because it is extremely difficult to make such formulations. Vernalis is working with US company Tris Pharma Inc. that has the appropriate long-acting liquids technology, and secured it for use in the cough and cold space back in 2012. </p><p><p>Vernalis's strategy was backed by a $104m fundraising from investors in 2012. Most of them continued backing the company's strategy even when its share price sank, Garland said. The company has continued to license out its remaining new chemical entities in research &ndash; the potential CNS therapy V81444 and the potential anticancer V2006 have been licensed to partners, and there are now only three un-partnered programs. The company is no longer investing in NCEs.</p><p><p>The UK company also receives royalties - &pound;4.9m in the 12 months to June 30 2015 - from the marketing of the migraine product frovatriptan by licensee Menarini Group. Patent protection on the product is expected to expire in December 2015.</p><p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
