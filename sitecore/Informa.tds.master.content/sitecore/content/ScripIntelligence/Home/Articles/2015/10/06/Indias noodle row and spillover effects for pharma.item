<p>Nestle's run-in with Indian regulators over its popular noodle brand, Maggi, being "unsafe" and hazardous" for human consumption may just have put the spotlight on the fast-growing nutraceuticals segment quite like the heightened focus on site compliance in the aftermath of "Ranbaxygate" some years ago.</p><p>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is now reported to be monitoring the special dietary products segment closely and a recent list of product approval proposals rejected by the FSSAI on assessment of risk/safety includes nutraceuticals and supplements of a clutch of pharmaceutical firms including Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy Laboratories (now part of Sun Pharma), Sami Labs, Theon Pharmaceuticals and Aristo Pharmaceuticals, among others. </p><p>The US FDA and the Department of Justice, working on inputs from whistle-blower Dinesh Thakur, some years ago unravelled a complicated trail of falsified records and deficient manufacturing practices at Ranbaxy, leading to seemingly more intense scrutiny of drug manufacturing in India.</p><p>"The Maggi issue has opened up a Pandora's Box," Dr Ajit Dangi, president and CEO of Danssen Consulting and a former director general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, which represents leading multinational firms, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Among the key aspects that require "urgent attention", Dr Dangi flagged up the need for a "clear demarcation of responsibilities" between the FSSAI, India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and other regulatory agencies like the state FDAs to ensure effective surveillance of the quality of products. An expert with a foreign drug firm told <i>Scrip</i> how most often, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies are caught up in "interdepartmental red-tape" and waste time "navigating bureaucracy" rather than getting the desired effect on the ground.</p><p>Local media reports quoted a senior FSSAI official referring to a growing queue of special dietary products and supplements awaiting approval. The official also noted that "to avoid rigorous scrutiny of drug approval" many pharmaceutical firms prefer to take the food route for such products.</p><p>Nestle earlier this month pulled its Maggi noodles off the Indian market after government test reports suggested that certain samples contained lead beyond permissible limits and were mislabelled with respect to the taste enhancer monosodium glutamate. The FSSAI then directed the Swiss multinational to take all nine variants of the noodle brand off the market. Nestle, which estimates a hit of around INR3.2bn ($50m) from the recall and related activities, has since moved the Bombay High Court.</p><h2>FSSAI list</h2><p>Meanwhile, an FSSAI list of product approvals that stand rejected and updated as of 30 April 2015 include, among others: Ranbaxy's Revital tablets (rejected in September 2014) and Revital capsule/Revital Senior tablets/ Revital Women tablets (all rejected in January 2014); Sun Pharmaceutical Industries' New Anofer and new Xtraglo tablets (both rejected in September 2014); and Trypchym and Bromelain (both rejected in April 2015) from Biocon.</p><p>Sun Pharma, which closed the merger with Ranbaxy in March this year, told <i>Scrip</i> that it had no comments to offer. It's unclear if any of the rejections have since been set aside. </p><p>Revital, which is marketed as a daily health supplement and comprises minerals, vitamins and ginseng, is seen as among Ranbaxy's lead products in the consumer healthcare space. Revital was ranked the fourth largest brand in Indian pharmaceutical market as per IMS Health data for the 12 months to March 2014. Both Revital [a pack procured by <i>Scrip</i> carries a FSSAI licence number 10013011000947] and Sun's New Anofer multivitamin and multimineral tablets are available on the market.</p><p>Biocon, however, clarified that it is not importing or marketing the concerned products under the FSSAI Act. "Hence there is no need for any product recall," it told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>India is estimated to have over 8,000 registered and non-registered nutraceuticals, herbs and related firms and a recent report by MP Advisors, an Indian strategic business advisory firm, sees the global nutraceutical industry springing to $205bn by the close of 2017. India, though just 1.6% of the global nutraceutical market, is seen growing manifold in the next few years.</p><h2>Resources and surveillance </h2><p>But looking beyond the noodle row, industry experts generally lamented the resources crunch at the FSSAI.</p><p>Dr Dangi, also a former president and executive director of Johnson &Johnson India, said that the FSSAI appeared to be "poorly equipped" to regulate the complex portfolio of packaged and processed foods, dietary supplements, functional foods, herbal products, packaged drinking water, etc, manufactured not only by reputed companies but also small and medium-sized enterprises and even "fly by night operators." </p><p>Among a string of suggestions, he highlighted how testing laboratories need to be upgraded to have an adequate number of trained analytical chemists, modern instrumentation such as X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrometry, etc, which are required to detect very small amounts of heavy metals, pesticides, food additives, etc.</p><p>Dr R B Smarta, managing director of Interlink Marketing Consultancy, though, said that the FSSAI is well-equipped to handle issues concerning nutraceuticals, functional food and dietary supplements from the "regulatory point of view." </p><p>"They have gazetted all regulations, except, to some extent, for medical foods. All the regulations are ready since we follow the international Codex guidelines. However, we are not equipped pan-India since we don't have adequate number of testing labs. NABL [National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories] accredited labs are few," Dr Smarta told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The formation of the joint Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization Food Standards Programme with the Codex Alimentarius Commission as its principal organ was approved in 1963. The US, EU and some Asian countries are said to be among those that follow the Codex Alimentarius guidelines for upper safety limits of vitamins and minerals in nutraceutical compositions.</p><p>Dr Smarta also underscored the need to consider structure/function claims in the area of nutraceuticals and functional foods. Regulation of products with other health claims should continue as drugs.</p><p>Post-marketing surveillance for nutraceuticals is required, he suggested, given that there are no marketing parameters, which again need to be developed in India.</p><p> "It will effectively put an end to a plethora of unnecessary claims that are made for such products," Dr Smarta explained.</p><p>The expert with a foreign drug firm, however, said that most large pharmaceutical companies (especially multinational corporations) have internal policies that demand a very effective quality control and PMS data recording. He believes it is the smaller domestic companies that may probably see this more as a "cost" than an "investment "and try to avoid it if the law of the land doesn't call for its strict enforcement.</p><p>"The solution for bad enforcement of the law does not require a new &ndash; often more draconian &ndash; law. This fosters corruption and brings the license raj to memory. It is important to ascertain where the real problem lies &ndash; at the site of production, a failure of quality norms, supply chain issues or merely media hype," he told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The Maggi case seems to be more "media hyperbole than an actual public health issue," he added.</p>
