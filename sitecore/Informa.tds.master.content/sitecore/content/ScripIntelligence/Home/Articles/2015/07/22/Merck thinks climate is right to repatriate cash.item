<p><p>With there being potential for change in Washington, DC, US companies have cash repatriation top of mind. Merck & Co, which has about $29bn in its war chest, sees potential to bring cash home. </p><p>During its second quarter earnings call on 28 July, Merck Chief Financial Officer Rob Davis noted that with 80% to 90% of its cash housed overseas, the company is following events in Washington closely. </p><p>"Obviously, we are very supportive of comprehensive tax reform. And I think listening to the dialogue as it's evolving in Washington, clearly it is something that I think is a possibility. As we look at it, it's important that it is comprehensive, that it does look at a territorial system, that it does consider a flat tax and it does look at ways to advantage companies that develop intellectual property in the United States," the exec said. </p><p>Currently, US companies have to pay a 35% corporate tax rate on anything they earn globally &ndash; higher than any other industrialized nation. Companies receive credits for payments to foreign governments, but then have to pay the difference when they return the money back to the US to either return to shareholders or make acquisitions. </p><p>Due to the high tax rate, many companies have tried to conduct reverse mergers that would allow them to move overseas and get access to their cash, but the US government put a stop to such repatriation with a Treasury policy change last September. </p><p>Yet, discussions in Washington have shifted as the President tries to bring more cash back into the country to help rebuild the highway system. While these talks are still ongoing, they offer cash-rich pharma companies a lot of hope. </p><p>"As far as the cash we have offshore and what we would do if we did have a major repatriation, right now I don't want to get into specifics about a strategy. I would just go back to say our overall capital allocation philosophy remains the same. First and foremost, we are going to fund the business. And then beyond that, we will look to deploy capital towards business development opportunities, primarily focused in areas that help to augment our pipeline," Mr Davis added. </p><p>The big pharma announced a deal in conjunction with its earnings release, acquiring Israel's cCam Biotherapeutics in a move that will bolster its cancer immunotherapy franchise. Through a subsidiary, Merck is paying $95m upfront in cash and has agreed to pay $510m in milestone payments tied to development, regulatory and commercial milestones. </p><p>The deal adds to Merck's potential in immuno-oncology with a pipeline of several preclinical immunotherapies aimed at various targets. The company also has a Phase I candidate that targets CEACAM1, a checkpoint protein that could have potential in a variety of cancers, including lung, bladder, colorectal and ovarian. </p><p><p>
