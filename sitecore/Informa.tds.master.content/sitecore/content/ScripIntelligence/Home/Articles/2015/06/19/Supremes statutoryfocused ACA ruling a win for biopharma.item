<p>In declaring that Congress passed the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) to "improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them," the US Supreme Court on 25 June, again, upheld President Barack Obama's healthcare law &ndash; with Chief Justice John Roberts, for the second time, coming to its rescue.</p><p>The court ruled 6-3 the ACA's tax credit subsidies &ndash; considered the law's linchpin &ndash; can be granted to eligible Americans enrolled in private health insurance plans, whether they bought their coverage through online marketplaces, known as exchanges, run by a state or those operated by the federal government.</p><p>"Today is a victory for hardworking Americans all across this country whose lives will continue to become more secure in a changing economy because of this law," President Obama said from the White House Rose Garden, noting the Supreme Court had "upheld a critical part of this law &ndash; the part that's made it easier for Americans to afford health insurance regardless of where you live." </p><p>The ACA, the president said, "is not an abstract thing anymore."</p><p>"This is not a set of political talking points. This is reality," Mr Obama declared.</p><p>For biopharmaceutical manufacturers and other industries in the healthcare sector, the Supreme Court's ruling is a significant positive development, because it ensures the companies' customers who receive the subsidies are likely to continue to afford the firms' products and services, said Ralph Tyler, a partner in the litigation and government divisions in the Baltimore and Washington law offices of Venable.</p><p>"The more people who have health insurance, the more consumers of biopharmaceuticals and other healthcare services there will be, and obviously, that's a net positive for the industry," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>But had the Supreme Court ruled that the two-thirds of Americans currently getting tax credits subsidies to help cover the costs of paying for their health plan premiums were not eligible for those benefits because they registered online through exchanges run by the federal government &ndash; the argument made by the plaintiffs in the case, known as <i>King v Burwell</i> &ndash; those people likely would no longer be able to afford their insurance and would drop out, meaning they also may not get their prescriptions filled, resulting in a financial loss for drug makers, Mr Tyler told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Indeed, about 87% of the Americans enrolled in the private health insurance plans through the ACA receive the tax credit subsidies, according to Health and Human Services (HHS).</p><p>But also significant for drug manufacturers in providing more surety about their ACA plan customers is the way the chief justice wrote the majority opinion &ndash; basing the decision on the statutory language of the law and not the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to set regulations using its interpretation of an ambiguous statute, said Washington lawyer James Napoli, a partner in the employee benefits practice group at Seyfarth Shaw.</p><p>That's noteworthy, Mr Napoli told <i>Scrip</i>, because it means it would take an act of Congress, such as an amendment or full or partial repeal, to change the subsidies structure of the law &ndash; and therefore, whoever wins the White House in the 2016 elections cannot simply force a change through the regulatory process on their own.</p><p><b>The complaint</b></p><p>At issue in the case, whose oral arguments the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">heard in March</a>, was the interpretation of four words in the ACA &ndash; "established by the state" &ndash; which opponents insisted meant Americans who enrolled in plans through the federally run exchanges were not eligible for the tax credit subsidies. </p><p>Less than a third of the states created their own exchanges, so the federal government stepped in and set up the other two-thirds on behalf of those that chose not to establish the online marketplaces. </p><p>The subsidies are part of the ACA's three-pronged reform effort, which was patterned on a successful 2006 Massachusetts law: upgrade insurance market regulations, require coverage and provide a way to reduce the cost, with the latter hinging on the federal tax credits, which are available to individuals and households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line.</p><p>The ACA requires individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS, unless the cost of buying insurance would exceed 8% of the person's income. </p><p>The IRS had interpreted the ACA language as meaning the tax credits were available regardless of whether the exchange in which a person enrolled was established and operated by a state or HHS.</p><p>The four plaintiffs, who live in Virginia, where the exchange is operated by HHS, challenged the IRS rule in federal district court. But that court dismissed the suit &ndash; holding that the ACA unambiguously made tax credits available to individuals enrolled through a federal exchange. </p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that decision, although it said the language in the ACA was ambiguous, and therefore, deferred to the IRS' interpretation, referencing a 1984 law, <i>Chevron USA v Natural Resources Defense Council</i>, which said that when a law is ambiguously written, a court should defer to the agency that is charged with enforcing it.</p><p><b>Inartful, but legal</b></p><p>But in his majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts said the <i>Chevron</i> decision "does not provide the appropriate framework here."</p><p>"The tax credits are one of the ACA's key reforms and whether they are available on federal exchanges is a question of deep 'economic and political significance,' and had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly," he said. </p><p>And, the chief declared, "it is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the IRS, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort." </p><p>Chief Justice Roberts said it was then the court's task to determine the correct reading of the section of the law in question, known as 36B.</p><p>He acknowledged the ACA "contains more than a few examples of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Inartful-v-colorful-language-the-SCOTUScare-ruling-359125" target="_new">inartful drafting</a>."</p><p>But, the chief said, the court nevertheless must do its best &ndash; bearing in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme. </p><p>And in this case, Chief Justice Roberts said, "the statutory scheme compels the court to reject petitioners' interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any state with a federal exchange, and likely create the very 'death spirals' that Congress designed the act to avoid." </p><p>Venable's Mr Tyler said those statements from the chief justice made it clear the plaintiffs' arguments fell short in not having any real answer about how Congress could have ever possibly intended for millions to not have the subsidies if they registered through a federal exchange or how to address the situation if the court ruled against the Obama administration &ndash; counting on the justices to blindly reach such a result.</p><p>While Chief Justice Roberts said the plaintiffs' "plain-meaning arguments are strong," he said the ACA's context and structure compelled the conclusion the law allows tax credits for insurance purchased on any exchange created under Obamacare. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
