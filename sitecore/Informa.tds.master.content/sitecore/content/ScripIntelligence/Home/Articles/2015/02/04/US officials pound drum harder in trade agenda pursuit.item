<p>Using a report that showed export activities brought $2.3tn and 11.7 million new jobs to the US economy last year, Obama administration officials on 9 April pounded the drum harder in their pursuit for trade promotion authority (TPA) for the president in advance of Senate legislation expected to be unveiled next week and the ongoing push to get lawmakers on board with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) free-trade agreements. </p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization have supported both the TPP and the TTIP.</p><p>The US is close to wrapping up the final terms of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Break-logjam-on-Asia-Pacific-trade-pact-354960" target="_new">TPP</a> with 11 Asia-Pacific nations: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/USEU-trade-investment-big-deal-pact-could-serve-biopharma-well-339997" target="_new">TTIP</a> involves ongoing talks between the US and 28 member countries of the European Union.</p><p>"We need new trade agreements to level the playing field for new businesses," US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker told reporters during a 9 April media briefing. "But if we are going to get these new trade deals done, we need Congress to act quickly and pass trade promotion legislation."</p><p>TPA, often referred to as fast track, would give President Barack Obama the authority to negotiate international trade agreements, which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals.</p><p>"For the last 40 years, trade promotion legislation has allowed both Democratic and Republican presidents to pursue new trade agreements that support American jobs, eliminate barriers to exports and level the playing field for our companies, farmers, ranchers and our workers," Secretary Pritzker said. </p><p>She said the administration was "anxiously awaiting to see the language" of the TPA bill.</p><p>Giving President Obama TPA, said US Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman, would allow the US to "sit down with its trading partners and speak with one voice and make sure we get the best possible deal."</p><p>Secretary Pritzker insisted the TPA would allow Congress to "set high standards, objectives and priorities" for US trade negotiators working on deals like the TPP and TTIP.</p><p>"With these new trade agreements, I'm confident we can keep America ripe for more growth, ready for more progress and open for more business," Secretary Pritzker said. </p><p>The TPP especially, Ambassador Froman said, is important to the Obama administration's policy of "rebalancing towards Asia" &ndash; often referred to as the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-US-seeks-to-get-TPP-Asia-pivot-back-on-track-354941" target="_new">Asia pivot</a>.</p><p>"TPP is critical piece of that," he declared. "It reflects our sense that our economic well-being is very much tied up with the economic well-being and the future of the region. We are a Pacific power and we want to be well integrated with the growing markets of this region. It's of importance economically and strategically."</p><p>Secretary Pritzker noted that Asia-Pacific "is the fastest growing region in the world in terms of middle class."</p><p>"We've never seen this before in the history of the world where you have a middle class has gone from $570m to $2.7bn in just 15 years," she said. "This is the opportunity we want to make sure our companies have the chance to play on a level playing field. That's why trade agreements are so important."</p><p>Ambassador Froman noted the TPP covers nearly 40% of the global economy, with "some of the fastest growing markets in the world."</p><p>But right now, he said, "the rules of the road in some of the highest growth markets like Asia are up for grabs."</p><p>China and other countries, Ambassador Froman warned, are "actively negotiating agreements with a different set of rules."</p><p>"They're not pushing for the same standards we are," he argued.</p><p><b>Democratic pushback</b></p><p>But President Obama has received <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-faces-more-trade-pushback-from-Dems-356352" target="_new">pushback</a> from members of Congress from both sides of the aisle on his trade agenda &ndash; even from the top Democrat in the Senate, Senator Harry Reid (Nevada) who has said he's "always been suspect over my entire career" of trade agreements.</p><p>Another Democrat, Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), who many in the party would like to see run for president &ndash; something she again insisted this week she is not planning on doing &ndash; has adamantly opposed the TPP, especially the proposal to establish investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunals, which would determine if a nation's laws harmed a firm's or investor's expected future profits, and if so, allow them to claim damages for actions that have been shown to reduce the value of an investment, or "indirect expropriation."</p><p>Speaking on 9 April on CBS This Morning, Senator Warren called the ISDS proposal "dangerous."</p><p>She has insisted that ISDS tribunals would allow foreign companies to challenge American laws without ever stepping foot in an American court.</p><p><b>Impeding access to affordable drugs?</b></p><p>Based on documents <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">leaked online last month</a> by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen argued the ISDS tribunals would allow biopharmaceutical companies to demand cash compensation for claimed violations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules about the creation, limitation or revocation of intellectual property rights. </p><p>The ISDS proposal, Public Citizen asserted, "could empower individual foreign investors to directly challenge governments over policies to ensure access to affordable medicines, claiming that they constitute TPP-prohibited 'expropriations' of intellectual property rights" if the tribunals deem them to violate WTO rules.</p><p>But a USTR spokesman told <i>Scrip</i> Public Citizen was wrong about the relationship between the investment rules and IP rights in the TPP agreement. </p><p>He insisted the relevant investment rules don't require governments to compensate IP rights holders for any breach of WTO commitments. </p><p>Instead, he said, the language provides that specific requirements for compensation won't apply where governments take certain WTO-consistent IP measures. </p><p>The provision Public Citizen has cited, he said, is a safeguard for governments, not a constraint.</p><p>While some of Senator Warren's questions are "important" and some of the criticism from her and others is justified because of poorly written agreements, "the reality is, that ISDS does not and cannot require countries to change any law or regulation," Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy, wrote in a 26 February White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/26/investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-questions-and-answers" target="_new">blog</a>.</p><p>Through the TPP, Mr Zients contended, "we can set a new, higher set of standards, stronger safeguards and better transparency provisions."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
