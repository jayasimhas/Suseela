<p>Celgene failed to convince the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) to impose sanctions against Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at Hayman Capital Management, and his self-created Coalition for Affordable Drugs, and dismiss his inter partes review (IPR) petitions on the grounds of abuse of process and improper use of the proceedings.</p><p>The PTAB's denial of Celgene's motion is a major win for Bass, who so far has been on a losing streak with the board in his pursuit to invalidate patents held by a "small minority" of drug makers that he has insisted "contain no meaningful innovations."</p><p>Patents on Celgene's thalidomide analogue Revlimid (lenalidomide) are among those Bass has sought to bring down.</p><p>Bass has filed about 30 IPR petitions so far.</p><p>But the PTAB has refused to institute trials on the hedge fund manager's IPR petitions challenging patents held by Biogen and Acorda Therapeutics on their multiple sclerosis medicines Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bass-Denied-Trials-In-Acorda-Patent-Challenges-Shares-Soar-360093" target="_new">Ampyra</a> (dalfampridine), respectively.</p><p>And <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Of-Kangaroos-And-Bass-IPR-Patent-Challenges-Going-Awry-360303" target="_new">earlier this month</a>, the board, in an unusual move, said it wanted to know whether the IPR petitions filed by Bass and his coalition challenging a patent, known as 7,056,886, owned by NPS Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Shire in February, covering gastrointestinal drugs Lialda (delayed-release mesalamine) and Gattex (teduglutide), should be dismissed for "abuse of process."</p><p>The PTAB asked the parties to submit additional briefings answering a set of four specific questions.</p><p>Earlier this year, Celgene filed a motion with the PTAB alleging Bass' petitions were driven entirely by an admitted profit motive unrelated to the purpose of the <i>American Invents Act</i> (AIA) &ndash; the law that created the IPR proceedings, which are intended to be a faster and more affordable way for third parties to challenge patents than going through the U.S. court system.</p><p>Celgene insisted Bass' IPR petitions were unrelated to a competitive interest in the validity of the challenged patents and his reasons for seeking the reviews were "illegitimate."</p><p>The PTAB told Celgene in June it could <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-What-to-do-about-inter-partes-reviews-Reforming-reforms-359257" target="_new">file the sanction motions</a> to dismiss the IPR petitions filed by Bass, although the board then emphasized that its grant of authorization was "not a decision on the merits of patent owner's allegation of abuse of process."</p><p>The PTAB said Celgene had to specifically address in its brief the elements required to establish an abuse of process; any evidence of intent that supports or undercuts the allegation of abuse of process in these cases; and the standard of proof that applies when deciding a motion for sanctions.</p><p>The PTAB said the burden of proof was on Celgene's shoulders.</p><p>The company insisted in its motion for the sanctions that Bass' purported altruistic motive of lowering drug prices for consumers was a pretext and that his real aim was to profit from the IPR review.</p><p>Celgene argued that if the PTAB permits such a strategy to continue, the board would be inundated with similar petitions, while no public company that relies on patents would be safe from the "unnecessary" petitions from for-profit organizations misusing the IPRs as investment strategies.</p><p>But the PTAB didn't buy that argument &ndash; declaring that "Profit is at the heart of nearly every patent and nearly every inter partes review" and as such, an "economic motive for challenging a patent claim does not itself raise abuse of process issues." </p><p>The board said it took no position on the merits of short-selling as an investment strategy other than "it is legal, and regulated." </p><p>The PTAB also was unconvinced by Celgene of its contention that Bass had no competitive interest in the patents he was challenging or the technology covered by the patents and that his motivation for profit, combined with a lack of a competitive interest, was contrary to the AIA's purpose and represented an improper use of the proceeding.</p><p>The board pointed out the AIA allows people who are not the patent owners to file IPR petitions &ndash; noting "this is in contrast to covered business method reviews, which require a party or privy to have been sued or charged with infringement of the patent."</p><p>And, the PTAB said, "Congress did not limit inter partes reviews to parties having a specific competitive interest in the technology covered by the patents."</p><p>The board also shot down Celgene's argument that Bass' IPR petitions were contrary to the AIA's intent of providing a expeditious and less costly alternative to litigation for challenging patents. </p><p>"The purpose of the AIA was not limited to just providing a less costly alternative to litigation," the PTAB said. "Rather, the AIA sought to establish a more efficient and streamlined patent system that improved patent quality, while at the same time limiting unnecessary and counterproductive litigation costs. The AIA was designed to encourage the filing of meritorious patentability challenges, by any person who is not the patent owner, in an effort to further improve patent quality."</p><p>AbbVie has filed a similar motion for sanctions against Bass, for which a decision is pending.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
