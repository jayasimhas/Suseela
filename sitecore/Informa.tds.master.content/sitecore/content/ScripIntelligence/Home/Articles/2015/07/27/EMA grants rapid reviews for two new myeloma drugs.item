<p>The European Medicines Agency is to review two novel therapies for multiple myeloma under its accelerated assessment procedure in an effort to get the drugs to market as soon as possible. </p><p>The agency's main scientific committee, the CHMP, has just accepted an approval application for Bristol-Myers Squibb/AbbVie's MAb, elotuzumab, which includes data from the Phase III ELOQUENT-2 trial. Takeda meanwhile said it would submit a filing for its oral proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in the next few weeks, with data from the Phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study.</p><p>Elotuzumab, which has orphan medicine designation in the EU, will be evaluated as a combination therapy for multiple myeloma patients who have received one or more prior therapies. This is the first regulatory filing for the product, for which BMS has proposed the brand name Empliciti in Europe. It was designated a breakthrough drug in the US in May last year but has not yet been filed with the FDA. </p><p>"We believe the CHMP&rsquo;s acceptance for an accelerated assessment reflects the need for a new treatment option for multiple myeloma, a largely incurable disease," said Michael Giordano, BMS' senior vice-president and head of oncology development. BMS is co-developing the product with AbbVie, and has sole responsibility for commercial activities. </p><p>To qualify for accelerated assessment in Europe, a drug must be shown to be of major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation.</p><p>Elotuzumab, a first-in-class compound, is a Signaling Lymphocyte Activation Molecule (SLAMF7)-directed immunostimulatory antibody that reactivates the immune system to target myeloma cells. SLAMF7 is a cell-surface glycoprotein that is highly and uniformly expressed on myeloma cells and natural killer (NK) cells, but is not detected on normal solid tissues or hematopoietic stem cells. Elotuzumab is believed to work by binding to SLAMF7 on NK cells, directly activating them and binding to SLAMF7 on myeloma cells, flagging them for NK cell recognition and destruction.</p><p>The product is the first MAb for which Phase III results in multiple myeloma have been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Multiple-myeloma-outlook-Keeping-the-cobra-in-the-basket-358930" target="_new">presented</a>, in the form of the open-label ELOQUENT-2 trial. This study compared elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide (Celgene's Revlimid) and dexamethasone (the ELd arm) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (the Ld arm) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. </p><p>Data from ELOQUENT-2 were presented at the European Hematology Association 2015 meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June. They showed that patients who received the ELd arm had a significant relative reduction of 30% in the risk of disease progression or death compared with the Ld arm. Median progression-free survival in the ELd arm was 19.4 months, compared with 14.9 months for those receiving Revlimid and dexamethasone alone, and the overall response rate at two years was 41% versus 27%. </p><p>"The safety profile showed modest incremental adverse events with the addition of elotuzumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone," the companies said. Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the two groups were lymphocytopenia (77% ELd arm vs 49% Ld arm), neutropenia (34% vs 44%), fatigue (8% vs 8%), and pneumonia.</p><p>As well as ELOQUENT-2, the European approval application is supported by data from a Phase II randomized, open-label study (CA004-009) which evaluated elotuzumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone versus bortezomib and dexamethasone alone, and which was also presented at the EHA meeting.</p><h2>Takeda's ixazomib</h2><p>Takeda said its EU filing for ixazomib, which will also undergo accelerated assessment, will include data from the 722-patient Phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Filings-set-for-Takedas-ixazomib-on-Phase-III-data-356675" target="_new">published</a> in February this year. The data showed that the study hit the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial compared two treatment regimens administered until progression &ndash; ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Takeda also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/marketdata/Pipeline-Watch---Pivotal-events-for-late-stage-and-marketed-drugs-10-16-July-2015-359501" target="_new">announced</a> this month that it had filed a US approval application for ixazomib, the drug's first filing worldwide. </p><p>Back in the MAb field, Janssen/Genmab have just completed a US BLA submission for their multiple myeloma drug daratumumab, based on data from the Phase II SIRIUS trial, the Phase I/II GEN501 trial, and three other studies. The product received breakthrough therapy designation in the US in May 2013, and Janssen has filed a request with the FDA for priority review. </p><p>Meanwhile, Amgen is consolidating its position in the myeloma market after the FDA approved an expanded use of Kyprolis (carfilzomid), which can now be used in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. The product was already approved for patients who have received at least two prior therapies.</p>
