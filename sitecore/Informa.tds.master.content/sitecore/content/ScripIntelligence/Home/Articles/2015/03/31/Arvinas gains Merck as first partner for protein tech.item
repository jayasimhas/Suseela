<p><p>Two-year old start-up and Yale spin-out Arvinas has landed a deal with a major pharma partner for its protein degradation technology &ndash; inking a multi-year collaboration with Merck & Co. on 07 April. </p><p>The big pharma has agreed to pay an undisclosed upfront, as well as research funding and potentially $434m in research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones for products created using the biotech's technology against the targets Merck initially selects. </p><p>Merck has the option to expand the collaboration at any time to include other targets &ndash; this decision would trigger further milestone payments.</p><p>Yale University biology, chemistry and pharmacology professor Craig Crews invented the technology for small molecules that can tag proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). New Haven, Connecticut-based Arvinas licensed the technology platform from Yale through the university's Office of Cooperative Research (OCR). The startup is using the platform to develop drugs for an internal pipeline and as the basis for partners that are looking for alternatives to traditional protein inhibition. The company is looking for platform and product deals. </p><p>Arvinas and Dr Crews have shown in cells and in animals that the degradation technology can target several proteins of interest in oncology and in inflammatory, autoimmune and rare diseases &ndash; the company chose oncology as its initial area of focus. Merck and Arvinas did not reveal the focus of the multi-disease collaboration, but will likely be in oncology considering Merck's leadership in the space. </p><p>The protein technology works in an entirely different way from most drugs on the market, which preserve proteins; instead, Arvinas' proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) target certain proteins and remove them from the cell.</p><p>Arvinas <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Arvinas-appoints-new-president-CEO-356158" target="_new">appointed</a> Dr Manuel Litchman president and CEO in January. Dr Litchman was most recently senior vice-president and global program head at Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Prior to that, it raised $19.25m in <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Arvinas-raises-19.25m-for-novel-protein-degradation-approach-346874" target="_new">Series A funding</a> led by Caanan and 5AM Ventures, who were joined by Elm Street Ventures and Connecticut Innovations. </p><p><p><p>
