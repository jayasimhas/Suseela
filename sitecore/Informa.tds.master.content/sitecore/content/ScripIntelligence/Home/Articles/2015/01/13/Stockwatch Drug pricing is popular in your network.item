<p><p><p><p><p>The annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco kicked-off with the bang of the acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals by Shire and closed with the preoccupation of drug pricing and formulary access. The theme of pricing and market access is akin to that of dogs and Christmas; not just for specialty and orphan pharmaceuticals, but now for generic manufacturers and almost everyone else involved in the pharmaceutical value chain.</p><p><p>Last year I noted the correlation between the quality of the company and the timing and location of its slot (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/STOCKWATCH-JPM-notes-349441" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 21 January 2014</a>). Dendreon, which I suggested would be sequestered away with the not-for-profit section this year, was instead in the not-in-attendance-at-all category this year because of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dendreon-seeks-Chapter-11-bankruptcy-as-620m-debt-looms-354946" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 November 2014</a>). In an attempt to prevent the investors on the last day being outnumbered by the tumbleweed drifting through the hotel corridors, recent IPO and much-hyped chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) company Kite Pharmaceuticals was saved for the last presentation in the best room. Although it didn't play to a full house, it wasn't far off standing room-only by the end of the presentation and for the break-out. Many companies that aren't as hyped up as Kite but do have sales and profits were shunted to the late afternoon or graveyard shifts in the conference's more distal rooms. A new specter was the 7:30am slot, which is not so much the graveyard shift as the neonatal shift, at least until the bulk of the investors start to arrive at about 8am.</p><p><p>One of the worthy workers of Wednesday's neonatal shift, made more embarrassing by being a FTSE100 company presenting to a less than half filled Grand Ballroom, was AstraZeneca, which swapped from a graveyard shift last year. AstraZeneca's CEO misjudged the dress code and presented tie-less to half a room of tie-wearing investors. This was not his only mistake: the strategy of developing a portfolio of immuno-oncology (IO) molecules appears to misjudge the pinch points of drug pricing and market access. As my former boss at SmithKline Beecham put it, offering US payers a basket of IO compounds is like a generics company offering a wholesaler their drug catalogue &ndash; it just cries out for most of the products to be sold at cost or less. It is much better commercially for patients to be prescribed the best IO products from different manufacturers in a divide and conquer approach, compared with a generic basket strategy.</p><p><p>While AstraZeneca's seven-minute presentation plus a fireside chat left me feeling that the company is hapless, GlaxoSmithKline's made me think that the company is beleaguered. Gone are the claims from just two years ago of their many expected drug approvals and these are replaced by slides on the traditional compensation for poor share price performance &ndash; increased dividends and share buy-backs. We were invested in GSK until last year for their respiratory franchise. However, AstraZeneca's tactic of racing to the bottom on pricing in restrictive formularies has consigned that to land of the profit warning (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-second-quarter-slump-even-worse-than-expected-352991" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 July 2014</a>). Indeed, two of the respiratory products that were being trumpeted as the important launches two years ago were being presented as still launching in this year's presentation by GSK's Chief Strategy Officer David Redfern. Investors, payers and physicians, if not GSK itself, have gotten the idea by now that the launches of Breo (fluticasone and vilanterol) and Anoro (umeclidinium and vilanterol) were commercial failures. To suggest that they are still launching seems not to recognise the commercial agony still to come.</p><p><p>But not all companies had doom and gloom as a subtext. Bluebird Bio's was elevated from the distant Elizabethan rooms it occupied last year to the proximal California West room on the basis of recent data on a handful of gene therapy patients treated (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gene-therapy-rising-Bluebird-soars-at-ASH-Pfizer-builds-platform-355514" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 09 December 2014</a>). In days gone byclinical data on five patients in Phase I would have been the preserve of private companies back down in the Elizabethan rooms rather than a public companywith a market capitalisation of $3bn. To pump up the hype, Bluebird appears to have trawled whatever Google and Twitter said was popular or trending at the moment. Thus, Bluebird's CEO's last slides were a statement of intent on the company's future prowess in CAR-T and gene editing technologies, which I almost missed as I was reeling from the multiple vague statements on ensuring the safety of its products. I wonder what Nick Leschly and the FDA know, and the rest of us currently don't.</p><p><p>Bluebird, like almost all other new companies presenting, seemed to have developed what I thought of as a self-resolving temporal paradox. This is because each company developing CAR-T, IO or T-cell receptor (TCR) therapies suggested that it had all been doing it for many years before everyone else, but its therapy was also compatible with anyone else's CAR-T, IO or TCR (delete where applicable) therapies that were at a later stage than theirs (or even now marketed).</p><p><p>Unfortunately, the comments of the Kite CFO on pricing at the end of the conference sent the share prices of any company with a hint of manipulated T-cell therapy down significantly. Perhaps these new kids on the block have some old lessons still to learn either in media training or on drug pricing and market access.</p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include NPS Pharmaceuticals and Shire.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies.
