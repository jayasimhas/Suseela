<p>Shares of Biodel Inc. leaped 16.3% on Oct. 13 on news the FDA had lifted the partial clinical hold on the company's randomized, open-label, parallel group Phase IIb trial, known as Study 3-250, which was testing the company's ultra-rapid-acting concentrated insulin formulation candidate BIOD-531 in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes versus Eli Lilly & Co.'s Humalog (insulin lispro) Mix 75/25. </p><p>The FDA has cleared the use of Biodel's investigational U-400 syringes in the trial, the company reported. </p><p>Biodel president and CEO Errol De Souza said data from the study will further inform later stage multi-dose trials with the "optimal patient population" and comparators early next year.</p><p>The company also plans to start a Phase IIa standardized meal challenge study plus a independent market analysis in the fourth quarter to determine whether the target diabetes populations and market segments for BIOD-531 can be further expanded.</p><p>The study will evaluate the hypothesis that treatment with BIOD-531 can reduce the injection burden and achieve glucose control at least as effective as that with separate basal and prandial insulins in patients with type 2 diabetes, Biodel said. </p><p>The market analysis, the firm said, will assess the optimal target patient populations and commercial opportunity for BIOD-531, including patients who are on intensive basal/prandial insulin therapy. </p><p>Biodel said it will continue Study 3-250 to allow completion of patients currently in the trial while deferring recruitment of new patients until the optimal target populations have been selected following review of top-line data from the new Phase 2a meal study and the results of the market analysis in the first calendar quarter of 2016.</p><p>Shares of Biodel closed at 43 cents on Oct. 13 &ndash; where the stock started the day.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
