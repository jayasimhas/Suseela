<p>Bayer is selling off its Diabetes Care business to Japan's Panasonic Healthcare for $1.1bn (JPY138bn) &ndash; the deal marks another step in Bayer's mission to shed non-core units and become a "pure" life sciences company. </p><p>The agreement will see Panasonic &ndash; backed by investment firm KKR &ndash; gain Bayer's Contour portfolio of blood glucose monitoring meters and strips, as well as other products such as Breeze 2, Elite and Microlet lancing devices. </p><p>Dr Alexander Moscho, CEO of Bayer UK and Ireland, says the deal "will see two strong leaders in manufacturing and marketing diabetes care products create a large global business committed to investing in innovative solutions that will help improve the lives of patients with diabetes."</p><p>The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. </p><p>Bayer has already begun divestment of its Material Science business under is downsizing plan. The unit, to be known as Covestro from September, will float on the stock market by the middle of 2016. </p><p>Dr Moscho added that much like the Material Science unit, divestment of Bayer's Diabetes Care business "is an opportunity to create a unique business with a shared vision and a more entrepreneurial, can-do spirit. </p><p>"These changes are another step closer to a focused Life Science company, and Bayer being a global leader in applying science and innovation expertise to improve human, animal and plant health," Dr Moscho said.</p>
