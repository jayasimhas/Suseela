<p>Other than chasing the seemingly impossible answers to the thorniest of questions, scientists love debating whether their hypotheses are correct. </p><p>Lucky for them, the FDA has a knotty question to tackle: What are the right levels of evidence needed to integrate biomarkers &ndash; characteristics objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or biological responses to therapeutic interventions &ndash; into drug development?</p><p>The FDA and its partners the Critical Path Institute (C-Path) and the University of Maryland (UMD) Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation are hoping scientists from academia and industry bring their intense passion to a one-day workshop on August 21, "where audience participation is absolutely key," said Dr. John-Michael Sauer, executive director of C-Path's Predictive Safety Testing Consortium.</p><p>Dr. Sauer said he is anticipating a "big can of worms" to be opened at the workshop, but said the organizers have set a clear agenda to keep the meeting focused.</p><p>He noted the biomarker requirements laid out in the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Cures-aint-law-yet-Senate-concurrence-may-be-tricky-359391" target="_new">adopted</a> by the House on July 10, are likely to come up at the meeting.</p><p>The legislation, which is awaiting a companion bill out of the Senate &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senate-chance-to-improve-Cures-but-dont-expect-soon-359643" target="_new">not expected until later this year</a> &ndash; calls for the creation of a structured framework at the FDA for the submission, review and qualification of biomarkers and other drug development tools for specific contexts of use that, if qualified, can be relied on by any person for such purposes.</p><p>The Cures bill is seeking to mandate the FDA to develop biomarker-focused guidance, which would advise industry on the evidence needed to support the use of biomarkers to identify subsets of patients that are likely responders to therapies with the intent to streaming clinical trials.</p><p>The legislation also said the FDA's guidance should include recommendations for designing studies to demonstrate the validity of a biomarker as a predictor of a medicine's response. It also should address the manner and extent to which a benefit-risk assessment may be affected when trials are limited to patient subsets identified using biomarkers.</p><p>In addition, the bill said the new guidance should include considerations for developing biomarkers aimed at informing prescribing decisions and when information about a biomarker may be included in the approved prescription labeling for a precision medicine.</p><p>In a blog posted on the FDA's website earlier this year, Dr. Shashi Amur, scientific coordinator for the agency's Biomarker Qualification Program (BQP), noted there are multiple pathways for biomarker acceptance and integration into drug development, although traditionally, they've been accepted through the submission of applications &ndash; investigational new drug applications and those seeking marketing approval. </p><p>But Dr. Amur said the challenge with that approach is that the supporting biomarker data are retained with the regulatory submission. </p><p>To make drug development tools publicly available and subsequently expedite drug development and regulatory review, the FDA established qualification pathways for biomarkers, clinical outcome assessments and animal models under the Animal Rule as part of the agency's Critical Path Initiative.</p><p>The BQP has received 24 biomarker submissions, five of which are in the review stage, with the others in various stages of consultation and advice, according to the most recent information on the FDA's website.</p><p><b>Series of debates</b></p><p>The August 21 symposium is intended to be the first in a series of workshops US regulators and their collaborators plan to hold focused on evidentiary standards for biomarkers in drug development, said Dr. Martha Brumfield, president and CEO of C-Path, an independent, non-profit established in 2005 with public and private philanthropic support from the Arizona community, the Science Foundation Arizona and the FDA to catalyze the development of new approaches to advance medical innovation and regulatory science.</p><p>The FDA's ultimate goal of the workshops is to bring the community into the discussions and use that feedback as the basis for new biomarker guidance documents for drug developers, she said.</p><p>"It's not a simple task to just sit down and start writing what you think the evidence needs to be," Dr. Brumfield explained, "especially when the underlying science about a disease isn't so clear."</p><p>Indeed, she pointed out, the FDA acknowledged in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDAs-love-letter-to-itself-359477" target="_new">recent report</a> the trouble the agency and industry have faced in identifying biomarkers for diseases like Alzheimer's and diabetes.</p><p>She noted the FDA is expected to issue a series of guidance documents that reflect on different key elements within the evidentiary standards, rather than "one big uber-guidance."</p><p>While the issue with biomarkers has been a "chicken-and-egg scenario where we are trying to gain experience in uncharted area," Dr. Sauer said he thinks "we are finally at the point where we have enough experience where we can have a real conversation about establishing these standards or considerations."</p><p>While the FDA can't really set the evidentiary standards for biomarkers &ndash; that job rests with the scientific community &ndash; regulators nonetheless need to hear the opinions and ideas from the academic and drug development communities so the FDA can set the regulatory expectations for the qualifications, he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Those conversations among the various stakeholders, Dr. Sauer said, are critical for "what this evidentiary standard landscape really needs to look like."</p><p><b>Where the action is</b></p><p>The all-day workshop, which is being held at the UMD's Baltimore, Maryland campus, will be divided into four sections, Dr Sauer said, noting the FDA will control the first session to set up the foundation for the remainder of the meeting.</p><p>Regulators, including Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, plan to discuss what's being done to encourage biomarker development and qualification and statistical considerations.</p><p>The second session will be an opportunity to "dive into some hypothetical examples" that will be "based on true information" around safety biomarkers, said Dr. Sauer, who will co-chair that section.</p><p>"That's probably one of the places where we have a wealth of knowledge and there's a number of efforts," he said.</p><p>He anticipated working through the examples and then having about an hour-long panel discussion on the matter with representatives from the FDA, Novartis and the University of North Carolina.</p><p>In the afternoon, a third session will examine the evidentiary considerations for biomarker-based enrichment of clinical study populations to increase the efficacy and safety of drugs, which will culminate into another panel conversation, where "we're hoping to gain a wealth of information," Dr. Sauer said.</p><p>Dr. Brumfield noted that while that session will look at a few hypothetical cases, there also will be an opportunity to discuss a case study of polycystic kidney disease, which she said emanated from a program C-Path has been leading for about four years aimed at developing an enrichment biomarker for the condition.</p><p>Dr. Brumfield will co-chair the last session of the day, which is intended not only to summarize the meeting, but to start the process of defining a roadmap for the next steps, she told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"We will try to lay the groundwork to get us farther down that road towards defining and codifying what the research community thinks the evidentiary standards should be," she said.</p><p>To ensure full participation from the various stakeholders, Dr. Sauer said the August 21 workshop will be webcast live, with those <a href="http://www.pharmacy.umaryland.edu/centers/cersievents/biomarkers/registration.html" target="_new">registered</a> able to submit questions.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
