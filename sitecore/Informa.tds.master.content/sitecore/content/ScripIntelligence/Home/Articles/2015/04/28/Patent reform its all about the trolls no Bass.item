<p>While lawmakers on Capitol Hill have concentrated the latest attempts at patent reform on so-called patent trolls &ndash; entities that acquire patents for the sole purpose of forcing companies to pay licensing fees or settling infringement suits through threats of aggressive litigation &ndash; the biopharmaceutical industry has been pleading for a fix to a problem that sprung up as an unintended consequence from the last time Congress tried to repair the US patent system.</p><p>As part of the <i>America Invents Act of 2011</i>, lawmakers created the <i>inter partes</i> review (IPR) process, which was intended to be a faster and more affordable way to challenge patents than going through the US court system &ndash; a process that can take from one to three years.</p><p>IPRs, which are proceedings conducted by the so-called Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), are statutorily required to be completed within one year of institution, except that the time may be extended up to six months for good cause, according to the US Patent & Trademark Office (US PTO).</p><p>The procedure for conducting IPRs took effect on 16 September 2012 &ndash; one year after the AIA was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-backs-NCATS-reveals-plans-to-move-ideas-from-lab-to----market-321330" target="_new">signed into law</a> &ndash; and applies to any patent issued before, on or after that date. </p><p>In March, US PTO Director Michelle Lee boasted the PTAB had received more than 2,600 IPR filings &ndash; well above anyone's expectations.</p><p>But the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) have insisted the IPRs are being used in abusive ways for which they were never intended. </p><p>Robert Zirkelbach, senior vice president of communications at PhRMA, said some financial investors and hedge fund managers have started shorting biopharmaceutical company stocks and then used the PTAB process to challenge those firms' patents "for the sole purpose of profiting off of the resulting change in price."</p><p>"The pro-challenger bias exhibited through these proceedings has come to be known as a 'death squad' for legitimate patents and patent holders," he said. </p><p>Kyle Bass, chief investment officer at the hedge fund firm Hayman Capital Management, has filed several IPRs targeting drugs from companies like Biogen, Shire and Celgene.</p><p>His most recent IPR filing came on 1 May against Biogen's patent 8,399,514, which covers the use of Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) at the 480mg per day dosage in multiple sclerosis. The patent expires in 2028. </p><p>"This is the key patent on Tecfidera," said Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum. </p><p>Mr Bass had earlier filed an IPR challenging Biogen's patent 8,759,393 also covering Tecfidera. But Wall Street and the company appeared not too bothered by that action and didn&rsquo;t view that patent quite as critical to the drug. </p><p>BIO CEO Jim Greenwood condemned Mr Bass for filing his IPRs &ndash; declaring the hedge fund manager had "opened a new door to abuse of the US patent system, exploiting the US PTO's patent challenge proceeding as part of his cynical short-selling strategy against innovative biotech companies that are delivering transformative therapies to patients in need."</p><p>"Congress never intended for the patent challenge system to be utilized by those attempting to profit from the confusion the current system creates," Mr Greenwood charged in February. "Such efforts not only damage the value of companies working on cures, but hurt those sick and suffering patients and their families who are eager for cures."</p><p>Mr Greenwood called on Congress to "act promptly" to stop the IPR process from being abused. </p><p>But when a bill was introduced in the Senate this past week, known as the <i>Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship (PATENT) Act</i>, it contained no provisions addressing the IPR issues raised by BIO and PhRMA.</p><p>Senator Charles Grassley (Republican-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, tried to console the drug industry groups by declaring lawmakers would consider an amendment as legislation moved through his chamber.</p><p>But combating patent trolls currently is the key focus of the Senate bill, which was introduced on 29 April by Senators Grassley and Patrick Leahy (Democrat-Vermont), the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, and a group of bipartisan lawmakers. </p><p>"Abusive litigation practices are stifling innovation and entrepreneurship that our system has been designed to protect," Mr Grassley said during a 29 April media briefing. </p><p>Patent trolls, he said, "prey on business owners by filing frivolous lawsuits and employing heavy-handed deceptive tactics. They target companies, both big and small, forcing them to waste financial resources and human capital defending against expensive litigation instead of investing in R&D and expanding businesses. A single lawsuit can cost millions of dollars. This forces companies to settle even when they know they have a strong defense."</p><p>"This growing problem is being felt by all sectors of our economy," Senator Grassley said.</p><p>"Patent trolls have perverted our system for too long," said Senator Charles Schumer (Democrat-New York), a co-sponsor of the Senate bill. "Startup companies are sued for something that's clearly not patentable, but they are so beleaguered by the huge costs before they get to any adjudication, that they are extorted and have to settle, and some of them actually go out of business."</p><p>"If our new technology companies are our seed corn, they are the future of America, we cannot let parasites like patent trolls prey on them," Senator Schumer told reporters. </p><p>He acknowledged that "not everyone will love every part of this bill. That's the nature of the beast."</p><p>But BIO and PhRMA said any patent reform legislation that fails to include a fix for the IPR review process would be opposed by the groups. </p><p>A bill that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PhRMA-BIO-shun-House-passed-patent-bill-348573" target="_new">passed</a> by the House in December 2013 and recently re-introduced, the <i>Innovation Act</i>, also does not contain language to go after abusers of the IPR system.</p><p>Mr Bass, however, has insisted the PTAB is "effectively serving an important purpose as currently structured" under the AIA and should be preserved. </p><p>In a letter last month to Representatives Bob Goodlatte (Republican-Virginia), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and John Conyers (Democrat-Michigan), the ranking member, Mr Bass said the PTAB system has been "highly effective in eliminating particularly egregious invalid patent claims."</p><p>Mr Bass asserted that a "small number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have engaged in abusive practices by acquiring and enforcing weak patents." </p><p>The "sheer ridiculousness," he said, of "simple concepts" that are claimed to be "novel" in certain biopharma patents, like "siliconized rubber stoppers" and "exclusive pharmacy" using "exclusive databases," taking an old drug for "at least two weeks" for a chronic condition, taking an old oral contraceptive for "24 days" instead of 21 days, and certain others, "keep these few drug companies' monopolies on old products alive." </p><p>"These abuses of the patent system are taxes on the US economy, public welfare and every citizen afflicted by diseases that range from multiple sclerosis to narcolepsy and a number of other conditions," Mr Bass said. "If nothing novel is disclosed, a patent owner should not be rewarded with a government grant of a 20-year monopoly."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
