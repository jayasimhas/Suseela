<p>While focusing most of its resources on its anticoagulant reversal agent, Portola Pharmaceuticals is looking for help developing one of its preclinical prospects. </p><p>The South San Francisco biotech tapped Ora to help in the early clinical work on PRT2761, a Syk inhibitor that could be a strong contender in certain ophthalmic conditions due to its ability to prevent activation of mast cells.</p><p>According to the deal &ndash; which did not disclose financial details &ndash; Ora will be responsible for development of PRT2761 and the companies will split costs of early trials, until proof-of-concept is established. Portola will retain the rights to make decision about the compound and the company said in a statement that it will decide whether to move the drug forward after proof-of-concept trials. </p><p>"We are impressed by its properties and preclinical data, which demonstrated activity in reducing conjunctival redness and swelling, a key clinical sign of allergic conjunctivitis that is not adequately treated by existing therapies," said Ora President and CEO Stuart Abelson. </p><p>This is the first time that Portola has licensed out some of the development rights to its earlier programs. The company has a deal with Biogen &ndash; signed in 2011-- for the other biotech to develop some of its other selective Syk inhibitors for autoimmune diseases. Biogen paid $38m upfront and took a small stake in Portola. </p><p>In 2013, Portola conducted a similar deal with Aciex Therapeutics &ndash; handing over the development of its small-molecule dual Syk/JAK inhibitors for topical ophthalmic conditions, including ocular allergy, dry eye, and inflammatory eye conditions. Ora served as a development consultant on that program. </p><p><b>A bleeding heart</b></p><p>Portola has been focusing the bulk of its resources on andexanet alfa, an antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors that the biotech has been studying with several big pharma blockbusters. Portola has been readying the drug for approval as an antidote to Factor Xa inhibitors Eliquis (apixaban), which is jointly marketed by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Bayer HealthCare and Janssen Pharmaceutical's Xarelto (rivaroxaban). </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Portola-readies-Factor-Xa-antidote-for-approval-357723" target="_new">Late-stage studies</a> have shown that the drug is well-tolerated and can rapidly reverse the effects of the anticoagulants. </p><p>Portola plans to submit a biologic license application (BLA) to the US FDA at the end of 2015 along with a request for accelerated approval.</p><p>Andexanet alfa became a candidate for expedited FDA review in late 2013 when the agency granted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-grants-breakthrough-status-to-Portolas-andexanet-alfa-348347" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> for the anticoagulant antidote.</p><p>Portola is also developing its own Factor Xa inhibitor dubbed betrixaban, which is currently in Phase III trials. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
