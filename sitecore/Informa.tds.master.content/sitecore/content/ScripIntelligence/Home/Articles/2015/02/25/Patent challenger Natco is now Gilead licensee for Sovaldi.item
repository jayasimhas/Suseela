<p>Patent challenger Natco Pharma has made a strategic about turn and has now emerged as a licensee for Gilead Sciences's blockbuster hepatitis C therapy, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).</p><p>Natco informed Indian bourses that it had signed a non-exclusive licensing pact with Gilead, to manufacture and sell generic versions of its chronic hepatitis C medicines including sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and the investigational NS5A inhibitor GS-5816, which is being evaluated in Phase III studies as part of a single-tablet regimen that combines the compound and sofosbuvir for the treatment of all six genotypes of hepatitis C.</p><p>As in the case of other licensees, the agreement covers 91 developing countries and Natco can set its own price for the generic products it makes paying a royalty on sales to Gilead to support product registrations, medical education and training, safety monitoring and other essential business activities. </p><p>Eight Indian-based generic manufacturers already hold licenses to manufacture Gilead&rsquo;s HCV medicines including Cadila Healthcare, Cipla and Ranbaxy Laboratories <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a> and more recently Biocon. Gilead had earlier this year added GS-5816 to its licensing agreements with the pharmaceutical manufacturers in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-adds-GS-5816-to-hepatitis-C-licensing-deals-in-India-356384%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 26 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>Gilead's licensee, Mylan, is expected to begin distribution of Sovaldi in India in the second quarter. Sovaldi would be priced at $300 per bottle/per month in India &ndash; which Gilead expects would act as a ceiling price for other market entrants <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gileads-10.71-Sovaldi-to-set-ceiling-for-other-Indian-entrants-356937%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 25 February 2015)</a>.]</p><p>It's not immediately clear what triggered Natco's turnaround, but it is expected to include a withdrawal or settlement with reference to the patent challenge. No official confirmation on this was immediately possible. </p><p>Natco and the US based non-profit group, Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK) had previously filed pre-grant patent oppositions against the Sovaldi patent in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/India-set-to-hear-Sovaldi-patent-objections-case-352584%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 June 2014)</a>. </p><p>India had earlier rejected one of Gilead's patent applications for Sovaldi essentially on the grounds that it falls under section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act and failed to meet the conditions therein. The Delhi High Court had, however, subsequently set aside the rejection and also observed how the patent office may have been potentially ''influenced'' by material placed on record by pre-grant opposition applicants. The court had remanded the matter for a fresh decision by the Patent Office <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-points-to-para-lifts-potential-for-bias-in-Indian-Sovaldi-case-356703%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 11 February 2015</a>). </p><p>Health groups appeared disappointed at Natco's move, but were hopeful that newer players would fill the gap and facilitate ''open'' competition going forward.</p><p>Leena Menghaney, head (South Asia), MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res Access Campaign, said that the changed patent scenario on new lifesaving drugs, the Indian government ''succumbing'' to US pressure and not proceeding on compulsory licensing and expensive patent litigation in Indian courts &ndash; all of which were having a ''chilling effect'' on the ability of Indian generic companies to take on such big patent challenges.</p><p>She noted how voluntary licenses offered ''short term gains'' to Indian firms that want to market new HCV drugs domestically and in South Asia without having to face long drawn out court battles. ''But the conditions attached to the sourcing of raw material, technology transfer, and marketing of the drug to patients need to be better understood in terms of its long term impact on freedom to operate, competition in middle income countries and access to low cost generic versions of HCV drugs globally,'' Ms Menghaney added.</p><p>She also referred to alternatives to Indian generic companies already emerging. </p><p>''New generic producers outside of India, particularly in least developing countries, have more potential to provide open competition in the HCV market,'' she said. Bangladeshi firm, Incepta Pharmaceuticals, had recently launched a cut-price generic Sovaldi version at Taka800 ($10.4) per tablet <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 February 2015)</a>. </p>
