<p> In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>&quot;The Pink Sheet&quot;</i>, President of Global R&amp;D Michael Hayden talked about integrating Allergan generics, Teva's late-stage specialty pipeline and its 17 new therapeutic entities, medicines that bridge generics and specialty medicine. </p> <p><p> <p> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is in the midst of making big changes that management believes will position it for sustainable long-term growth. As part of the new strategy, Teva is preparing for the integration of Allergan PLC's generic drug business, setting up to launch several brand drugs from its newly pruned specialty pipeline, and managing 17 projects in a budding area for the company, new therapeutic entities (NTEs), or medicines that bridge generics and specialty. </p> <p> <p> President-Global R&amp;D Michael Hayden talked about all three areas of Teva's strategy during an interview at Informa's Pharmaceutical Strategy Conference in New York Sept. 27. </p> <p> <p> The goal is to return Teva to consistent long-term growth after a challenging period in which its generics business slipped, its top-selling specialty drug Copaxone (glatiramer) faced generic competition and the Israeli pharma cycled through back-to-back leadership changes at the top level. </p> <p> <p> Now Teva appears close to turning a corner, securing near-term growth with the $40.5bn acquisition of Allergan's generics business, which was announced in August, but is yet to close. </p> <p> <p> &quot;We have essentially an opportunity to turn the company into a growth company quicker than we would have done organically,&quot; Hayden said of the planned Allergan generics acquisition. </p> <p> <p> Hayden is still relatively new to Teva, having joined the company in May 2012 as one of several key appointments by the company's then-CEO Jeremy Levin, who <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-CEO-quits-amid-board-row-rumors-347726">left abruptly</a> after just 18 months at the helm following an apparent disagreement with the board of directors. Hayden stayed on when Erez Vigodman stepped into the CEO role in February 2014, and he continued to shepherd some of the ideas he championed under the former regime, NTEs being one of them. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/86CD4506F9E64D86B39F64348B6868A1.ashx"></p> <p> <i>Teva President Global R&amp;D Michael Hayden at Pharmaceutical Strategy Conference </i></p> <p> <i>Brenda Sandburg for &quot;The Pink Sheet&quot;</i> </p> <p> The Allergan deal will bolster the generics business, securing Teva's position as the number one generic drug company in the world and helping it compete amid increasing payer and wholesaler consolidation. </p> <p> <p> Teva is gaining the businesses that used to be Actavis and Watson Laboratories Inc., before Watson was acquired in 2013 by Actavis, which then merged with Allergan earlier this year. Following the close of the Allergan/Actavis merger, Allergan decided to focus mainly on specialty drugs while <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">divesting the generic business to Teva</a>, negotiating a deal that simultaneously ended Teva's hostile pursuit of rival Mylan NV. </p> <p> <p> The combined company will have 320 ANDAs pending and generate expected annual synergies of $1.4bn. </p> <p> <p> Teva is already preparing for the integration. &quot;We want to take the best of both companies while respecting both companies,&quot; Hayden said. As to how the integration will impact R&amp;D, Hayden said there will be job cuts in areas where there are redundancies, though the details haven't been decided. The two organizations have several R&amp;D sites, and some will be closed, he indicated. </p> <p> <p> &quot;There will be some attrition as part of this integration, particularly where we have overlapping skills because we sometimes don't need two of the same,&quot; he said. &quot;The exciting part of it is there is also quite a lot complementary there, things we don't have.&quot; The Allergan business has been stronger in patches, creams and in some aspects of injectables, for example, while Teva is stronger in areas like abuse deterrence technology, the exec said. </p> <p> <h2> Generic Revenue Feeds The Specialty Beast </h2> <p> <p> A healthy generic business will go a long way towards supporting Teva's initiatives in the branded specialty space, where for many years Copaxone for multiple sclerosis has been the firm's primary revenue generator and growth driver. With $4.24bn in sales in 2014, Copaxone made up nearly half of Teva's $8.56bn in specialty revenues. </p> <p> <p> But the first generic version of Copaxone launched in June with the entry of Glatopa from Novartis AG's Sandoz unit. Teva, meanwhile, has been working to switch patients to a new 40 mg version that is dosed just three times a week versus daily <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-cautiously-optimistic-on-Copaxone-despite-generic-359707" target="_new">with some success</a>. MS will remain a cornerstone of Teva's specialty business, and the company is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-Pins-Long-Term-Hopes-In-MS-On-Return-Of-Laquinimod-361010" target="_new">returning its attention</a> to laquinimod as a future growth driver. </p> <p> <p> Despite the headwinds facing the specialty business, Teva has some promising drugs in late-stage development and pending with FDA. </p> <p> <p> The generics business provides a revenue stream to fund the specialty R&amp;D organization that Vigodman is committed to, Hayden said. Last year, under the new CEO's strategy, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Womens-health-and-oncology-out-as-Teva-realigns-pipeline-354333" target="_new">Teva pruned its specialty focus</a>, ending most of its R&amp;D investment in oncology and women's health to focus on central nervous system disorders and respiratory disease, where it has a stronger heritage. </p> <p> <p> The change has been profound, according to Hayden, especially as the company concentrates more intently on developing &quot;integrated solutions&quot; for patients, a beyond-the-pill type of approach. </p> <p> <p> &quot;One of the principles of R&amp;D that we really want to achieve is some opportunity to be a world leader,&quot; Hayden said. &quot;We don't have to be number one, but we have to be in a position where we provide solutions for patients.&quot; </p> <p> <p> The company is increasingly evaluating and developing novel technologies to aid patients managing their disease. For example, in September, the company acquired Gecko Health Innovations, gaining a novel cloud-based software technology that Teva plans to use with its metered-dose inhalers and potentially other respiratory products to help patients monitor their medication use and synchronize and store data. </p> <p> <p> As for why the company believes it can be a leader in the notoriously challenging area of CNS, Hayden said it is because technology advancements are paving the way for new innovative treatments, resulting in better understanding of mechanisms of action and imaging enhancements that are making it possible to image the effect of a molecule in the brain and see if it is having an impact. </p> <p> <h2> A Robust Pipeline Of CNS Drugs </h2> <p> <p> Investors have high hopes for TEV-48125, an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody in development for chronic migraine and high frequency episodic migraine. Teva has a strong position in a tight race to bring the first CGRP to market. The company reported positive Phase IIb data showing the drug administered subcutaneously once monthly resulted in fewer migraines versus placebo in two studies, one in episodic migraine and one in chronic migraine. </p> <p> <p> Amgen Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. are also developing CGRP antibodies for migraine, but Teva is the only one that has completed Phase II studies in both chronic and episodic migraine. The company is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tevas-Next-Blockbuster-Its-Anti-CGRP-Antibody-Prepares-For-Phase-III-In-Difficult-To-Treat-Migraines-360800" target="_new">preparing to begin Phase III testing</a>, having completed an end of Phase II meeting with FDA. </p> <p> <p> Two other drugs Hayden is excited about are an abuse-deterrent formulation of hydrocodone, pending at FDA for pain, and pridopidine, a dopaminergic stabilizer in Phase II development for motor symptoms associated with Huntington's disease. Both opportunities could validate technologies that could have broader utility. </p> <p> <p> FDA approval of the hydrocodone product would validate Teva's abuse-deterrent technology and support the development of more abuse-deterrent drugs in the pipeline, of which Teva currently has four. </p> <p> <p> Teva gained pridopidine through a 2012 deal with Danish CNS biotech NeuroSearch AS for around $26m up front. Results of the Phase II trial are expected in the first quarter, and if they are positive, the data could serve as the basis for a regulatory filing with FDA, Hayden said. </p> <p> <p> He is also hopeful about the drug's potential in other CNS disorders, including Parkinson's disease or possibly even Alzheimer's disease. &quot;It is a very important trial for us. It will give us insight into neurodegeneration in general,&quot; Hayden added. </p> <p> <p> The company has two other drugs pending at FDA, though both are considered to be niche commercial opportunities: reslizumab for severe asthma and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tevas-Huntingtons-Pursuit-Lends-Insight-Into-Other-Diseases-359934" target="_new">SD-809 for chorea associated with Huntington's disease</a>. Reslizumab will likely be entering a challenging commercial market competing against rivals for a subset of patients with severe asthma and potentially competing against GlaxoSmithKline PLC's mepolizumab which is also pending at FDA. Mepolizumab is formulated as both a subcutaneous injection and intravenous infusion, while Teva's product is only I.V. </p> <p> <p> SD-809, which Teva acquired earlier this year with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Teva-band-aids-issues-with-3.5bn-Auspex-deal-357579" target="_new">$3.5bn acquisition of Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc.</a>, will initially address a small patient population if approved. But Teva is also studying the drug, a deuterated version of tetrabenazine, in other larger patient groups, including tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome. </p> <p> <p> Deuteration is a process used to change the pharmacokinetic profile of a known older medication, resulting in an improved PK profile with numerous potential advantages like less frequent dosing, improved tolerability and fewer drug interactions. Teva is further studying the technology and looking to apply it to other medicines. </p> <p> <h2> 17 NTEs In Development </h2> <p> <p> The technology ties in neatly to the company's efforts in NTEs, where it is looking to bring new drugs to market in what it refers to as &quot;the space between&quot; generics and specialty. </p> <p> <p> An NTE, according to Teva, is a known molecule that is formulated, delivered or used in a novel way, resulting in a meaningful advantage for patients. Teva sees big opportunity in this space to improve upon the generic drugs it already has in its portfolio and to do so a lot faster and cheaper than developing a novel drug. </p> <p> <p> The time it takes to conceive an NTE to regulatory submission is about four to six years at a cost of about $10m to $100m, significantly less time and money than it takes to discover and develop a brand new drug, Hayden said during a presentation at the pharmaceutical conference. </p> <p> <p> Levin and Hayden <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Reaching-for-the-stars-Teva-CEO-aims-to-reshape-111-year-old-firm-338158" target="_new">first unveiled the NTE business idea</a> to Wall Street in 2012 to mixed reviews. The company has since established a formal process for assessing the commercial opportunity for an individual NTE; one of the parameters is that the drug has to have a sales potential of at least $250m, Hayden said. </p> <p> <p> &quot;From about 300 product concepts, a process of four to six months, we now have 17 active pipeline projects,&quot; Hayden said. &quot;Between 2015 and 2020, this will account for around one-third of all our submissions. They are a significant contributor to our specialty portfolio in this regard.&quot; </p> <p> <p> As an example, the company is developing a version of Johnson &amp; Johnson's long-acting antipsychotic Risperdal Consta (risperidone), but while J&amp;J's drug is dosed every two weeks via intramuscular injection and must be reconstituted, the version Teva is developing would be dosed once a month or every three months via subcutaneous injection and require minimal reconstitution. </p> <p> <p> Investors, however, have questioned the reimbursement challenges around a category of drugs that could be viewed by payers as offering only incremental benefit. </p> <p> <p> But Hayden said the value story for the products Teva has chosen to develop is clear. &quot;We have spoken to as many payers as we would speak to and sometimes more than we would a specialty product,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything that is on our list of approved for development has already got payer buy-in.&quot; </p> <p> <p> As for pricing, NTEs will be priced &quot;in between&quot; generics and specialty, &quot;exactly where it should be,&quot; according to Hayden. &quot;It adds value. It has R&amp;D costs. It doesn't have as much as a specialty drug and it's not a generic drug,&quot; he said. &quot;The pricing will be appropriate for the value we create.&quot; </p> <p> <p> Teva could still add new assets to its specialty pipeline in the near term, even with the big expense it is incurring with the acquisition of Allegan generics. Investors should anticipate more &quot;Auspex-like deals&quot; through the end of 2016, Hayden said, but starting in 2017, the company could have the financial capacity to complete significantly larger deals. </p> <p> <p> Teva could be nearing a corner but there is still a long road ahead. Now the company needs to execute expertly on the Allergan generics integration and stabilize the specialty business while it still has patent protection for Copaxone 40 mg. </p> <p> <p> This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet" target="_new">&quot;The Pink Sheet&quot;</a>.
