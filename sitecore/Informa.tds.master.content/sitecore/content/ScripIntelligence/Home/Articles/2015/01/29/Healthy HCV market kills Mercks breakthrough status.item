<p>The FDA notified Merck late last month that regulators were rescinding the breakthrough therapy designation the agency had granted for the firm's hepatitis C virus combination product grazoprevir/elbasvir (MK-5172/MK-8742), citing the availability of other recently approved treatments for genotype 1 patients, the company revealed on 4 February.</p><p>Grazoprevir is an investigational HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor and elbasvir is an investigational HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitor.</p><p>Gilead Sciences and AbbVie both recently brought new HCV combination drugs to the US market, which have essentially provided a cure for the disease &ndash; Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) and Viekira Pak (paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">10 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Merck confirmed its plans to seek approval in the first half of this year of grazoprevir/elbasvir as an oral once-daily drug to treat chronic HCV infection.</p><p>Merck announced in mid-January it was moving up the pace of filing its new drug application (NDA) for grazoprevir/elbasvir (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-ups-filing-pace-for-lung-cancer-HCV-drugs-356097" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The company said it plans to discuss the breakthrough status matter with the FDA and said it does not anticipate the loss of the designation to impact the company's ability to file the NDA or the timing of the submission.</p><p>During the firm's fourth-quarter earnings call with investors and analysts on 4 February, Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the FDA "has invited us to comment on their intent to withdraw breakthrough designation, and we intend to have those discussions with the agency, and we'll see where that goes. But meanwhile, we're moving forward with our program."</p><p>Merck won the breakthrough therapy designation in October 2013 for the grazoprevir/elbasvir combo in HCV (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-HCV-NS34A-NS5A-combo-gains-FDA-breakthrough-status-347566" target="_new">24 October 2013</a>).</p><p>The breakthrough therapies designation was created under the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act </i>to speed the development and review processes for medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">10 July 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-more-cha-ching-will-PDUFA-V-satisfy-on-the-ba-bling-332986" target="_new">19 July 2012</a>).</p><p>To gain the breakthrough therapy designation, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">30 May 2014</a>). </p><p>As of 23 January &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 66 of the 227 requests for the breakthrough designation it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 112.</p><p>As of 31 January, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least nine of the 46 requests it has received for breakthrough status, denying at least 31.</p><p>Most recently, Intercept, bluebird bio and Roche unit Genentech were the recipients of the breakthrough therapy designation.</p><p>Intercept was granted the status for its investigational product obeticholic acid as a treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis &ndash; a win that sent its shares soaring 23%, or a gain of $39.31, on 30 January, before closing at $201.03, up $30.34, or 17.7%</p><p>On 2 February, Bluebird revealed it had gained the breakthrough designation for LentiGlobin as a treatment for transfusion-dependent patients with beta-thalassemia major.</p><p>The FDA deemed Genentech's investigational cancer immunotherapy MPDL3280A (anti-PDL1) a breakthrough as a treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer, the company said in a 1 February statement.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
