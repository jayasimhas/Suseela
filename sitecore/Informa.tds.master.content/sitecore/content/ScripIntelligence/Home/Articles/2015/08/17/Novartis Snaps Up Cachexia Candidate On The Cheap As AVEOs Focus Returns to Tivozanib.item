<p>AVEO Oncology is seeing the resurgence in its fortunes continue with the signing of a licensing agreement with Novartis for its growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) inhibitory antibody AV-380, which is in preclinical development as a potential treatment for cachexia.</p><p>The company's share price had almost doubled to $2.30 within 30 minutes of the markets opening (17 August). </p><p>Novartis is paying just $15m upfront for the entire program, which includes all related antibodies. AVEO <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Aveo-changes-course-Telik-running-out-of-cash-financings-abound-350654" target="_new">said last March</a> that future development efforts would focus on AV-380 in cachexia following the failure of its lead product candidate, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tivozanib, in multiple trials. AVEO's partner Astellas <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Astellas-drops-Aveo-Alexion-Prothelia-collaborate-Akebia-files-Audeo-withdraws-IPO-350065" target="_new">pulled the plug</a> on their partnership to develop the drug in February 2014, and tivozanib was seen as all but dead.</p><p>However, the US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-sparks-AVEO-investors-hopes-for-tivozanib-in-RCC-358525" target="_new">threw the tivozanib a lifeline</a> in May this year when it suggested that there may be a way forward for the product in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). AVEO said the FDA told the company a Phase III trial it had outlined in patients with RCC who had failed at least two prior regimens, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, may support a proposed indication for tivozanib in the third-line setting. </p><p>AVEO said it was continuing to evaluate all options for advancement of tivozanib in RCC and colorectal cancer.</p><p>In June 2013, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EXPECTED-FDA-rejects-AVEOs-tivozanib-in-RCC-343958" target="_new">FDA rejected</a> AVEO's new drug application (NDA) for tivozanib as a treatment for patients with advanced RCC.</p><p>Under the exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Novartis, in addition to the upfront payment of $15m, AVEO is also eligible milestone payments of up to $311m. AVEO could also receive tiered royalties on product sales ranging from high single digits to a low double-digit. Novartis will be responsible for all clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization activities and costs associated with the product. </p><p>Novartis is already investigating muscle-wasting disorders via BYM338 (bimagrumab), which is in a pivotal clinical study for sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and is also being tested for sarcopenia and cachexia associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>According to Citeline's Pharmaprojects database, AV-380 is the only GDF15 inhibitory antibody under investigation as a therapeutic product.</p><p>"AV-380 holds great promise as a potential treatment for cachexia secondary to multiple disease states, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease," said Michael Bailey, AVEO's president and chief executive officer. "Novartis brings resources and expertise to bear on advancing this program, which we believe provides the optimal path forward toward realizing its full potential."</p>
