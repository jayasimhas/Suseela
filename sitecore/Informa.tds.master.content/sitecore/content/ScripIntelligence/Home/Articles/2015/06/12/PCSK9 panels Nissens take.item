<p> An FDA advisory panel got it right this week when it recommended to approve, but limit the use to certain patient populations, two experimental proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, said Dr Steven Nissen, chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/A65070AFAF984F85AE49B823B2C08C54.ashx" border="0"> </p> <p> <i>Dr Steven Nissen, chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University.</i> </p> <p> But Dr Nissen said some members of the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) were being overly concerned about the use of PCSK9 inhibitors, which are intended to bring down high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when statins have not been enough to do the job. </p> <p> And, he told <i>Scrip</i>, the panel &quot;wasn't as crisp and clear&quot; as it could have been in discussing the first PCSK9 inhibitors to come before an FDA advisory committee. </p> <p> &quot;I would have liked to have seen the discussion be a little bit better focused,&quot; said Dr Nissen, who has served on several FDA advisory committees. </p> <p> The EMDAC on <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873">9 June voted 13-3</a> that Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had sufficiently established that the LDL-C-lowering benefit of their PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) exceeded its risks to support approval in one or more patient populations. </p> <p> The same committee &ndash; minus two panelists from the day earlier and the addition of one more &ndash; gave a similar thumbs up to Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab) in an <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895">11-4 vote on 10 June</a>. </p> <p> But until the results of the companies' two cardiovascular outcomes trials are completed so it's more clear whether PCSK9 inhibitors work on preventing events like heart attacks, strokes and CV-related death, the panelists said the drugs should only be used in certain groups, like adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) &ndash; a genetic disease that causes unusually high levels of LDL-C, often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; and those at high CV risk where statins are not enough. </p> <p> The EMDAC also unanimously backed the use of Amgen's Repatha in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a more rare form of FH that causes early onset of arthrosclerosis, often resulting in patients experiencing heart attacks in their early teens and dying before they reach 30. Sanofi and Regeneron are not seeking the HoFH indication because they have not yet studied Praluent for that use. </p> <p> The monoclonal antibodies work by blocking overactive PCSK9 proteins, which control the number of LDL receptors &ndash; proteins on the surface of cells that regulate blood cholesterol levels. </p> <p> PCSK9 inhibitors act very differently than statins, which are used to elevate LDL receptors. </p> <p> While statins have been very effective in reducing LDL-C, Dr Nissen said there remains patients who still cannot get their levels down or who don't tolerate statins well, &quot;and we've needed for a long time something else.&quot; </p> <p> He noted that 5% of the population taking statins ends up with difficult muscle-related problems, which has caused many of those patients to stop using the drugs. </p> <p> But PCSK9 inhibitors, which have shown dramatic results in lowering LDL-C, don't appear to have the muscle side effects, said Dr Nissen, who acknowledged he is the study chairman for a 1,000-patient intravascular ultrasound trial testing Amgen's Repatha, which is examining whether coronary disease can be regressed with ultra-low levels of LDL. He's also serving on the steering committee for Pfizer's experimental PCSK9 inhibitor bococizumab. </p> <p> Dr Nissen noted that, for the most part, PCSK9 inhibitors will be used with statins. </p> <p> The new class of drugs, he said, will &quot;give us very powerful new tools in the tool chest.&quot; </p> <p> <b>Pushback a surprise</b> </p> <p> Most on the EMDAC said LDL-C should not be used as a surrogate for approving PSCK9s. </p> <p> While Dr Nissen said he generally is a &quot;skeptic&quot; about using biochemical surrogate endpoints to approve drugs, &quot;in this case, given the size of the unmet medical need and given the fact that very large outcome trials are well along, my comfort level with the drugs was somewhat higher than that of the panel members.&quot; </p> <p> Dr Nissen said he was &quot;a little bit surprised at some of the pushback&quot; by some on the EMDAC. </p> <p> &quot;I would have thought that the vote might have been unanimous,&quot; Dr Nissen said. </p> <p> But, he added, &quot;people were voting their conscience, and I respect that.&quot; </p> <p> Nonetheless, Dr Nissen pointed out that the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of approval. </p> <p> &quot;Given the fact the FDA generally follows the advice of its panels, I would expect them to provide an approval, but for a somewhat limited population initially,&quot; he said. &quot;The emphasis on statins first is certainly an appropriate thing to do. It's the responsible approach to all of this.&quot; </p> <p> The FDA is expected to make a decision by 24 July on Praluent and 27 August for Repatha. </p> <p> <b>Injectable route a turnoff?</b> </p> <p> While Dr Nissen acknowledged using injectable drugs is commonplace in many fields of medicine &ndash; like cancer and rheumatology &ndash; &quot;cardiology is not one of them.&quot; </p> <p> So as the PCSK9 inhibitors come onto the market, &quot;we'll have to get cardiologists comfortable&quot; with using injectables, he said. </p> <p> But Dr Nissen didn't perceive the injectable route of administration to be a problem, given that Praluent and Repatha will be available as single-use pre-filled autoinjector pens or prefilled syringes &ndash; which he called &quot;very easy to use, and should not deter physicians and patients.&quot; </p> <p> <b>Low LDL concern</b> </p> <p> Dr Nissen also said he thought those on the FDA's EMDAC who had raised concerns about LDLs falling too low with the PCSK9 inhibitors &ndash; resulting in physicians stopping the use of statins or reducing those drugs to keep patients on the newer products &ndash; were being overly worried. </p> <p> &quot;The problem with that logic is there's not been any evidence of any harm with low LDL levels,&quot; he said. &quot;Their concerns were not concerns that were on my mind.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;People have to understand that these drugs are going to be used in patients who don't have an adequate response with the statins,&quot; Dr Nissen added. &quot;If you administer a drug to people who have been given a statin and who don't get their LDL down and you finally get their LDL down by adding the drug, why would you pull back on the statin? That doesn't make any sense. I am not terribly concerned about that.&quot; </p> <p> <b>Payer reluctance</b> </p> <p> Dr Nissen had strong words for the payers, like CVS and Express Scripts, who already have been <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803">complaining about the potential costs</a> of PCSK9 inhibitors before the drugs have reached the market. </p> <p> &quot;They're in the business of profit,&quot; he said. &quot;We're in the business of making people healthier. So I have very little sympathy for pharmacy benefit managers.&quot; </p> <p> Dr Nissen noted that payers cover the &quot;tens of thousands of dollars&quot; in costs for cancer drugs, which often only extend the lives of patients by a matter of weeks. </p> <p> But PCSK9 inhibitors, he said, will be &quot;treating the number one cause of death in both men and women in the United States&quot; &ndash; heart disease &ndash; which affects about 27 million Americans, or just over 11% of the US population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p> <p> &quot;The costs of heart attack or a stroke are extraordinary, and these are devastating illnesses that are preventable,&quot; Dr Nissen declared. &quot;From my perspective, the value proposition is quite reasonable.&quot; </p> <p> But he also said he hoped the drug companies would price their PCSK9 inhibitors &quot;at a point that will be acceptable to patients and to society. And I hope they will provide a program so that people with low incomes can get access to the drugs.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;I think with some creativity, we can do this,&quot; Dr Nissen added. &quot;We can certainly afford to do this in a country where we spend on our military and other things to keep our population healthy.&quot; </p> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
