<p><p>With the failure of its lead compound squarely in the rearview, Vical has been looking for assets that could help pad its pipeline and a recent deal with Japan's Astellas is the key to moving forward for the biotech. </p><p>The San Diego-based company announced 25 March that it has in-licensed an IND-ready antifungal compound from Astellas that fits in with its new focus, as well as its budget. </p><p>"Post Allovectin failure we started a strategic process to find other assets," said Vical president and CEO Vijay Samant on a 26 March call. Samant noted that finding assets to add into the company's pipeline has been difficult because of a lack of opportunities within the biotech world and Vical has been forced to turn to unused assets at big pharma.</p><p>"It took us a long time to convince Astellas to conduct this deal," said Samant, who noted the pharma rarely out-licenses products. </p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, Vical has been granted the right to develop and commercialize ASP2397, an antifungal meant to treat invasive Aspergillus infections. The Japanese pharma will receive 1% of Vical's outstanding common stock, as well as $250,000 in cash. Astellas will also be eligible for $100 million in commercial and sales milestone payments. "Astellas was amenable to a deal structure that would allow us to conserve cash," admitted Samant. He noted the back-loaded deal structure as a positive for Vical and the biotech's expertise in infectious disease development as a boon for the bigger pharma. The company remains on track to have a cash burn of $12m to $15m for 2015. </p><p>The drug showed potent activity in preclinical animal studies conducted by Astellas; the drug reduced the colony count of aspergillus more rapidly than three already-marketed compounds. ASP2397has a novel mechanism of action and is excreted unchanged in the urine, resulting in a low likelihood of drug-to-drug interactions. The drug is a natural product discovered by Astellas from leaf litter fungus collected in a Malaysian national park.</p><p>"We believe these preclinical data sets demonstrating 2397's antifungal activity are very important," said Dr Michael Hodges, a consultant to Vical and a long-time veteran of Pfizer. Hodges sees the unique mechanism of action, the rapid onset of activity and the potential for the drug to be used as a front-line agent as exciting differentiators.</p><h2>GAINing advantages</h2><p>Vical hopes to take advantage of the incentives set forth by regulatory agencies to speed ASP2397 through the clinic. </p><p>Provisions under the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">2012 Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act</a>, including the qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation, have made the development of anti-infectives more appealing to pharmaceutical drugmakers. The incentives include an extra five years of marketing exclusivity, as well as a more succinct regulatory pathway. The steps were taken by the FDA to help boost the development of anti-infectives at a time when the pipeline had gone almost dry and more bacteria are developing resistance to currently used therapies, creating untreatable superbugs. </p><p>Vical intends to seek QIDP designation, as well as orphan status for ASP2397, and hopes to have Phase I studies underway by early 2016. </p><p>"The potential combination of smaller clinical trials required for approval and the better pricing and reimbursement may make the antifungal market more attractive in the future," said the company's senior VP of corporate development Dr Igor Bilinsky. "Vical plans to work closely with the FDA and other agencies to identify opportunities to use existing and emerging legislation in order to design quality, smaller, efficacy-focused trials."</p><p>Astellas <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Astellas-wins-FDA-nod-for-antifungal-Cresemba-357117" target="_new">recently gained the approval</a> of its own antifungal by the FDA; Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate) was the sixth QIDP designated product to be approved by the agency and has indications in two rare, but serious fungal infections. </p><p>The deal with Astellas could be just the first step in the path forward for the biotech, which anticipates doing at least one more similar deal in the future. Albeit, Samant admitted that cash constraints will keep the company from conducting more deals beyond that. </p><p>Vical has been trying to recover since mid-2013 when its lead compound, Allovectin (velimogene aliplasmid) <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vical-dives-as-Allovectin-terminated-on-conclusive-failure-345819" target="_new">failed to meet its primary endpoint</a> in a Phase III trial of metastatic melanoma patients. The clinical misstep pushed the stock down more than 60% to linger below $2 per share and forced the company to <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vical-cuts-47-workers-after-recent-Allovectin-failure-346005" target="_new">cut almost a third of its staff</a>. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
