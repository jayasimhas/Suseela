<p>Seeking to piggyback on what appears to be the FDA's reluctance to appeal a decision in a free-speech lawsuit brought by Amarin involving off-label promotion of its fish-oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl), Pacira Pharmaceuticals has filed its own challenge against the agency &ndash; hoping to further loosen regulators' grip on what drug makers can discuss about their medicines with doctors and in promotional materials.</p><p>Pacira's argument is somewhat different than Amarin's &ndash; insisting the FDA is attempting to narrow the labeling of its drug Exparel.</p><p>Nonetheless, Pacira's complaint against the FDA relies on the free-speech arguments Amarin has put forward.</p><p>Pacira even filed its petition at the same venue where Amarin launched its challenge: The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which is significant because it resides within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, whose December 2012 decision in <i>U.S. v. Caronia</i> cracked the very foundation of the FDA's argument against promoting unapproved uses of approved drugs.</p><p>Indeed, in overturning the October 2008 conviction of New York sales representative Alfred Caronia for conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce related to discussions he had with doctors about unapproved uses for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' narcolepsy drug Xyrem (sodium oxybate), the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Are-sleepless-nights-ahead-for-FDA-in-wake-of-off-label-narcolepsy-drug-verdict-337862" target="_new">Second Circuit declared</a> that "truthful" off-label promotion of US approved prescription therapies is not a criminal activity and is protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Want-To-Promote-Off-Label-Pick-Your-Battlefield-359838" target="_new">An Aug. 7 decision</a> by District Judge Paul Engelmayer further chipped away at the FDA's hold over off-label promotion &ndash; with the court granting a preliminary injunction and declaring Amarin could share certain "truthful and non-misleading" information about Vascepa "without incurring liability for misbranding."</p><p>The FDA appeared to blink late last month by agreeing to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Possible-FDAAmarin-Off-Label-Deal-Rule-Tweaks-Ahead-360183" target="_new">explore the possibility of a settlement</a> on the Amarin matter.</p><p>But that move may have been like blood in the water for some firms seeking to chomp away at the agency's ability to control prescription drug promotional activities. </p><p>A spokesman for Pacira pointed out, however, that the firm's conflict with the FDA had started long before the company filed its suit this week &ndash; and before the recent ruling in the Amarin case.</p><p>Investors appeared to embrace Pacira's move &ndash; sending shares of the firm up 5.2%, or $2.92, on Sept. 9, before closing at $60.18, up $2.71, or 4.7%.</p><p>In its complaint against the FDA, Pacira is charging that the agency is trying to restrict the firm's protected free speech about its approved medicine Exparel, a liposome injection of bupivacaine, an amide local anesthetic, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Paciras-long-acting-non-opioidpain-drug-gets-FDA-ok-323108" target="_new">approved in the U.S. in 2011</a> for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia.</p><p>The company asserted the FDA has attempted to narrow Exparel's approved indications through the agency's September 2014 warning letter, in which regulators demanded Pacira "immediately cease" sharing with surgeons, anesthesiologists and other "sophisticated" audiences certain information about using the drug outside of bunionectomy or hemorrhoidectomy procedures.</p><p>Specifically, the FDA objected to so-called "administration guides," which the agency described as "educational technique flashcards."</p><p>Regulators said the guides provided evidence that Exparel was "intended for new uses for which it lacks approval and for which its labeling does not provide adequate directions for use" &ndash; rendering the product "misbranded" within the meaning of the <i>Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</i> (FDCA).</p><p>In addition, the FDA said a journal ad misbranded the drug because it provided "evidence of the intended use of Exparel in surgical procedures other than those for which the drug has been shown to be safe and effective" and suggested that the medicine was "more effective than has been demonstrated."</p><p> The FDA argued in the warning letter the "Dosage and Administration" section of Exparel's labeling recommended dosing for "bunionectomy or hemorrhoidectomy only."</p><p>Regulators noted the "Clinical Studies" section "clearly states" that Exparel "has not been demonstrated to be safe and effective in other procedures."</p><p>"The approved labeling for Exparel does not provide instructions for or otherwise indicate that Exparel will be safe and effective for postsurgical pain if used in surgical procedures other than hemorrhoidectomy or bunionectomy," the FDA told the company. </p><p>Even though Pacira's administration guides included several disclaimers or disclosures, the FDA insisted those notices failed to "mitigate the overwhelming impression that Exparel is safe and effective for use in cholecystectomy and colectomy" &ndash; uses the agency claimed are not approved for the drug.</p><p>But Pacira, which said it took some corrective actions for its materials and has attempted on numerous occasions to meet with the FDA &ndash; only to be ignored by the agency &ndash; is arguing Exparel's label "reflects that it is approved for use in surgical sites generally."</p><p>The firm said the FDA was attempting through its warning letter to "retroactively" revise Exparel's labeling to limit its use to only bunionectomy or hemorrhoidectomy.</p><p>But, Pacira said in its complaint to the court, the "FDCA does not permit FDA to make such labeling changes except in limited circumstances where FDA becomes aware of new safety information about a serious risk associated with use of the drug after approval of the drug, and only after following designated procedures."</p><p>The company contended that the FDA's attempt to "silence Pacira's truthful and non-misleading speech is inconsistent with the FDCA and the First Amendment of the Constitution." </p><p>Pacira is asserting the FDA granted Exparel a "broad indication" for controlling postsurgical pain in "any" surgical site and had allowed the firm to promote that "consistent with that indication for years.</p><p>"Three years later, FDA appears to have concluded that Pacira should have received a narrower indication," the firm said, insisting the agency has accused the company of "criminal activity for supposedly off-label speech." </p><p>The company argued that even if the use of Exparel specific surgical sites beyond bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy were off-label, "such use would be lawful and Pacira's truthful and non-misleading speech about such use could not be deemed 'violative' of the FDCA, as FDA has threatened."</p><p>"As applied to Pacira's promotion of Exparel for surgical sites other than bunionectomy or hemorrhoidectomy, FDA's prohibition on off-label promotion would constitute a retroactive, <i>ex post facto</i> penalty in violation of the Due Process Clause" of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which requires U.S. federal agencies to establish clear rules that give fair notice of what is prohibited, the company argued, noting the courts have ruled that when speech is involved, rigorous adherence to those requirements is necessary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech, the firm contended.</p><p>But, the firm said, U.S. regulators have "failed to provide these requirements, instead creating uncertainty and doubt about what FDA views as permissible versus impermissible speech, violating Pacira's right to due process." </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
