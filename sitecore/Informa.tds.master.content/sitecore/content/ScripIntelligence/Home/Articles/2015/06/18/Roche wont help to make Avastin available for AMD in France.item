<p>Roche is refusing to play any part in French government efforts to make its anticancer Avastin available for off-label use in wet AMD under a "temporary use recommendation" (RTU), saying that it goes against the product's labeling and that other therapeutic alternatives are already available.</p><p>The company's position could lead to something of a stand-off with the medicines regulator, ANSM, which insists it is Roche's responsibility to implement the RTU and a patient monitoring program.</p><p>The RTU for Avastin (bevacizumab) was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/French-revolution-committee-OKs-off-label-Avastin-for-AMD-357480" target="_new">approved in March</a> by ANSM's benefit-risk evaluation committee on the grounds that it was non-inferior to Novartis's wet AMD drug Lucentis (ranibizumab) in terms of efficacy and showed "no significant difference" with regard to systemic adverse effects. </p><p>ANSM subsequently sent Roche a draft treatment protocol laying out the procedures for monitoring patients and collecting information on the efficacy, safety and conditions of use of Avastin under the RTU. </p><p>Normally, RTUs are unproblematic, as they are simply a mechanism for making an unapproved drug available for a specific condition where no other drugs are available. But under controversial legislation passed last year, the authorities can now approve an RTU even where doctors already have suitable treatments at their disposal.</p><p>Although it is not explicitly stated in the law, the aim is to allow the off-label use of drugs that are cheaper than those already authorized for that condition &ndash; in this case Lucentis and Bayer's Eylea (aflibercept). </p><p>Roche said the proposed RTU for Avastin in wet AMD "contradicts EU labeling and, in the presence of other licensed therapeutic alternatives, weakens the established regulatory framework in the EU through which the benefit and risk of medicines are formally assessed and patient safety is ensured". Such action, it said, risked creating "multiple standards for medicines in the EU and raised serious questions regarding pharmacovigilance and product liability".</p><p>Doctors should be able to make informed decisions about the treatments they prescribe, the company said, adding that it would "continue to make them aware of the known risks associated with the off-label use of bevacizumab in the eye". This would include alerting doctors to the fact that Avastin has neither been developed nor manufactured according to quality standards for drugs to be injected into the eye. </p><p>Roche said it "could not assume responsibility" for implementing the RTU and monitoring Avastin for a use that it does not recommend and that is contrary to its EU marketing authorization and the precautions in the summary of product characteristics.</p><p>"While we recognize the budgetary pressures faced by governments, economic considerations must not undermine the EU regulatory system that protects patient interests, particularly when several EU approved medicines (such as Eylea and Lucentis) are available," the company added. </p><p>ANSM is not impressed. It reminded the company that "according to the provisions of the Code of Public Health, it is up to the marketing authorization holder to implement an RTU and to monitor patients included in this mechanism". </p><p>Roche did add, however, that it might not oppose an RTU for Avastin that was implemented under the sole responsibility of the ANSM, as long as the company played no part and had no new obligations placed upon it. It suggested that in such a case a "third party" chosen by the ANSM could take charge of activities related to the new use and route of administration. Whether that will satisfy the regulator remains to be seen.</p>
