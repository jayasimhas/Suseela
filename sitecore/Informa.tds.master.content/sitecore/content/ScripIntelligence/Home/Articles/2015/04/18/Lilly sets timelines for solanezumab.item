<p><p>Expect Eli Lilly & Co to start giving analysts and investors some color on its Alzheimer's disease program by the end of 2016. Lilly revealed during its first quarter earnings call 23 April that the last patient visit in its study of its recently resurrected AD drug solanezumab is now expected in late 2016 &ndash; topline data should follow months later. </p><p>"I'm also pleased to announce that we have completed enrollment of the EXPEDITION 3 trial evaluating solanezumab in amyloid positive patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. Given that we completed enrollment ahead of schedule, we now expect last patient visit in October of 2016," said Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice on the call. </p><p>Solanezumab is a humanized version of mouse antibody m266, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a specific beta amyloid's epitope. It is hoped that binding and removal of soluble beta amyloid by the drug could lead to the dissolution of beta-amyloid plaques and result in slowing of the disease progression.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease has been one of the most challenging areas of R&D for big pharma, which has failed on multiple occasions to find disease-modifying treatments. Those failures have not only been costly, but have largely happened in late stages. Lilly has had its own failures in AD &ndash; including solanezumab. The drug showed some <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/therapysector/Third-time-lucky-for-Lillys-solanezumab-344978" target="_new">disappointing results</a> in earlier trials, but Lilly has chalked that up to a patient population that whose disease progression was too far along. The Indianapolis company is now hoping it can have better luck in the EXPEDITION 3 study with patients that are not as sick. It has also been hypothesized that the patients included in the trial may not have had beta-amyloid deposits and were misdiagnosed. </p><p>The company admitted during the call that the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is likely going to require combination therapies that tackle multiple mechanisms of action. When asked about the approach of targeting soluble amyloid beta &ndash; like solanezumab &ndash; versus plaque-specific monoclonal antibodies, Lilly noted the mechanisms might be complementary. </p><p>"As you rightly point out we also have specific interest in a Phase I program in that area. We are also excited about that mechanism. Recognizing that the mechanisms may, in fact, be complementary in some sense, either sequentially or combined together, that specific antibodies to date, the ones that we had published data on, also have a safety side effect profile that's, to our eye, quite different from solanezumab from the patient inherence perspective, et cetera, that may have an impact," said Lilly's head of Bio-Medicines Dave Rick. </p><p>"So we'll have to let both of these mechanisms play out. And we're excited about both of them and I think with Alzheimer's, it is truly unique moment here as we've seen these modifying effects from multiple different programs," the exec added. </p><p>Lilly will be taking a wait and see approach. "Let me just add that I think it's very likely that these mechanisms are complementary. And clearly solanezumab has also shown preferable safety profile, particularly in relation to ARIA on the brain edema dilemma that you see with this plaque-specific antibodies. So I think we now need to wait and see what happens with it in these bigger trials," added Jan Lundberg, president of Lilly Research Laboratories. </p><p><p><p>
