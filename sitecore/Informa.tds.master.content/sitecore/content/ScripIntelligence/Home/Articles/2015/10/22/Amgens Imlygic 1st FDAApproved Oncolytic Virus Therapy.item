<p>Amgen Inc. made history on Oct. 27 by gaining the FDA's approval for the first oncolytic virus therapy &ndash; Imlygic (talimogene laherparepvec), which is indicated as a local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery.</p><p>Shares of Amgen got a 1.5% boost, or a gain of $2.52, in after-hours trading on Oct. 27.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said he did not anticipate Imlygic as a single agent in the approved indication to be a material top-line driver for Amgen &ndash; modeling peak worldwide sales at $300m.</p><p>More importantly, he said, development continues of the drug in combination with other immune-oncology assets in melanoma and other solid tumors, which he said represents potential upside to his sales estimates, if successful.</p><p>Imlygic works differently in melanoma than Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s and Merck & Co.'s programmed death-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">Keytruda</a> (pembrolizumab).</p><p>Imlygic, which previously went by the name T-Vec, is a genetically modified herpes simplex virus type 1 designed to replicate within tumors and produce an immunostimulatory protein, called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). </p><p>Imlygic is intended to be injected directly into cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal lesions, resulting in selective lysis, or breakdown, of the injected tumor cells, but not the normal tissue. </p><p>The result, according to Amgen, is the release and presentation of tumor-derived antigens and local expression of GM-CSF to initiate a systemic anti-tumor immune response that also induces regression of noninjected and distant lesions.</p><p>A treatment course with Imlygic consists of a series of injections. After the initial injection, a second dose is administered three weeks later, followed by additional doses every two weeks for at least six months, unless other treatment is required or until there are no remaining injectable lesions to treat.</p><p>Amgen, which said it intends to make Imlygic available to US patients within the week, said the average cost of the drug would be $65,000, which J.P. Morgan's Kasimov noted was about $10,000 lower than he had anticipated.</p><p>"We actually find it somewhat refreshing that a company isn't simply pushing the price of a cancer drug &ndash; and an immuno-oncology one at that &ndash; as aggressively as possible, at least until there's more robust data supporting it," Kasimov said in an Oct. 27 research note. </p><p>He said he didn't think the slightly-lower-than-expected price would materially impact his commercial estimates for Imlygic.</p><p>Because there is expected to be variability in dosing from patient to patient with Imlygic, Amgen said it would work with the health care community to implement a program that helps keep the cost to the $65,000 per year amount for eligible participating institutions. </p><p>Amgen also said it would provide assistance for Imlygic in the US, with free medicine available to qualifying individuals with no or limited drug coverage through the Safety Net Foundation.</p><p>In addition, the company noted it also offers a copay coupon program for Imlygic through the Amgen FIRST STEP Program, which helps commercially insured patients meet their co-payment obligations. The program has no income requirement, Amgen pointed out. </p><p>Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said Imlygic is the "first clinical and regulatory validation" of an oncolytic virus as a therapy.</p><p>"Not all melanoma patients currently benefit from available therapies," Harper noted. </p><p>Imlygic, he said, "represents an important new option that can provide meaningful durable responses for patients with this aggressive and complex disease.'</p><p>According to the National Cancer Institute, about 74,000 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, with nearly 10,000 dying from the disease.</p><p>"Metastatic melanoma continues to be one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers because it is often insensitive to chemotherapy, can be highly aggressive and can require several different types of treatment depending on the stage and location of the disease and health of the patient," said Howard Kaufman, associate director for clinical science at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and president of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), who served as the principal investigator for the OPTiM pivotal trial of Imlygic. "Despite new therapeutic options, additional treatments are needed, particularly for patients with metastatic disease." </p><p>Lisa Butterfield, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and SITC's vice president, said Imlygic offers a two-pronged approach for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. </p><p>"The combination of the virus with GM-CSF increases the drug&rsquo;s cancer-killing effect while activating the immune system to kill melanoma cells &ndash; even those that are distant from the treated tumor," she explained. </p><p>Butterfield insisted Imlygic administration is "simple."</p><p>"It can be injected in an office visit and importantly, has no serious side effects," she said.</p><p>In approving Imlygic, the FDA followed the advice of its Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (CTGTAC) and Oncologic Drugs (ODAC) Advisory Committees, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Amgens-T-Vec-with-caveats-358133" target="_new">voted 22-1</a> at a joint meeting in April that the drug has an overall favorable benefit-risk profile.</p><p>After the advisory committee meeting, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the likelihood of Imlygic making it to the market at 85%, which was 3% above the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Amgen's single multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase III study, known as study 005/05, tested Imlygic in 436 patients with stages IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma that was not surgically resectable, comparing the drug against GM-CSF.</p><p>Amgen reported there was a statistically significant higher durable response rate, including complete responses or partial responses, maintained for at least six months with T-Vec, versus GM-CSF.</p><p>But in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Uphill-battle-for-Amgens-T-Vec-FDA-expresses-uncertainty-358082" target="_new">briefing documents</a> released ahead of the April 29 advisory committee meeting, the FDA's reviewers said there was "uncertainty" about the meaningfulness of the observed responses in study 005/05. They also suspected there was bias involved, which they said "could have had substantial impact on the results of the survival analysis" of Imlygic.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
