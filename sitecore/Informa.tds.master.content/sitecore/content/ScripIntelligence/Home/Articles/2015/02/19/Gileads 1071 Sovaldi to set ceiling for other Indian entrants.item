<p>Gilead Sciences expects its $300 per bottle price for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir 400mg tablets) in India to act as a ''ceiling price'' for other market entrants. India is the first Asian nation to approve the blockbuster hepatitis C therapy.</p><p>Gilead has appointed Mylan's Indian arm, Mylan Pharmaceuticals, as the exclusive distributor in India of Sovaldi and Harvoni (ledipasvir 90mg/sofosbuvir 400mg tablets) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. </p><p>Mylan expects to begin distribution of Sovaldi in India in 2Q. Sovaldi received regulatory approval in India in January 2015. India's apex committee for regulating clinical trials had previously endorsed trial waivers for five products, including sofosbuvir and the anticancer enzalutamide (Astellas/Medivation's Xtandi; <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/With-trial-waivers-India-moots-PMS-norms-for-anticancers-355956%5d" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 6 January 2015)</a>.</p><p>Gilead confirmed to <i>Scrip</i> that Sovaldi would be priced at $300 per bottle/per month in India. With each bottle containing 28 tablets, this works out to just over $10.71 per tablet.</p><p>Asked whether Gilead expects the Bangladeshi firm Incepta's launch of sofosbuvir in certain least developed countries at about $10 each to have any impact, Gilead reiterated its price point for Sovaldi in India and added that its licensing agreements [which include India] allow the generic manufacturers to set their own prices for the product they produce. </p><p>''We would therefore expect the $300 per bottle for branded product to act as a ceiling price for other market entrants,'' Gilead told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Incepta Pharmaceuticals recently launched a generic version of Sovaldi at a maximum retail price of Taka800 ($10.40) per tablet <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>Last year Gilead entered into licensing deals with the seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a>. Biocon was recently added to the list of licensees. Licensees are expected to pay a royalty &ndash; estimated at around 7% &ndash; to Gilead under the deal.</p><p>Gilead had subsequently added a third drug, GS-5816, a next-generation NS5A inhibitor, which is being developed in a single-pill, fixed-dose combination with Sovaldi to treat more HCV genotypes than Harvoni, to its licensing agreements with the pharmaceutical manufacturers in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-adds-GS-5816-to-hepatitis-C-licensing-deals-in-India-356384%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 26 January 2015)</a>. </p><h2>WHO prequalification</h2><p>Meanwhile, Gilead also clarified that there was no clause for sub-licensing of technology under the deal with the Indian firms. </p><p>On whether the Indian licensees for sofosbuvir can go through with an expression of interest for World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification for supply of sofosbuvir, Gilead told <i>Scrip</i> that a mechanism for WHO pre-qualification of HCV drugs had been recently established.</p><p>''Licensees agree that they will manufacture in a manner consistent with (i) the applicable Indian manufacturing standards; (ii) either WHO pre-qualification standards, standards of the European Medicines Agency, FDA tentative approval standards, or the standards of other similarly stringent regulatory authorities; and (iii) on a country-by-country basis, any applicable national, regional or local standards as may be required by the specific country where product is sold,'' Gilead explained.</p><p>It is not immediately clear if firms like Incepta or other Indian aspirants that were not part of Gilead's licensing deal would pursue a WHO pre-qualification for sofosbuvir.</p><p>On whether Gilead expects to enforce any special precautions to prevent ''suitcase'' exports of cut-price Sovaldi generics to the developed world, the US firm said that licensees were committed to working with Gilead and its partners to ''design measures'' to ensure that these medicines are not ''diverted '' from their intended recipients and outside those countries in the agreements. Treatment with Sovaldi in the US is reported to cost $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for a 12-week course.</p>
