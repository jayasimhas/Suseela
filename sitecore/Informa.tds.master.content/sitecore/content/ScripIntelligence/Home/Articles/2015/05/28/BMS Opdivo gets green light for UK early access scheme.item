<p>In what appears to be only the second such decision by the UK regulator, the MHRA, Bristol-Myers Squibb's advanced melanoma product Opdivo (nivolumab) has been given the go-ahead to enter the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS), meaning it can be made available in advance of its EU approval.</p><p>The anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's scientific committee, the CHMP, for adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma on 23 April, and is now awaiting formal marketing authorization by the European Commission. The company said it could not speculate as to when approval might be granted, although this generally happens two to three months after a positive opinion. </p><p>BMS also applied for the drug to be considered for the EAMS, and in January it gained a "Promising Innovative Medicine" (PIM) designation from the MHRA. This is the first stage in gaining access to the scheme: the second is a positive MHRA scientific opinion, which is what Opdivo has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-access-to-medicines-scheme-eams-scientific-opinion-nivolumab" target="_new">just received</a>. This opinion comprises a public assessment report and three treatment protocols, for patients, healthcare professionals, and on the pharmacovigilance system. </p><p>The aim of the EAMS is to allow early availability of promising new unlicensed drugs for patients with a high unmet medical need, generally for seriously debilitating or life-threatening conditions with no adequate treatment options. </p><p>Johanna Mercier, general manager, BMS UK & Ireland, said the company was "delighted that the MHRA has recognized the value, innovation and survival benefit that nivolumab can offer to patients in the UK". </p><p>The first product to gain an EAMS scientific opinion, in March this year, was Merck's new drug, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-UK-patients-to-get-Mercks-Keytruda-after-landmark-early-access-decision-357232" target="_new">Keytruda</a> (pembrolizumab), which is also for advanced melanoma. Keytruda was also one of three immune-oncology drugs to be granted a positive opinion by the CHMP at its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EUs-CHMP-green-lights-three-immune-oncology-drugs-358565" target="_new">May meeting</a>. The other two were Opdivo for the treatment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer and United Therapeutics' Unituxin (dinutuximab) for neuroblastoma in young patients.</p><p>Opdivo has been in the news recently over its efficacy in combination with another BMS drug, Yervoy (ipilimumab), in patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma. BMS announced a couple of days ago that it had gained <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-combo-gains-priority-review-358701" target="_new">priority review</a> for a supplemental BLA for the combination, and that it expected the FDA to reach a decision by the end of September. </p><h2>Opdivo assessment report</h2><p>In the EAMS public assessment report prepared for Opdivo, the MHRA says that the product's effects have been studied in 418 patients with advanced melanoma who had not received prior therapy, and in 405 patients who had previously received ipilimumab and, where appropriate, a BRAF inhibitor, after this treatment had not worked or had stopped working.</p><p>Among patients who had not received previous therapy, those treated with nivolumab had an increase in overall survival: after 12 months, 73% were alive compared to 42% of those treated with dacarbazine, the assessment report says. Among patients who had failed previous therapies, tumor shrinkage was observed in 32% of those treated with nivolumab compared with 11% of those treated with chemotherapy. The most frequent side-effects were mild to moderate in severity.</p><p>The MHRA said results on survival were still preliminary and that BMS had agreed to provide more information as it becomes available.</p><p>A risk management plan has also been developed to ensure that Opdivo is used as safely as possible under the EAMS. BMS must ensure that healthcare professionals and patients are provided with information on the medicine, including side-effects related to the excessive activity of the immune system, and recommendations for minimising these side effects. </p><p>Information will be collected about patients before they enter the scheme, and healthcare professionals will be asked by the company to report adverse effects experienced by patients receiving nivolumab through the scheme. These safety data will be reviewed and reported to the MHRA by the company on a regular basis.</p><p>Patients in the EAMS will also receive an alert card summarising the important risks with the medicine, which they should carry with them in case they need treatment or advice from a doctor who is not familiar with nivolumab treatment, the MHRA says.</p>
