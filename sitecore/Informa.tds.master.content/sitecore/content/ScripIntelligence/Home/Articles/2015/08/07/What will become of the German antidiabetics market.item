<p>Yet another company &ndash; this time Novo Nordisk &ndash; has decided that it wouldn't be good business to sell its antidiabetic in Germany following a rocky ride through the AMNOG benefit assessment and pricing negotiations. While companies are worried about the future of treatments for chronic diseases in Germany, prescribers and health insurers are more sanguine and believe that German patients are not yet missing out on important innovations in the market. </p><p>Novo Nordisk has decided to stop distributing its ultra-long lasting basel insulin Tresiba (insulin degludec) by September. It joins several other companies that have withdrawn their new diabetes drugs from the German market following an AMNOG assessment: Boehringer Ingelheim (Trajenta, linagliptin); Janssen (Invokana, canagliflozin, and Vokanamet, canagliflozin plus metformin), Sanofi (Lyxumia, lixisenatide) and Novartis (Galvus, vildagliptin, and Eucreas, vildagliptin plus metformin). These assessments, introduced in 2011, see a new drug go head to head against its competitors in order to prove that it offers added benefits for patients. On the basis of that assessment the manufacturer must then agree with health insurers a discount on the freely set launch price for that drug. If a drug has no added benefits, its price should be similar to that of its competitors already on the market. </p><p>Critics of the system believe that it is weighted against products for treating chronic disease like diabetes. "There is a systematic discrimination in the evaluation of chronic diseases such as diabetes, as additional benefit often cannot be demonstrated according to the requirements," said Matthias Heck, from the BPI, an association that represents the German pharmaceutical industry. The problem is that the evaluations focus on hard endpoints such as morbidity and mortality, for example preventing cardiac events and deaths, he explains. For chronic diseases like diabetes, the pivotal trials are too short to display these endpoints. Meanwhile, surrogate parameters like HbA1c reduction, weight gain and preventing hypoglycemia are generally not recognized in the early benefit assessment, he said. </p><p>Dr Cordula Riederer, pharmacist at DAK, one of Germany's biggest health insurers, agrees that manufacturers of therapies for chronic diseases have a more difficult time in proving their drug's value because it is not possible to see the effects of a product on endpoints like morbidity and mortality over the period of a clinical study. She suggests that endpoints centered around quality of life should play a greater role in the assessments for chronic diseases.</p><p>Nevertheless, she does not believe that German patients are missing out on diabetes products just yet. For now, there are plenty of alternatives to the products that have been withdrawn. For example, other gliptins aside from Trajenta and Galvus are available. Nor is Tresiba a great loss and it will be easy enough to switch the 40,000 patients on the drug to another insulin, she says. Furthermore, she thinks Novo Nordisk would have known that it would be unlikely to succeed through the AMNOG, and that to launch then withdraw Tresiba was unfair to patients. </p><p>However she acknowledged that further down the line patients could miss out on new classes of antidiabetics given the difficulties manufacturers have in proving their benefits.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mathias Flume, from the Westphalia-Lippe Physicians Association, said the news about Tresiba was unsurprising. "We absolutely have enough insulins &#8230; we do not see that it has a benefit that was really needed," he told <i>Scrip</i>. He does not believe that diabetes products have a particularly tough time under the AMNOG and points out that SGLT2 inhibitors like BMS's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) have not made it on to the French market.</p><h2>Tresiba</h2><p>Novo had had its suspicions about how well Tresiba would do and initially in 2013 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novo-no-show-for-Tresiba-in-Germany-345996" target="_new">decided against launching</a>. However, Tresiba's "great reception" in 29 other markets and a good clinical data package convinced the firm to try to come to an agreement with German authorities, explained Jakob Riis, Novo Nordisk's executive vice-president, China, Pacific and Marketing. Tresiba's chief advantage is that it offers an ultra-long duration of action, beyond 42 hours, which gives patients more flexibility when dosing.</p><p>But it turned out that the company had been right in the first place. It was unable to show that its fourth-generation insulin offered any benefits over human insulin, the comparator selected by the GBA, the body in charge of the AMNOG assessments. Clinical trials had been powered to compare Tresiba against insulin glargine and so the company didn't have the required data. In addition, Novo Nordisk declined to publish certain data that it claims was confidential. </p><p>It was therefore unable to argue a satisfactory price with the GKV, the association of health insurers, and Novo Nordisk would have to have accepted a price of around &euro;1 per day, down from a launch price of &euro;2.5 per day. Mr Riis declined to comment how low the company would have gone, but said that Novo Nordisk was prepared to "stretch quite far."</p><p>"If we were to accept the price of 30-year-old products, it would completely undermine our ability to research our products," Mr Riis, told <i>Scrip</i>. He complained that failing the assessment for technical reasons without actually discussing the data or the drug's benefits was a big problem. "You aren't doing patients any favors," he said. He worries that further down the line patients in Germany will only have access to older antidiabetics.</p><p>
