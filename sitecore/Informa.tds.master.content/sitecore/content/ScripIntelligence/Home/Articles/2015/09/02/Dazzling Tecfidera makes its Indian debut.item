<p>Biogen Idec has announced launch plans in India for Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) &ndash; the first oral therapy for remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the country.</p><p>Biogen's Indian affiliate said that it received approval for the product from the Drugs Controller General of India and that the approval was based on data from a clinical development program of two global Phase III studies in more than 2,600 patients, including some from India. </p><p>The company declined to share pricing details, but indicated that the Indian price was ''different'' and potentially lower than comparable Western prices for the product. </p><p>Tecfidera will be marketed by Biogen's own field force that is estimated to cover around 1,000 neurologists in India. </p><p>The product will be available in India commencing the second week of February, a company statement said. </p><p>Biogen's Tysabri (natalizumab) and Avonex (interferon beta-1a) are already on the Indian market and the company hopes that the launch of Tecfidera will offer new patients a more convenient therapy option. </p><p>There are an estimated 200,000 MS patients in India, according to some previous reports in the local media.</p><p>Biogen, however, declined to comment on the Tecfidera's potential prospects and whether it expects the product to take market share from first-line interferon therapies and generic Copaxone (glatiramer acetate). The Indian company Natco has been selling its cut-price generic version of Copaxone in India since 2007 and last year sources had indicated that sales of the product (marketed as Glatimer) were in the region of INR500,000 (then $8,097) per month <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indian-court-returns-Tevas-Copaxone-process-infringement-suit-350347" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 3 March 2014)</a>. The latest figures for Glatimer in India could not be ascertained.</p><p>Globally Tecfidera had been grabbing a significant share of newly diagnosed patients and the drug's EU launch was ramping up faster than in the US, the firm's top brass have indicated <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-Amgen-Biogen-BMS-Celgene-Novartis-Pfizer-and-Roche-356329%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 January 2015)</a>.</p><p>Tecfidera, with sales of $2.9bn last year, appears to be on course to emerging as Biogen Idec's top-selling product globally, ahead of current best-seller Avonex <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tecfidera-pushes-Biogen-revenue-40-higher-in-2014-356453%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare had earlier forecast the multiple sclerosis market at $14.9bn in the US, Japan, and five major EU markets in 2014, set to peak at $18.6bn by 2018, backed by a strong growth trajectory and an uptake of novel oral therapies. It also expects peak sales of Tecfidera of $5.3bn in 2023.</p>
