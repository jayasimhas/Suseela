<p>The Turkish pharmaceutical market delivered a good performance in 2014, growing by around 9%, although the declining lira meant market expansion remained insignificant in US dollar terms. Alimentary, antineoplastic and immunomodulatory products became best sellers, and as of the end of November 2014, Novartis led the market.</p><p>Despite the fact that the Turkish pharmaceutical market managed to grow well in value in local currency terms in 2014, the volatility of exchange rates wiped out any increase in US dollars.</p><p>The total market reached TRY14.6bn by the end of December, which represented an increase of 8.8% over the previous year's TRY13.4bn. However, while the market in dollars was $6,238m at the end of 2013 (at a rate TRY2.15 to a dollar on 31 December 2013), it increased only marginally to $6,265m at the end of 2014 (at TRY2.33 per dollar on 31 December 2014).</p><p>In fact, with the most recent developments in the exchange rate, which have brought it to TRY2.46 per dollar, the market value in 2014 would have shrunk to $5.9bn.</p><h2>top products</h2><p>According to ATC 1-based market analysis for the reimbursed market (IMS data), alimentary tract and metabolism products were last year's best sellers in the country with TRY2.03bn, an increase of 10.1% over 2013.</p><p>Antineoplastics and immunomodulatory products also displayed strong growth of 16.7% last year and reached the figure of TRY1.6bn, followed by nervous system products, which managed TRY1.48bn, a growth of 5.3% over the previous year.</p><p>Despite the fact that their growth stayed negative at &ndash;1.3%, systemic anti-infectives were fourth in the reimbursed market with TRY1.47bn, while respiratory system products sales in this market grew by 7% to reach TRY1,368m. The sixth major product group was cardiovasculars, which reached TRY1,360m.</p><h2>top companies</h2><p>By company, Novartis led the reimbursed market as of the end of November 2014.</p><p>A list of market shares and sales of the top five companies in the Turkish reimbursed market for the 12 months to November 2014 (IMS data) also gives a strong idea about the shape of competition in Turkey in 2014.</p><p>Strong sales of TRY817.6m, a 6.2% market share and 8.3% growth over the previous 12 months were enough to put Novartis on the top of the pile. The company repeated its successful performance of 2013, when it was also the market leader.</p><p>Second was Abdi Ibrahim Ilac Sanayi ve Tic AS, as in 2013, with a 5% market share and sales of TRY650.9m, growing by an impressive 10.9% over the previous 12 months. Sanofi followed, delivering a very strong growth performance of 12.5% and grabbing a 4.7% market share with sales of TRY614.8m. The strong third place performance represented a significant leap from its eighth place in 2013.</p><p>Pfizer kept its fourth place with sales of TRY554.3m, a growth of 2.2% over the previous 12 months' performance, while Bilim Pharmaceuticals was in fifth &ndash; down from third place in 2013 &ndash; with sales of TRY486.4m, which shrank by 5.2%, and a market share of 3.7%.</p><p>Among the big players, Bayer's performance seemed to decline in 2014, although it still managed to grow by 3.8% to TRY446.7m, and had a market share of 3.4%. Bayer was eighth in the list, down from fifth in 2013.</p><p>It seems that despite the complaints of the industry about government pricing policies, most of the big companies managed to reach their targets in 2014. Representatives of the industry just hope that the number of good performers will increase this year.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
