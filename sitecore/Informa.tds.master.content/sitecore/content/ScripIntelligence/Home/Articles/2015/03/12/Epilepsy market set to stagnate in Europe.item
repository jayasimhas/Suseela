<p> As the market for epilepsy drugs emerges from the first patent cliff that eroded much of its value over 2008&ndash;09, Datamonitor Healthcare has been evaluating its prospects over the coming years. The value of the epilepsy market will undergo steady growth in the US and Japan, but &ndash; despite a spate of recent launches &ndash; in the five major EU markets it is likely to remain flat. </p> <p> The US is the largest market for epilepsy drugs, owing to its large diagnosed patient population and the high prices that manufacturers can command for branded products. &quot;The US market will grow from $2.7bn to a peak of $4.4bn in 2021, driven largely by the uptake of UCB's latest successful epilepsy drug Vimpat (lacosamide),&quot; <a href="https://service.datamonitorhealthcare.com/disease/central-nervous-system/neurology/epilepsy/forecast/article104406.ece?sg=article" target="_new">predicts Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Daniel Chancellor</a>. &quot;Other recent launches, including innovative new anti-epileptic drugs from Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline and Dainippon Sumitomo, as well as Supernus's once-daily reformulations, will all add to the market's overall expansion,&quot; he adds. </p> <p> Despite its loss of exclusivity, UCB's Keppra (levetiracetam) remains the highest selling drug in the epilepsy space. Datamonitor Healthcare believes that UCB will continue to dominate the epilepsy market as Vimpat's historical growth, additional epilepsy indications, and expansion to Japan will propel the drug to blockbuster sales. </p> <p> However, Eisai's Fycompa (perampanel) is expected to perform the best of the recently launched products. Eisai is an established company in the epilepsy market and has the geographic reach to target the US, Japan, and five major EU markets, notes Mr Chancellor. &quot;Unlike some of its competitors, Fycompa has both an innovative mode of action and is in further clinical development for generalized seizures.&quot; </p> <p> Japan is the second largest market for epilepsy drugs, worth an estimated $493m in 2013, according to Datamonitor Healthcare. Although it has traditionally lagged behind its Western counterparts, the introduction of second-generation anti-epileptic drugs such as Keppra and Lamictal (lamotrigine; GlaxoSmithKline) has greatly boosted the Japanese market. &quot;Further uptake of these therapies, coupled with additional product launches, will see the market grow at a CAGR of 3.4% to $664m in 2022,&quot; predicts Mr Chancellor. </p> <p> The combined five major EU markets are estimated to be worth $1.2bn in 2013. Germany is the largest single market in this region, worth $395m in 2013, although Datamonitor Healthcare expects widespread contraction over 2013&ndash;22. &quot;European markets are experiencing far greater control over drug prices, with no increases expected in the cost of therapy. Furthermore, strict health technology assessments, especially in Germany, are making the environment extremely difficult for companies seeking to set price premiums for their new therapies,&quot; concludes Mr Chancellor. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>Growth forecast for epilepsy market 2013-2022: US, Japan, 5EU markets</b></i> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/BAF949BA8B254922944055354B5E75EF.ashx"> </p>
