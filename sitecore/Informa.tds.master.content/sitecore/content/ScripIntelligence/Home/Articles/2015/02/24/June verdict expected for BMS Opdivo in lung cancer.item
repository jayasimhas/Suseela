<p>The FDA has granted a priority review to Bristol-Myers Squibb's application for Opdivo (nivolumab) as a treatment for patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior therapy. </p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision by 22 June, the drug's <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date.</p><p>But if things go as smoothly as the company's application in advanced melanoma &ndash; which won approval in December 2014 three months before its PDUFA date &ndash; BMS could be looking at another early decision for the drug in NSCLC (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>).</p><p>BMS is hoping to be the first company with an immuno-oncology agent on the US market to treat advanced squamous NSCLC.</p><p>Opdivo is in a race for approval in the NSCLC indication with Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which also gained approval last year in melanoma (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">4 September 2014</a>).</p><p>BMS said its application was based on its single arm, open-label CheckMate -063 Phase II study, which was designed to assess advanced squamous NSCLC patients who progressed after both platinum-based therapy and at least one additional systemic therapy.</p><p>In January, BMS revealed its Phase III CheckMate-017 study of Opdivo in previously treated patients with advanced, squamous cell NSCLC was stopped early because the trial met its endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival versus docetaxel (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
