<p><p>Personalized treatment plans for oncology are becoming increasingly more important as companies develop therapies based on certain mutations. Boehringer Ingelheim and Kantar Health teamed up to survey 562 physicians in 10 countries to see how those doctors are using genetic testing in their practices. </p><p>According to the survey, physicians aren't looking at genetic profiles very often when determining the best course of treatment for their patients. Results from the survey showed that 60% of US oncologists do not determine their treatment protocols based on EGFR mutation subtype. Meanwhile, 26% of US physicians decided on therapy for their patients with advanced NSCLC before their mutation test results were available, compared to 30% in Europe and 12% in Asia.</p><p>The main reasons for not conducting genetic tests &ndash; said the survey &ndash; were insufficient tissue samples, poor performance status and test results taking too long to come back.</p><p>"When a lung cancer diagnosis is made, it's important to receive a biomarker test to determine whether particular mutations like EGFR are present," said Dr Edward Kim of the Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas HealthCare System in Charlotte, NC. "EGFR mutation status is a critical prognostic factor that many doctors use when determining the most appropriate treatment options for patients. One would not start a patient with breast cancer on treatment without knowing hormone receptor or HER-2 status. We must be diligent in testing appropriate patients for mutation status to offer the appropriate therapy."</p><p>Results from the survey were presented at the 2015 European Lung Cancer Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.</p><p><p>
