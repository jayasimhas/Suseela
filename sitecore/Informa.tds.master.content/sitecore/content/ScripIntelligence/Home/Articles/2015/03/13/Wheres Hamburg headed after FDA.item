<p>Dr Margaret Hamburg, one of the longest serving commissioners of the FDA in recent years, would not reveal during a 12 March Capitol Hill hearing where's she's headed after she departs the agency in a few weeks.</p><p>But then again, perhaps she's not yet really made up her mind.</p><p>"I made my decision to step down independent of future opportunities," Dr Hamburg told lawmakers about her <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">5 February revelation</a> that she planned to leave by the end of March after serving nearly six years in the job.</p><p>"I'm going to rest, relax, regroup and then decide," she said. "But I suspect that I'll still be involved in many of the kinds of issues that I've dealt with at the FDA."</p><p>"You look a little too happy," Senator Jeff Merkley (Democrat-Oregon) told a broadly smiling Dr Hamburg at the opening of the 12 March hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies, noting it was the last time the FDA chief will appear before that panel.</p><p>But before her departure, lawmakers grilled Dr Hamburg on a handful of issues, particularly generic drugs and the agency's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">November 2013 proposed rule</a> to allow those manufacturers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes &ndash; just like makers of brand-name medicines do already.</p><p>The goal of the rule, which the FDA had initially intended to finalize in December 2014 but has since delayed it, "is to ensure patients and healthcare providers can get access to the most recent safety information wherever it emerges from, whether from experience with an innovator or a generic drug and that the system enable rapid and responsive communication of information," Dr Hamburg explained.</p><p>She noted the agency has received numerous comments involving "lots of stakeholders' perspectives."</p><p>"We've tried to listen carefully," Dr Hamburg said, adding the agency has held a number of meetings on the matter with industry, and plans to hold a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-FDA-to-face-generic-labeling-rule-critics-356883" target="_new">27 March</a> open public gathering to examine the issue.</p><p>"We do plan to proceed with finalizing, but we want to make sure the process is inclusive," Dr Hamburg said.</p><p> "The goal is to provide the best possible information for patients and most timely," she added.</p><p>Realistically, Dr Hamburg said, "one of the concerns is, if only innovator can make the change, the sponsor of the original product, then what happens in the world where there's increasing reliance on generics and some of the original drugs are no longer in the marketplace?"</p><p>Dr Hamburg disputed a charge by Senator Roy Blunt (Republican-Missouri) that the FDA is taking 42 months to approve a generic drug, which the lawmaker claimed was up from 30 months in 2011.</p><p>"I'm not aware of those numbers you are citing," Dr Hamburg said. "In fact, we have been making a major push in the generic drug area."</p><p>She acknowledged it was "true that we have had an unacceptable backlog in approval times."</p><p>But Dr Hamburg said the user fees granted for generic drugs under the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) have allowed the FDA to make "great progress in addressing the backlog" of generic drugs, which now account for more than 80% of the medicines prescribed in the US. </p><p>"Many of the generic drugs are actually manufactured overseas, so there's an additional complexity in our approval process of the need to do inspections of facilities before approval and the additional time and cost of the international component," Dr Hamburg explained. "The fact that we have this user fee program in place, which has measureable goals and performance measures that are transparent and are monitored by industry and others, I think you're going to see enormous progress. We've made enormous progress."</p><p>She said the FDA has actually addressed 65% of the existing 4,000 or so application backlog that was in place at the time FDASIA went into effect.</p><p>"I think you will be pleased with the progress," she said.</p><p>Dr Hamburg said the FDA anticipates having the backlog eliminated by 2017. </p><p><b>Ebola activities</b></p><p>At the hearing, Dr Hamburg also said that while the FDA wasn't "quite as visible" as the other US health agencies in addressing the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, drug and device regulators have been "very actively involved."</p><p>"We aren&rsquo;t the front-page news on the response to the Ebola crisis, but we have played a very meaningful role, in terms of trying to make, as yet, unapproved medical products available as needed for diagnosis or treatment of individuals at risk of disease or with disease," Dr Hamburg said.</p><p>"But importantly, also, working with our scientific colleagues to really put in place the systems for scientific evaluation and research so that we can actually learn what works and what doesn&rsquo;t in terms of new treatments and vaccines that may have a very important role in this continuing outbreak, but will be absolutely crucial to have when there is a future epidemic," she said.</p><p>Dr Hamburg pointed out that the FDA has had a role in monitoring for fraudulent products.</p><p>Sadly, in the Ebola situation, and as we&rsquo;ve seen in other public health crises there are people who readily jump to the opportunity to try to sell products that offer hope but no proven value so we have actually also taken action against some fraudulent products in the marketplace," she said.</p><p>Dr Hamburg praised lawmakers for making <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Funding-deal-gives-Ebola-5.4bn-FDA-NIH-slight-boosts-355535" target="_new">additional funds</a> available to the FDA to address Ebola.</p><p>"Sadly," Dr Hamburg said, "by the nature of this disease, there almost certainly will be future problems with Ebola in Africa and perhaps in other places."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
