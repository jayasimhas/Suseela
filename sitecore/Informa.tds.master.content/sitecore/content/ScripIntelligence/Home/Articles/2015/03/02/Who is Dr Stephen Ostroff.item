<p>When FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg revealed she planned to depart the agency next month, she said Dr Stephen Ostroff would be stepping into her shoes as the acting chief. </p><p>Who is Dr Ostroff? </p><p>Currently, he's the FDA's chief scientist &ndash; a job he's only held for about a year, initially in an acting capacity after the departure in February 2014 of Dr Jesse Goodman, who had been in the role since 2009. </p><p>Dr Goodman left the FDA to teach at Georgetown University in Washington and to lead its medical center's newly formed Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.</p><p>Dr Ostroff had joined the FDA in 2013, taking on the role of chief medical officer at the agency's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. </p><p>He came to the FDA from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where he was the deputy director of its National Center for Infectious Diseases.</p><p>The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine-educated physician also previously served as the acting director of CDC's Select Agent Program, which oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products.</p><p>He also had been an assistant surgeon general as a member of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps &ndash; the federal government's nonmilitary, uniformed force of health care professionals &ndash; but has since retired at the rank of rear admiral.</p><p>Before coming to the federal government, Dr Ostroff was involved in state public health, serving as the director of Pennsylvania's Bureau of Epidemiology. He also was the commonwealth's acting physician general.</p><p>Dr Ostroff experience includes consulting for the World Bank on public health projects in South Asia and Latin America.</p><p>It's unclear how long Dr Ostroff may be at the helm of the FDA. President Obama has yet to announce his choice for replacing Dr Hamburg, who has not yet revealed her future plans since telling her staff on 5 February she was leaving the agency (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The US Senate must confirm whoever the president selects to lead the FDA.</p><p>It's been widely speculated a possible contender for the next commissioner is Duke University's Dr Robert Califf, who is joining the FDA this month as the new deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco and may have been put into that role to ease him into the top job (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Dukes-Califf-takes-deputy-job-at-FDA-next-chief-356386" target="_new">26 January 2015</a>).</p><p>President Obama, however, could very well have someone else in mind for his next FDA chief.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
