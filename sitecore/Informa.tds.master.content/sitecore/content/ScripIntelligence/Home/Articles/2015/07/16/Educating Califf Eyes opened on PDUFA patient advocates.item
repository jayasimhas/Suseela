<p>Dr Robert Califf, the FDA's deputy commissioner of medical products and tobacco &ndash; and someone who has been widely speculated to be the next permanent chief &ndash; said his perspectives about a lot of things have changed since joining the agency this past winter after spending decades in academia.</p><p>Specifically, Dr Califf said he's had his eyes opened to the impact the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) has had on the drug development and regulatory processes and the role various stakeholders, including the patient advocacy community, play.</p><p>"As a relatively newcomer to the FDA, I'm actually almost overwhelmed with the importance and the magnitude of the PDUFA process, in particular," Dr Califf said on 15 July at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PDUFA-VI-launches-Not-Pluto-flyby-but-has-potential-359452" target="_new">public meeting</a> the US agency is required under law to hold to gain input before staring the negotiating process with the biopharmaceutical industry on the next user fee round, which would run from 2018-2022.</p><p>Dr Califf, a cardiologist and former vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at Duke University, who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Dukes-Califf-takes-deputy-job-at-FDA-next-chief-356386" target="_new">came into his FDA job in February</a>, said he knew about PDUFA when he was an "outsider," given he'd worked with the agency "a lot" before joining it &ndash; serving for several years on the agency's advisory committees.</p><p>"But on the inside, when you see how working together, identifying areas of mutual interest and the funding that comes with it have led to dramatic successes, it's really exciting," he said.</p><p>What's been done in the past with PDUFA, Dr Califf said, is "only really prelude to what can be done now, because it's an amazing time in biomedicine."</p><p>Since joining the FDA, Dr Califf said he's even changed his views about the use of the term "process" &ndash; a word he said he previously thought as connoting a "sterile cookbook of how to do things."</p><p>"That's not at all the case in the PDUFA negotiations," he said, declaring that in that case, the process is more than "just checking boxes and meeting timelines."</p><p>PDUFA, Dr Califf said, has "already led to a major increase in predictability of the regulatory effort."</p><p>He said he also hopes it creates a "better environment for innovators to work."</p><p>Dr Califf said when he was in the academic setting he was "a little afraid of patient advocacy groups."</p><p>But, he said, that has changed &ndash; noting he was swayed when he recently met with advocates for children with type I diabetes.</p><p>"They want safe and effective medical products, but they also want to have a chance at a cure, even if it produces some risk," Dr Califf said.</p><p>He said his perspective about patient advocacy groups actually started to change about five years ago when he was part of the executive committee for the Clinical Trials Transformative Initiative, a public-private partnership of multiple groups and the FDA aimed at identifying and promoting practices to increase the quality and efficiency of medical product studies. </p><p>"Patient advocates sort of took me aside and said, 'You've got to quit avoiding us. Here are the reasons you better pay attention to us,'" Dr Califf said. "It's one of the best pieces of advice I ever got."</p><p>"We're entering the era now where patient groups and multiple stakeholders exist in this ecosystem," he said. </p><p>"We do have differences, but where we can identify the common themes, this is where the real progress is going to be made, and it's very exciting," Dr Califf said.</p><p>He also made a point of thanking Dr Stephen Ostroff, the current acting commissioner of the FDA, who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Who-is-Dr-Stephen-Ostroff-356612" target="_new">took the reins in early April</a> after Dr Margaret Hamburg <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">departed</a> after nearly six years on the job.</p><p>"He stepped in with very little warning into this job, and I think he's handled it with pretty amazing grace and always standing up for the FDA and all of the people who work here," Dr Califf said about Dr Ostroff. </p><p>President Barack Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell have been mum on how soon a permanent FDA commissioner would be nominated &ndash; a position that must receive Senate confirmation.</p><p>But when Dr Califf's appointment was announced, FDA watchers were betting he was put in the deputy role to get him ready for the top job.</p><p>His hat tip to Dr Ostroff on 15 July may have been a signal the two men's roles could soon change.</p><p>But that's all speculation for now. President Obama could have someone else in mind altogether to lead the FDA or he could decide to leave Dr Ostroff in the job.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
