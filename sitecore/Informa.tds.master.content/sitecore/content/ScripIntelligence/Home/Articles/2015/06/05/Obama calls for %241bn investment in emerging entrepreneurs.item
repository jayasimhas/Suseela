<p>No doubt there wouldn't be much of a biopharmaceutical industry without its pioneering innovators, often scientists, who sought to be entrepreneurs, with many eventually growing their small businesses into successful global enterprises &ndash; likely with a lot of blood, sweat and tears.</p><p>Now, President Barack Obama wants to help make it easier for emerging startups to get their ideas off the ground and to the marketplace and has challenged US business leaders to help raise $1bn in private investment by 2017 to support aspiring entrepreneurs &ndash; with half of those funds intended to help women and younger Americans.</p><p>The Spark Global Entrepreneurship Initiative is intended to be a joint commitment between the private sector and the US federal government to incubate and grow innovation and entrepreneurship, the White House said.</p><p>The initiative, President Obama said, "brings together some of the most successful entrepreneurship programs across our government and makes sure that they're working with the private sector in ways that allow for long-term, sustained success."</p><p>President Obama said ensuring investment in entrepreneurship has been one of his top priorities.</p><p>Indeed, his administration already has several programs and pilots in place to assist startups, including those in the life sciences.</p><p>One of those is being run by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-I-Corps-takes-startups-on-focused-path-to-commercialization-355648" target="_new">I-Corps</a>, which is aimed at providing life sciences startups with real-world immersive learning about what it takes to successfully translate promising technologies into products or services that will benefit society.</p><p>"We want to spur entrepreneurship in places where it can do the most good and have the greatest impact, and we're going to work even harder to reach entrepreneurs who face the highest hurdles when it comes to accessing the essential tools of entrepreneurship &ndash; finance, support networks and mentors," President Obama told a room full of business leaders, many of whom had started their own companies.</p><p>"Encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship can help us to tackle some of the greatest challenges that we face around the world," he said. "At a time when the world is more interconnected than ever, we've got unprecedented opportunities to help more people access capital and resources and networks that they need to succeed," President Obama said. </p><p>The president insisted entrepreneurship can break down barriers between cultures and faiths, at a time when we need more than ever the capacity to understand and work across borders."</p><p>"Together, we can help make sure that anyone who's got the creativity and drive to work hard, no matter where they're from, what they look like, what their background is, they get a fair shot at pursuing their dreams," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
