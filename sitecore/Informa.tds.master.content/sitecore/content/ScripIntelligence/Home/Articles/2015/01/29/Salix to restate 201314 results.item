<p>In an update regarding the ongoing audit of its business, Salix has said it is restating financial statements for all of 2013 and the first three quarters of 2014. </p><p>Salix said in a 28 January release that the impact of errors on net product revenue and net income over all previously reported periods affected by the restatements is a decrease of approximately $20.7m and $11.9m, respectively. </p><p>Salix's current financial worries came to light in November 2014, when it lost $3bn from its market cap following the resignation of its then chief financial officer, Adam Derbyshire, and its admission that an audit of its inventory levels was ongoing (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Salix-sinks-as-audit-admission-hurts-MandA-potential-354915" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 November 2014</a>). Salix's CEO Carolyn Logan also stepped down from the company earlier this month. </p><p>The company also had problems in November 2014 with a pile-up of inventory for its key drugs. At the time Salix blamed the problem on the end of takeover talks with Allergan (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Investors-ask-Allergan-to-nix-Salix-negotiate-with-Valeant-354169" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 26 September 2014</a>). Salix markets products and medical devices for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, its lead products include Relistor (methylnaltrexone), Ruconest (recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor); and Apriso (mesalamine). The company was forced to cut its full-year forecast at the time because of this product pile-up; however it says the excess inventory will be cleared by the end of 2015.</p><p>The financial reporting errors picked up by an outside counsel reporting to the Audit Committee and BDO Consulting, are primarily related to the timing for recognition of certain revenue, revenue-reducing returns and discounts, and expense items, Salix said. They will be corrected in the company's restated financial statements. </p><p>Broken down the cumulative impact for correcting these errors over all previously reported periods affected by the restatement will decrease previously reported net product revenue and net income by approximately $20.7m and $11.9m, respectively. For the full year 2013, this would decrease previously reported net product revenue and net income by approximately $20.1m and $11.8m, respectively. For the nine months ended 30 September 2014, this would decrease previously reported net product revenue by $0.7m and result in no change in net loss.</p><p>Chair of the Salix board, Thomas W D'Alonzo said the conclusion of the accounting portion of the ongoing audit committee review was an important milestone. "While in total the restatements are minor in scale, the audit committee takes these matters very seriously and is in the process of promptly enhancing controls and procedures to ensure this never happens again."</p><p>Shares of Salix (traded on Nasdaq) were up 4.5%, reaching $134 per share, in the morning of 29 January, following the company's announcement the previous afternoon. </p><p>Salix had been a speculative M&A target for many months in 2014, but no firm offers came to fruition for the company after a deal was nixed by Allergan. However, in January this year it was reported the firm has been working with investment bank Centerview Partners to explore its options going forward, which still include a possible sale.</p><p>Raleigh, North Carolina-based Salix said it will file its 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K on or prior to 2 March and anticipates filing its restated financial statements prior to filing its 2014 Form 10-K. </p>
