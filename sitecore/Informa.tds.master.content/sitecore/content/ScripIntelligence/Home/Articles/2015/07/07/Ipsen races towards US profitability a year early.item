<p>A turnaround in Ipsen's US business is underpinning a transformation at the mid-sized French pharmaceutical company, which is planning to narrow its focus to niche therapeutic areas including gastrointestinal endocrine tumors and antispasticity neurotoxins. The company's CEO says it is now on track to reach US profitability one year earlier than forecast.</p><p><p><p>The approval of Somatuline (lanreotide) for a new indication &ndash; the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) &ndash; in the US at the end of 2014 is catalyzing the turnaround in Ipsen's business. It now expects to become profitable in the US in 2016, and to double its total sales in 2020 compared with 2010, according to Marc de Garidel, Ipsen's Chairman and CEO, speaking at a 2 July investor day held in Paris.</p><p><p>Like many of its peers in Europe, including companies like Spain's Almirall and Italy's Recordati, Ipsen has transformed and refocused its business over the past several years. Almirall, for example, sold its respiratory business to AstraZeneca and now <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Flush-with-AZ-cash-Almirall-seeks-dermatology-assets-353106" target="_new">focuses on dermatology</a>.</p><p><p>Similarly, Ipsen has reduced its reliance on France and its primary care business, where sales were declining, and is aiming over the next several years to strengthen specialty care and its activities in "niche" diseases where it has leading positions, particularly neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and the use of neurotoxins as therapeutic agents. More recently, the discontinuation of the licensed product tasquinimod in prostate cancer at the Phase II stage was expected to reduce projected R&D spending.</p><p><p>Back in 2011, it was Ipsen's poor performance in the US that the company's management knew it had to address. "We were strong in Europe, and we were doing a good job in emerging markets, but we were not strong enough in the US," Mr de Garidel recalls. "The US is the world's largest market and the most profitable and was an important weakness we needed to fix."</p><p><p>Since then, Ipsen has downsized in France, restructured its Dysport (abobotulinumtoxinA) US operations, closed an R&D facility in Spain and sold its interests in hemophilia.</p><p><p>But it is in the US that the most significant change has occurred. On 16 December the company obtained a unique first-line label for the use of Somatuline in NET from the FDA. Ipsen had already decided in 2014 to invest in a 100-strong US team to promote Somatuline for NET. The drug has had a "great launch" in the indication, Mr de Garidel noted, allowing him to forecast that profitability in the US would be achieved in 2016, "one year earlier than predicted."</p><p><p>In the first quarter of this year, Somatuline sales rose by 25% compared with the same quarter last year to &euro;89.3m ($99m), driven by the new NET indication in both the US and Europe.</p><p><p>Beyond Somatuline, "we expect to receive a new additional indication for our third best-selling product Dysport for adult spasticity in the second half of 2015," Mr de Garidel said. Ipsen is currently reinforcing its Dysport team to prepare for US launch, with the addition of 20 new employees. "We are continuously looking to strengthen our pipeline and looking for opportunities in the US," he said.</p><p><h2>a narrowed focus</h2><p>Ipsen split its business into two, specialty care and primary care, in 2013, and the former now accounts for around 75% of sales, noted deputy CEO Christel Bories.</p><p><p>In specialty care, the French company intends to focus its resources in the future on a small number of therapeutic areas where it can be a global leader, such as NET, spasticity and neurotoxins for esthetics, and is aiming to have a product for every stage of the treatment pathway.</p><p><p>In NET, for example, Ipsen entered into an agreement with Lexicon Pharmaceuticals in 2014 for ex-US rights for Xermelo (telotristat etiprate), a Phase III compound active in controlling the symptoms of NET. Phase III results for Xermelo are expected in the third quarter of 2015 and European launch in 2017, Ms Bories said.</p><p><p>Ipsen also has acquired a new NET Phase IIb/III imaging agent, SOMscan, and a preclinical somastatin receptor antagonist, SOMther, through its acquisition of Germany's OctreoPharm Sciences in May 2015. Ipsen is close to having products for all stages of the NET diagnosis and treatment pathway, Ms Bories said.</p><p><p>In the neurotoxin segment, Ipsen expects to launch Dysport in the US in the fourth quarter of 2015 for adult upper limb (AUL) spasticity, and expects to file for its use in pediatric lower limb (PLL) patients by the end of 2015, Bories reported. The company expects to be the first to market with the PLL indication, where it should gain "first mover" advantage, she added.</p><p><p>What is potentially the first liquid injectable neurotoxin formulation is being developed for Dysport, with the first marketing submission expected in Europe in the first half of 2016. Phase III studies of Dysport in the bladder disorder neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) and in sialorrhea also are underway.</p><p><h2>other oncology niches</h2><p><p>The second part of Ipsen's business strategy is to strengthen its business in related therapeutic areas, including in prostate and bladder cancer, GI oncology, orphan oncology and in adult endocrinology, Ms Bories explained. This it intends to do by entering into late-stage deals that will use the sales and marketing expertise gained with Ipsen's mature products like Decapeptyl (triptorelin) and the bladder cancer diagnostic agent Hexvix (hexaminolevulinate).</p><p><p>New formulations and indications also are being pursued for Decapeptyl, including a three-month subcutaneous injection for use in prostate cancer patients, and Phase III studies in female breast cancer patients in combination with exemestane or tamoxifen. "We are currently discussing how to pursue the registration of a Decapeptyl-containing combination for breast cancer," Ms Bories said.</p><p><h2>legacy primary care still important</h2><p><p>Sales of Ipsen's primary care products have been declining since 2005 in France and are now below &euro;100m annually. But the business is a "cash cow" for Ipsen, and following restructuring, it is profitable in France. "We are now establishing a new vision, to be the preferred partner in gastrointestinal products in new geographies, where products are prescribed by doctors but are classified as over the counter products, the so-called "OTx" category of products."</p><p><p>A core product in the OTx strategy will be the OTC antidiarrheal product Smecta (diosmectite). New formulations and tastes, including a strawberry-flavored product, have been developed, and through the use of new ingredient combinations, Smecta is being developed as an umbrella brand for use in related indications including abdominal pain, as an aid to digestion, and in the treatment of irritable bowel disorder.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" Daily</a>.</p>
