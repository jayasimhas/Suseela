<p> Shionogi's naldemedine (S-297995), an investigational peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, has met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving opioid therapy. </p><p> Study results showed naldemedine (0.2 mg tablet given once daily) significantly improved the frequency of spontaneous bowel movement compared with placebo over 12 weeks.  Shionogi said naldemedine was generally well-tolerated with the most commonly reported side effects being gastrointestinal disorders.  This is the first phase III data generated from the COMPOSE program; the program is comprised of seven clinical studies being conducted in patients with OIC with cancer or chronic non-cancer pain.   </p><p> Sagient Research's BioMedTracker has given naldemedine a likelihood of approval rating of 64%, 2% higher than average for a product at the same stage of development. </p><p> According to BioMedTracker there are currently three products for opioid-induced constipation in Phase III trials in the US as well as naldemedine. There are four products in Phase II, and a number which have been suspended or placed on a clinical trial hold. </p><p> Meanwhile, already available on the market for OIC are Sucampo Pharmacuetical's Amitiza (lubiprostone), Salix Pharmaceutical's Relistor SC (methylnaltrexone bromide), and Movantik (naloxegel), which is being developed by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo. On 19 March this year AstraZeneca announced a co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for Movantik in the US. Under this arrangement AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing of Movantik, will book all sales and will make sales-related commission payments to Daiichi Sankyo. </p>
