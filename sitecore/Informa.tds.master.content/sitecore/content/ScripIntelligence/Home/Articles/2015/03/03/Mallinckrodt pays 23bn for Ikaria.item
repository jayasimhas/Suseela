<p>In signing a deal to acquire neonatal critical care specialist Ikaria, Mallinckrodt is expecting to see immediate gains in both its top and bottom line for fiscal 2015. The $2.3bn deal brings it a nitric vasodilator and accompanying device for newborns with a respiratory failure, and North American rights to a candidate to treat a rare life-threatening condition, hepato-renal syndrome.</p><p>Founded in 2007, Ikaria commercializes INOmax, said to be the only US FDA-approved inhaled nitric oxide vasodilator for newborns suffering from hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF). INOmax is distributed in combination with Ikaria's INOmax DSIR delivery systems &ndash; also cleared by the US FDA and validated to work with 79 ventilators commonly used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) &ndash; and supported by INOmax Total Care program. Ikaria has an installed base across more than 650 hospitals throughout North America, including all major academic medical centers and large tertiary hospitals, and a strong reputation for highly attentive customer service. It also has an international presence, in markets including Europe, Japan, Latin America and Australia. </p><p>Private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners took a majority stake in Ikaria last year, in a transaction that valued the Illinois company at $1.6bn at that time. Now, with this new deal, Mallinckrodt has agreed to buy Ikaria for $2.3bn. </p><p>Mallinckrodt expects the acquisition to strengthen its footprint in hospitals by expanding its current base of diagnostic radiology and multimodal pain management in surgical specialties to include critical care respiratory therapies in neonatal intensive care units. The addition of Ikaria&rsquo;s portfolio also builds potential diversity in Mallinckrodt's nephrology rare disease pipeline; in 2008, Ikaria acquired the North American rights to terlipressin from Orphan Therapeutics. The drug is being investigated for the treatment of hepato-renal syndrome type 1 (HRS 1) &ndash; a rare life-threatening condition with no currently approved therapy in the US. Terlipressin is, however, approved for use and recognized as the standard-of-care treatment for HRS 1 in countries outside the US, including several in Europe.</p><p>By joining Mallinckrodt, Ikaria would be able to leverage its acquirer&rsquo;s larger hospital presence, regulatory expertise and experience in complex drug and device manufacturing. Mallinckrodt indicated that Ikaria&rsquo;s sales force and customer service team will "augment" its hospital platform working alongside the group&rsquo;s existing teams.</p><p>Assuming the transaction is completed in Mallinckrodt's third fiscal quarter (which ends 30 June 2015), the acquisition is expected to add at least $150m in net sales and at least $0.25 to its adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2015. Beyond that, it expects Ikaria to deliver around $400m in net sales annually, of which a significant amount will translate into operating income, Mallinckrodt said in a conference call to discuss the acquisition.</p><p>Commenting on the deal, Mallinckrodt president and CEO Mark Trudeau said buying Ikaria is in line with the company&rsquo;s strategy to seek "fast growing, highly profitable durable assets that fits squarely in the growth platforms that we've established &ndash; and this acquisition does that in spades." </p><p>"We also look for things that are complex and therefore tend to have low competitive intensity in high value parts of the market, and again the NICU is a perfect example of that," he added.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="http://www.clinica.co.uk/" target="_new">Clinica Medtech Intelligence</a>.</p><p>
