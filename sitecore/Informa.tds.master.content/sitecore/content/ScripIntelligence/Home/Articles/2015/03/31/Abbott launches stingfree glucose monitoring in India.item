<p>Abbott has introduced its revolutionary glucose assessment tool, which does away with the need for routine finger pricks for diabetics, on the Indian market.</p><p>And if early physician response in the country is anything to go by, Abbott's professional version of its Flash Glucose Monitoring System may also find use in managing a large Indian pre-diabetic population.</p><p>At a press briefing in Mumbai on 1 April, Dr Shashank Joshi, a leading endocrinologist and president of the Association of Physicians of India, referred to the potentially high acceptability of the device in India among patients and noted how current diabetes monitoring tools were limiting since they did not reveal "a complete picture" of the glucose fluctuations that a person goes through during a day. </p><p>Dr Joshi also told <i>Scrip</i> that he expects insulin-taking patients to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new Abbott device but referred to how he had put a group of pre-diabetics onto the product who "did not want to do tablets but just lifestyle [changes]."</p><p>"It could give me a good insight on how to handle this population," Dr Joshi said.</p><p>India has about 65 million diabetics, while 77.2 million Indians are seen as pre-diabetic (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance).</p><p>Dilip Rajan, head of Abbott's diabetes care unit in India, said that the Indian glucose monitoring market was in a nascent stage and estimated to be valued at about $100m. He also said that customer insights on the shortcomings associated with current monitoring tools guided the development of the Flash Glucose Monitoring System.</p><h2>Device</h2><p>Abbott's new device essentially comprises a round disposable sensor that is held in place with a self-adhesive pad and remains on the back of the patient's arm for up to 14 days, requiring no patient interaction with the sensor or finger-prick calibration. It records glucose levels every 15 minutes, capturing up to 1,340 glucose readings over 14 days, giving the physician data for a complete glucose profile of the patient.</p><p>India is the first country to get access to the professional Flash Glucose Monitoring System &ndash; the version managed by doctors &ndash; though the device is essentially the same as Abbott's FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System available in Europe. The only key difference between the two is that in the Indian scenario the Flash Glucose Monitoring reader, which scans the sensor and downloads the glucose results that are stored in the sensor, stays with the physician, unlike in Europe where the patient retains the reader. </p><p>The sensor has been priced at INR1,999 ($32) in India, with the cost of the reader that is priced at just under INR5,000 to be borne by the doctor. The product costs an estimated &euro;70 in Europe.</p><p>Dr Matthew Bates, R&D Director, Abbott Diabetes Care, told <i>Scrip</i> that the device was very "unobtrusive" on a person's lifestyle and that Abbott was providing a new software package which makes it easy for a doctor to interpret and highlight areas of concern.</p><p>"The product offers a lot of versatility to a doctor in terms of feasibility to understand a patient's glycemic profile," Dr Bates said. He has worked hard to deliver the Flash Glucose Monitoring system, spending three years at the Abbott Diabetes Care facility in California to initiate the project and more recently in the UK to transfer the design and initiate manufacture of the product. </p><p>Dr Bates, however, declined to comment on emerging ideas or innovation, when asked about potential competition from Apple, Google, and Samsung that are known to be are exploring sensors for wearable devices that could measure glucose levels.</p><p>"But we are certainly aware of the fact that they are beginning to look into this space We are just very happy that we are at the forefront &#8230; we are here, we're launching. We are happy to be out there and the first with this type of technology," he said.</p><p>He added that Abbott was "very happy" with the technology it has and "very pleased" with the feedback and what it had managed to achieve in terms of a very easy to use system which lasts for 14 days and gives a wealth of data for doctors to make decisions. Last year Novartis's Alcon unit signed a deal with Google to license the latter's "smart lens" technology, which could lead to innovations such as constant blood sugar monitoring via the eye, or adaptive focusing of contact lenses <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Google-and-Novartis-in-smart-lens-pact-352875%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 July 2014</a>). </p>
