<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals made a big financial commitment to expand its cystic fibrosis portfolio beyond drugs for patients with specific genetic mutations to gene-editing therapies that may cure CF via a new partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics that more than doubles the startup firm's cash balance.</p><p>Boston-based Vertex will pay $105m up front, including a $30m equity investment in CRISPR, to develop therapies based on clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) technology for various genetic diseases with an initial focus on cystic fibrosis (CF) as well as sickle cell disease. The deal is worth up to $2.65bn to CRISPR Therapeutics in upfront and milestone fees, not counting any research funding or royalty payments.</p><p>"I think companies like Vertex and so many others out there over the last 24 months have realized that CRISPR/Cas9 technology is game-changing and valuable to their R&D organizations," CRISPR CEO Rodger Novak said. </p><p>Discussions about the science of gene editing with Vertex chief scientific officer David Altshuler and connections that the CRISPR Therapeutics team had with Vertex executives, including CEO Jeffrey Leiden, led to the discovery that CRISPR/Cas9 technology could be used by the two companies working together in areas of mutual interest. CRISPR/Cas9 is being used to develop treatments that may cure genetic diseases by repairing, replacing or removing mutated genes.</p><p>Altshuler described CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies as "potentially transformative treatments for many genetic diseases" and said that the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics "puts us at the forefront of what we believe may be a fundamental change in the future treatment of disease &ndash; using gene editing technologies to address the underlying genetic causes of many diseases."</p><p><b>Big Investment In CF And Beyond</b></p><p>Novak told <i>Scrip</i> that CF was not an area that CRISPR Therapeutics was working in when the Vertex collaboration was negotiated, but the company already was developing CRISPR/Cas9 therapies for sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies. That means the partnership with Vertex will move CRISPR's research into new areas and it may accelerate programs that are under way.</p><p>The upfront cash from Vertex also will give CRISPR the resources to fully staff its own existing research and development priorities, and to add employees that can bring forward new wholly-owned R&D programs beyond the planned research expansion based on recently increased funding rounds. CRISPR announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CRISPR-Therapeutics-raises-64m-validating-uncertain-patent-position-358131" target="_new">new Series A and B venture capital</a> in April, bringing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CRISPR-Therapeutics-raises-64m-validating-uncertain-patent-position-358131" target="_new">the company's VC fundraising</a> total to $89m, so the Vertex deal increases the startup firm's cash balance by more than 100%.</p><p>The companies will evaluate a specific, undisclosed number of genetic targets for CF, sickle cell and other diseases under their four-year collaboration agreement. CRISPR will be responsible for discovery work with unspecified research funding from Vertex. </p><p>Vertex will have exclusive rights to license up to six CRISPR/Cas9 therapies and it will have full responsibility for development costs for each asset. CRISPR will earn development, regulatory and sales milestone fees of up to $420m plus royalties for each of the programs.</p><p>CRISPR has high throughput screening to identify therapies that target genes responsible for many diseases, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Vertex's two US FDA-approved drugs &ndash; Kalydeco (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-expanded-pediatric-use-of-CF-drug-Kalydeco-357372" target="_new">ivacaftor</a>) and Orkambi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orkambi-OKd-Vertex-prices-new-CF-drug-at-259k-359235" target="_new">lumacaftor</a>/ivacaftor) &ndash; target specific mutations of the CFTR gene and the company has at least four other drugs in or nearing clinical development that target CFTR mutations. </p><p>Two of those drug candidates are expected to begin Phase I testing in healthy volunteers in November, so that Vertex can test one of the assets in combination with Kalydeco and the Phase III drug VX-661 as a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/4Q-EARNINGS-ROUNDUP-Alexion-Vertex-and-Baxter-35644" target="_new">triple therapy regimen that treats about 90% of CF patients</a>.</p><p>Vertex will work with CRISPR to develop CRISPR/Cas9 therapies that edit CFTR and other genes that contribute to the disease, but the collaboration is the second partnership that Vertex has entered into this year to explore new treatment options for CF.</p><p>Vertex paid $80m up front in June and committed up to $1.09bn in milestone fees plus tiered royalties to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Next-step-for-Vertex-pair-with-Parion-358771" target="_new">Parion Sciences for worldwide development</a> and commercialization of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors to treat CF and other pulmonary diseases. Vertex plans to evaluate Parion's P-1037 in multiple mid-stage studies in various indications, including a Phase IIa clinical trial to test Orkambi plus P-1037 in CF.</p><p><b>CRISPR's Potential Projects</b></p><p>Beyond its CF and other discovery work for Vertex, CRISPR Therapeutics is looking forward to expanding its own portfolio of CRISPR/Cas9 programs. The company already planned to add employees at its R&D headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but its head count will increase further as it reinvests Vertex's upfront fee and equity capital.</p><p>CRISPR started 2015 with four people and the company now has about 30 employees. Its R&D personnel could increase to 40 to 50 people by the end of 2016, thanks to CRISPR's new venture capital, and the company could add another 20 employees to support the Vertex partnership in the same timeframe, depending on the amount of overlap in CRISPR's in-house R&D and the Vertex collaboration, Novak said. </p><p>Capital from the Vertex collaboration "allows us to expand the program portfolio and we can only do that by getting new and additional people on board," he said.</p><p>The CRISPR CEO also noted that the company could use some of its new venture and partner capital to buy drug delivery and manufacturing technologies necessary to bring gene-editing therapies to patients. </p><p>"We now have a little bit of a war chest to acquire assets of interest to our programs," Novak said.</p><p>While CRISPR/Cas9 is an area in which intellectual property is in question, with ongoing patent disputes to determine who owns the original IP and who must license the associated patients, CRISPR's CEO points out that if the company's patent stance was not strong then Vertex wouldn't have made such a big financial commitment to CRISPR Therapeutics nor would GlaxoSmithKline's venture capital arm SR One have invested VC money in the company.</p><p>Indeed, the CRISPR/Cas9 field has generated a lot of buzz with several significant VC investments and big money partnerships announced this year, including Intellia Therapeutics whose IP &ndash; like CRISPR's &ndash; was licensed from the University of California, Berkeley. </p><p>The university asked the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) earlier this year to determine who invented and owns the rights to CRISPR/Cas9 technology &ndash; UC Berkeley or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) and Harvard University's Broad Institute.</p><p>But CRISPR Therapeutics is far from the only company to raise money and execute partnerships despite the ongoing IP dispute. Intellia recently raised <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intellia-Raises-70m-To-Sharpen-CRISPR-Scissors-360210" target="_new">$70m in Series B venture capital</a> after unveiling a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-to-use-gene-editing-tool-with-CAR-T-therapies-355979" target="_new">partnership with</a>Novartis at the start of 2015. </p><p>Also, Editas Medicine, which licensed its technology from the Broad Institute and other groups, raised a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-deals-take-CRISPR-to-its-drug-discovery-heart-356437" target="_new">$120m Series B round</a> a few weeks before Intellia's Series B announcement. </p><p>Meanwhile, AstraZeneca unveiled <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Could-120m-Make-Editas-1st-in-Clinic-With-CRISPR-359904" target="_new">CRISPR research agreements</a> with four different partners in January, including the Broad Institute.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
