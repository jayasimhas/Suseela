<p>Companies interested in developing new antimicrobials may be pleased to hear that Members of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EUs-Horizon-2020-to-fund-innovative-drugdiagnostic-RandD-and-boost-life-sciences-industry-348306" target="_new">European Parliament</a> are pushing to ensure they get a fair return on their investments. The European Parliament has voted for a resolution calling for the price of new antimicrobials to be de-linked from the volume of sales.</p><p>The resolution calls on member states and the European Commission to begin a "reflection process" on developing a new economic model that would de-link the "reward" paid for new antibiotics from the volume of sales. This model would reflect the drug's value to society and allow the manufacturer "sufficient return on investment" while the buyer would acquire the right to use the product, with full control over volumes.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies have in the past been put off from developing antibiotics because they would be unlikely to be able to sell them in large enough quantities to make back the money that they want. Because prescriptions for any new antibiotics will be highly restricted to prevent the type of resistance that has now lead to a major public health concern, companies will be unable to sell them in large quantities. Therefore a new pricing model could remove a major disincentive, if acted upon.</p><p>The resolution on "Safer healthcare in Europe: improving patient safety and fighting antimicrobial resistance" requests action from member states and the commission to introduce new measures and legislation to tackle antimicrobial resistance. It is a political statement from the parliament about the type of action it would like to see. The commission has no remit to legislate on pharmaceutical pricing, which is the fiercely protected domain of individual member states. </p><p>The resolution also calls for: </p><ul><li>The commission to work with the World Health Organization, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nations-back-WHO-antimicrobial-resistance-global-action-plan-358603" target="_new">which has just adopted a plan to tackle antimicrobial resistance</a>; </li><li>Member states to ensure that, whenever possible, microbiological diagnosis is systematically performed before prescribing antibiotics, for example with new diagnostics that allow point-of-care rapid diagnosis; </li><li>Member states to regulate antibiotic prescriptions and introduce or enforce law to prohibit the provision of antibiotics without prescription; </li><li>Member states to implement responsible marketing practices to avoid conflicts of interest between producers and prescribers; </li><li>The commission and member states to accelerate R&D and strengthen incentives for public and private co-operation; </li><li>The commission and member states to use adaptive pathways and other regulatory tools to ensure earlier approval of and patient access to innovative antibacterials.</li></ul><p>It also acknowledges other EU work to tackle antimicrobial resistance, including the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EUs-Horizon-2020-to-fund-innovative-drugdiagnostic-RandD-and-boost-life-sciences-industry-348306" target="_new">Horizon 2020</a> research and innovation program, and the EU's Third Public Health Program.</p><p>
