<p> The pressure on pharmaceutical companies to justify the prices they charge for new drugs just seems to keep on growing. The Council of Europe, a human rights organization encompassing no less than 47 member countries, has said that greater transparency is needed on the actual R&amp;D costs that lie beneath &quot;exorbitant&quot; prices of some medicines, particularly those for cancer and hepatitis C. </p><p> According to the committee on social affairs, health and sustainable development of the Parliamentary Assembly of the CoE (PACE), European governments should oblige firms to ensure &quot;absolute transparency regarding the real costs of research and development&quot;, particularly in relation to the public research aspects of those costs. </p><p> As well as echoing ongoing pricing concerns in Europe, the PACE committee's call mirrors the rising chorus of criticism in the US, where payers are clamping down on high drug costs and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">made pricing a key issue</a> of his political platform. </p><p> But in a draft resolution due to be discussed at the assembly's autumn plenary session later this month, the PACE committee goes much further in a bid to flush out other industry practices that it claims go against the interests of public health. </p><p> It calls for stricter conflict of interest rules, a levy on promotional spending to fund doctor training programs, and a public fund to finance R&amp;D geared towards unmet health needs. It further proposes a &quot;need clause&quot; in marketing authorization procedures so that only drugs with clear added benefits are approved for marketing, and says alternatives are needed to the patent-based system for fostering innovation. </p><p> While most of the ideas in the resolution have been aired on numerous occasions in the past, they come together at a time when issues like high drug costs, conflicts of interest and unmet medical needs are high on the agenda both in Europe and at the global level. Whether or not that means the report will have any practical effects, it will certainly serve to fuel the growing debate on industry behaviors. </p><p> Responding to the resolution, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said it was &quot;perhaps not rounded enough&quot; and that it focused on a few negative aspects rather than the positive benefits that breakthrough medicines are able to offer, both in improving patients' quality of life and avoiding costs elsewhere in the healthcare system. </p><h2> Innovation And Pricing </h2><p> The resolution, which is due to be discussed at the assembly's autumn session on Sep. 28-Oct. 2, acknowledges the &quot;indisputable role&quot; of the industry in investing &quot;massively&quot; in R&amp;D for new medicines, and says it constitutes a very important sector of activity in many countries. Nonetheless, it claims that very few medicines placed on the market offer a real therapeutic benefit. </p><p> According to the rapporteur for the PACE Committee, Liliane Maury Pasquier, industry has &quot;placed onto the market a large number of second-generation medicines which are new variants of old molecules whose patent has expired, released in a slightly modified form ('me-too drugs').&quot; </p><p> At the same time, the resolution says, there has been an upsurge in new drug prices &quot;allegedly justified by the cost of research and development, which nonetheless remains opaque and broadly disputed.&quot; It cites in particular the &quot;exorbitant&quot; prices of cancer and hepatitis C treatments&quot;, claiming these jeopardize public health systems' ability to fulfil their role. </p><p> &quot;The main argument put forward by these companies to justify the high prices of their new medicines is the cost of R&amp;D, a very risky business, given that out of ten thousand or so molecules tested, only one will reach the stage of actually being placed on the market,&quot; according to Pasquier. </p><p> &quot;However, the cost of R&amp;D is somewhat controversial, not only because it is never revealed in detail and it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the figures given, but also because often it does not take into account public-sector funding and also includes opportunity costs, that is what the company could have hoped to obtain by investing elsewhere than in R&amp;D, for example on the stock market.&quot; </p><p> She says that these problems are partly the result of the current patent-based innovation model which &quot;produces the highest return on investment, but not necessarily the medicines that society needs the most.&quot; In addition it leads to high prices for certain new medicines, whereas there are few higher quality medicines in clinical terms. </p><p> &quot;In order to ensure the sustainability of health care systems and the accessibility of affordable and innovative medicines in the long term, I believe it will be essential to reform the current innovation model, despite the fact that a 2009 report published by the European Commission acknowledges the importance for the pharmaceutical sector of strong intellectual property protection,&quot; Pasquier declares. </p><h2> Industry Influence </h2><p> The resolution also flags up industry's relationships with, and influence over, health professionals and patient groups, noting that companies sponsor &quot;the great majority of symposia, congresses and seminars&quot;, and that the industry makes &quot;a considerable contribution&quot; to the funding of patient organizations, &quot;in return for which it enjoys certain advantages such as access to the groups' representatives. </p><p> Pasquier, who met with industry and patient bodies as well as the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency and the NGO Health Action International while preparing her report, says that while these interactions are not in themselves problematic, the question is whether, without an appropriate regulatory framework, they could have &quot;adverse effects with serious implications for public health. </p><p> &quot;In my view, one merely has to look at the example of the Mediator case in France to realise that the answer to this question is unfortunately a resounding 'yes'.&quot; The Mediator case, she said, highlighted the &quot;dangerous collusion between health authorities and pharmaceutical companies, in which the malfunctions were due, amongst other reasons, to the conflicts of interests of certain experts.&quot; </p><p> While efforts have been made to tackle conflicts of interest between the pharmaceutical industry and health sector stakeholders, which can lead to &quot;biased decisions&quot;, preventing and dealing with such conflicts is &quot;still today largely a matter of hit-and-miss.&quot; </p><p> The rapporteur notes that EFPIA has codes of good practice covering these interactions, and has embarked on a series of initiatives to &quot;enhance the transparency of the pharmaceutical industry. One of these initiatives will result in EFPIA member companies publishing, with effect from 2016, their financial relationships with health care professionals and organisations&quot; (this is EFPIA's &quot;Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations&quot;). </p><p> She also notes that the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) has a code of practice that is a &quot;good example of self-regulation&quot;, and that the EMA has implemented a new policy on managing conflicts of interest, which applies restrictions on its experts and staff depending on the nature of the interest and the activity concerned. </p><p> However, she says, it &quot;remains to be seen whether this wide range of instruments is truly effective in preventing and managing conflicts of interest. Self-regulation demonstrates the commitment of the industry to adopt a more ethical approach, which is undoubtedly laudable, but in my view it is inconceivable to be content merely with self-regulation in such a sensitive field as public health. Indeed, this is not binding and, therefore, not dissuasive,&quot; Pasquier says. </p><h2> Proposals </h2><p> The resolution puts forward a number of ways of addressing these issues that CoE member states should consider, including: </p><ul> <li> Obliging companies to ensure &quot;absolute transparency&quot; regarding the real costs of R&amp;D, particularly in relation to the public research portion. </li><li> Tightening up on marketing authorization procedures by introducing criteria such as added therapeutic value (in relation to existing treatments) or a &quot;need clause&quot; implying that a drug must be assessed in relation to medical need. </li><li> Imposing a mandatory levy on the promotional activities of the pharmaceutical industry to finance a public fund to be used for the independent training of health care professionals, partly to raise their awareness of the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. </li><li> Obliging pharma firms to declare all links with health sector players and to make these accessible to the public. </li><li> Introducing regulations governing the movement of people from positions in the public sector to the private sector (and vice versa). </li><li> Increasing public funding of patients' associations to reduce reliance on industry financing. </li><li> Setting up a fund to encourage public R&amp;D for unmet needs, financed by the levy on promotion as well as &quot;fines imposed on pharmaceutical companies for illegal practices, which, moreover, should be much harsher than they currently are.&quot; </li><li> Ensuring that medicines whose effectiveness has been established remain on the market by having recourse, where necessary, to mandatory licences in return for the payment of royalties. </li><li> Prohibiting any agreement between pharmaceutical companies which aims to delay, with no medical justification, the marketing of generic medicines. </li> </ul><p> The resolution also calls on the WHO to put forward alternatives to the current patent-based pharmaceutical innovation model. </p><h2> EFPIA On The Proposals </h2><p> Commenting on the committee's proposals regarding promotion, EFPIA noted that it has already adopted three codes covering relationships with health professionals and patient organizations, and the disclosure of transfers of value. &quot;These Codes, in particular the last one, reflect a clear commitment on the part of industry leaders (CEOs) to work towards greater transparency, accountability and ethical behaviour within an industry framework of self-regulation,&quot; the federation said. </p><p> As for drug development and pricing, EFPIA told Scrip that the &quot;criticism about me-toos does not fit with the argument about high prices.&quot; It said &quot;there was a time&quot; when industry was accused of &quot;evergreening&quot; (for example as part of the European Commission's sector inquiry) and developing only &quot;me-too&quot; products with limited added value. </p><p> &quot;The Council of Europe report has seemed to maintain this 'me-too' or 'evergreening' line, whilst we would consider that the situation has dramatically evolved. We would consider that today the situation is different: people know pipelines are better than ever; and companies are delivering on the science,&quot; EFPIA declared. </p><p> It illustrated industry's embrace of innovation by citing the launch of new anticoagulants, new classes in diabetes, targeted cancer drugs, a series of new products for multiple sclerosis, cures for hepatitis C, and a range of medicines for rare diseases. &quot;Moreover, soon we will welcome the next generation of cancer drugs, mobilising the body's own immune system.&quot; </p><p> It conceded that the wave of innovation brought new challenges, such as how to pay for ground-breaking medicines and provide access to all those who need them. &quot;We must also continue to learn &ndash; to gather evidence over the lifecycle of the product, re-adjusting use to gain maximum effectiveness and value, while avoiding side effects (the big data concept).&quot; </p><p> The current debate on the price of the hepatitis C drugs, particularly Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), &quot;loses sight of the value of innovation,&quot; EFPIA declared. &quot;The cost may look high up front, but when you look at the alternative costs to society over time, including liver transplants, it is still a good deal.&quot; </p>
