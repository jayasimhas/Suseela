<p>Amgen's decision to dump co-development and commercialization plans of the interleukin-17 inhibitor brodalumab with AstraZeneca appears to have significantly buoyed the outlook for Sun Pharma's late-stage asset for chronic plaque psoriasis, tildrakizumab.</p><p>Sun's founder and managing director, Dilip Shanghvi, noted that brodalumab, which had reported significant clinical superiority over Johnson & Johnson's Stelara (ustekinumab) had seen "significant side-effects" because of which Amgen had decided not to continue to develop the product. </p><p>"People are looking at whether this is a class effect of IL-17 or it was specific to the Amgen product. And we believe that this significantly enhances the value of MK-3222 (tildrakizumab). We have an aggressive clinical development plan for the product," Mr Shanghvi said in response to an analyst's query in a post results investor call on 29 May. </p><p>Sun's boss said that in view of the "potential risk" to IL-17 or "a likely constraint" in its ability to get "significant" market, the company also expects to look at how rapidly and which other indications it can develop the product for.</p><p>"But I see that we are likely to achieve much more than we originally anticipated when we licensed the product."</p><p>Last year Sun <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sun-acquires-rights-to-late-stage-Merck-psoriasis-asset-354002%5d" target="_new">acquired worldwide rights</a> to tildrakizumab, Merck & Co's late-stage asset for chronic plaque psoriasis. Tildrakizumab (MK-3222), an anti-IL-23p19 monoclonal antibody, is being evaluated in Phase III trials. Top-line data are expected later this year. </p><p>Amgen and AstraZeneca's investigational product brodalumab had previously <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenAZs-brodalumab-AMAGINEs-bright-future-in-psoriasis-355010%5d" target="_new">trounced Stelara</a> in a head-to-head Phase III trial in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. More recently, Boehringer Ingelheim's novel entrant to the anti-inflammatory pipeline, BI-655066, had shown <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/BI-enters-psoriasis-fray-by-knocking-out-Stelara-357415%5d" target="_new">impressive Phase II results</a> against Stelara in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. </p><p>AstraZeneca andAmgen were expected to submit brodalumab for FDA approval this year after success in a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Amgen-AstraZeneca-plan-2015-brodalumab-filings-on-third-Phase-III-success-355267%5d" target="_new">third Phase III clinical trial</a>. Sagient's BioMedTracker had then placed the likelihood of approval at 72% at the time the results were announced. </p><p>However, on 22 May this year, Amgen said that it was <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-dumps-brodalumab-AstraZeneca-losing-a-blockbuster-358573%5d" target="_new">pulling out</a> of the development and commercialization of brodalumab based on events of suicidal ideation and behaviour in the program, which it believes likely would necessitate "restrictive labelling". Significantly, AstraZeneca had last year, when fending off an acquisition attempt by Pfizer, noted that brodalumab had the potential to be a blockbuster product.</p><p>
