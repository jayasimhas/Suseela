<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales, has published final guidance approving the use of Takeda Pharmaceutical's ulcerative colitis treatment, Entyvio (vedolizumab), on the National Health Service. </p><p>Takeda has been warring with NICE over the product's full reimbursement in the UK, without patient population restrictions, for some months but finally gained approval after agreeing a price discount for the product under a patient access scheme. </p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Takedas-Entyvio-gains-lukewarm-NICE-yes-355307" target="_new">previous NICE guidance</a>, Entyvio's use was restricted to patients who were na&iuml;ve to TNF-alpha inhibitors and those who have previously failed on TNF-alpha inhibitors. It is now recommended for use on the NHS in all adult patients. </p><p>The NHS list price of Entyvio &ndash; a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting &#945;<subscript>4</subscript>&#946;<subscript>7</subscript> integrin, which is expressed in certain white blood cells that are found in the gut &ndash; is &pound;2050 per 300mg vial. The company has agreed a patient access scheme with the Department of Health, but the level of discount was not revealed. </p><p>Takeda presented data from the GEMINI I study in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis whose disease had an inadequate response or lost response to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids or TNFalpha inhibitors, or who were intolerant to them.</p><p>In December 2014, NICE refused to recommend Entyvio for use in Crohn's disease and it is also wrangling for a patient access scheme in this indication. A delayed second appraisal committee meeting for the product for this use was held on 28 May &ndash; information from this meeting has not yet been published. </p>
