<p>A new three-drug tuberculosis (TB) regimen eliminated more bacteria from sputum than standard therapy and did so at a faster rate, according to Phase IIb data published in <i>The Lancet</i>. PaMZ is comprised of two drugs that are not yet licensed for use against TB: pretomanid (formerly known as PA-824 and developed by TB Alliance) and the antibiotic moxifloxacin (developed by Bayer). The third component is another antibiotic, pyrazinamide, which is approved to treat TB. The therapy is intended for those patients whose TB infections are sensitive to the three drugs, including people with drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The PaMZ regimen appeared to be effective independent of HIV status. On the basis of these and other data, TB Alliance and its partners have launched a global Phase III trial named STAND (Shortening Treatment by Advancing Novel Drugs) in patients who are currently considered to have either drug-sensitive or MDR-TB. If successful, the PaMZ regimen could eliminate the need for injectable drugs and reduce the cost of MDR-TB therapy by more than 90% in those patients whose TB is sensitive to the three drugs.</p>
