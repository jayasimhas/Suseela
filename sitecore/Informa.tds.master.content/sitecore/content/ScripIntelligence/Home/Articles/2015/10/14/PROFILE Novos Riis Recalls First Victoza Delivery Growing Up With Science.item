<p><b>Jakob Riis is a Danish national who joined diabetes R&D giant </b>Novo Nordisk <b>in 1996 as a health economist. He has since risen through the company, via a series of marketing roles of increasing seniority, to take on his current position of executive vice-president of China, Pacific and marketing. </b></p><p><b>In the latest instalment in <i>Scrip</i>'s executive profile series, he talks to Lucie Ellis about the feeling of getting a blockbuster diabetes drug to market; getting his hands on a chainsaw as often as possible; and the challenges and benefits of digital connectivity. </b></p><p><p><p><b>Lucie Ellis: You have risen to a leadership position in your field. What aspect of your personality has helped you get there?</b></p><p><b>Jakob Riis:</b> Being at Novo Nordisk, a complex business environment, I have honed the ability to make quick yet consistent decisions with a view for the long term. </p><p><b>LE: What led you into the industry?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> My first position in this area was as a health economist around 20 years ago. This was at a time when the environment was expected to go through a lot of change and we needed to prepare how to manage products in this evolving payer space. </p><p><b>LE: What are the key things that shaped you when growing up?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> My upbringing instilled in me the idea that with talent comes the obligation to use your skills to help others. My father was a doctor with a focus on scientific ethics and my mother a school teacher, so I grew up in a home with these three things being prominent: science, ethics and education. </p><p><b>LE: What are your own long term aspirations?</b></p><p><b>JK:</b> I don't care where I end my career as long as when I retire diabetes is in a much better place as a global health challenge. It is currently a huge global health problem and it is going to take the efforts of a lot of groups &ndash; policy makers, regulators, payers, pharma, health care professionals and patients &ndash; working together to improve the situation. </p><p><b>LE: If you were starting over what's the best bit of advice you would want to give to your younger self?</b></p><p><b>JR: </b>I would say, speak less and listen more. But also I would have said to take myself more seriously earlier on &ndash; it is okay to have high ambition and I didn't recognize this as much in the beginning. However, I wouldn't want to mess with who I am and how I got to be here: I have seen too many "Back to the Future" type films!</p><p><b>LE: Who do you admire in the industry?</b></p><p><b>JR: </b>Kelly Close, [president and founder of Close Concerns, a diabetes educational and advocacy group].She is very passionate in the way she acts as a diabetes activist. She is very pro-innovation, and she works in a very impactful way that reminds us that we need to work harder still to improve the lives of patients with diabetes. </p><p><b>LE: Tell us something surprising about you.</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> If I could be allowed to chop down trees with a chainsaw more often I would be very happy. I don't get out doing it very often, but when there is work with a chainsaw to be done it doesn't get much better than that. </p><p><b>LE: If you weren't a pharma executive, what would you be?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> I am very happy in the pharmaceutical industry but I could picture myself in a completely different life as a forester. </p><p><b>LE: What has your proudest moment been?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> The launch of our product <i>Victoza</i> (liraglutide) is my proudest professional moment. The first day, along with developer of the product Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, that we got it in the hands of the very first patients in the US is one I will always remember. I was on the very plane delivering the product to the US wholesalers, with 48 pallets of Victoza in the cargo room. </p><p><i>[Victoza is approved for use in diabetes. In 2014, worldwide sales of the drug reached $2.5bn.]</i></p><p><b>LE: And what about your most difficult moment?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> The best moments in this business are always when the FDA approves one of our new products we have been working on for over a decade. And hence, the worst moments are when the FDA disagrees with us and cannot approve and we face an unexpected setback. </p><p><b>LE: Tell us about one change you effected in your organization that you believe was invaluable.</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> The launch of Victoza reorganized our approach to launching all new products. It was the example for others to follow. This is probably the biggest direct influence I have had in my role. </p><p><b>LE: What was your favorite subject at school?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> My favorite subject was physics &ndash; more the math side of things though. I like taking a complex problem and structuring it in a way that a solution can be found. </p><p><b>LE: What current trend in your field would you highlight as the most exciting and why?</b></p><p>We are seeing a lot of change in dialog with payers, and even though it challenges us, I fundamentally welcome this dialog on value. It challenges us to be better at arguing the real value we bring to a disease space. With this value at the fore, we will be rewarded for the most meaningful innovations getting to patients. This trend brings with it shorter term challenges, but it will have benefits for us in the long term and will bring our industry into a more sustainable partnership with prescribers and payers. </p><p><b>LE: What big changes do you anticipate might affect your area of business in the next 5-10 years?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> The increase in connectivity and the ongoing digital transformation of the industry is what I expect will challenge us in the near future. Connectivity will lead to better disease management and these developments are very exciting. Digital innovation will change how we all operate industry-wide. Connectivity will allow us to document how our products are performing in the real world. This information could be used to shift some products to more conditional agreements on pricing. We will also be able to display more easily and in greater depth what our products actually do for patients. We will have the ability to enhance our medicines so they can be used in the most effective ways and we will add value to our products. Patients will be able to access better tools for education, guiding them in a more personalized setting. </p><p><b>LE: What was the last thing you changed your mind about in a business decision?</b></p><p><b>JR:</b> 12 months ago there was a project I could not see a future for but developments in terms of digital innovation have meant there could now be a way to move this program forward. Changes in the environment affect the decisions we make all the time. </p><p><b>LE: What do you do in your spare time? </b></p><p><b>JR:</b> If I have a chance to play a game of soccer, or I suppose we can call it football between us, with my old team, that is my favorite. I play one match and then spend the next two to three weeks recovering from it nowadays, though. </p><p>
