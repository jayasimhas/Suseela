<p>The European Commission has confirmed that talks on one of the most controversial parts of the proposed EU-US TTIP trade treaty &ndash; the Investor-State Dispute Settlement system &ndash; have been temporarily halted after an online consultation produced what the trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström called "huge scepticism against the ISDS instrument".</p><p>The commission says it will discuss the way forward on the ISDS with the European Parliament, EU member states and other stakeholders, including NGOs, business, trade unions, consumer and environment organisations, after which it will develop specific proposals for continuing talks.</p><p>The negotiations on investment in the TTIP "will only resume once the commission has come to the assessment that its new proposals guarantee among other things that the jurisdiction of courts in the EU member states will not be limited by special regimes for investor-to-state-disputes", the commission said.</p><p>The TTIP, which has been under negotiation since February 2013, is expected to boost overall EU exports by some 6% and those of the US by 8%. The commission estimates the potential economic gains at &euro;95bn (US$131bn) and &euro;120bn ($165bn) respectively. </p><p>As well as reducing trade barriers, the TTIP is intended to address differences in regulatory practices and requirements in a range of areas, including pharmaceutical regulation. Negotiating documents recently released by the commission show that alignment is being sought on issues like GMP inspections, further harmonization of technical requirements in areas like biosimilars and paediatrics, and strengthening collaboration in scientific advice and quality by design applications (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EU-reveals-proposals-on-pharma-in-TTIP-talks-356024" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 8 January). </p><p>The pharmaceutical industry says the treaty is also an opportunity to harmonize intellectual property protections upwards, strengthen patent enforcement protections, and ensure transparent and predictable pricing and reimbursement processes. </p><p>Health campaigners by contrast say that while some degree of regulatory harmonization would benefit patients, there is a risk that any extensions to patent protection could delay access to cheaper medicines, and that efforts to reach an agreed transatlantic definition of "commercial confidentiality" might hinder EU efforts to promote the disclosure of clinical trial data. </p><p>But it is the ISDS that has caused most consternation among those who are sceptical of the TTIP in general. An ISDS mechanism gives foreign investors the right to bring a damages claim against a host government in an international tribunal for an alleged breach of investment protection commitments agreed in a treaty agreed by the host state and the investor's home state. Such commitments include not discriminating against foreign investors and protecting investments from expropriation. </p><p>Supporters say that ISDS protects businesses and individuals who have made investments overseas from discriminatory or unfair treatment by governments, and that it cannot force governments to open markets or privatize public services.</p><p>Opponents say that by allowing companies to sue governments for any loss of earnings seen to be due to national laws and regulations, the ISDS as proposed in the TTIP could jeopardize the right of governments to regulate in the public interest, for example where they want to introduce legislation on curbing healthcare costs that might affect a US firm with interests in the health service. </p><p>Last year, a group of NGOs said that US pharmaceutical companies could use ISDS "to sue any EU member state, arguing that the government&rsquo;s measures to promote access to medicines (such as price controls, reimbursement decisions, marketing approvals and pharmacovigilance decisions, or stricter patentability standards) will damage their investments protected by IP rights in the EU". Others say that the legal systems in the US and the UK are already quite capable of handling investor-state disputes without the need to resort to private tribunals.</p><h2>Public consultation</h2><p>As a result of these concerns, the commission organised a public consultation between 27 March and 13 July 2014. The consultation sought feedback on whether the proposed EU approach would achieve the right balance between protecting investors and safeguarding the EU&rsquo;s and member states' right and ability to regulate in the public interest, and on issues such as transparency and an appeals body. </p><p>The consultation yielded almost 150,000 replies, of which the vast majority (97%) were critical of the ISDS, although the commission notes that most were "submitted through various on-line platforms of interest groups, containing pre-defined, negative answers". But it also received replies from more than 3,000 individual citizens and some 450 organizations representing "a wide spectrum of EU civil society". </p><p>In a report on the consultation, published on 13 January, the commission said that many respondents "recognize the EU's efforts to improve the investment protection system, but consider for various reasons that the approach is insufficient. A significant number of trade unions and a large group of NGOs stress the need to strengthen the right to regulate in the public interest."</p><p>Despite overall business support for "a more inclusive and coherent ISDS system, characterised by transparency and ethics, there are concerns that the EU&rsquo;s approach could decrease the level of protection for investors as compared to existing investment agreements and that this could make the EU less attractive to foreign investment", it added.</p><p>The commission now plans to organize further meetings on the ISDS with EU governments, the European Parliament and other stakeholders &ndash; the first step will be to present the results of the consultation to the parliament's trade committee on 22 January. "Following these consultations during the first quarter, the commission will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations," it said.</p><p>Just what the outcome of these further talks will be remains to be seen. The most desirable outcome, at least from the commission's point of view, would be some modifications to the ISDS to meet critics' concerns. There have been calls for it to be kicked out of the treaty altogether, although this would require a change to the TTIP negotiating mandate.</p>
