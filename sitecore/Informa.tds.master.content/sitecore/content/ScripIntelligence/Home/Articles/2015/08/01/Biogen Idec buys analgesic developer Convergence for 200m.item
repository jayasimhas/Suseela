<p>Biogen Idec has agreed to pay $200m up front and up to $475m in milestones to acquire the UK developer of drugs for neuropathic pain Convergence Pharmaceuticals. The target company's most promising pipeline drug is CNV1014802, which has yielded positive Phase II results for trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), an orphan condition characterized by excruciating face pain.</p><p>Convergence was spun out of GlaxoSmithKline in 2010 after the UK pharma giant announced it would stop researching depression and pain. Its assets focus on ion channel modulation to treat chronic pain. Biogen confirmed that Convergence would stay based in Cambridge, UK, under the leadership of its Chief Scientific Officer Dr Simon Tate, former vice-president of the pain and epilepsy discovery performance unit in GSK's neurosciences drug discovery centre. CEO Clive Dix, a veteran entrepreneur in the UK biopharma world who sold his vaccine technology PowderMed to Pfizer for over $300m in 2006, will depart.</p><p>"Neuropathic pain is an area of significant unmet need and represents a natural complement to our current neurology portfolio," said Dr Douglas Williams, executive vice president of R&D at Biogen Idec. </p><p>Biogen Idec derives the bulk of its revenues from its multiple sclerosis portfolio, led by its new blockbuster Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), and older treatments Tysabri (natalizumab) and Avonex (interferon beta-1a). It is also building a franchise in hemophilia with partner Swedish Oprhan Biovitrum (Sobi), and collaborates with Roche's Genentech business to sell anticancer products Rituxan (rituximab) and Gazyva (obinutuzumab).</p><p>In R&D, meanwhile, Biogen has a broader interest in neurology, and is developing a novel therapeutic protein, neublastin (a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor licensed from NsGene), in Phase II for the treatment of neuropathic pain. The Phase II SPRINT trial of neublastin in patients with painful lumbar radiculopathy, or sciatica (a condition for which Convergence's candidate is also being considered), is expected to be completed in early 2015, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database.</p><p>A Biogen Idec spokesperson told <i>Scrip </i>that planning for Phase III registrational studies of Convergence's compound had just begun. They noted that Biogen and Convergence's lead products have different mechanisms of action and target different patient populations. Neublastin signals through GFRalpha3 receptors that are highly expressed in pain sensing neurons, and a potent survival factor for sensory neurons.</p><p>"Convergence's approach to understanding disease is based on emerging genetics and a deep understanding of the pharmacology of various ion channels thought to be important modulators of pain," the spokesperson said. "Their candidates have the potential to provide significant advancements in pain management due to their state dependent mechanisms of action, which provide a greater level of block when it is needed, while reducing interference of normal physiological function. The ion channels targeted by this novel approach are understood to reside at convergent points in pain signaling."</p><p>Pain is a difficult area of drug R&D because although there is significant unmet need in terms of both efficacy and side-effect profile, and demographic trends indicate a growing need for effective pain treatments, existing drugs, including opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are well established and highly genericized. At present patients with TGN are generally prescribed the sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, but these can have significant side-effects such as heavy sedation, dizziness and rash.</p><p>CNV1014802 is a novel Nav1.7 selective, state dependent sodium channel blocker that has been shown to be well tolerated in clinical trials, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo, and that has achieved proof of concept in trigeminal neuralgia. In a recent Phase II trial it showed consistent reduction of pain severity and a reduction in the number of paroxysms compared with placebo. Convergence says it is thought to penetrate the central nervous system and block Nav ion channels in a novel manner, resulting in an improved therapeutic profile over currently available agents.</p><p>Convergence has raised $35.4m since its founding in 2010, so the exit was a successful one for its three venture capital investors, Apposite Capital, New Leaf Venture Partners and SV Life Sciences, which held similar stakes in the business under similar terms. GlaxoSmithKline had also retained a small stake.</p><p>
