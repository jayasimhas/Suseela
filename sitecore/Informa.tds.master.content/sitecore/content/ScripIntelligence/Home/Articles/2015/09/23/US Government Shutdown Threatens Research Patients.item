<p>With the clock ticking on the end of the current fiscal year and only three legislative days left on Congress' calendar, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), ranking member on the House Budget Committee, on Sept. 22 tried to put a human face on the toll another shutdown of U.S. federal agencies would take if lawmakers let an ideological dispute stand in the way of funding the government.</p><p>"I can't stand here right now and say with confidence that there won't be a government shutdown, despite all of our efforts to avoid a government shutdown," Van Hollen told reporters during a press conference on the NIH campus.</p><p>Closing federal agencies like the NIH would harm biomedical research and the patients who depend on the treatments that work provides, Collins and Van Hollen argued.</p><p>And, they said, patients who receive care at the NIH's Clinical Center &ndash; considered America's premier research hospital &ndash; may also have their treatment put on hold if the government is forced to close up shop.</p><p>The last time the U.S. government shut down in October 2013 &ndash; which lasted 16 days &ndash; "hundreds of patients" were turned away from the Clinical Center and from participating in studies testing new medicines, Van Hollen said, which he contended caused "real-world harm."</p><p>According to a White House report, seven clinical protocols that were scheduled to begin during the period of the 2013 shutdown were delayed.</p><p>"This is not just an argument about hypotheticals. Real lives are affected &ndash; lives of children who are already in difficult straits, coming to this house of hope, counting on some potential out of very challenging situations, and we have to turn them away," Collins declared. </p><p>The NIH chief said he had to in fact personally tell most of the patients who were scheduled for admission to the Clinical Center during those weeks that they could not come, unless it was a life-threatening situation &ndash; "which was a hard thing for people to hear and for many of us to have to say."</p><p>"We really seriously hope that cannot happen again," he said.</p><p>For the biopharmaceutical industry, a shutdown means the basic research drug makers depend on would be slower in coming to those firms. For biotechs and smaller firms, it could mean NIH grants and contract awards may be delayed.</p><p>According to the Government Accountability Office, the NIH had to reschedule the review process for over 13,700 grant applications because of the shutdown.</p><p>When the government closed its doors two years ago, Collins said he had to send home 80% of his employees &ndash; or more than 15,700 workers &ndash; including scientists doing critical research at the agency's laboratories and clinicians and staff at the NIH Clinical Center.</p><p>Walking around a nearly empty NIH campus in October 2013, he said, "was about the most depressing thing I've been through" during his more than 20 years at the agency.</p><p>"I don't want to have to do that again," Collins said.</p><p>Unfortunately, Collins said, while the public has a high regard for their own personal health, they don't quite make the connection between that and the work the NIH does on a daily basis.</p><p>So the reality of the harm caused by government shutdown often is readily lost &ndash; particularly in the midst of the heated political debates on Capitol Hill, he lamented.</p><p>Standard & Poor's estimated the 2013 shutdown <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Research-blunted-economy-damaged-And-for-what-347447" target="_new">wiped out $24bn</a> from the U.S. economy that year.</p><p>"It was unquestionably, a total waste of money," Collins said, adding that those billions of dollars were simply "thrown out the window."</p><p>He noted that it took "thousands of person hours" to re-launch biomedical research that had been halted during the shutdown.</p><p>Collins said another government shutdown may also be the breaking point that drives some NIH scientists to the private sector or to seek employment in another field. "If people have suffered significant damage to their own work as a result of this, and many people did, that leaves a mark," he said.</p><p>With the last shutdown viewed "so universally negatively" and "seemed so totally pointless," Collins said it's hard to imagine lawmakers would let it happen again.</p><p>"Yet, here we are," he said.</p><p>While Collins said the NIH leadership is remaining "optimistic" the agency won't have to implement the lessons it learned from the last shutdown come Oct. 1, "we would not be good stewards of the public trust or good managers to hide our heads in the sand and pretend this could not happen."</p><p>So he said there has been some behind the scenes planning if the inevitable happens.</p><p>But, Collins said, "We haven't activated any particularly steps because we still hope fervently that we won't have to."</p><p>"We've got to avoid another shameful and harmful government shutdown," Van Hollen declared.</p><p>He said he's urged his colleagues to come together on a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government's doors open while lawmakers can negotiate the fiscal year 2016 budget &ndash; something Van Hollen insisted should have spent the past couple of months doing.</p><p>The roadblock has been a controversy over whether to keep funding the reproductive and family planning services organization Planned Parenthood, which has been accused of trying to profit from making fetal tissue available for research &ndash; a charge the group has adamantly denied.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Sept. 22 said he plans to hold a vote on Sept. 24 on a measure that would keep the government open until Dec. 11, but would defund Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Democrats, however, are threatening to block the measure. </p><p>If that's the case, some have predicted McConnell may go ahead with a stopgap measure to keep the government open and abandon the measure to defund Planned Parenthood, although House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) would then have to get it passed through his chamber, all within the next few days &ndash; something Capitol Hill watchers said may take a miracle to happen.</p><p>Good thing the Pope's in town.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
