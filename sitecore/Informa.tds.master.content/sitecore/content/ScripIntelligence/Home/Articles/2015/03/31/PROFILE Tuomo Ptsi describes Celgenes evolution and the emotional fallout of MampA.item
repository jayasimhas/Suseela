<p> <preform><p> Tuomo Pätsi, current president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region at Celgene International S&agrave;rl, believes the business unit is on a steady path of &quot;humble&quot; growth within the pharma industry. </p><p><h4><img alt="" refid="249466" version="c" src="-/media/2EA25C6CBDA84C378ADF75403B3BC578.ashx"></h4></p><p><i>Tuomo Pätsi</i></p><p> In 2014 Celgene tied with Roche for the highest number of drug approvals in the EU. In the past four months the company has received approval in Europe for Abraxane (paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles, or nab-paclitaxel) in combination with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer; Revlimid (lenalidomide) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant; and for selective PDE4 inhibitor Otezla (apremilast) as a treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. </p><p> Prior to his current position Mr Pätsi, who is based at Celgene's Boudry site in Switzerland, was corporate vice-president for the South Europe region. He was also previously a European vice-president at Benlysta (belimumab; for treatment of lupus) developer Human Genome Sciences. </p><p> In this latest edition of our executive profile series he talks to <i>Scrip</i> about growing up with a strong work ethic, the importance of flexibility and how it can be hard to let go when your company is acquired. </p><p><b>Scrip: What aspects of you personality have got you to where you are today?</b></p><p><b>Tuomo Pätsi:</b> There are many aspects but I suppose the main ones are being a hard worker &ndash; I have worked to build a solid background knowledge in my field and continued to move up from there &ndash; and then being able to focus. There are so many things that I want to do, but I know how to focus on certain things and do them well rather than spreading myself too thinly. Teamed with this focus is the ability to prioritize what's important. Strong prioritization is a key element. </p><p><b>Scrip: What are the key things that shaped you when growing up?</b></p><p><b>TP: </b>My parents owned their own small business, so that definitely sent a message. When you run a small business it is dependent on your efforts and capabilities, and I saw that. It also gave me the opportunity very early on to be engaged in business activities. I worked there from a very young &ndash; what nowadays might be considered child labor (I kid) &ndash; but growing up I always had something to do. </p><p><b>Scrip: Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b></p><p><b>TP:</b> My father influenced me a lot &ndash; don't tell my mother that. But both my parents as business owners influenced my thoughts on success and how you achieve it. </p><p> Within the industry there isn't one specific person, but I think it's important to recognize that you can absorb information from both good and bad leaders. Good leaders might help you develop but bad leaders provide you opportunities to see problems and learn from them. </p><p><b>Scrip: What are your long term aspirations?</b></p><p><b>TP: </b>I am very pleased with where I am now and I enjoy what I do. Also I know my work serves a good purpose. I wouldn't want to be a guy promoting chewing gum or other things; I have to have a meaning. When you put so much effort in to your work you have to know it ultimately affects a person &ndash; and I get that at Celgene. </p><p><b>Scrip: If you were starting over what's the best bit of advice you would want to give to your younger self?</b></p><p><b>TP:</b> Interestingly my son has chosen the same educational path as I did. I never advised him to do that because obviously he would have elected to do the opposite. But I never advised him against it and I am very pleased he has chosen to study pharmacy. </p><p> I don't regret my decisions but I thought I would become a scientist, a pharmacologist, and it didn't work out exactly as I hoped it would. I did become a scientist but I realized it wasn't for me. So the advice I would give is that you cannot predict your career when you are a teenager. The key is to stay flexible, to be open to opportunities when they arise. Some call it luck how people progress, but I think it's more about how you react in the face of new opportunity. </p><p><b>Scrip: What has your proudest moment been?</b></p><p><b>TP: </b>I am very proud of what we have achieved this year at Celgene. I think under &quot;biggest achievement&quot; I would put the success of this company. We have achieved success in a very humble way in Switzerland. We started on simple premises here in Neuch&acirc;tel and we have grown. </p><p><b>Scrip: And what about your most difficult moment?</b></p><p><b>TP: </b> I did work for another company, Human Genome Sciences, which was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline, and it was difficult in the sense that you put so much effort into it and then let it go. I asked many other people to join the company and then it was acquired by another firm. So it was hard as I felt responsible for the people who had joined with me. Ultimately it turned out well but I think it was difficult emotionally for many. </p><p><i>[Ed: In September 2012 Human Genome Sciences, after closing its acquisition deal with GSK, announced plans to lay off 114 staff members.
