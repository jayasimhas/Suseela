<p> &quot;Show me the money!&quot; has been the anthem of the first half of 2015 as pharma and biotechs have demanded record valuations, even as the number of mergers and acquisitions was only slightly higher than a year earlier. </p> <p> While there were only 8.7% more deals in the first six months of 2015 than the year prior, the amount of money being thrown around by the industry went up a whopping 188.8%, according to acquisitions tracked by Informa's Strategic Transactions and MedTrack databases. </p> <p> The strength of biopharma M&amp;A has largely continued from last year and at a rate that has startled many industry insiders, provoking several concerns, including speculation that the biotech bubble will soon burst and fear that consolidation will push drug pricing higher for patients. </p> <p> Companies have been jumping on the M&amp;A and initial public offering bandwagons at a record rate to take advantage of good economic conditions while they still can. There were 29 biotech IPOs in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-A-US-biotech-IPO-surge-Data-are-mixed-359219" target="_new">first half of 2015</a>, and while that was down from the almost unheard of 41 first-time offerings during the first six months of 2014, valuations were up. </p> <p> Some of the numbers are driven by large transactions that took place during the last several months, like Pfizer's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-to-buy-Hospira-for-17bn-in-injectables-and-biosimilar-boost-356560" target="_new">acquisition</a> of Hospira for $17bn and AbbVie's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-outdoes-rumored-JandJ-bid-with-21bn-Pharmacyclics-buy-357078" target="_new">$21bn purchase</a> of Pharmacyclics, but most of the deals were small- to mid-sized. </p> <p> Unlike 2014, which was characterized by some major asset swaps from big pharmas as companies like Novartis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">traded whole business units</a> with competitors like GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., this year hasn't seen many of those kinds of deals. Most of the large pharmaceutical companies reprioritized their portfolios in 2014 and are now shopping for ways to build their strength in just a few therapeutic areas. </p> <p> Another trend that hasn't continued in 2015 is that of tax inversions. US legislation at the end of 2014 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-tax-inversion-needs-to-be-fixed-in-2015-355777" target="_new">put a kibosh</a> on companies trying to merge with companies headquartered in countries with more advantageous tax laws. This resulted in most 2015 deals being conducted within US borders. According to Mergermarket, about 52% of pharma, biotech and medtech deals took place domestically. </p> <p> In total, there were 75 mergers and acquisitions in the first half with 57 of those deals being transparent about the amount of money that changed hands: $188bn or virtually three times the amount that was paid out in the first half of 2014. The major change from year to year was the average deal value, which increased from $1.2bn to $3.3bn this year. </p> <p> The most significant transaction of the first two quarters of 2015 was easily the acquisition of Allergan by Actavis, which carried a $70.5bn price tag. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">acquisition</a> gave the new company a significant presence in specialty pharmaceuticals, including the mega franchise for <i>Botox</i> (onabotulinumtoxinA) that has more than eight indications across a wide variety of diseases. </p> <p> Actavis &ndash; now known as Allergan &ndash; also had one of the largest deals of 2014 with its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-in-25bn-Forest-buy-rumor-350092" target="_new">$23.9bn buyout</a> of Forest Laboratories. The two deals depleted the company's cash, but a recent agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries has made the new company flush again. Teva agreed earlier this month to buy Allergan's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mega-Deals-or-Not-Allergan-Transformation-Under-Way-359815" target="_new">generics business for $40.5bn</a> in a deal that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. </p> <p> Expect M&amp;A to continue at a high rate for the remainder of the year; several deals that already have been proposed could come to fruition, including Mylan's $35bn <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-not-seeing-the-value-in-Mylan-offer-358127" target="_new">hostile bid</a> for Perrigo and Horizon Pharma's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Depomed-Disses-Horizon-For-A-Third-Time-360045" target="_new">$2bn offer</a> for Depomed. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/0EB394B3D26A48DF8F4D050DFF9BBBF3.ashx" alt="M&amp;A Infographic"> </p>
