<p>Active Biotech and Ipsen have dropped development of the immunotherapy candidate tasquinimod in prostate cancer after its "unambiguous" failure in a Phase III trial.</p><p>The market capitalization of Active Biotech, the drug's originator, fell over 61% on the news while that of licensee Ipsen initially dropped by 14.7% before recovering all losses during an active trading morning. When the news initially broke, the market valued the loss of the tasquinimod project at over $700m, but then settled for a much more modest $150m hit, loaded entirely on Active Biotech.</p><p>The top line results of the 10TASQ10 study showed that while tasquinimod did reduce the risk of radiographic cancer progression or death compared with placebo (rPFS, HR=0.69, CI 95%: 0.60 - 0.80) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who had not received chemotherapy, but it did not extend overall survival (OS, HR=1.09, CI 95%: 0.94 - 1.28). </p><p>Professor Tomas Leanderson, Active Biotech's president and CEO, said: "The outcome of the 10TASQ10 study is a major disappointment based on the promising Phase II results. However, the data at hand is unambiguous and cannot motivate further development of tasquinimod in this patient population."</p><p>The prostate cancer market has become increasingly competitive in recent years, making the product unviable. Astellas/Medication's Xtandi (enzalutamide) and Johnson & Johnson's Zytiga(abiraterone). It is also a rich area of research into immunotherapies, following the pioneering Provenge (Dendreon's sipuleucel-T), with products such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab) being tested at a late stage, and a number of cancer vaccines also at Phase III: Bavarian Nordic's ProstVac and SOTIO Group's DCVAC/PCa in Phase III. </p><p>Tasquinimod targets the tumor microenvironment by binding to S100A9 and modulating regulatory myeloid cell functions, exerting immunomodulatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties. Its development has focused mainly on prostate cancer, but it has been tested in early clinical studies in other cancer indications such as liver, ovarian and renal cancers.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare senior analyst Dr Colin White said that because of the game-changing arrival of Xtandi and Zytiga expectations for tasquinimiod had not been high. "Tasquinimod would have had to demonstrate an impressive improvement in overall survival to compete. Given that this trial failed to show a positive benefit risk balance you can understand the decision to discontinue all studies in prostate cancer."</p><p>Ipsen and Active Biotech <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ipsen-to-co-develop-and-commercialise-Active-Biotechs-Phase-III-prostate-cancer-drug-314301" target="_new">entered into a partnership</a> to co-develop and commercialize tasquinimod in April 2011 and in late 2013, the French firm paid Active Biotech <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Ipsen-pays-12m-tasquinimod-milestone-for-prostate-cancer-trial-347140" target="_new">a &euro;12m milestone</a> in relation to the Phase III study. </p><p><p>
