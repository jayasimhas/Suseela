<p>The pooling of knowledge, collaboration rather than confrontation, stratified benefit-risk assessments, adaptive pathways, and the appliance of science to improve drug regulation. These are some of the key elements of Elias Zerhouni's vision of the future &ndash; or at least the future he'd like to see. </p><p>As a keynote speaker at the European Medicines Agency's 20th anniversary conference last week in London, Sanofi's president of global R&D had been asked to be provocative, and he didn't disappoint. </p><p>Dr Zerhouni lauded the EMA for its achievements and for being more transparent in its regulatory processes than the US FDA, but tempered his praise by suggesting the European agency would do well to emulate its transatlantic counterpart and get a grip on the "breakthrough" mentality. He spoke too of the need to reverse the trend towards the development of specialty drugs at the expense primary care medicines, as this was "going in the wrong direction".</p><p>Kicking off with the complexity of science and regulation today, Dr Zerhouni said that while great progress had been made in unravelling the complexity of biology, "we are far behind in understanding the complexity of human disease biology". This, he said, was the "translational gap that will be the challenge for all of us to meet".</p><p>The way forward, the Sanofi executive suggested, was through closer collaboration and the sharing of resources and experience. "The order of the day is going to be intense collaboration [rather than] confrontation. I think this is what the EMA has shown&#8230; in many ways you have done for Europe what we wish to be done for the world." </p><p>Dr Zerhouni, who was director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2002 to 2008, said the industry had to continue its shift away from the "corporate R&D model" and towards partnerships with other stakeholders. He sketched an image of the future where the walls separating the various sources of knowledge were gradually being broken down and fundamental translational scientific problems would be addressed through interactions with biotechs, universities, foundations, other pharma firms and the like. </p><p>He said it was important to actively seek partnerships, like the EU's Innovative Medicines Initiative and the NIH's Public-Private Partnership Program, "because we need a much larger common ground of knowledge, whether predictive toxicology or epidemiology. We need to share data freely to a greater extent publicly worldwide so that the level of knowledge increases across the board. The notion of silo R&D is something I personally believe has no future. You need network innovation to succeed."</p><p>He said that "if you look at the complexity of the R&D project, it involves hundreds of people, and if one piece is weak the whole project fails". He cited the example of identifying strategies for biomarkers, whether surrogate or clinical endpoints: "We are all facing a big issue. I don't know how to solve it, but I know our common wisdom will allow us to solve it." </p><h2>Regulatory reform</h2><p>Regulatory reform was needed if regulation was to keep up with the pace and trajectory of scientific innovation. This was happening to some extent: "There are pilots, other positive energies that I didn't see 10-15 years ago." But having strong regulatory science meant not just applying scientific methods to regulation, but using science and research to discover new ways of regulating. "If we don't keep pace, then we'll slow things down. We need to really understand this."</p><p>The key to improving regulatory science was manpower, Dr Zerhouni said. "We can talk all we want, but you are only as good as your people, how well trained they are, how committed to their missions."</p><p>He bemoaned what he saw as the paucity of training for experts in the regulatory science area. "I was really surprised to see the lack of investment in regulatory science training, doctorates&#8230; How can you motivate someone with creativity who really believes their future is to guarantee the safety and efficacy of therapies &ndash; how to give them recognition, stimulate them? It is a fundamental issue to me. How can we help? This is really my message. How can we work together to make this happen? We need to encourage the next generation of highly trained scientists who have dedicated their lives to regulatory science."</p><h2>Key areas</h2><p>Turning to some key regulatory areas where action is needed, Dr Zerhouni said that biomarkers were a very important aspect of drug development and evaluation, but their clinical utility was limited by a lack of international agreement on qualification. As for companion diagnostics, where there was a "huge trend towards precision medicine and stratified patient populations", he said they would allow regulators to move towards new models of paying for performance, but this was a "huge issue and we're not there yet".</p><p>He welcomed the EMA's efforts to look at adaptive clinical trial designs, and noted the shift away from randomized controlled trials as the gold standard. He said that the agency's willingness to explore new approaches to drug approval, particularly the pilot project on adaptive pathways, was "a breath of fresh air" that had "the potential to reverse the trend away from primary care therapies for chronic diseases" and towards specialty medicines &ndash; " a situation that I deplore personally". Projections by the World Health Organization show that this is "going in the wrong direction. The diseases where I see approvals coming affect less than 20% of the population," he declared. </p><p>Another "game changer" was real-world data, which he said allowed us to accumulate new knowledge and also "reduce variability, which is an indicator of quality". Big data, though, requires a change of mindset: it could "turn to a big buzz with no content, so we have to be very careful". </p><p>Benefit-risk assessments would converge, he predicted, and they would have to be stratified, "just like we are stratifying R&D decisions. We must have a doctrine of benefit-risk assessment, which we do not have" at present. </p><p>As for the EMA's lead on boosting clinical trial data transparency, Dr Zerhouni said this had been "a little confrontational, I would say, at some points, but&#8230; I completely agree that this is the right thing to do". He said the data sharing principles produced by the US industry bodies PhRMA and EFPIA were ground-breaking, and the EMA now had its own policy, and "our positions are now aligned". </p><p>Could this issue have been approached in a better way though? "There were issues, and everyone had a point of view on the value of the data, and commercially confidential information was clearly something we were concerned about&#8230; we wanted to convey that, and we did, but at the end of the day it shows that we don't have a system of earlier understanding of each other's goals, we are not communicating well enough, and I think somehow somewhere really these issues should be discussed."</p><h2>Divergences in drug regulation</h2><p>Dr Zerhouni then moved on to the question of whether there is true convergence of drug regulation at a global level. "There is a view of the world that says that now we are a global world, we have global supply chains, the principles of science are the same, we are exchanging information like never before, and around the world there are more opportunities to communicate. You would think this would lead to regulatory convergence, but unfortunately I think it's not leading there."</p><p>He noted that of course there are differences in legislation, implementation of regulations and socio-political systems, as well as inherent biases within agencies that lead to different responses to the same evidence. </p><p>"I completely understand that&#8230; but at end of the day, you ask yourself: it's the same science, the same data, the same outstanding regulatory agencies, but comparative analysis shows that 50% of labels show significant differences between the EMA and the FDA. For the same evidence. And in 22% of cases there are discordant decisions on approval or denial. Why is that? To me as scientist that is where the nugget of truth is going to be. Because variance is an indicator of quality, and variability in decision making is something we need to look at."</p><p>He said that during his five years in the industry he had not seen "a single regulatory decision that was fully consistent across regulatory agencies. We need to do better." </p><h2>EMA v FDA</h2><p>Turning to the performance of the individual agencies, he noted that there were very consistent times to new drug approval at each agency, although the FDA was faster than the EMA. While comparisons of speed between the two agencies are often seen as invidious, Dr Zerhouni was in no doubt that it played a part in company strategies: " It is important for our decision making process to see which agency has the ability to match the development process."</p><p>He would also have taken many in the audience by surprise when he said that there was "actually more transparency, in my view, in the EMA process. I favour personally the EMA process, because I see there are specific dates on which the exchange of information and opinion is mandated." The fact that there were rapporteurs and co-rapporteurs for each dossier meant that there was "a balance of opinion, there are checks and balances in the system, which scientists really appreciate". </p><p>He pointed out that the EMA process involves clocks stops and "very rigid systems, whereas you look at the FDA, the process is shorter, faster, but not as clearly spelled out in terms of what is the information we need to provide so as not to be surprised". </p><p>He said the FDA had an advantage in being willing to look at priority reviews and breakthrough designations, which had been "a sea change in the ability of the innovator to make progress." The proportion of expedited reviews each year, Dr Zerhouni said, was quite significant at the FDA compared with the EMA. </p><p>"You can see across agencies what is the propensity of the agency to take responsibility and say, 'this is something the public needs and needs quickly, and I'm going to give it breakthrough priority'. That's what the FDA does well, I don&rsquo;t think the EMA is in the same mould, actually for reasons that I think are valid." </p><p>He was clearly aware of the effect this might have on the EMA's chief medical officer Hans-Georg Eichler, who was sitting in the front row. "I see Hans-Georg looking at me like, we are going to throw you out, but forgive me for being candid, I think this is what you asked me to do."</p>
