<p>Can young Indian start-ups like Curofy, a mobile networking app exclusively for physicians, add a new dimension to pharma's "social listening" or alliance options? </p><p>A big yes, if pharma industry pundits are to be believed, even as Curofy vouches that it is "spam free" - sans patient, medical rep or PRO interference.</p><p>For starters, here's what Curofy is all about. Founded by three young graduates from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology - Nipun Goyal, Pawan Gupta and Mudit Vijayvergiya - Curofy is a physician-only networking app via which doctors can connect and collaborate. Physicians can search for colleagues/batch-mates, showcase their profile, discuss and refer cases and stay updated on latest advances in medicine. </p><p>Launched some months ago, more than 3,500 doctors, including super-specialists from Indian hospitals like Medanta, Apollo, Max and Saket City and physicians from 50 cities, are already using the Curofy app. Curofy expects to go global in a year.</p><p>An Indian industry expert compared Curofy to Sermo.com, an international social network for physicians or in its words "a virtual doctors' lounge". All of Sermo's 343,000 members are verified and credentialized US and UK physicians, details on its website suggested. It also claims to be a leading site for medical crowdsourcing. In 2007, Pfizer Inc and Sermo had announced a collaboration aimed at "redefining" the way physicians in the US and the healthcare industry work together to improve patient care.</p><h2>LinkedIn</h2><p>Put simply, you can probably think of Curofy as a hybrid of sorts between a LinkedIn and a WhatsApp, with critical add-on features that help address the "asks" in a busy physician's everyday life. </p><p>Ask cofounder Vijayvergiya about how Curofy distinguishes itself as the go-to networking app for physicians in India and he refers to how the physician community inherently needs "privacy", something that he believes other social networks like LinkedIn or Facebook lack.</p><p>"It's been seven years that LinkedIn has been present in India&#8230;look at the number of physicians networking there - hardly any. The UI/UX [user interface/user experience] of LinkedIn is not what the healthcare industry demands&#8230; it has to be simple and easy to use. LinkedIn is quite complex for doctors," Mr Vijayvergiya told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> could not immediately verify the number of physicians networking via LinkedIn in India.</p><p>On safe sharing of potentially sensitive patient data, Curofy underscores that firstly its doctors-only platform ensures that the information stays within the community. </p><p>"We are working on technology that will remove the identification elements in an image like face, name, tattoos etc. to protect a patient's privacy. The technology is in advanced stage and will be out very soon," Mr Vijayvergiya said.</p><p>The young founder also elaborates on how Curofy keeps a check on quacks entering the network. "Apart from community reporting, we also have bots crawling our servers for any unscrupulous usage or malpractice. Any suspicious activity is red flagged and we block the access temporarily till we are sure," he said.</p><h2>Pharma's take</h2><p>So, does pharma see value in networking apps like Curofy?</p><p>An industry expert with a foreign firm told <i>Scrip</i> that it is pharma&rsquo;s business to "listen to the customer&rsquo;s voice" and that platforms like Curofy bring together some of the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of the customer base, probably not right away, but over time.</p><p>The expert explained that doctors and patients need peer-interaction which is neutral and fair and it is for this reason that pharma and other stakeholders, perceived as "biased", are kept out of these platforms. </p><p>"Surprisingly, Curofy classifies patients alongside pharma and PROs as spam and promises a 'spam-free portal'. There cannot be a greater reflection of pharma&rsquo;s failure if doctors, who for centuries have been the industry&rsquo;s most important stakeholders, consider them spam," the expert said.</p><p>He referred to how such developments have introduced pharma to the concept of social listening - emerging as an important customer intelligence tool. </p><p>"Platforms like Curofy provide a forum for potential or existing customers to share their experiences and sentiment for a product, service, market trend or a breakthrough in science. This can be of immense value to the industry," he underscored.</p><p>He believes such platforms allow a chance for a strategic collaboration that can redefine the way doctors and the healthcare industry can work together to improve patient care. </p><p>"The quicker both sides understand this and work towards it, the better."</p><p>The expert, though, emphasized the need for extra vigilance on the use of social media in the area of pharmaceuticals, including an awareness of the legal requirements about reporting safety-related data.</p><p>"I would expect the regulator to be worried about adverse events popping up from social media, which either the pharma company knows about (through social listening) or is ignoring. This could potentially open up a Pandora&rsquo;s Box. Most content providers of mobile apps or websites are expected to be HIPAA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of the US] compliant to avoid such issues." HIPPAA sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data.</p><h2>Physicians only</h2><p>For now, though, Curofy is sticking to physicians as its core base, but clearly it is aware of industry's interest and the potential of such linkage. </p><p>"We are not going into any kind of partnerships at present [with pharma firms], but going forward we might allow them to broadcast relevant information based on the doctors preference and consensus," Mr Vijayvergiya said.</p><p>But what about letting in medical directors of pharma firms- after all these are physicians per se. "Anything that will be introduced would be non-intrusive and beneficial to doctors. Currently, it's only doctors who are allowed to access the platform. We can introduce medical directors of firms very soon, but can't comment on other stakeholders of industry for now."</p><p>In the case of hospitals, Curofy anticipates tie-ups for digitalizing doctor profiles, posting job vacancies and also as a platform to let doctors across the country know about the "latest technological and medical advancements" in their setup.</p><p>The industry export quoted previously referred to how healthcare professionals were increasingly turning to specialized online communities to seek advice, advance their careers, or look for new jobs. In 2011, 31% used the social media for job searches, up from 21% the prior year, according to AMN Healthcare's 2013 Survey of Social Media and Mobile Usage by Healthcare Professionals.</p>
