<p>With Poland's first ever dedicated life science venture capital (VC) fund having just announced its first closing at $42m, there are promising early signs that the country could be stepping up in the space. Kreske Nickelsen, a veteran of 3i Group and Aescap, is one of the managers of the new Joint Polish Investment Fund (JPIF). She told <i>Scrip</i> about the backdrop to the fund's launch, and why Poland may be one to watch.</p><p>As Ms Nickelsen points out, Poland was the single largest net recipient of EU funding in its latest funding round in 2014, scooping more than &euro;100bn in cash for the 2014-2020 period. As Poland expects that this will be the last time it is a net receiver of funds from Brussels, the government is galvanized to a long-term project of reshaping the country's economy and is committing more than &euro;20bn to supporting the environment for innovation. </p><p>The project will see funds flowing to build and support innovation, from grants for start-ups to support on the legal and intellectual property fronts and provision of access to expensive equipment.</p><p>"The political will is there to build an innovation economy over the next 10 years or so, and they started last year. One piece is the support and set-up of a VC community, and we are the first ones," explained Ms Nickelsen. JPIF is backed by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCVR), an executive agency of Poland's Ministry of Science and Higher Education. However, the idea is not to create an artificial funding environment. "We have agreed that this will be a very, very normal VC fund with an overarching aim of making money," she noted.</p><p>Poland has "great science, great secondary education and good institutes and publications," said Ms Nickelsen. But to translate that into a start-up community, "it needed venture capital." </p><p>JPIF will look to fill that hole initially by supporting enterprises around medical technology, mobile health and enabling technology/instruments. "There may be selected projects in drug development but with a fund this size we can't start doing early-stage drug discovery," Ms Nickelsen explained. She said that possible biopharma projects that could be considered would include ventures working on improved drug formulations or expanded indications for approved products.</p><p>The fund will aim to invest in 8-12 companies in total. While around half of them are expected to be located on Polish soil, others will be international ventures that have Polish connections, whether that be ex-pat Poles who have set up firms abroad &ndash; talks are ongoing with a Polish team based in Pittsburgh, US, for example - or companies that are considering spending significant money in Poland, for example on clinical trials. People have been in touch to express an interest from as far afield as Israel and San Diego, she revealed. Wherever they are, they must have "solid IP, a credible team, some proof of concept data and a prototype device (just a patent on its own is not out of the question but it would need to be exceptional)", said Ms Nickelsen: "We are out to make money."</p><p>The fund's investors are Polish and European institutional investors, while the potential exit markets are international: "companies acquiring start-ups hardly ever care where they are based," said the fund manager.</p><p>Ms Nickelsen expects the main challenge for JPIF, aside from having to build the market from scratch as a pioneer in Polish VC, will be in building effective management teams at portfolio investments. "There is no shortage of IP and science here, but there aren't many serial entrepreneurs. Experienced serial management teams will be hard to come by and we will have to be very involved early on," she said.</p><p>For the future, she foresees additional specialized VC firms joining JPIF in the Polish market. "We have been talking to others and would appreciate some more funds to syndicate with. I think there will be at least two more within the next two or three years."</p><p>Joining Ms Nickelsen in leading and managing JPIF are fellow general partners Dr Marek Orlowski, a Polish business angel and a co-founder of Nepentes SA, which was sold to Sanofi Aventis is 2007; Dr Axel Polack, former general partner of TVM Capital; and Anna Aranowska, who also has experience in pharma/life sciences including as a board member in start-up companies.</p>
