<p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb's immuno-oncology drug Opdivo (nivolumab) continues to wow &ndash; this time in lung cancer, when an independent data monitoring committee ceased a late-stage trial of the drug due to overwhelming efficacy.</p><p>The big pharma announced 17 April that a Phase III trial of Opdivo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients was stopped early because the drug showed superior overall survival over Genentech's standard of care Taxotere (docetaxel). Patients in the Checkmate-057 trial, which included 582 people, will be continued on the treatment or given the option to start using Opdivo. </p><p>This is not the first time that Opdivo has impressed &ndash; the Checkmate 017 trial in squamous NSCLC was also stopped early due to efficacy. That news was followed by a quick BLA filing with the FDA from BMS and a 6-week approval from the agency &ndash; one of the fastest approvals in recent memory. </p><p>Analysts are wondering if BMS can have the same luck twice &ndash; "But assuming near-term filing and approval a little ahead of regular priority review timelines, Opdivo could still receive approval by YE'15 and BMY could be on the market for all 2nd line lung cancer (NSCLC) patients independent of PDL1 tumor expression by the beginning of 2016," wrote Evercore ISI analyst Dr mark Schoenebaum in a sameday note to investors. </p><p>Credit Suisse analyst Dr Vamil Divan expects another approval could expected for Opdivo as early as the third quarter. "These results, combined with the positive results seen previously in patients with lung cancer tumors of squamous histology puts BMY in a very enviable position of likely having several months on the market as the only company with an immuno-oncology drug showing overall survival benefit across all tumor types and regardless of PD-L1+ biomarker status in 2nd line lung NSCLC," he wrote. </p><p>The news is a major win for BMS, which has been competing with Merck & Co, amongst others, to bring immunotherapies to market. Merck gained the first approval with its programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Keytruda-beats-Yervoy-and-edges-ahead-of-Opdivo-in-first-line-melanoma-357471" target="_new">metastatic melanoma</a>; Opdivo gained approval in the same indication shortly after. Both companies have been pushing forward in lung cancer &ndash; the largest market for the immuno-oncologics. </p><p>Opdivo <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">gained approval in March</a> from the FDA in metastatic squamous NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Should BMS gain approval for the drug in a wider lung cancer indication it could guarantee the drug's status as a major blockbuster. Analysts anticipate the immuno-oncology market could be worth $30bn by 2025. </p><p>Another approval for Opdivo could have a major impact on competitors like Merck, Roche and AstraZeneca, which will not likely have approval in the setting until early next year or later. Analysts have expectations that Opdivo will be the market leader in the immuno-oncology space with peak sales of $8bn, but most analysts believe there is plenty of room in the market for multiple players. </p><p>"The results of CheckMate -057 mark the second time Opdivo has demonstrated a survival advantage in lung cancer," said Michael Giordano, head of development for oncology for BMS. "Through our Opdivo clinical development program, we seek to bring the potential for long-term survival to a broad range of patients, across lines of therapy and stages of disease."</p><p>Once BMS evaluates the results they will be published in a medical journal and presented at future medical meetings. </p><p><p><p>
