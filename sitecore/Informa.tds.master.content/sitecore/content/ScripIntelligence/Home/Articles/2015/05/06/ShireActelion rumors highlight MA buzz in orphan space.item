<p>Reports of a &pound;12.4bn ($18.9bn) preliminary approach sent Shire's share price down by 2.75% to &pound;53.05 on the London Stock Exchange on 8 June, while Actelion's stock rose nearly 10% to an all-time high of CHF144.50 on the Swiss exchange, pushing its market capitalization up to CHF16.5bn ($17.5bn). </p><p>Buying Actelion would add around $2bn in annual sales to Shire, which booked $6bn in 2014, driven by ADHD drug Vyvanse ($1.4bn), Lialda/Mezavant for ulcerative colitis ($634m) and Elaprase for the rare lysosomal storage disorder Hunter syndrome ($593m). </p><p>Shire has been active in rare disease M&A, buying four companies for potentially upwards of $10bn since the beginning of 2014 (ViroPharma, Lumena Pharmaceuticals, NPS Pharmaceuticals and Meritage Pharma). </p><p>Actelion's main commercial revenues come from a portfolio of products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but a large proportion are generated by its older product Tracleer and the market is competitive. Nevertheless, Opsumit (macitentan), launched for the condition in 2014, is seeing sales gather pace, and the company is bullish about Uptravi (selexipag), another PAH treatment going through regulatory assessment. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analysts foresee Tracleer's sales falling from $1.5bn in 2014 to less than $200m by 2023, by which time they expect Opsumit sales to have risen from $180m to $1.4bn and Uptravi sales to reach around $925m. Separately, Actelion has a small presence in the market for drugs for lysosomal storage disorders, a field in which Shire is a big player.</p><p>A deal would add a pipeline with a redoubled focus on CNS disease (notably including the Phase III compound ponesimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis), which like fingolimod (Novartis's Gilenya) blocks the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor, but it is not clear what benefit such a product, without much differentiation from Gilenya, would bring to Shire.</p><p>The reported bid represented a premium of around 20% to Actelion's share price. This is rather low relative to other recent deals in pharma, but with Actelion's outlook potentially at risk should cheap generics of Tracleer undermine the prospects for its newer PAH products, Shire may decide to abandon its approach at this point rather than going public with a higher bid. </p><p>The latest rumor that Shire continues to pursue Actelion after purportedly having made a rebuffed takeover offer some weeks ago is a sign of the heated market that exists for companies in the rare disease space. Incentives introduced over recent years in the EU and US to develop drugs for orphan conditions have made business prospects for firms in that area far rosier than in the past; indeed Shire itself is riding high with a market cap of nearly &pound;31bn having steadily risen back to &ndash; and beyond &ndash; the levels it was trading at when it was a takeover target itself for AbbVie in 2014. </p><p>Earlier this year, Shire was speculated to be on the verge of a deal to acquire BioMarin, with its significant portfolio of lysosomal storage disorder treatments and which has itself recently acquired Prosensa for its late-stage candidate for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, drisapersen. Last month, Alexion Pharmaceuticals agreed a $8.6bn deal to acquire Synageva, another firm focused on lysosomal storage disorders. And Swedish Orphan Biovitrum (Sobi) in April revealed that it had received a preliminary takeover offer from an unnamed company (rumored to be Pfizer or Biogen), although today it said its board had terminated discussions on the proposal. Whether or not anything materializes between Shire and Actelion, consolidation in orphan drugs looks set to continue apace.</p>
