<p><p>Intercept Pharmaceuticals is making it hard for competitors to enter the NASH market with a Phase III trial that raises the efficacy bar for the liver disease. </p><p>The biotech announced 19 May that it has reached "harmony" with the two major regulatory bodies about the design of its Phase III registrational trial for its FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) for the treatment of non-cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis. </p><p>The endpoints for the REGENERATE trial will be the dual endpoints of improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening NASH and the resolution of NASH with no worsening of liver fibrosis. </p><p>"I have been saying for a long time ever since we learned that OCA for the first time ever showed the ability in a relatively short period of time, 72 weeks, to actually improve, reverse fibrosis. That elevated the bar for us and, frankly, for the field," said Incept CEO Mark Pruzanski in a 19 May conference call. The trial endpoints give Intercept a leg up on the competition; OCA showed that it could improve liver fibrosis in its Phase II FLINT trial and analysts believe the company will have no trouble showing the same efficacy in the late-stage study. " I can't speak to what other companies with other approaches to NASH will be doing and what kinds of discussions they're going to be having with regulatory authorities. I can only say that it was clear that we intended to showcase OCA's ability to address all the key histopathologic features of this disease," added the exec. </p><p>According to BioMedTracker, OCA has an 84% likelihood of approval, 24% higher than average. There are currently seven drugs in mid-stage trials for the condition including contenders from Gilead and AstraZeneca. </p><p>"Intercept has upped the bar for approval in NASH. We believe the co-primary endpoints of NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement are likely to make it difficult for companies&rsquo; with product candidates that have yet to show an improvement in liver fibrosis get approval," wrote Wedbush analyst Dr Liana Moussatos in a same day note. "Additionally, we believe that the large trial size serves as barrier for approval for other companies seeking approval of product candidates in NASH."</p><h2>The trial design</h2><p>Intercept expects to enroll 2,500 patients at 250 sites in the REGENERATE trial. The study will include an interim analysis at 72 weeks of 1,400 patients that will serve as the basis for approval by the FDA and the EMA. The trial will continue after the analysis in a blinded fashion to further assess long-term safety and efficacy. </p><p>Patients in the trial will be randomized in a 1:1:1 manner &ndash; given either placebo, 10mg of OCA or 25mg of OCA once-daily. The study population of the trial will include patients with advanced liver fibrosis, but will also include a small group of NASH patients with early-stage fibrosis that are at increased risk of rapid disease progression due to co-morbidities like diabetes, obesity or active liver inflammation &ndash; these patients will not be included in the primary endpoint analyses. </p><p>Analysts now expect that OCA will be launched in NASH in 2018 and may lose its first-mover advantage due to the number of patients needed to reach the interim result. </p><p><p><p>
