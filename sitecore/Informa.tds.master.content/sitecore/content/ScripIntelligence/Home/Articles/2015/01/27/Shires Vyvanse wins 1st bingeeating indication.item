<p>Shire picked up another indication for Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) &ndash; winning the first approval in the US for a drug to help curb episodes of binge-eating in adults with the disorder. </p><p>Binge-eating disorder may lead to weight gain and to health problems related to obesity, the FDA noted.</p><p>Vyvanse has been shown to significantly reduce the mean number of binge days per week. </p><p>The drug, however, is not indicated or recommended for weight loss or the treatment of obesity, Shire emphasized. </p><p>Binge eaters have recurrent episodes of compulsive overeating, during which they consume larger amounts of food than normal and experience the sense that they lack control, regulators noted.</p><p>Patients with the condition eat when they are not hungry and often eat to the point of being uncomfortably full. </p><p>Vyvanse initially was approved in 2007 as a once-daily medication to treat attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder in patients 6 years or older. </p><p>The drug is a Schedule II controlled substance because it has high potential for abuse, with use potentially leading to dependence.</p><p>The FDA approved Vyvanse under the agency's priority review program &ndash; a speedier process than typical reviews.</p><p>Vyvanse's efficacy in treating binge-eating disorder was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization studies in adults 18-55 years.</p><p>The primary efficacy outcome for the two studies was defined as the change from baseline at week 12 in the number of binge days per week. Baseline is defined as the weekly average of the number of binge days per week for the 14 days prior to the baseline visit. </p><p>Participants in both studies on Vyvanse had a statistically significant greater reduction from baseline in mean number of binge days per week at week 12. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
