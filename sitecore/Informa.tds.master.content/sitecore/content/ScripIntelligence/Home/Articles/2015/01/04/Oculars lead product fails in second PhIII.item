<p>Ocular Therapeutix's sank on 7 April following mediocre results from a second Phase III trial of the company's lead product candidate, OTX-DP (sustained release dexamethasone). </p><p>OTX-DP, a sustained and tapered release of dexamethasone depot administered via a hydrogel punctum plug, is being tested as a treatment for ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. In a second Phase III study of the drug, OTX-DP was required to meet two separate primary efficacy endpoints: statistically significant differences between the treatment group and the placebo group for the absence of pain on day eight and absence of inflammatory cells on day 14. Ocular has reported that OTX-DP failed to meet its day 14 target. </p><p>In this trial, which enrolled 240 patients, 77.5% of those receiving OTX-DP reported an absence of pain in the study eye on day 8 following insertion of the drug product, compared to 58.8% of those receiving placebo vehicle control punctum plug, a difference which was statistically significant (p=0.0025). However, only 39.4% of OTX-DP-treated patients showed an absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye on day 14 following drug product insertion, compared to 31.3% of those receiving placebo. </p><p>Data regarding secondary efficacy endpoints for the second Phase III trial are still being evaluated.Â </p><p><p>In March 2015, Ocular reported results from its first Phase III clinical trial of OTX-DP, which enrolled 247 patients. In this trial, OTX-DP met both primary efficacy endpoints with 33.7% of OTX-DP-treated patients showed an absence of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the study eye on day 14, compared to 14.6% of those receiving placebo vehicle control punctum plug (p=0.0015).</p><p>"Following the favorable results from our first Phase III trial, we are disappointed that the second Phase III clinical results for resolution of inflammation did not have the same magnitude of differential as what OTX-DP achieved in the first trial," said Dr Amar Sawhney, president and CEO of Ocular. </p><p>He added that although the efficacy results for the absence of inflammatory cells in the OTX-DP treatment group met expectations, the placebo group response was significantly higher than expected.</p><p>Dr Sawhney said Ocular has begun a thorough analysis of the data from the second trial to fully understand "the difference in efficacy between these two trials that had essentially the same trial design and similar patient population."</p><p>On a more positive note, Ocular said there were no treatment related serious adverse events in the OTX-DP treatment group in either of the two Phase III clinical trials. There were two serious adverse events in the OTX-DP treatment group in the first Phase III trial (1.2% incidence), compared with three serious adverse events in the placebo group (3.6% incidence). There were two serious adverse events in the OTX-DP treatment group in the second Phase III trial (1.3% incidence), compared with three serious adverse events in the placebo group (3.8% incidence). But overall there were fewer adverse events in the treated group than in the placebo group.</p><p>The company now plans to "promptly" discuss the Phase III OTX-DP clinical trial results with the FDA and "chart the appropriate path forward."</p><p>Ocular also hopes to be able to use the safety data from these Phase III trials to support its other OTX-DP clinical development programs including allergic conjunctivitis. </p><p>
