<p><p>Gilead is on the cusp of dominating the hepatitis C landscape once again now that its latest combination product has been shown to work in all genotypes of the drug. Companies have been racing to be the first to develop a cure that could work on all forms of the disease. </p><p>The big biotech announced Sept. 21 that late-stage results from studies of its blockbuster <i>Sovaldi</i> (sofosbuvir) with the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir that showed sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after treatment. </p><p>The Gilead combination could have major impacts on the hepatitis C treatment landscape &ndash; which has already been dramatically changed by the other offerings from the company. The pan-genotypic treatment has the potential to eliminate the need for genotype testing and create a larger market for drugmakers. </p><p>The next frontier for these drug combos will be shorter durations of treatment. Some of Gilead's competitors are already showing success in some genotypes in as little as six weeks and expect Gilead to maintain its lead with similar data. </p><p>Currently, the hepatitis C market is very fragmented due to the different genotypes of the disease. Most of the treatments on the market are approved to treat genoype 1, which is the most prevalent form of the disease in the US. </p><p>Analysts and payers are going to be pay close attention to the cost of the combination. Gilead's other two hepatitis C products brought in more than $12bn in 2014 and are on track to exceed that this year. There has been uproar over the last few years over the price of the drugs, sparking a national debate about high prescription drug costs. Competition from AbbVie in the space brought down the pricetag of the drugs minimally, but payers have still expressed exasperation &ndash; prompting many to ask the value of a functional cure. </p><p><b>The Results</b></p><p>The results from ASTRAL-1, -2, and -3, which included more than 1,000 hepatitis C patients of genotypes 1 through 6, achieved SVR12 rates of nearly 100% in almost every genotype of the disease. In ASTRAL-1, genotypes 2, 4 and 6 achieved SVR12 rates of 100%, while genotype 1 had a response rate of 98% and genotype 5 had a rate of 97%. </p><p>In ASTRAL-3, a study of just patients with genotype 3, 95% of patients on the drug combo achieved SVR12, while only 80% of those treated with Sovaldi and ribavirin reached the endpoint. </p><p>Of the 1,035 patients in the three studies, only 20 patients did not achieve an SVR12 rate. Ten of the 13 patients who experienced virologic failure were genotype 3. </p><p>The ASTRAL-4 trial studied the drug combination in patients with severe cirrhosis. Patients in this study experienced higher response rates if their regimen included ribavirin &ndash; the former standard of care. Nine of the patients in this study died of advanced liver disease. </p><p>Side effects were generally well-tolerated across all of the studies with the most common adverse events being nausea, fatigue and headache. </p><p>FDA has already granted breakthrough therapy designation to the drug combination and Gilead expects to file for approval by the fourth quarter. </p><p><p>
