<p>Even though Relypsa Inc. achieved the ultimate regulatory success of gaining US approval on Oct. 21 of Veltassa (patiromer) &ndash; the first drug in 50 years to treat hyperkalemia, which often affects people with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease, heart failure, diabetes and hypertension &ndash; investors were spooked by the black-box warning the FDA imposed on the medicine's labeling.</p><p>Shares of the company plummeted 36.4% on Oct. 22, before closing at $11.76, down $4.39, or 27%.</p><p>Hyperkalemia is a condition that causes elevated blood potassium levels. The condition can cause abnormal heart rhythms and even sudden death. </p><p>There are often no warning signs, meaning a person can unknowingly experience spikes in potassium levels recurrently and be at risk for these cardiac events. </p><p>Veltassa is a polymer medicine that binds potassium.</p><p>In clinical trials, Veltassa significantly reduced blood potassium and kept levels in the target range for up to a year in patients with hyperkalemia, allowing for chronic daily treatment of the disease.</p><p>But Veltassa also binds to many orally administered medications, which could decrease their absorption and reduce their effectiveness. </p><p>The drug's labeling warns that the medicine should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action.</p><p>The boxed warning advises prescribers to administer other oral medications at least six hours before or after Veltassa. </p><p>"Choose Veltassa or the other oral medication if adequate dosing separation is not possible," the warning says.</p><p>During a conference call, investors and analysts peppered Relypsa management about the dose separation.</p><p>But Relypsa CEO John Orwin insisted it's not unusual for a binder to have language in its label advising doctors about binding of oral drugs and recommending dose separation. </p><p>There was a suggestion in preclinical studies that there is a potential that Veltassa may bind with some oral medications within the gastrointestinal tract, and if that occurs, it could decrease their absorption and potentially reduce their effectiveness, he said.</p><p>"While we did not observe any evidence in the clinical trial program to suggest clinically relevant binding interactions between Veltassa and drugs that showed some binding in vitro, we have studies ongoing to evaluate whether Veltassa binds to these medicines in humans and if binding is seen, whether a three-hour separation can potentially be used to manage this risk instead of six hours," Orwin explained.</p><p>He said Relypsa expected to have those data early next year and, if appropriate, the company will discuss the potential labeling update with FDA. </p><p>"Based on our market research and feedback from key opinion leaders, we believe physicians will find this dose separation manageable," Orwin said.</p><p>He said the company had tested potential elements of Veltassa's labeling with nephrologists and cardiologists prior to approval, and in those discussions, the majority of physicians indicated the medicine "fulfils an important need and that they will use it." </p><p>The doctors also said the vast majority of their patients are on medications that are once or twice daily, "which is in line with our own market research and they see the recommended six-hour separation as feasible," Orwin said. </p><p><b>Pricing And Distribution</b></p><p>In the outpatient setting, Veltassa will be provided to patients in a 30-day supply, which will contain 30 single-use packets. The drug will be available in three different strengths. </p><p>The wholesale acquisition cost for the 30-day pack of Veltassa will be $595, which is the same for each of the three dosage strengths. </p><p>"When deciding the price of Veltassa, our primary concern was ensuring patients living with the burden of hyperkalemia have access to Veltassa and have manageable out-of-pocket costs," said Scott Garland, chief commercial officer and senior vice president at Relypsa.</p><p>Hospitals will receive special packs designed to allow them flexibility in ordering Veltassa, he said. </p><p>Each hospital pack will have four single use packets of the 8.4g dose and will have a wholesale acquisition cost of $119. </p><p>"Securing reimbursement for Veltassa is one of our top priorities," Garland said. "Our payer field team has been out, building relationships with payers for most of the year."</p><p>The company said it working with an authorized network of specialty pharmacies to distribute Veltassa. The drug will be shipped to hospitals through specialty distributors which are divisions of the major wholesalers, Garland said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
