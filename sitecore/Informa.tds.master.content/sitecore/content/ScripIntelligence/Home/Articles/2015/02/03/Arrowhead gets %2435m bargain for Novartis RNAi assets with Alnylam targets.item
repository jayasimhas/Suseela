<p>Arrowhead Research president and CEO Christopher Anzalone courted Novartis for more than a year before the Pasadena, California-based biotechnology company signed an agreement to buy the Novartis's RNA interference (RNAi) portfolio, but he doesn't expect the $35m acquisition to immediately yield new clinical programs.</p><p>In fact, Dr Anzalone is the first to admit that the transaction, in which Arrowhead will pay $10m in cash and issue $25m in stock to Novartis, was a technology play more than a drug candidate-driven deal. The Novartis research may enhance Arrowhead's technology platform for the delivery of RNAi therapeutics and the intellectual property may broaden the company's ability to operate in the RNAi field, but there's no rush to move Novartis's preclinical programs immediately into the clinic.</p><p>The transaction follows Novartis's April 2014 announcement that the company was giving up on RNA therapeutics, due to concerns about formulation and delivery (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-RNA-pullback-gives-biotech-stocks-whiplash-351300" target="_new">15 April 2014</a>). Less than a year later, Arrowhead is buying Novartis's patents covering RNAi triggers, the company's novel intracellular targeting ligands, a license to 30 gene targets from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, and three therapeutic candidates in various stages of preclinical development.</p><p>"I first reached out to [Novartis] early last year before they announced they were going to get out of the business, just in case they were going to shed some assets," Dr Anzalone told <i>Scrip</i>. "A month or two later, they announced they were going to get out of the business."</p><p>It took a while for Novartis to determine how it would dispose of its RNAi assets, but eventually the company accepted Arrowhead's offer to pay a $7m option fee in exchange for an exclusive look at the intellectual property that was up for grabs. The fee is part of the $10m in cash that Arrowhead is combining with $25m in stock, issued over a 30-day period, to buy the RNAi portfolio.</p><p>"I knew there'd be companies going to them and venture firms that would want to form companies around the assets," Dr Anzalone said. "We were able to do this without other companies going over the data sets. None of our potential competitors, I don't think, had an opportunity to look at the detailed data."</p><p><b>A stale bag of potato chips?</b></p><p>Alnylam CEO John Maraganore told <i>Scrip</i> that he wishes the team at Arrowhead well, but he's skeptical that the company bought anything of value, including the gene targets that Alnylam licensed to Novartis under a 2005 agreement.</p><p>"We like the people over at Arrowhead, and at Novartis, but I think they bought a bag of stale potato chips. We think there wasn't much there," Dr Maraganore said. "The targets, I would describe as being pretty useless in the RNA space [based on current science]. These were selections that were made by Novartis quite a while ago."</p><p>That said, if Arrowhead is able to advance any therapies based on any of those, Alnylam will benefit from royalties on product sales. </p><p>"The other intellectual property that was at Novartis doesn't really give much to any player. It's a bit of a yawn from our perspective," Dr Maraganore said. "We wish [Arrowhead] well with the assets. If they're able to make something good out of it, good for them."</p><p>It will take time for Arrowhead to show a return on its relatively small investment, but at $10m cash and $25m in stock the company is investing less than Novartis spent on the Alnylam license deal alone. Dr Anzalone noted during Arrowhead's 5 March conference call to discuss its transaction with analysts and investors that Novartis paid $10m up front and bought $58m worth of Alnylam shares, although that stock has appreciated considerably since 2005.</p><p>Alnylam gained 4% on 5 March to close at $111.56 per share, a new all-time high, based on Arrowhead's deal with Novartis. Arrowhead closed up 5.7% at $7.94 per share on 5 March, but the stock remains near the low end of its one-year range of $4.95 to $27.01. The company's market cap is $435.1m.</p><p><b>Why Arrowhead and not Novartis?</b></p><p>Why does Arrowhead think that it can be successful with RNAi assets that Novartis, with its big pharma resources, could not advance into the clinic?</p><p>Dr Anzalone said it's a matter of delivery, which has been the biggest challenge for RNA-based therapies. Arrowhead believes that it solved the problem with its Dynamic Polyconjugates (DPC) delivery platform even if it may have room for improvement with some of the Novartis technology. </p><p>"They made great progress, but they hadn't figured out delivery. If you marry [the Novartis research] with what we think is the best delivery technology in the world, you've got a pretty powerful combination," Dr Anzalone said.</p><p>Arrowhead doesn't expect to file investigational new drug (IND) applications with the US FDA until 2016 for assets from the Novartis portfolio. </p><p>"This is a technology play. It's not really a drug candidate play, not yet," Dr Anzalone said.</p><p>Arrowhead will have to sort through the technology to determine whether the RNA triggers can improve the efficiency and potency of RNAi therapeutics delivered with the company's DPC technology and to see if the Novartis ligands can improve the level of RNA knockdown and/or increase the duration of activity for Arrowhead's RNAi therapies. Figuring out whether the company can or should combine its DPC technology with the Novartis triggers and ligands will take some time.</p><p>"We view this as a 'nice to have,' not a 'need to have,'" Dr Anzalone said.</p><p>Arrowhead already has two programs in the clinic that use the company's DPC technology &ndash; ARC-520 for hepatitis B and ARC-AAT for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). </p><p>ARC-520 was placed on a partial clinical hold in January after Arrowhead asked the FDA for permission to test multiple doses simultaneously in a Phase IIb clinical trial (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Arrowhead-plummets-on-FDA-partial-hold-356098" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>). The agency wants the company to start with the lowest dose then move on to higher doses in a traditional rising multiple dose study. Arrowhead submitted a new trial protocol and expects to hear back from the FDA and start its Phase IIb study soon. A trial testing single doses of ARC-520 is ongoing and data are expected before the end of the second quarter of 2015.</p><p>The first patient was dosed in a Phase I clinical trial for ARC-AAT about a week ago, and Arrowhead plans to submit an IND for a third clinical candidate by the end of 2015.</p><p><b>Smaller companies, bigger focus</b></p><p>The best way for the RNAi field to advance from early- to late-stage development may be in the hands of smaller companies, like Arrowhead and Alnylam, that can focus all of their attention on the field.</p><p>"The last time we had an interaction with Novartis in the RNAi space was in 2007. Since then, it was not really an active relationship," Dr Maraganore said. "It was no surprise at all that they stopped investing in RNAi, because they weren't really making any progress in the space."</p><p>He said it's been hard for larger companies to advance RNAi science, because they aren't solely committed to it, but Alnylam has advanced six programs into the clinic, including three in Phase III. </p><p>But big pharma companies are taking another look at RNA-based therapies, as evidenced in 2014 by Alnylam's agreement with Sanofi for rare disease therapies that was worth $700m up front and Roche's acquisition of Santaris for up to $450m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Alnylam-gets-700m-Sanofi-investment-buys-Sirna-from-Merck-349280" target="_new">13 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-rekindles-RNA-love-affair-with-450m-Santaris-buy-353187" target="_new">5 August 2014</a>).</p><p>"I'm optimistic about pharma interest in the space, but the focus has shifted to products rather than technology where Novartis and others had issues," Dr Maraganore said.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
