<p><p>The slowing growth rate of the UK drugs bill is worrying the pharmaceutical industry, that believes it reflects a lack of awareness in the National Health Service about the rebate scheme that started in 2014.</p><p><p>The latest figures show that the UK drug's bill grew by 2.4% in the 2015 second quarter compared with the 2013 second quarter, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) reported Sept. 7. This contrasts with the growth rate in 2014 that was almost twice that, the ABPI noted.</p><p><p>Under the 2014 Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS), the UK industry said it would keep overall NHS drug spending flat in 2014 and 2015, and agreed to rebate any spending in 2014 and 2015 that was above that level. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the industry agreed to repay any spending above a growth rate of 2%. In the second quarter of this year, the industry rebated &pound;209m to the government, and &pound;207m in the first quarter. </p><p><p>The scheme is believed to be unique. In other European countries, rebate agreements tend to involve spending on specific drugs by individual hospitals or regions.</p><p><p>The aim of the UK scheme was to drive the uptake of new medicines, as their cost is spread among the industry, so the finding that the growth in spending has slowed suggests the rebate scheme is not having the full impact that UK companies wanted it to have.</p><p><p>"Whilst industry is underwriting the medicines bill, patients are still not getting access to the right medicines at the right time," said David Watson, director of pricing and reimbursement at the ABPI. During 2014 the industry paid &pound;310m in rebates and expects to pay more than &pound;800m in 2015.</p><p><p>For anticancers, a popular category in which to launch a new drug, the NHS&rsquo;s Cancer Drugs Fund has been available to fund treatments rejected by the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), but for the purposes of the PPRS scheme it is still spending by the NHS and is included in the scheme. However, the ABPI has just reached an agreement with the government to improve the clarity on how the Cancer Drugs Fund spending is included in the PPRS calculations.</p><p><p>Part of the reason for the lack of awareness in the NHS of the PPRS provisions may be that individual clinical commissioning groups are not aware they are receiving PPRS rebates; the money is there but it is not visible. This lack of awareness then leads to additional processes in the NHS to control prescribing that slows the uptake of NICE-approved medicines.</p><p><p><p><p>
