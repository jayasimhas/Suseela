<p>As the full-year 2014 earnings season turns into a long tail of announcements from small companies, the major themes of moment &ndash; those of currency translations and market access by price discounts &ndash; are set to become non-issues for companies which may never have the luxury of either of those challenges. </p><p>So far, earnings season has afforded little opportunity for those companies reporting early to avoid revealing the impact of those pressures, but those reporting later have already learnt to deploy diversionary tactics for their own issues.</p><p>Regeneron reported fourth quarter 2014 sales that beat analysts' consensus estimates, but missed earnings estimates on higher expenses (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Regenerons-Eylea-overtakes-Lucentis-with-2014-US-sales-356689" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 11 February 2015</a>). With partner Sanofi's anti-PCSK9 biologic drug Praluent (alirocumab) for lipid-lowering expected to launch this summer, there was a muted response to Regeneron's announcement, which can be attributed to the many moving parts to this emerging story. On the one hand, investors should be pleased that Regeneron is investing in its commercial infrastructure ahead of a major drug launch; since this is more than many big pharma companies can hope for this year. But on the other hand, it too has been affected by the euro. While Regeneron has sales and commercial infrastructure in the US, and reports in US dollars, its ex-US partner Bayer's Eylea (afilibercept) sales represent over 35% of Eylea's total last quarter sales. And it was Eylea sales that missed the estimates of the analysts from both Cowen and JP Morgan, but beat the consensus estimate. This made me wonder, not for the first time, who on earth these analysts are who don't take the euro into account in their models, and whether consensus estimates should be a median, rather than an average number.</p><p>Companies like Regeneron, which you might expect would be playing the strong home currency card, seemed to have chosen other villains for their disappointing financial results. Similarly, Australia's CSL, which has had the challenge of a strong home currency for a number of years, reported sales and earnings that missed analysts' expectations for the last quarter. Like most of their bigger brethren, earnings guidance for 2015 was also a disappointment to the sell-side analysts. CSL seemed to blame both disappointments on competitive pressures in immunoglobulins (also known as pricing pressure by large payers) and integration costs for the recent bargain-basement acquisition of Novartis' influenza vaccines business (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-sells-flu-vaccine-business-at-knockdown-rate-354672" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 October 2014</a>).</p><p>The long-anticipated closing of the swap transactions of the non-influenza vaccine, oncology and consumer businesses between GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, which had forced Novartis to virtually give away their influenza business to CSL, was used by GSK to divert attention away from its operational, currency and price-discounting woes. The ongoing transaction meant that GSK did not feel able to give earnings guidance for 2015, thus avoiding the share price fall-out that has accompanied its more transparent competitors (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-2014-revenues-fall-but-shares-climb-on-upbeat-respiratory-talk-356544" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 February 2015</a>). </p><p>The other aspect of GSK's recent earnings announcement that resulted in its share price rising that day was the prospect of the IPO of its ViiV Healthcare HIV joint venture with Pfizer and then possibly, other spin-off transactions for the Consumer Healthcare and Vaccine businesses. Had I been a shareholder I would have been wondering about what would be left of GSK after all these divestments, other than the group of senior executives who got it into this mess in the first place. To the financially na&iuml;ve , it might therefore have appeared strange to see the analysts from UBS do an about-face upgrade of GSK from "Sell" to "Buy" despite continuing falling sales at the company. That is, unless like me, you suspected that the upgrade had less to do with the fundamentals of GSK and more to do with the bankers from UBS angling for a piece of these spin-off transactions.</p><p>A similar effect might have been predicted after Reckitt Benckiser and its recently spun-off pharmaceutical division Invidior both reported their first financial results as separate entities (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Reckitts-Indivior-endeavors-to-gain-recognition-for-addiction-says-CEO-355171" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 20 November 2014</a>). As a wasting asset with, like GSK, historically declining sales and uncertain patent challenges, only its investors seemed shocked and disappointed at Invidior's 2015 guidance which resulted in the share price opening sharply down, but recovering over the day to finish down about 3%. The same effect without the recovery was seen at Invidior's former parent whose second life without the higher margin products should have given the management of GSK a pause for thought on their spin-offs. </p><p>In a related transaction, I had to give some credit to the management of Sanofi for their transparency when they bit the bullet and started to withdraw from the oncology therapeutic area, rather than spinning it off to an unsuspecting public market (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-confirms-down-sizing-of-oncology-efforts-356729" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 February 2015</a>). Sanofi has lagged companies like Merck, Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and even Pfizer, most of which already have new products on the market in cancer immunotherapy. It appears though that no French employment contracts were harmed in the making of the redundancies at Sanofi's Boston site.</p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include Regeneron, CSL, Novartis, Merck, Roche and BMS.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest manages the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for four life science</i>&ndash;<i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p>
