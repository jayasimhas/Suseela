<p>Investors weren't too alarmed over the FDA's rejection on 28 May of AMAG Pharmaceuticals single-dose vial of its preterm birth drug Makena (hydroxyprogesterone caproate), with shares of the firm actually gaining 8%.</p><p>AMAG&rsquo;s stock closed the day at $68.52, up $1.83, or 2.7%.</p><p>Most on Wall Street said they thought the company could easily manage the FDA's concerns over AMAG's application, which regulators said they could not accept in its present form.</p><p>The FDA said it needed additional information about the manufacturing procedures for the single-dose vial of Makena at a new third-party manufacturer. </p><p>AMAG said it remained committed to commercializing a single-dose vial of Makena and plans to work with the FDA on a timely response.</p><p>Makena is the only FDA-approved treatment indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant with one baby and who have spontaneously delivered one preterm baby in the past.</p><p>The drug currently is marketed in a multi-dose vial containing five weekly injections. </p><p>But CEO William Heiden said the single-dose vial of Makena could provide "important added flexibility and efficiency for our customers, with the assurance of a product that meets the FDA's strict quality requirements for sterile injectables."</p><p>AMAG emphasized the FDA's rejection of the single-dose vial has no impact on the currently marketed version of Makena.</p><p>Mr Heiden said the company continues to anticipate a fourth-quarter launch of the single-dose vial of Makena and does not expect the FDA's rejection to change the firm's financial outlook for 2015.</p><p>But RW Baird analyst Christopher Raymond said that although he was comforted the delay with the single-dose vial appears minimal, with fiscal year 2015 guidance maintained, the FDA's rejection on 28 May, coupled with the continued <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/AMAG-slides-on-FDA-rejection-of-Feraheme-label-expansion-349533" target="_new">setbacks with Feraheme's</a> (ferumoxytol) broad iron deficiency anemia efforts, "make us wonder how well management will be able to navigate the much more complex tasks associated with Makena's life-cycle extension."</p><p>AMAG picked up Makena last year when it acquired Lumara Health, formerly KV Pharmaceutical, which had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Battered-by-compounders-on-Makena-KV-seeks-bankruptcy-protection-333576" target="_new">reorganized under bankruptcy protection</a>.</p><p>KV had blamed the FDA for its downfall &ndash; claiming that when the agency said it had no intention of stopping the hydroxyprogesterone caproate compounders from making their lower-priced products as long as they remained safe, harmed the firm's sales of Makena, whose high-price had been criticized and snubbed.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
