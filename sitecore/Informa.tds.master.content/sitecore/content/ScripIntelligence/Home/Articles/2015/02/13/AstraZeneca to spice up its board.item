<p>AstraZeneca said this week that Dr Cornelia (Cori) Bargmann will be proposed to shareholders for election as a non-executive director at the company's AGM on 24 April 2015. The board also wants to propose her appointment to AstraZeneca's science committee. </p><p>Dr Bargmann, is head of the Laboratory of Neural Circuits and Behavior at The Rockefeller University, New York.</p><p>She has been quite a vocal critic of the pharma industry on social media. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=GSK%20illegally%20markets%20drugs%20for%20recreational%20purposes&src=typd" target="_new">tweet</a> after GSK was fined $3bn by the US justice department in 2012 for marketing abuses, she wrote: "GSK illegally markets drugs for recreational purposes. In other segments of the economy, that leads to prison." </p><p>The proposal comes as John Varley, senior independent non-executive director and Dame Nancy Rothwell, non-executive director, both intend to retire from AstraZeneca's board, each having served as a board member for nine years. </p><p>Leif Johansson, AstraZeneca's chairman, said the retirement of existing board members had provided the company with an opportunity to propose new appointments. "We welcomed Ann Cairns last year and are delighted that Cori Bargmann has agreed to join the board in April. Cori will bring a wealth of experience in scientific research, fitting the needs of AstraZeneca's board very well."</p>
