<p><b>As preparations continue for the establishment of Europe's Unified Patent Court system, Paul England examines the structure of the court and the various factors that will determine where infringement and revocation actions are to be lodged</b>. </p><p>The future Unified Patent Court will be a pan-European court, and it will have either a local division or regional division in most of the 25 contracting EU member states. In addition, there will be a central division with its seat in Paris, and sections in London and Munich. These together make up the Court of First Instance, but there will also be a Court of Appeal in Luxembourg. </p><p>There are rules governing how actions are to be lodged in the divisions of First Instance. The general rule is that infringement claims must be filed in the divisional court of the member state where the defendant is situated, or the divisional court of the member state where the alleged infringement takes place or is threatened. </p><p>Revocation actions must generally be filed in the central division, unless an infringement action concerning the same patent and the same parties has already been lodged in a local or regional division. In this case the revocation action must follow the infringement action. </p><p>In certain circumstances, if actions for infringement and revocation of the same patent and between the same parties have been lodged, jurisdictional rules apply that can split the revocation and infringement actions or (if they are lodged in different divisions) bring them together.</p><p>In addition to the above rules, actions that are lodged in the central division will be allocated to the Paris seat or one of the other sections, according to the subject matter of the patent (or patents) in dispute. </p><p>The Paris seat will be responsible for hearing patent disputes concerning subject matter including computer electronics and telecommunications. The Munich section will be responsible for largely mechanical engineering-related subject matter. The London section of the UPC central division will hear matters concerning "human necessities", which includes chemicals and life sciences. </p><p>The location of the UPC division in which an action is lodged also has an impact on the language that must be used in the proceedings. As with the location in which an action must be lodged, there are rules governing the language of proceedings in a local or regional division and the central division. </p><h2>Language Issues</h2><p>In a local or regional division the language may be the official language of the contracting member state hosting the division, the language that court has designated, or an official language of the European Patent Office. There are also circumstances in which the language may be that of the grant of the patent in dispute. If a dispute is lodged in the central division, the language will be that in which the patent was granted. </p><p>The result of the above rules is that, depending on the subject matter of the patent, or the location of the defendant or the infringement, actions in the UPC may be brought in a country other than the one where the claimant and/or the defendant is situated. Most stages of proceedings in the UPC do not require the parties actually to be present in court, which will help to mitigate the costs of travel. </p><p>The UPC will also employ a number of measures &ndash; the translation of documents and simultaneous interpretation of oral hearings &ndash; designed to overcome potential problems due to language differences. However, these will carry costs for one or other party.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at law firm Taylor Wessing</i>.</p>
