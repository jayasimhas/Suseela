<p>Zogenix got an 8% boost in after-hours trading on 30 January after the FDA gave its blessing to the firm to market a new formulation of its a single-entity extended-release hydrocodone Zohydro, which uses an abuse-deterrent technology.</p><p>The company, however, has yet to win the abuse-deterrent claims in its US labeling &ndash; something competitor Pursue Pharma is able to tout for its newly approved single-entity hydrocodone Hysingla. </p><p>Purdue's drug currently is the only hydrocodone product to be recognized by the FDA as having abuse-deterrent properties expected to deter misuse and abuse via chewing, snorting and injection &ndash; the routes of administration abusers generally use to get high (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-clears-Purdues-harder-to-abuse-hydrocodone-Hysingla-355182" target="_new">21 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Zogenix said the new formulation of Zohydro ER uses its BeadTek technology, which is designed to provide abuse-deterrent properties without changing the release properties of hydrocodone when the firm's drug is used as intended. </p><p>The company said the results of its ongoing human abuse liability studies will further characterize the abuse-deterrent properties of the new formulation. </p><p>Zogenix said it intends to submit those data in the second half of this year to the FDA to support an amended product label, including abuse-deterrent claims consistent with the agency's current draft guidance, <i>Abuse-Deterrent Opioids &ndash; Evaluation and Labeling</i>.</p><p>The company said BeadTek incorporates "well-known pharmaceutical excipients that immediately form a viscous gel when crushed and dissolved in liquids or solvents." </p><p>All of the beads within the medication capsule are indistinguishable in color, shape, density and size, and do not impact the drug release profile when taken as directed, Zogenix said.</p><p>Zohydro, an extended-release opioid agonist, initially was approved in October 2013 to manage pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zogenix-soars-on-FDA-Zohydro-OK-1st-single-entity-hydrocodone-347647" target="_new">26 October 2013</a>).</p><p>But from the get-go, the drug was under fire from consumer protection groups and lawmakers &ndash; a controversy that brought Democrats and Republicans together in their attacks against the FDA for allowing the medicine to enter the US market without the abuse-deterrent mechanisms (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timid-tiptoeing-Antibiotic-efforts-panned-348782" target="_new">8 December 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-zaps-Zogenix-Zohydro-Rough-road-ahead-for-other-ER-opioids-338014" target="_new">16 December 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/House-FDA-funding-bill-advances-but-not-without-some-scolding-352067" target="_new">30 May 2014</a>).</p><p>Massachusetts also made several attempts to get Zohydro ER banned or to at least make its marketing and distribution more difficult scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Fighting-the-uphill-battle-Stakes-high-for-drug-makers-350945" target="_new">31 March 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zogenix-takes-Massachusetts-to-court-over-Zohydro-ban-351148" target="_new">8 April 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Judge-Massachusetts-Zohydro-ban-unconstitutional-351332" target="_new">16 April 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
