<p>Novartis AG hopes new Phase III data showing most patients were able to maintain clear or nearly clear skin for up to three years by using Cosentyx (secukinumab) will reinforce and expand use of its new plaque psoriasis treatment.</p><p>The Swiss company already has first-mover advantage with the drug, the first in a new class of medicines called interleukin-17A inhibitors, and is trying to establish Cosentyx's lead in a tightly controlled reimbursement environment. </p><p>The company thinks that aim will be helped by latest Phase III trial data in which 320 patients received Cosentyx in a fixed dosing schedule for three years. The extended study, the longest Phase III Cosentyx trial conducted so far, showed 69% achieved clear or almost clear skin (PASI 90) at year one. That response was well maintained after three years, with 64% of patients continuing to have a PASI 90 response, while 43% of patients maintained completely clear skin (PASI 100) at year three, compared with 44% at year one. </p><p>Results from the A2304E1 Extension Study, a multicenter, double-blind and open-label, four-year extension to the pivotal Phase III SCULPTURE and STATURE studies, showed 83% of patients taking Cosentyx achieved the standard treatment goal of PASI 75 skin clearance at three years. Data from the study were presented on Oct. 10 at the 24th Annual Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV), in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p><p>The PASI score assesses the reduction from baseline in the redness, scaling and thickness of psoriatic plaques and to what extent it affects each area of the body. PASI 75 has historically been considered the goal for psoriasis treatment. But with newer treatments with increased efficacy, there is now a focus on PASI 90, representing clear or almost clear skin, and PASI 100 or clear skin as the ultimate goal for treatment, as recommended by clinical guidelines and regulatory authorities.</p><p>"In this extended study we found no new unexpected safety concerns, so this is going to give physicians and patients much more confidence that the effect will last over time and that you won't have any loss of effect from the drug with use over multiple years," said Vasant Narasimhan, global head of pharmaceutical development at Novartis.</p><p>Until now, TNFs including Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel (etanercept), AbbVie Inc.'s Humira (adalimumab) and Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s Remicade (infliximab) have traditionally been the standard of care for psoriasis. But Cosentyx has raised the bar on efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis and is supported by clinical data showing it performed better than Amgen's Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor, Stelara (ustekinumab). </p><p>Cosentyx is a fully human immunosuppressive monoclonal antibody that inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reduces IL-17A mediated contributions to auto-immune and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. It became the first IL-17A inhibitor approved in Europe and the US In January 2015. In Europe, Cosentyx is the only first-line biologic approved for the systemic treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients. In the US, Cosentyx is approved as a treatment for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. In addition to the EU and the US, Cosentyx has been approved in Switzerland, Australia, Canada and a number of other countries for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and in Japan for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. </p><p>"We've already shown that Cosentyx is better than the anti-TNFs; it has a first-line label in Europe, and we're already seeing very strong uptake as the first biologic in markets around the world," Narasimhan said in an interview with <i>Scrip</i>. He declined to give sales details for the drug, saying those would be revealed at the company's third-quarter results presentation on Oct. 27. </p><p>Cosentyx is administered monthly by injection. "We think that's very convenient. We've found patients are compliant; they stay with their monthly subcutaneous dosing and they continue to maintain their almost clear skin three years out," he said. </p><p>Although it's the first of its class out of the gate commercially, there is a raft of other IL-17 inhibitors nearing the market: Eli Lilly & Co.'s ixekizumab is expected to be filed for US approval in the first half of 2015; Amgen Inc./AstraZeneca PLC's brodalumab is in Phase III studies and is expected to be submitted for US approval by Amgen in 2015. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is developing an interleukin-23 inhibitor tildrakizumab that is in Phase III trials in psoriasis.</p><p>Analysts have predicted Cosentyx will be a major success, with worldwide revenues of between $700m to $1bn annually seen by 2020. Projections include assumptions that the drug will obtain a broader range of indications beyond psoriasis.</p><p>That's the company's intention.</p><p>"We are focused on generating additional profile data in psoriasis but we're also expecting to receive approval next year in the US and Europe in treating ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). So we're really focused on building out the data on psoriasis and then expanding into other indications as broadly as we can," Narasimhan said.</p><p>Novartis is now exploring another rheumatological condition called non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, where patients don't show evidence of their disease when X-rayed. This lag in objective radiographic findings, combined with a lack of other reliable diagnostic biomarkers for axial SpA, can hamper early diagnosis and treatment in many patients. </p><p>"This is a patient population that has been underserved by current therapies so we're now initiating a Phase III program for Cosentyx in that indication. It's estimated that up to half of patients with spondyloarthropathies have this non-radiographic spondyloarthropathy where a physician can't confirm it on X-ray. Right now the programs we're running require a positive reading on an X-ray before initiating therapy, so this would be a nice label expansion as well," Narasimhan said.</p>
