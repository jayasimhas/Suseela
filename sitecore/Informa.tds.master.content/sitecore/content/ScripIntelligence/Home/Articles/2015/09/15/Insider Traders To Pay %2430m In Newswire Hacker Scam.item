<p>A Ukrainian firm and its CEO have agreed to pay $30m to settle charges they profited from trading on insider information they received from not-yet-public press releases, which contained information about public companies' quarterly and yearend earnings, financial performances and potential mergers and acquisitions, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Sept. 14.</p><p>The press releases came from three newswire services &ndash; Marketwired, PR Newswire and Business Wire &ndash; which had been hacked into by two Ukrainian men in the largest known computer hacking and securities fraud scheme in American history.</p><p>The two hackers are still on the loose &ndash; with some doubts they will ever be caught.</p><p>The SEC, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Makers-Betting-The-Farm-On-Others-Cybersecurity-359920" target="_new">which first revealed the plot on Aug. 11</a>, said the insider traders allegedly garnered more than $100m in illegal profits over five years from getting early looks at the information in the press releases before they were made public.</p><p>The SEC said many as 150,000 press releases were stolen, although only 800 were used to make illegal stock trades.</p><p>Two of the 34 defendants who took part in the scam, Jaspen Capital Partners and its CEO Andriy Supranonok, agreed to return $30m of their allegedly ill-gotten gains, although they did not admit to being guilty of any of the allegations.</p><p>"Today's settlement demonstrates that even those beyond our borders who trade on stolen nonpublic information and use complex instruments in an attempt to avoid detection will ultimately be caught," declared Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's Enforcement Division.</p><p>Nonetheless, the newswire hack scam is an example of how drug manufacturers and other firms often have no <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Makers-Betting-The-Farm-On-Others-Cybersecurity-359920" target="_new">control to prevent a cyber attack</a> of their information when they put it into the hands of others.</p><p><p><p><p>
