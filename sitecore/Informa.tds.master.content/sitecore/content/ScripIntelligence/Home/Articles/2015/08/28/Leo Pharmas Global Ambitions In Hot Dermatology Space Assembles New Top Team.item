<p><p>Restructuring the top management team at Denmark's Leo Pharma to reflect the diversity of its markets and customers will begin the next stage of the dermatology specialist's transformation into a global company focused on dermatological disorders and patients, according to its president and CEO Gitte Aabo.</p><p><p>Leo also is awaiting US approval of <i>Enstilar</i>, a new psoriasis-fighting foam formulation of calcipotriene and betamethasone propionate which it intends to launch there first to strengthen its business in the US after the loss of market exclusivity to <i>Taclonex</i> (calcipotriene/betamethasone) ointment, which led to a 21% decline in US sales in 2014. Enstilar is expected to obtain FDA approval later this year for treating psoriasis vulgaris, a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, with a US launch at the end of the year or early next year. The treatment also has been submitted for marketing approval in Europe for the same condition.</p><p><p>The mid-sized European pharma company announced Sept. 1 that its three geographic heads will be elevated to the top management team &ndash; Barbara Osborne, executive vice president of the US region; Lars Minor, interim executive vice president of the European region, and Joergen Damsbo Andersen, executive vice president of the international region. They will join Aabo and Kim Kjoeller, executive vice president of global R&D, who previously was senior vice president of global development, and a new head of global finance, IT and Legal, who will be announced soon.</p><p><p>Leo also is reorganizing certain functions into global teams that will report to Aabo, with Annette Sylvest Nielsen being appointed senior vice president of global people and communications; Jim McPherson remaining senior vice president of global product supply; Duncan Ferguson being appointed senior vice president of patient solutions and strategic marketing, and Patrice Baudry becoming senior vice president of global strategy and business development.</p><p><p>The long-serving former executive vice president of global sales and marketing, Lars Olsen, is to become chairman of Leo Pharma's owners, the Leo Foundation. Jukka Pertola, Leo Pharma's deputy chairman, will move up to become chairman of the Danish company. The changes will follow the retirement of 40-year-company veteran Poul Rasmussen at the end of 2015, who is currently chairman of both Leo Pharma and the Leo Foundation. The Foundation supports Leo Pharma and provides grants for research in medicine, chemistry and pharmacy.</p><p><p>The top team now includes non-Danes and a mix of executives who have been at Leo Pharma for only a short time and others who have long-term company experience, Aabo said in an interview Sept. 2. It is the next stage in a transformational process that started in 2009 when Leo primarily was a northern Europe-focused company.</p><p><p>The middle of 2015 saw Leo achieve the latest in a series of objectives it set for itself some time ago: the medical biophotonic device to treat acne, <i>Kleresca</i>, was launched in the UK, bringing to five the number of dermatology conditions in which it has launched new products. The other diseases are psoriasis, actinic keratosis, skin infections and eczema.</p><p><h2>Interested In Product Acquisitions</h2><p>Leo also has established a presence in countries like the US, Brazil, Russia and China over the past six years. "In a relatively short time, we have established Leo in 61 countries," Aabo said. The company is keen to use its expanded infrastructure to market other dermatological products, or to partner on the development of such products by biotech companies. Earlier this year, it secured a preclinical antibody for inflammatory skin disease from arGEN-X.</p><p><p>Still, the diversity among patients and other stakeholders including payers, doctors and patient caregivers around the world was one of the primary drivers of the executive reorganization. "In order to address that diversity, we need to have top management discussing issues in local markets, and that's why we elevated our three geographic region heads into the senior management team," Aabo explained. "For example, the internet plays a significant role in sales and marketing in Russia in a way that is certainly not the case in Europe."</p><p><p>Aabo also wanted to reduce the internal complexity of Leo in order to free up time to discuss markets and products &ndash; dermatological diseases like psoriasis usually are diagnosed in patients' teenage years when peer pressure is important, and the company needs to provide answers to a whole range of issues that come up, like the concomitant use of cosmetics, for example.</p><p><p>The Danish company believes that understanding patients' needs much better than in the past should reap dividends: it has developed a gel formulation and applicator for <i>Daivobet</i> (calcipotriene/betamethasone) that partly arose out of discussions with patients. An applicator can reach psoriatic plaques on the scalp without making a mess of the hair, unlike other formulations. Also, spouses often apply lotions and ointments, and were unhappy with getting the products on their hands, Aabo noted.</p><p><p>The potential growth of the dermatology market has not been missed by other companies. Spain&rsquo;s Almirall reorganized its business to focus on the therapeutic area a year ago . And new compounds, like Novartis's interleukin-17 inhibitor <i>Cosentyx</i> (secukinumab), launched in the US earlier this year, are targeting the disease area. There also are biosimilar TNF-inhibitors in development that could reduce the cost of therapy with biologics.</p><p><p>But Aabo believes that Leo's topical products still will be used alongside the new biologic therapies. The competitors are increasing disease awareness and underlining the seriousness of diseases like psoriasis, potentially growing the market, she noted.</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in </i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/?pub=The%20Pink%20Sheet%20Daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers</i>.</p><p><p>
