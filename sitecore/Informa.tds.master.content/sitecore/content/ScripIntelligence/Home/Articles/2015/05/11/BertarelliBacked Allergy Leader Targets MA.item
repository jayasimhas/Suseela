<p><p>The CEO of the newly merged Stallergenes Greer PLC says he is looking for business development opportunities, and certain actions should be expected "this year and, if not, in 2016."</p><p><p>Stallergenes Greer now accounts for 32% of the $1bn global allergy immunotherapy (AIT) market, the largest of any company, and it expects to bring the "next generation of allergy products and technologies to the market, driven by R&D and business development," said chairman and CEO Fereydoun Firouz in a Nov. 5 analysts' briefing. </p><p><p>"We are looking for accretive and bolt-on acquisitions, and will focus on the US and EU markets and products in adjacent markets like dermatology, ophthalmology and diagnostics," Firouz said. "We are also looking for innovative assets in development, that is new treatment paradigms and small molecules, oral vaccines, synthetic peptides and food allergies."</p><p><p>Potential targets for the newly enlarged allergy company are not particularly numerous, with the <i>Pharmaprojects</i> database containing details of the following companies with products in development:</p><p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Company</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Leading Products</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Stage Of Development</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ALK-Abello</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><i>Grazax</i> grass allergy SLIT and SCIT tablets</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Allergopharma</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pollen, house dust mite SLIT and SCIT tablets</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>HAL Allergy</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Allergenic SLIT, SCIT tablets</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Allergy Therapeutics</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><i>Pollinex Quattro</i> tree, grass allergy tablets</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Laboratorios Leti</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>House dust mite vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Circassia Holdings Ltd.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Cat allergy vaccine SCIT</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Anergis SA</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><i>AllerT</i> fast-acting SCIT</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>DBV Technologies SA</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Peanut allergy vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Immunomic Therapeutics, Inc./Astellas</p><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ASP4070 Japanese red Cedar pollen <i>LAMP-vax</i></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><p>SLIT = sublingual immunotherapy tablet; SCIT = subcutaneous immunotherapy tablet. Source: Informa PLC&rsquo;s Pharmaprojects database.</p></table></p><p><p><p>The merger of France's Stallergenes and the US's Greer Laboratories, to form a new UK-based but EuroNext Paris-listed public company, Ares Holdings PLC, was completed on Sept. 8, 2015, having been announced on March 3, 2015. Investment companies associated with the Bertarelli family, the former owners of Swiss biotech Serono, had majority stakes in both companies, and Ares Life Sciences, the family's life sciences investment vehicle, now owns 83.9% of the new merged company. Shareholder approval to change the name of the company from Ares Holdings to Stallergenes Greer was received Oct. 27.</p><p>Firouz, a former president and CEO of Merck Serono US, said he wanted to accelerate revenue growth and improve profit margins using the broader resources of Stallergenes Greer that now include company infrastructure in both Europe and the US, a broad R&D pipeline, and the largest global manufacturing capacity for allergens and finished AIT products that include oral and sublingual tablets, subcutaneous injections, diagnostics and allergen extracts. There are two operational units, in Cambridge, MA, and in Paris, France.</p><p><p>A mid- to long-term objective is to widen the availability of the sublingual <i>Oralair</i> tablet for grass allergies to countries including China, Japan, Russia and Australia, and to expand Oralair's label in countries where it is marketed.</p><p><p>Firouz highlighted in particular the potential of the US market, where allergen extracts are used in preference to AIT, and the country accounts for only 11% of the anti-allergy market by value, compared with Europe that accounts for 78%. There are 6 million patients globally with allergies, and 52% of those live in the US, he added.</p><p><p>"We need to improve the marketing of Oralair, and to focus on high potential prescribers, not necessarily allergists," Firouz commented. Oralair was launched in the US in 2014 but had a lukewarm reception by allergists, who still prefer to make up their own allergy shots. "Are we happy with our penetration in allergy patients? No," Firouz told analysts. </p><p><p>"There is a significant unmet need with around 50% of US patients discontinuing their subcutaneous AIT therapy. We need to enhance patient and prescriber awareness of sublingual Oralair," Firouz said.</p><p><p>Stallergenes Greer's R&D pipeline for allergic rhinitis includes: STAGR 320, a house dust mite (HDM) product that is in Phase III in the EU and US and marketed in Japan (by licensee Shionogi), STAGR 120, a Japanese cedar allergy product in Phase II in Japan, and STAGR SAIL, a ragweed allergy product in Phase III in the US, with an approval submission in the US expected to be made in the first half of 2016. STAGR 320 is also in Phase II in both the EU and US for the treatment of allergic asthma, although in a recent study the HDM product did not meet its primary endpoint in allergic asthma patients, and the company is discussing how to proceed in the indication. </p><p><p><p>
