<p>An FDA panel on 19 March backed the use of GlaxoSmithKline's Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) as a once-daily inhaled treatment for asthma in adults, but said the medicine was not ready for primetime in adolescents with the disease.</p><p>GSK&rsquo;s partner on Breo, Theravance, took an 11% hit in after-hours trading on 19 March. But GSK&rsquo;s shares were only slightly dinged, with the stock losing 30 cents.</p><p>Breo Ellipta &ndash; a combination of fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol, a long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonist (LABA) &ndash; already is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKTheravance-US-Breo-win-pleases-investors-343079" target="_new">approved</a> in the US to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>But GSK is seeking to broaden the use of the drug in asthma in adults and adolescents.</p><p>At the joint meeting of the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committees, panelists voted 16-4 in favor of Breo's approval in adults and 18-2 against marketing the drug for adolescents &ndash; a vote that went pretty much as analysts from Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Adolescents-FDAs-greatest-concern-for-GSKs-Breo-in-asthma-357343" target="_new">predicted</a> earlier in the week.</p><p>Panelist Dr James Tracy, an assistant clinical professor of internal medicine at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Nebraska, who voted to support Breo's use in the adolescent population, however, said he actually "hit the wrong button," and really meant to give it a thumbs down.</p><p>Another panelist, Dr Geoffrey Rosenthal, executive director of critical care services at the University of Maryland Medical Center, who voted against approval in adults, said he would have preferred a "meh" option.</p><p>"If any of you are treating me, just give me Advair," he said, referring to another of GSK&rsquo;s drugs.</p><p>Regulators actually held a series of votes on Breo. </p><p>The committee voted 18-2 the efficacy data provided substantial evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit for Breo in adults with asthma.</p><p>But the panel voted 16-4 in declaring the efficacy data were not sufficient in adolescents. </p><p>Dr Sally Seymour, the deputy director for safety in the FDA's Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products, noted that GSK did not need to show "substantial" evidence of efficacy in the adolescent group, because the agency relies on the adult data to judge whether that standard has been met. </p><p>Companies, nonetheless, must demonstrate there is a "sufficient" benefit in patients younger than 18 years, Dr Seymour said.</p><p>The panel voted 17-3 GSK's data adequately demonstrated Breo was safe in adults. But in a 19-1 vote, the committee said safety was not adequately shown in adolescents.</p><p>Some on the committee said they didn't buy the argument it was difficult to recruit teenagers for clinical testing.</p><p>"Asthma is a prevalent disease. You can find kids for this study," Dr Rosenthal contended.</p><p>Several expressed concern about extrapolating the adult data to the younger population. </p><p>"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and extrapolation is not something I feel comfortable doing," said panelist Dr Mark Dykewicz, chief of allergy and immunology at St Louis University in Missouri.</p><p>"It seems very burdensome, but it seems like we need to have a full efficacy and safety study in [the adolescent] population before I would feel comfortable," said panelist Dr Judith Kramer, a professor emeritus of medicine at Duke University.</p><p>While the committee was supportive of approval for Breo in asthma patients 18 years or older, a majority of the panelists called for the FDA to require a large LABA safety study in all patients 12 years or older &ndash; voting 13-7 on the mandate for the adult population and 17-2, with one non-vote, in adolescents.</p><p>The non-vote was due to one of the panelists departing the meeting before the final question.</p><p><b>The LABA concern</b></p><p>The FDA has been concerned for nearly two decades about the potential for serious asthma exacerbations in patients using LABAs. </p><p>The agency in February 2010 told makers of those drugs they needed to revise their labeling to include a contraindication for the use of LABAs without an asthma control medication; a recommendation to use fixed-dose ICS plus LABA combination in pediatric and adolescent patients; and alert to assess asthma control and consider step-down therapy. </p><p>Like the other LABAs, Breo's COPD labeling carries the black-box warning about an increased risk of asthma-related deaths.</p><p>To evaluate the safety of LABAs when added to ICS, the FDA required manufacturers of the currently marketed products in that class approved for asthma to conduct postmarketing controlled safety trials of the drugs, which include GSK's Advair (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol), AstraZeneca's Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate) and Merck's Dulera (mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate dihydrate) and Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol).</p><p>While the design of the randomized, double-blind, 26-week, active-controlled clinical trials comparing ICS/LABA products and ICS drugs to evaluate the risk of serious asthma outcomes, such as hospitalization, intubation and death, in 11,700 adults and adolescents 12 years or older with persistent asthma, was "harmonized," the results will be reviewed independently.</p><p>The companies, however, will share the joint oversight steering and data monitoring committees.</p><p>The FDA had set June 2017 as the deadline to report the data, but regulators noted progress of the studies has varied. </p><p>GSK also has an additional requirement for a pediatric safety trial because it has the only ICS plus LABA combination product approved for asthma in children 4-11 years &ndash; Advair Diskus. </p><p>"It troubles me there's a trial in 4 to 11-year-olds, but not one in 12 to 17-year-olds," said panelist Dr John Connett, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. </p><p>Even though the FDA panel had recommended the need for separate LABA testing for Breo, several threw in a caveat that if the pending studies have positive outcomes, they would change their advice to declare such a trial for GSK&rsquo;s new drug was not necessary.</p><p>Duke's Dr Kramer wondered whether the FDA should even be considering bringing another LABA to the market when there remains uncertainty about the safety of the drugs. </p><p>She also suggested Breo may not be the same as other LABAs, and therefore, "we need to know the safety of this particular product."</p><p>Dr Kramer insisted that requiring GSK to also conduct a safety trial for Breo could have a silver lining if it turns out it does not show a risk of asthma-related deaths.</p><p>"If in fact the drug is different, then we really need to question the whole assumption that all LABAs get the same black-box warning automatically," she said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
