<p>Roche's atezolizumab, an anti-PDL1 treatment, shrinks tumors in people with a specific type of bladder cancer, according to data from the IMvigor 210 study. Roche highlighted atezolizumab at an analyst event on 31 May 2015, ahead of the annual ASCO meeting in Chicago. The company believes atezolizumab has the potential to provide a transformative benefit to a broad patient population either as a monotherapy or via combinations.</p><p>Atezolizumab (also known as MPDL3280A) is designed to target PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, preventing it from binding to PD-1 on the surface of T cells. By inhibiting PD-L1, atezolizumab may enable the activation of T cells.</p><p>All of Roche's studies of atezolizumab include the evaluation of an investigational IHC test that uses the antibody SP142 to measure PD-L1 expression on both tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells. The goal of PD-L1 as a biomarker is to identify those people most likely to benefit from atezolizumab as a monotherapy, and to determine which people may benefit most from a combination of atezolizumab and another medicine. </p><p>The push towards precision medicine perfectly suits Roche's complementary strengths in diagnostics and pharmaceuticals. "The value of understanding patient responses using biomarkers, and then using those biomarkers to help understand what combinations to use, is really critical and very, very exciting," Ira Mellman, vice president of cancer immunology at Roche's Genentech division said at the 31 May meeting. </p><p>There are 11 ongoing or planned Phase III studies of atezolizumab across certain kinds of lung, kidney, breast and bladder cancer.</p><p>The latest data showed atezolizumab shrank tumors (objective response rate, ORR, the primary end point of this Phase II study) in people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) who had progressed on initial treatment (second-line or later). High amounts of PD-L1 expression by a person's cancer correlated with increased response to the medicine. Adverse events were consistent with what has been previously observed for atezolizumab. </p><p>Last year, the US FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for atezolizumab in people whose metastatic bladder cancer expressed PD-L1.</p><p><b>about IMvigor 210</b></p><p>IMvigor 210 is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm Phase II study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in people with locally advanced or metastatic UBC, regardless of PD-L1 expression. People in the study were enrolled into one of two cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of people who had received no prior therapies for locally advanced or metastatic UBC, but who were ineligible for first-line cisplatin-based therapy; results from this cohort are not yet mature. Cohort 2, the latest data, included people whose disease progressed during or following previous treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (second-line or later). </p><p>People received a 1200mg intravenous dose of atezolizumab on day one of 21-day cycles until progressive disease (Cohort 1) or loss of clinical benefit (Cohort 2). The primary endpoint of the study was ORR. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.</p><p>In addition to the IMvigor 210 study, Roche has an ongoing randomized Phase III study, IMvigor 211, comparing atezolizumab with standard-of-care chemotherapy in people who have relapsed UBC, and a planned Phase III study, IMvigor 010, that will evaluate atezolizumab compared with observation in people with early-stage muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are selected for PD-L1 expression and are at risk for recurrence (adjuvant).</p><p>All studies include the evaluation of a companion test developed by Roche Diagnostics to determine PD-L1 status.</p><p>Metastatic urothelial bladder cancer is associated with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. It is a disease that has seen no major advancements for nearly 30 years. </p><p><b>recent lung data</b></p><p>Roche reported encouraging results at ASCO from a Phase Ib study of atezolizumab in combination with a range of platinum-based chemotherapy combinations commonly used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study showed that atezolizumab shrank tumors (ORR) in 67% (20/30) of people with advanced NSCLC when combined with chemotherapy. The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy was well tolerated and no unexpected toxicities were reported. </p><p>"This result indicates that combinations may provide a way to extend the benefits of atezolizumab to a wider range of people, including those with low levels of PD-L1 expression," said Dr Sandra Horning, Roche's chief medical officer and head of global product development.</p>
