<p>A White House-led effort to curb the use of heroin, for which the Obama administration is pumping millions of dollars, could be a boon for a tiny Virginia-based pharmaceutical firm that makes the only FDA-approved naloxone product intended for immediate administration in an emergency situation.</p><p>The firm, privately held Kaléo, markets Evzio, a single-use compact autoinjector prefilled with naloxone, an opioid antagonist indicated to rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdose, including respiratory or central nervous system depression.</p><p>The FDA's approval last year of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Evzio-take-home-naloxone-autoinjector-for-opioids-rescue-351040" target="_new">Evzio</a> was somewhat controversial, given the agency had just months earlier given its blessing to put the first single-entity, extended-release hydrocodone pill on the US market, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zogenix-soars-on-FDA-Zohydro-OK-1st-single-entity-hydrocodone-347647" target="_new">Zohydro</a>, which Zogenix agreed in March to sell to Pernix Therapeutics.</p><p>Evzio is intended as a take-home product in situations where opioids may be present and it is widely used by law enforcement and community organizations throughout the U.S.</p><p>Under the White House's Heroin Response Strategy, which consists of a new collaborative network of public health and safety partnerships in 15 states, the product will be distributed under rapid public health responses when alerts go out about dangerous batches of heroin or when other heroin-related threats are reported. </p><p>The White House, which said heroin has emerged as a serious threat to multiple regions of the US, said the initiative will provide training to first responders about how to use the naloxone auto-injector.</p><p>Kaléo noted that a unique feature of Evzio is that it has a battery-operated electronic voice instruction system intended to help guide the user through each step of the injection.</p><p>Kaléo has not disclosed its total sales from Evzio, which it also makes available to some law enforcement agencies through a donation program. </p><p>In addition to Evzio, the firm also markets an emergency compact auto-injector epinephrine treatment, known as Auvi-Q, for life-threatening allergic reactions in people who are at risk or have a history of anaphylaxis, which gained the FDA's nod in August 2012.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
