<p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count, according to an early release guideline from the World Health Organization (WHO). This could mean certain HIV medicines see increased use, particularly single-tablet regimens.</p><p>The recommendation is based on evidence from clinical trials and observational studies released since 2013 showing that earlier use of ART results in better clinical outcomes for people living with HIV compared with delayed treatment. </p><p>The WHO also now recommends the use of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches. This is based on clinical trial results confirming the efficacy of the ARV drug tenofovir for use as PrEP to prevent people from acquiring HIV in a wide variety of settings and populations, said the WHO.</p><p>The news will not come as a surprise in the US, the largest market for HIV drugs, according to Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock. "US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines already recommend initiating HIV treatment irrespective of CD4 count, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines already recommend PrEP for persons at high risk of HIV infection," he tells <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>But the news is more significant in Europe. "EACS (European AIDS Clinical Society) guidelines still only recommend initiating treatment in patients whose CD4 count has dropped <350 cells/&micro;l,"="" notes="" haydock.="" "european="" guidelines="" now="" disagree="" with="" both="" us="" and="" who=""></350></p><p>However, he believes an upcoming update to European guidelines will see the CD4 count cut-off dropped or abolished to bring them in line with the US and WHO.</p><p>Haydock also says the HIV medicines that could see increased use following the WHO's latest update are the single-tablet regimens such as Stribild, Atripla, Complera and Triumeq, "as these are most commonly prescribed to patients at first-line therapy."</p><p>The recommendation for PrEP could also impact European practices because there does not appear to be clear consensus yet among EU countries on whether PrEP should be routinely used. "EACS don't mention it and the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) hasn't issued a formal recommendation as it was waiting for trial evidence released this year," says Haydock. "The evidence suggests that it its very effective at preventing HIV transmission but the two resistors of implementing it are the cost and whether it encourages more risky sexual behaviors."</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare conducted a survey earlier in 2015 to gauge the percentage of physicians who agree with initiating therapy irrespective of CD4 count in each market. </p><p>In the US, where the guideline already suggests that recommend initiating HIV treatment irrespective of CD4 count, 97% of physicians agreed with initiating treatment in any patient who was willing to be treated, irrespective of CD4 count or viral load. This was echoed in France, where national guidelines recommend treatment irrespective of CD4 count &ndash; unlike broader EU guidelines.</p><p>However, in countries such as Germany, Italy and the UK, which follow European guidelines, only around half of physicians agreed with initiating therapy irrespective of CD4 count.</p><p>The WHO said its latest recommendations would form part of the revised consolidated guidelines on the use of ARV drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection to be published by WHO in 2016. "The full update of the guidelines will consist of comprehensive clinical recommendations together with revised operational and service delivery guidance to support implementation," said a statement on its website.</p><p>The target audience for this guideline is primarily national HIV program managers, said the WHO.</p><p>The two recommendations were being made available on an early-release basis "because of their potential to significantly reduce the number of people acquiring HIV infection and dying from HIV-related causes," said the WHO. "By publishing these recommendations as soon as possible, WHO aims to help countries to anticipate their implications in a timely fashion and begin the dialogue necessary to ensure that national standards of HIV prevention and treatment are keeping pace with important scientific developments."</p>
