<p> The Gavi global vaccine alliance has successfully concluded its second replenishment conference, securing the $7.5bn that it was targeting from donors including more than 20 countries, the European Commission and private sector partners and foundations including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. </p> <p> Together with $2bn in already assured resources, the vaccine alliance will be able to meet the $9.5bn cost of funding vaccine programs in developing countries over the 2016-2020 period, Gavi announced. it said that this would enable countries to immunize an additional 300 children, preventing 5-6 million premature deaths and yielding economic benefits worth $80-100bn through productivity gains and savings in treatment and transportation costs and caretaker wages. </p> <p> The conference, hosted in Berlin by the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, saw several companies make pledges to Gavi for the first time. China pledged $5m, meaning that all BRICS countries are now contributing financially. The other new donors were Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which committed $3m, $10m and $25m, respectively. Developing countries themselves also increased their financial contributions to childhood immunization: Gavi expects these implementing countries to allocate $1.2bn to Gavi-supported programs in addition to the donor funding. </p> <p> The second replenishment has seen donor pledges rise from the $4.3bn committed in 2011, which brought the total resources for 2011-15 to $7.4bn. </p> <p> The biggest single donors this time were the UK, which added $1.57bn to the $770m previously committed to bring its total up to $2.34bn; the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which contributed $1.55bn, Norway with $1.02bn, the US with $800m and Germany with $720m. the European Commission is contributing $240m. </p> <p> Before the conference, vaccine manufacturers also made pledges on pricing and special access for companies that graduate from Gavi support as their economies improve (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Vaccine-makers-make-new-concessions-in-immunization-drive-356419">scripintelligence.com, 28 January 2014</a> ). </p>
