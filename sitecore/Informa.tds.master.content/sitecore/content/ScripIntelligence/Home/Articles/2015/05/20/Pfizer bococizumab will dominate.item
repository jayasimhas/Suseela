<p><p>Pfizer says its PCSK9 inhibitor could be the market leader in the space, despite a late entry behind candidates from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi, with a clinical program that shows the drug is lowering cholesterol levels in the broadest range of patients. </p><p>"In the SPIRE1 trial, which has 17,000 patients with a baseline LDL-cholesterol level between 70 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL, we believe in that study we are going to reach LDL levels well beyond what's achievable on lipid-lowering therapy today. We believe we are going to get to LDL levels that haven't been shown before in clinical trials. We are testing the hypothesis to see how low can you go where you'll see a continued reduction in cardiovascular events," said Pfizer's David DeMicco, VP of cardiovascular and metabolic, global medical affairs. </p><p>SPIRE1 is one of two cardiovascular outcomes studies that Pfizer is conducting to test the safety and efficacy of bococizumab. The trial is expected to be completed in April 2018, preceded by a few months by the second CV outcomes study SPIRE2, which is testing the drug in a patient population with LDL-cholesterol levels greater than 100 mg/dL. </p><p>The CV outcomes trials will readout in the same time period as those being conducted by competitors; Amgen's FOURIER study will be completed February 2018 and Regeneron/Sanofi's ODYSSEY will readout in January 2018. Yet, Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent (alirocumab) are both expected to gain FDA approval this summer. Pfizer is undeterred and believes its bococizumab will outshine both drugs and become the market leader once all three drugs are approved. </p><p>"History tells us that being first to market doesn't always translate into being the market leader," said DeMicco. "When you think about the rich history Pfizer has in the CV space; Lipitor was the fifth statin to market, and more recently Eliquis was the third novel, oral anticoagulant to market. What we believe is that the strength of the data that we are building through the SPIRE program will show the value and the differentiation of bococizumab compared to the other agents."</p><p>Analysts at Sagient's BioMedTracker don&rsquo;t agree. They estimate peak US sales of Repatha and Praluent at 5.1 bn each, while they place peak US sales for bococizumab at $3.4bn. BioMedTracker places the chance of approval for bococizumab at 50%, 3% above the average for the disease group.</p><p><h2>A broader patient population</h2><p>Pfizer's assumptions about its place as market leader are based on the broad patient population in its late-stage clinical program. Both competitors are conducting CV outcomes studies that include patients with LDL-cholesterol greater than 70 mg/dL, while SPIRE separates the more severe patients into a second study. </p><p>"What we are trying to do in this high risk population is really elucidate whether lowering LDL is going to prevent cardiovascular events. In our Phase III program we are including patients who already have established CV disease, a few have other complications including diabetes or chronic kidney disease. This is one of the key differences with our program from competitors is that we're studying our drug in a broader, high-risk population," said DeMicco. </p><p>While all three drugs seem to have amazing efficacy and few safety concerns &ndash; although there has been some worry about neurocognitive issues &ndash; the market leader may ultimately be determined by price. Each of these three drugs is administered via injection every two weeks, but come in different dosages. Repatha is administered biweekly at 140mg or once monthly at 420mg, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">while Praluent will be offered</a> at 75mg and 150mg every other week and bococizumab is being tested at a dose of 150mg. </p><p>The different dosages will allow the companies to better compete on price &ndash; although none of the companies have revealed how much they will charge for their drug. Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges estimates that Praluent will be priced at $5,000 for the low dose and $10,000 for the high dose, while he expects both doses of Repatha to be priced at $10,000. </p><p>Payers have <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">already expressed concerns</a> about how these drugs &ndash; if they are high priced &ndash; could put strain on the system due to the large patient population. Pfizer estimates that that there are 21m patients that are statin intolerant or not controlling their cholesterol with a statin alone in the US, five largest EU markets and Japan. The patient population for the PCSK9 inhibitors is likely to be larger considering there are more than 15m Americans who have high cholesterol. </p><p>DeMicco adds that Pfizer is already in discussion with payers "to determine the appropriate patient population." </p><p>The first test for the class will be on 09 and 10 June when Repatha and Praluent face an FDA advisory meeting that will likely <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">question the safety</a> of the drugs. </p><p><p>
