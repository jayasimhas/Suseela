<p>Top-line results from Vanda Pharmaceuticals' Phase II study of tradipitant as a monotherapy in the treatment of chronic pruritus (itch) in atopic dermatitis show that it failed to meet the primary endpoint. Tradipitant, formerly known as VLY-686, is a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist. The pre-specified primary endpoint of the Phase II study was the change from baseline on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for itch. According to Vanda, "due to high placebo effect," there was no significant difference from placebo on this pre-specified endpoint. However, Vanda believes this proof of concept study was informative, in that through subsequent analyses, it has discovered an exposure response relationship and further observed a significant and clinically meaningful response across several pruritus related outcomes evaluated in individuals with higher blood plasma levels of tradipitant. "This is not unexpected given that all the assessments related to pruritus are significantly associated with the itch sensation the patient is experiencing at that time," said the Washington, DC-based firm. Based on the data Vanda examined across the study, lower blood plasma levels of tradipitant may be below a threshold of efficacy to ameliorate the itch sensation in patients. "Additional studies may be required to further confirm these findings," it concluded.</p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-One-deal-ends-for-Vanda-Novartis-five-new-agreements-begin-355824" target="_new">BioNotebook: One deal ends for Vanda, Novartis; five new agreements begin</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Vandas-Hetlioz-for-sleep-disorder-in-blind-349741" target="_new">FDA OK's Vanda&rsquo;s Hetlioz for sleep disorder in blind</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Vanda-raises-cash-in-anticipation-of-tasimelteon-approval-345700" target="_new">Vanda raises cash in anticipation of tasimelteon approval</a></p><p>
