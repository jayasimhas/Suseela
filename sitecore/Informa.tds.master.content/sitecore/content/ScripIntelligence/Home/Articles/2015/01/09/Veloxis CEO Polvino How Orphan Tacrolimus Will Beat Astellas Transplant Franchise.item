<p>Veloxis Pharmaceuticals A/S has received orphan drug designation from the US FDA for its recently approved extended release tacrolimus product <i>Envarsus XR</i>, a rare achievement for a product which contains a previously approved active ingredient. CEO William Polvino explains to <i>Scrip</i> why the tacrolimus-based Envarsus XR secured orphan drug status, and how it plans to compete with Astellas and its established tacrolimus franchise.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Tacrolimus has been around for a while, yet Envarsus XL garnered orphan drug status. How?</b></p><p><b><i>William Polvino</i>:</b> It is quite rare to receive an orphan drug exclusivity award when the active ingredient has previously been approved. Most times orphan drug exclusivity is awarded when you're approaching a brand new target disease that has never seen treatments before or you're using a brand new molecular entity. </p><p>In our case, we're working with tacrolimus in the transplant setting, so we don't really fit into either of those categories. We were awarded the exclusivity because of some features that are very unique about our product and about our approval. The product has dramatically reengineered the pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus in the blood. Where normally there are a lot of peaks and troughs, we figured out a way to deliver the product in an incredibly smooth, flat profile, and that means the dose can be reduced.</p><p>Also unique is that our approval is for a novel indication: for the conversion of people already on immediate release tacrolimus switching to a once a day therapy. These unique features ultimately led to us gaining the exclusivity award but it was by no means a certainty. </p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Why is a smooth PK profile such great news for patients?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: It's great news because it does a number of things, and I'll start with a simple one. Because of the way that the drug is engineered, you need less of a dose. It gets absorbed out of the GI tract much more efficiently. If you're on twice a day therapy, you can go to once a day therapy, a real advantage for patients that have a surprisingly difficult time with compliance. Roughly 20% to 30% of transplant patients, believe it or not, don't fully comply with the regimen. </p><p>And then we can look at other attributes. The normal PK curve with immediate release tacrolimus shows a rather significant peak in blood levels that occurs about an hour-and-a-half or two hours after dosing and we completely smashed that down so that our peak is about 30% to 40% lower and it occurs at six to eight hours after you've taken the dose. This means efficacy may be improved in important patient subgroups, most notably in black patients which make up a significant proportion of transplant patients. </p><p>The next benefit comes from the fact that the dips are bad because that is when you're at risk from rejection, but the peaks are also bad because we believe that it's those high blood levels that cause some of the very troubling side effects with tacrolimus, such as central nervous system toxicity. One of the most common manifestations is tremor, which occurs in 40% to 50% of patients who are receiving tacrolimus. When we put those patients on Envarsus, they had the benefits of a flatter profile and their tremors got significantly better. </p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Your biggest competition will come from Astellas' once daily product. How are you differentiating your product?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: The benefits that I described are versus twice daily <i>Prograf</i> (tacrolimus), but we've also studied it versus once daily <i>Astagraf XL</i>, or <i>Advagraf</i> in the UK, and even there you can see a reduction in our peak height and a delay in the time to peak so those benefits that I described are true whether you're talking about Astellas' twice daily or once daily. We are reporting this data at European Society of Transplant meeting coming up on Sep. 13 &ndash; Sep.16 in Brussels.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: What is the difference between the European and US label for Envarsus?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: There are some significant differences in the label. Most notably in Europe we're approved for use in both liver transplant and kidney transplant, and our product is being marketed and promoted to both kidney surgeons and liver surgeons. In the US our label only mentions kidney transplant patients, so we do not have an approved indication in liver.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Do you plan to pursue the liver indication in the US?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: Our product works really well in liver and clearly we're big believers in its safety and efficacy in liver transplant patients and that's why we're selling it in Europe. The challenge that we encounter is the challenge that faces almost all small start-up companies: it's the cost of developing the drug versus the commercial benefit. We have had a very clear response from the FDA: they want us to do a fairly sizeable study, probably a 300 or 400 patient study, in liver transplant patients. To do that study would cost us about $30m to $40m and require two or three years. We're 100% certain that we know the outcome but unfortunately it's a simple business decision about whether we will recoup that investment. We're not 100% certain it's the right decision because it comes up frequently when we talk about how to spend our R&D money and whether or not we should pursue formally a liver transplant indication in the US.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Meanwhile, Astellas' products also do not have the liver label in the US. Is that a coincidence?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: Astellas has the same label in Europe and the US as we do. I can't speak for Astellas, but it is public knowledge that when it initially filed for approval of its once a day product in the US, it was filed for both kidney and liver and it withdrew both NDA filings. Then at a later point in time it re-filed but for kidney only. </p><p>In our case it was simply because Europe believed that our data package was sufficiently complete to support use in liver and in the US the FDA wanted one more study from us.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: How is the launch progressing in Europe?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: It's going well. However, transplant drugs are tough. The product was launched in Germany just about a year ago and our partner Chiesi is responsible for commercialization throughout EU, Turkey and CIS. It was launched in Germany, followed by Holland, followed by UK and most recently Denmark. </p><p>There are a couple of things worth noting. Transplant drugs are a very high science promotion activity. The clinicians are extremely sophisticated, they understand pharmacokinetics, so our data package is quite appealing in that regard. The other thing is that these are very sick patients, so physicians are very slow to make a change if the patient is doing well, which is understandable. It's generally the patients having some form of difficulty, whether it be tremor, whether it be problems titrating, whether they need a bigger dose, if they're a black patient, that are the first ones to switch. So what you see in terms of commercial sales is that the ramp up is very slow initially, but it builds into a very nice profitability model. Once you're on the product you tend to stay on that product forever. </p><p>The one complicating factor that's occurred in Europe that no one could have predicted back when we did the deal with Chiesi, is the evolving economics in southern Europe over pricing etc. That's a tough struggle and clearly has not been a positive when talking about commercialization efforts. But in terms of what we're seeing out of the launch in the northern European countries, I'd say it's going well, it's going as projected, and as the territories expand and assuming that Chiesi is successful in pricing negotiations, and they're quite talented at this, we would expect to see a fairly normal ramp occurring which requires several years before you start seeing appreciable sales coming in.</p><p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: In the US, how are launch activities progressing?</b></p><p><b><i>WP</i></b>: Very well. We're at that busy stage of setting up commercial activities, primarily focusing on hiring and training our sales force, so this is a vigorous time for us in terms of expanding the size of the company and preparing to get out into the marketplace. </p><p>
