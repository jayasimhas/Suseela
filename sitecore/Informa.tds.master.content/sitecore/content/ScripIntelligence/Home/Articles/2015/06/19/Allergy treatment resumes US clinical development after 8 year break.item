<p>Allergy Therapeutics is ready to re-start clinical trials in the US with its Pollinex Quattro Grass allergy treatment, eight years after it was placed on clinical hold by the FDA, and three years after that hold was lifted. </p><p>"The clinical hold was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Allergy-share-price-drops-after-FDA-safety-concerns-in-Phase-III-35309" target="_new">introduced in 2007</a> following a reported adverse reaction after a trial had completed," the company told <i>Scrip</i>. "After <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Allergy-creeps-forward-hoping-rising-barrier-to-entry-will-repel-competition-324308" target="_new">the company's response</a> regarding the adverse event, the FDA conducted a broad review of the use of adjuvants in vaccines, which took some time to complete and involved other vaccines containing adjuvants. Following the conclusion of this review, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Allergy-seeks-partners-as-FDA-lifts-hold-on-pollen-vaccine-333536" target="_new">the hold was lifted</a>." </p><p>In the meantime, Allergy "battled through the clinical hold and an economic downturn in Europe, whilst building market share in its profitable Europe business," it said. "We reported double digit revenue growth in the March interims, despite EU markets remaining flat. We have an appetite to further expand our market share in Europe both organically and through M&A, as demonstrated by the [&euro;5.8m acquisition of Alerpharma] in Spain earlier this month. The company is planning to continue this approach."</p><p>Meanwhile, the company has submitted its clinical trial protocols to the FDA, and the Pollinex Quattro Grass trials are scheduled to start in September this year. In addition, Allergy has hired the CRO Inflamax Research, which specializes in mobile environmental exposure chambers (mECC), to run the studies. Following input on trial design from the FDA, the company will initially conduct a small safety study, immediately followed by a Phase IIb study this year, before progressing into a pivotal Phase III study in 2016.</p><p>If approved, Pollinex Quattro Grass could be the first subcutaneous seasonal allergy treatment to receive regulatory approval in the US, as well as being the company's first product to be approved for the US market. According to Allergy, the US allergy immunotherapy market is estimated to be around $2bn.</p><p>In March this year, Allergy raised &pound;20m to fund the final phase of US development of Pollinex Quattro Grass through to FDA regulatory approval.</p><p>The company anticipates that it will submit a biological license application (BLA) for Pollinex Quattro Grass in 2018, assuming the successful completion of the remaining clinical development program. </p><p>"We will then evaluate whether to partner the product or seek alternative options, including building our own commercial infrastructure. We have significant expertise in running sales and marketing infrastructures across Europe where we sell our products. When the hold was lifted, we did initiate a partnering process but, although there were interested parties, there were none with the right deals."</p><p>"The US now poses a real opportunity for us to become the first US FDA approved short-course seasonal allergy vaccine," the company noted. The other main players in the market are Stallergenes and Alk-Abello (partnered with Merck) which have launched sublingual treatments this year (Oralair and Grastek and Ragwitek). These are the first FDA approved treatments for allergy in the US but require tablets to be taken daily, notes Allergy.</p><p>"We have funding for the development of Pollinex Quattro Grass (&pound;20m raised in March), but there is also Pollinex Quattro Ragweed and Tree in clinical development, which were again put on the same clinical hold, so there is a platform for more products to add to the pipeline," the company continued. "The advantage of the Pollinex Quattro vaccine is its ultra-short course treatment plan &ndash; 4 injections per year &ndash; initially being for just one year in the US but we will be doing a two year follow up study to test efficacy into the second year. The only other company to have a subcutaneous vaccine is Circassia but their lead candidate is for cat allergy, therefore it is a perennial treatment, not a seasonal one."</p><p>According to Allergy, the US is a subcutaneous market "and vaccines have historically been tailor made by compounding allergists," meaning there has been no regulation and no GMP manufacturing facilities.</p><p>"This is an exciting time in the US immunotherapy market," claims the company. "There is a niche opportunity to make a global franchise and there are very few players well positioned to take advantage of that."</p>
