<p>Nothing unites sometime-adversaries like an issue that threatens to drain money from both sides. In this case, brand-name and generic drug makers have come together to fight a first-of-its-kind US ordinance in Alameda County, California that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to design, implement and pay for a program to collect and dispose of unused prescription pills.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Alameda County Safe Drug Disposal Ordinance, which they say is unfair and unlike any other drug disposal law in North America. </p><p>The industry organizations want to stop the county from enforcing its ordinance starting in mid-2013 before other local or state governments adopt similar requirements.</p><p>Alameda County Board of Supervisors president Nate Miley spearheaded the ordinance to prevent accidental and intentional overdoses and to keep discarded medicines from contaminating groundwater when pills are flushed down toilets or left in landfills (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Local-drug-disposal-may-kill-small-biotechs-says-BIO-as-Bay-area-county-votes-in-favour-327742" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 March 2012</a>). The board of supervisors approved the ordinance in July and the pharma industry lawsuit was filed in early December.</p><p>"Given the novel nature of the ordinance as the first of its kind nationally, and the important public purposes that it serves, the county is prepared to have the ordinance tested in a court of law," Mr Miley told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Alameda County is in the San Francisco Bay Area and includes the cities of Oakland and Pleasanton, where several life science firms are headquartered, but the county's ordinance affects biotechnology and pharma companies around the globe.</p><p>PhRMA executive vice-president and general counsel James "Mit" Spears said that PhRMA, BIO and GPhA do not oppose drug take-back programs, such as those organized on specific days by local governments, law enforcement agencies or municipal waste authorities to collect unused medications. </p><p>"If the government decides this is how they want to spend their tax dollars, it's their call, but the Alameda program is fundamentally different. It wants the prescription drug industry to design, implement, manage and fund a program," Mr Spears said.</p><p>The industry's two basic problems with the Alameda law are: 1) the requirement for pharma companies to design and implement a drug disposal program that does not hold the local government or the county's businesses responsible; and 2) the shifting of waste disposal costs from the government to pharma companies without a means for recouping the cost.</p><p>In writing their ordinance, Alameda County officials studied a law in the Canadian province of British Columbia that requires drug manufacturers to pay for a disposal program in which unused pills are collected at pharmacies. The difference between the Alameda and British Columbia requirements, Mr Spears said, is that pharma companies do not run the Canadian program and the province allows manufacturers to include drug disposal costs in the pricing for their medicines.</p><p>"There is no other take-back program - including the British Columbia program - that puts take-back responsibility on the shoulders of pharmaceutical companies. When they are managed locally, that is really the only way these programs can work," he said.</p><p>The Alameda County ordinance does pose logistical problems, such as how a pharmaceutical company on the other side of the country, or the other side of the world, can physically and legally police the drug program so that unused medicines are discarded appropriately and drug collection containers aren't robbed by thieves seeking controlled substances.</p><p>Mr Spears also noted that the only people served by the Alameda ordinance are the county's residents, but they are not the ones who will pay for the drug disposal program. </p><p>Pharma companies' costs will be passed on to prescription medicine consumers outside of Alameda County, since the ordinance does not allow manufacturers to charge the county's residents any kind of fee to cover the drug disposal program's costs.</p><p>Mr Miley's office estimates that the costs to manufacturers would be about $0.01 for every $33 worth of pharmaceuticals sold in Alameda County for a structure resembling the $40,000 program currently run and funded by 10 local agencies.</p><p>PhRMA, BIO and GPhA maintain that the costs of the program aren't entirely understood, because insurance fees and other costs are difficult to predict given the unique nature of Alameda County's ordinance.</p><p>GPhA spokesman Greg Howard said the ordinance reflects a misunderstanding of the pharma industry, because generic manufacturers that produce low-cost pills could be responsible for a higher proportion of the drug disposal program's cost based on the number of generic pills consumed in the US.</p><p>"Generics work on much smaller margins than our branded counterparts and upwards of 80% of prescriptions are filled with our drugs," Mr Howard said.</p><h2>Constitutional clash?</h2><p>PhRMA, BIO and GPhA claim in their lawsuit that the ordinance's demands violate the commerce clause of the US Constitution, which assigns regulation of interstate commerce to the federal government.</p><p>"States can't reach out to regulate companies that have no connection with their jurisdiction other than they put products into interstate commerce and some of them happen to be sold in their jurisdiction. Also, the ordinance shifts the costs beyond their borders. The commerce clause prohibits the kind of cost-shifting that Alameda is trying to do here," Mr Spears said.</p><p>No other industry has been asked to dispose of its products in the way that Alameda County will require branded and generic drug manufacturers to dispose of prescription pills, according to Mr Howard. </p><p>He said it would be like asking newspaper publishers to collect used newspapers and recycle them, rather than including newspaper recycling in municipal waste programs for which city or county residents pay a regular fee. </p><p>Or, it would be like telling domestic appliance manufacturers that they have to pay for the disposal of old dishwashing machines, rather than requiring consumers to haul their old appliances to nearby landfills and dump them there for a fee.</p><p>Pharma companies are worried that other US cities, counties or states will lobby for laws similar to Alameda County's ordinance. Some states have tried, but failed, to pass drug disposal laws paid for by pharma companies due to the difficult logistics of manufacturer-run programs.</p><p>"I'm certain there are other jurisdictions looking over Alameda's shoulder. It's a pretty attractive option - to have a state-of-the-art program that somebody else pays for," Mr Spears said.</p><p>
