<p>Drug makers and other companies can take internal measures to protect their information by ensuring their computer systems are robustly secure and warning employees about tricks by cyber thieves, such as "spear phishing," in which hackers pretend to know the person to get them to click on a malware link, letting the scammers into the firm's network, where they siphon off rich data they intend to sell for a profit.</p><p>But what can biopharmaceutical manufacturers and other firms do when they must put their trade secrets, data, financial details and other facts into the hands of others, like a government agency, such as the FDA &ndash; where it's mandated to be shared &ndash; or a publicity firm, where in both cases the owners of the information have no control to prevent a cyber attack?</p><p>Indeed, as two "unprecedented" parallel cases showed on Aug. 11, in which the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought actions against more than 30 people involved in a five-year cyber scam on three newswire services &ndash; Marketwired, PR Newswire and Business Wire &ndash; the companies whose information was stolen from their embargoed press releases were helpless to do anything to stop the attacks.</p><p>The plot &ndash; the largest known computer hacking and securities fraud scheme in US history &ndash; involved two Ukrainian men who allegedly hacked into the three newswire services' computer networks and swiped the not-yet-public press releases, which contained information about public companies' quarterly and yearend earnings, financial performances and potential mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>The cyber thieves would then sell the press releases to rogue Wall Street securities professionals, who would trade on the inside information extracted from the embargoed documents.</p><p>The scam, in which as many as 150,000 press releases were stolen, although only 800 were used to make illegal stock trades, generated more than $100m in illicit profits, SEC and Justice officials told reporters.</p><p>The hackers, who one DOJ official described as "relentless, tireless and patient," had used a few different ways to attempt to get into the newswire services' networks, including spear phishing.</p><p>But what they used most was a structured query language (SQL) injection attack. </p><p>SQL is a programming language used to create and maintain databases and is one of the most popular pieces of software employed by organizations.</p><p>SQL injection attacks, which circumvent the SQL programming language syntax with the intent of bypassing security controls that are supposed to prevent unauthorized users from accessing restricted data, was the same way hackers got into the FDA's databases in 2013, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Left-Companies-Trade-Secrets-Data-Open-To-Hackers-359817" target="_new">according to a report released late last week</a> by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>In those attacks, a UK hacker gained access to 14,000 accounts held by drug makers and other medical product firms data &ndash; demonstrating how companies' trade secrets and other information were left vulnerable and unprotected in the hands of the FDA.</p><p>Lawmakers scolded the FDA and the other Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies that also had experienced cyber attacks.</p><p>But should Congress do more, especially given it has the opportunity to impose mandates under <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/User-fees-Cures-elections-FDA-bracing-for-the-crash-359689" target="_new">two major pieces of legislation</a> currently on deck involving how the FDA will operate in the coming years &ndash; one effort aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise and the other reauthorizing user fees?</p><p>"Absolutely," declared Dr. Niam Yaraghi, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.</p><p>He suggested there are a few avenues lawmakers could take to mandate actions by the FDA and HHS to ensure information submitted to those agencies by companies and other stakeholders are better protected.</p><p>First, Dr. Yaraghi told <i>Scrip</i>, the FDA and HHS should be required under a legal mandate to share information about the privacy breaches they experience in a reasonable amount of time and disclose it not only to the affected stakeholders, but also to the public in general.</p><p>Just like the government's "Hall of Shame" website which lists all medical providers who have experienced privacy breaches affecting more than 500 patients, so, too, should HHS and its agencies be required to publicly display information about cyber attacks they've encountered, he said.</p><p>"There should be a public platform in which people can know about these privacy breaches, and that should include these investigative reports about the reasons why these breaches happened and the steps the specific agencies took to solve them," Dr. Yaraghi said.</p><p>Plus, he said, if there was more transparency about FDA's and HHS' privacy breaches, other agencies could better learn from each other about how they solved the problems and be better prepared for the next hack attack.</p><p>"These hacks do not happen at only one federal agency. They are most likely replicated at other agencies," Dr. Yaraghi said.</p><p>He suggested the "shame" website should be mandated for all agencies, not just FDA and HHS &ndash; recommending a good spot for it is the government's already established <a href="https://itdashboard.gov" target="_new">IT Dashboard</a> site, which has details about investments in federal technology.</p><p>One reason breaches are more common at the federal government and in the health care sector is because security and privacy are "separated from the core business value of the organization," Dr. Yaraghi said, noting that's not the case for other sectors.</p><p>Given what's at stake &ndash; especially with biopharmaceutical makers standing to lose billions of dollars if their data are stolen from regulators' systems &ndash; he also suggested the FDA, HHS and other federal agencies need to "hire better and more competent people to manage security."</p><p>While the US federal government may not pay as well as the private sector for information technology professionals, Dr. Yaraghi noted there are other perks of being a government employee &ndash; pointing out that even those who have been highly successful in the private sector, like entrepreneur Todd Park, who cofounded cloud-based services company athenahealth, left profitability behind for the opportunity to serve their country.</p><p>In Mr. Park's case, it was at the White House, where he served as the nation's second chief technology officer.</p><p>Dr. Yaraghi also recommended Congress insist on third-party "secure" audits of the FDA's databases, with those assessments occurring on a frequent and regular basis. </p><p>Just like Americans are urged to check their credit reports for suspicious activity, the audits could be a check on the FDA's database security, he said.</p><p>And if proper quality measurements can be devised, the FDA's performance on cyber security also could be tied to user fees, Dr. Yaraghi said. </p><p>While some data breaches may be more preventable than others, Dr. Yaraghi said it's nearly impossible to completely eliminate the risk &ndash; echoing what he'd said earlier this year in a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/02/12-anthem-hack-health-privacy" target="_new">Brookings analysis</a> of the cyber attack on insurer Anthem Health, in which 80 million patients' personal information was hacked.</p><p>But, he said, "We should not stop exchanging data."</p><p>Rather, Dr. Yaraghi said, "We should consider it as a risk and try to manage, mitigate and minimize it." </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
