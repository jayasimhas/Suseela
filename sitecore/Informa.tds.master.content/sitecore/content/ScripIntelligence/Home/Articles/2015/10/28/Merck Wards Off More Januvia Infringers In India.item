<p>Merck & Co has moved to fend off a clutch of smaller Indian players that allegedly contract manufacture and export its diabetes therapies <i>Januvia</i> (sitagliptin) and <i>Janumet</i> (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride), or hope to introduce copies of these on the domestic market, infringing on its patents.</p><p>MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside of the US and Canada) has initiated legal proceedings against these players, securing ex-parte injunctions from the Delhi High Court in two cases. </p><p>One of the alleged infringers, Mahaveer Chand, is said to be involved in contract manufacturing and export of generic version of sitagliptin under the brand names, <i>Sitag</i> and <i>Sitag-M</i>. The two brands are known to be associated with the Chennai-based Bafna Pharmaceuticals Ltd led by chairman and managing director, Bafna Mahaveer Chand.</p><p>An email sent to Bafna Pharmaceuticals concerning the case, however, remained unanswered at time of going to press.</p><p>Court documents indicate that MSD had instructed an "independent investigator" to verify the extent of infringing activities in the cases and the findings suggested that the defendants, Mahaveer Chand and others, may also be considering a launch of sitagliptin on the domestic market, amounting to infringement of Merck's patent. Similar allegations have been made against defendants Dinesh Sawant and others in another case.</p><p>In both cases, the Delhi High Court, in separate orders dated Oct.20, restrained, till further orders, the defendants, their employees, directors, agents etc. from "making, using, selling, distributing, exporting, offering for sale, in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly" or dealing in any product under any other name that may infringe the subject matter of Merck's sitagliptin Indian Patent No 209816.</p><p>The next date of listing of the cases against Chand and Sawant is March 25, 2016. </p><p>A similar case in September saw the Delhi High Court restrain the defendants, Munish Thakur and others, till further orders, from using sitagliptin in any manner that is the subject matter of the 209816 patent.</p><p>MSD did not immediately comment on the series of legal actions initiated.</p><p>Last month the Delhi High Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Permanent-Bar-Against-Glenmarks-Sitagliptin-Copies-360858" target="_new">permanently enjoined</a> Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd from making and selling its generic version of Januvia and Janumet. The Indian firm was found to have infringed Merck's sitagliptin patent.</p>
