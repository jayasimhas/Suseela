<p>Glenmark will pay $25m to settle allegations that it falsely reported inflated drug prices under the Texas Medicaid program, though the firm claims that cash-flows will not be hit "materially".</p><p>Glenmark informed Indian bourses that its US arm will make payment in 16 equal tranches of $1.56m each quarter for the next 16 quarters to the state of Texas, but underscored that the settlement was not an admission of liability.</p><p>Under the settlement agreement, Glenmark is required to pay the State of Texas a total of $11.25m for its general revenue fund. An identical sum will go to the federal government, since it is entitled to a percentage of the settlement proceeds given that the Medicaid program is jointly funded by the state and US taxpayers. Additionally, the Texas Attorney General's office will receive $2.5m in attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</p><p>A statement by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office said that the state's investigation found that since 2005, Glenmark had violated Texas law when it "illegally misreported prices" to Medicaid in order to induce pharmacies and other providers to purchase its products over that of competitors. </p><p>"As a result, Medicaid reimbursed pharmacies more than it should have for certain of Glenmark's products," the statement said.</p><p>Since 2000, the Texas Attorney General's Civil Medicaid Fraud team has investigated dozens of drug firms for reporting inflated drug prices to the Medicaid program, with recoveries for the State of Texas exceeding $600m since 2002. </p><p>Several large firms including Pfizer, Abbott, Merck & Co and Amgen too have in the past ended up with settlements, while last year Ranbaxy said that it had <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ranbaxy-extends-losses-in-Q3-but-merger-with-Sun-on-track-356423%5d" target="_new">settled litigation</a> concerning its ''participation'' in the Texas Medicaid Programme and it expects to make payments to the State of Texas in tranches through August 2015.</p><h2>Shares up</h2><p>Glenmark's stock, however, appeared relatively untouched by the news of the settlement, moving up instead on the back of an announcement that that India's Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had cleared foreign investments proposals in Glenmark and another Indian firm Aurobindo.</p><p>Glenmark can increase the investment limit by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) from 35.07% to 49%. "This will result in an inflow of about INR20.22bn ($324m)," a government statement said. The Glenmark scrip ended at INR884 (+4.69%) on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 8 April.</p><p>Glenmark's shareholders had earlier approved a proposal to issue securities not exceeding $300m and also to hike the shareholding limit for FIIs/Registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (RFPI) from 40% to an aggregate limit of 49% of the paid up share capital of the company.</p>
