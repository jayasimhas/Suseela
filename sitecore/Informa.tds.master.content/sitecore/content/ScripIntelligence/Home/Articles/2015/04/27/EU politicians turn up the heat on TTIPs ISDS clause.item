<p>Political pressure is growing in the EU for the controversial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clause contained in the draft US/EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) to be removed after almost half of the committees involved in preparing the European Parliament's position on the TTIP rejected the clause.</p><p>The parliament's environment and public health committee (ENVI) said recently that the European Commission should oppose the inclusion of the ISDS in the TTIP, insisting it should be up to the EU or member state courts to provide investors with legal protection. </p><p>Now a total of six of the 14 committees involved have approved draft opinions rejecting the ISDS: as well as the ENVI, they are those responsible for legal affairs, economic and monetary affairs, employment, petitions, and constitutional affairs.</p><p>The legal affairs committee said in a statement that the TTIP should not contain an ISDS mechanism because the current level of investment protection in both the US and the EU was "fully sufficient to guarantee legal security". The state-to-state dispute settlement system and the use of national legal and judicial systems are the most appropriate tools to address investment disputes, the committee added.</p><p>The committee also said that intellectual property matters should not be negotiated in the TTIP, and that the European Commission should exclude "sensitive services" such as health and social security systems from the treaty, and ensure that the negotiations "do not result in the diluting of the precautionary principle, particularly in the areas of environmental, health, food and consumer protection". </p><p>While the committees' opinions are not binding, they will add weight to the report being drafted by the lead international trade committee, which is to be presented to the parliament's plenary session in June. </p><p>The parliament does not have a seat at the TTIP negotiations, as the EU is represented by the commission, but it has the power either to ratify or to reject the trade treaty once talks are complete. Parliamentary opposition led to the demise of an earlier international agreement, the anti-counterfeiting treaty ACTA, for example, although there is no suggestion that this will happen with the TTIP.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seems something will have to be done about the ISDS, which is supposed to protect investors by giving them recourse to arbitration tribunals if there are conflicts between a private company and a government. </p><p>The provision has proved to be one of the most contentious aspects of the TTIP, which underwent a ninth round of negotiations in New York on 20-24 April. High-level opposition to its inclusion, at least as currently worded, has been growing for some time across a range of stakeholders and other parties. </p><p>In the area of medicines and healthcare specifically, concerns have been voiced that the ISDS would allow companies to demand compensation for claimed violations of World Trade Organization rules on intellectual property rights, and that firms could drag governments before tribunals over measures taken to control healthcare spending.</p><p>Because of the concerns raised, in January 2014 talks on the ISDS were suspended pending the finalization of new proposals from the European Commission aimed at guaranteeing that special regimes for investor-state disputes will not limit the jurisdiction of national courts. Discussions on these proposals are understood to be still under way. </p><h2>Implications for pharma SMEs?</h2><p>While the exact implications of the TTIP for the pharmaceutical sector have not been well delineated, a new report from the commission gives some indication of the issues at stake for small and medium-sized companies that trade with the US. </p><p>The EU is one of the largest trading partners of the US, and as SMEs contribute a significant share of total EU export value, it can be expected that they will also contribute to a significant share of US imports, according to the report, "Small and Medium Sized Enterprises and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership".</p><p>Among the manufacturing sectors where EU SMEs have a large market share are pharmaceuticals, chemicals and printing, and "compliance with US food quality and safety rules and technical rules and regulations for all goods, which are different from those of the EU, is seen as a barrier for all firms that export or want to export to the US market", the report says.</p><p>According to a survey of SMEs carried out for the report, EU SME exports of pharmaceutical and chemical products account for more than 10% of total US imports in those sectors. In those industries, standards and certification issues (technical barriers to trade) were highlighted by 31 respondents.</p><p>Several pharmaceutical SMEs mentioned issues such as conformity assessment, certification and inspections. "This may be explained by the requirements for inspections by the EU member states and by the US Food and Drug Administration to determine pharmaceutical firms&rsquo; compliance with what are known as good manufacturing practices (GMP)," it declared. </p><p>This was not only an issue for SMEs, as "a large German firm also highlighted the need for regular inspections and noted that EU firms are already also subject to European controls, the report continued. The company suggested that "mutual recognition of GMP standards and monitoring between the EU countries and the EU and the USA would facilitate the movement of drugs and their active ingredients significantly". </p><p>Ten companies producing medical devices mentioned different approaches to authorization procedures in the US compared with the EU, with one suggesting "I would be interested to have Class III medical devices [that are] CE marked&#8230; recognized by the FDA."</p><h2>Lack of transparency</h2><p>A great deal of the unease over the TTIP in general has been generated by the lack of transparency in the negotiations, although it does appear that the level of openness on the EU side has increased since the new European Commission was installed last year. </p><p>The European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, believes that the commission was taken aback by the level of public criticism of the secrecy surrounding the talks, particularly via social media, as well as from her own office, and that it has, to some extent at least, changed its stance on the publication of negotiating documents. </p><p>Last month she said that "in response to her own-initiative inquiry", the commission was "building on its more proactive approach to publishing TTIP documents", and that it had stated that its soon-to-be-published list of TTIP documents would be "comprehensive". </p><p>She said that while more could be done in the coming months to increase public awareness of the content and implications of TTIP &ndash; particularly when the consolidated texts of EU and US positions come close to being finalized &ndash; she was "pleased with the way in which the commission has further moved to build on the transparency measures already put in place". </p><p>She also congratulated the European Parliament and civil society groups who had pushed for more transparency. "The democratic responsibility now lies with the elected representatives to scrutinise the negotiations on behalf of their constituents, engage with European citizens and decide the future of TTIP," she declared.</p><p>But she suggested that negotiators on the other side of the Atlantic were proving less amenable to calls for more openness. The commission had signalled, she said, that "it continues to seek to persuade the United States of the need for greater transparency in these trade talks". </p>
