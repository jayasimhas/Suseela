<p><p>Merck & Co is taking no chances with the development of its most promising asset &ndash; its immunotherapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The company wants to make sure that the drug has the most likely chance of success by picking the right patients to receive Keytruda. </p><p>The big pharma announced 28 May that it has collaborated with NanoString Technologies on the development of an assay to determine the patients most-likely to experience benefits from the PD-1 inhibitor. The assay is based on immune-related gene expression and was developed using NanoString's nCounter analysis system.</p><p>"We're interested in any method that will help us identify patients that are most likely to benefit from Keytruda. We're fairly agnostic about the technology and we're quite excited about finding various ways identify patients in addition to our existing work with PD-L1 identified by immunohistochemistry," said Merck's Dr Eric Rubin, VP and therapeutic area head of oncology early-stage development, in an interview. </p><p>Merck will be making several presentations at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting 29 May &ndash; 02 June that showcase the use of the RNA signatures technology and the interferon-gamma response gene developed with NanoStrings that was used to identify patients. The studies included patients with a variety of tumor types, including gastric cancer, bladder cancer, advanced melanoma and head and neck cancer. </p><p>"Across these tumor types we found that these signatures could predict who was most likely to have a response to Keytruda," added Rubin. </p><p>Merck will present data from its KEYNOTE-001 trial at ASCO that show the overall response rate (ORR) was higher in the patients indicated through the biomarkers. According to the abstract, the ORR was 47% in the validation cohort. Both the Interferon-gamma [IFN&#947;] 10-gene and the expanded-immune signatures showed statistically significant associations with ORR (P = 0.047 and 0.027, respectively) and progression-free survival (P = 0.016 and 0.015).</p><p>In the Phase I KEYNOTE-012 study, 33 of the 39 gastric cancer patients had the RNA expression profiling data of "sufficient quality." In those patients, the ORR was 30%. </p><p><p><p>
