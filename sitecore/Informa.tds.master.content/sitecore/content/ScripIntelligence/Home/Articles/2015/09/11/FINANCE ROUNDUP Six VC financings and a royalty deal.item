<p>Biotechnology companies and their investors came back from summer break with a slew of venture capital funding rounds and a royalty deal, although it remains to be seen how many early-stage firms will remain financially independent with large biotech and pharmaceutical companies raising massive stockpiles of cash.</p><p>With an eye on mergers and acquisitions, biopharma industry observers are wondering which companies and assets Gilead Sciences Inc. and Biogen Inc. intend to buy with the $10bn and $6bn, respectively, that they are raising through the sale of senior unsecured notes. Recently funded private companies and those that are considering an initial public offering may or may not be of interest to Gilead, Biogen or their pharma peers, so they need new cash to get them to research and development milestones that could make them attractive to future big name partners.</p><p><b>Venture Capital Keeps Flowing</b></p><p>Several firms involved in drug development revealed new venture capital funding rounds during the post-Labor Day, four-day week of Sept. 8 to 11, led by biotech billionaire and former Abraxis Biosciences CEO Patrick Soon-Shiong's NantCell, which closed a $100m funding round, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. </p><p>Soon-Shiong has spent a lot of time talking about his <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CALBIO-2013-Success-Redefined-by-Abraxis-founder-biotech-innovator-Patrick-Soon-Shiong-344053" target="_new">vision for connected health care</a> &ndash; especially cancer care &ndash; during the past few years and he's invested a lot of money in a massive venture called NantWorks LLC with several subsidiaries tackling different parts of cancer diagnosis and treatment, including the cell-based immunotherapy firm NantCell. </p><p>Investors in NantCell's recent funding round were not disclosed in the company's Sept. 11 SEC filing, which could be a precursor to a future IPO. Soon-Shiong invested in Conkwest, now known as NantKwest, before the immunotherapy company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Bubble-worries-heighten-after-another-big-Alzheimers-offering-359735" target="_new">grossed more than $200m</a> in a late July IPO.</p><p>The table below highlights five other significant venture capital funding rounds that were announced during the short Labor Day week.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Financing</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Use Of Proceeds</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AveXis Inc.;</p><p>Chicago, Illinois</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The gene therapy specialist closed a $65m Class D common stock financing led by funds and accounts managed by T.
