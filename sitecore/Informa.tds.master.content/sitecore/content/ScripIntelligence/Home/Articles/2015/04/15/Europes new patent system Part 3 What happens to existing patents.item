<p><b>In the third in his series of articles on the EU's future unitary patent and Unified Patent Court, Paul England looks at what will happen to existing patents when the new system comes into operation in a couple of years' time. </b></p><p>The Unified Patent Court (UPC) is expected to come into force sometime in 2017, and together with the new patent with unitary effect it will offer the most far-reaching changes to European patent litigation in 40 years. But how will the new system affect existing European and national patents? Will they continue to have effect? </p><p>The simple answer to the second question is yes, they will continue to have effect. Moreover, both European patents (which are now frequently referred to as "classicals" to help distinguish them from unitary patents) and national patents will continue to be available for the protection of inventions at a national level. </p><p>However, in the event of a dispute, the relationship between these patents and the UPC will be different: disputes about national patents will continue to be actionable in the national courts only; by contrast, the rules on where disputes about classical patents are heard are very much more complicated.</p><p>The complexity in respect of classical European actions stems from the UPC transitional period. Eventually, it is intended that all classical European patents must be enforced or revoked exclusively in the UPC &ndash; the national courts will not have a role (subject to the opt-out, which we'll deal with in the next article). </p><h2>Transitional period</h2><p>However, this will not happen until after the transitional period, which is initially set to last for seven years, but may be extended by a further seven years at a later date. During the transitional period, a classical European patent may be litigated in either the UPC or the national court of the country in which it is validated. </p><p>Whether a revocation and/or enforcement action proceeds in a national court or the UPC makes a big difference in terms of the effect of the final decision that is reached. A successful revocation action in the UPC will have pan-European effect. That is, a decision of the court will apply to all classical patents validated in the contracting member states to the UPC &ndash; ie, those that have ratified the UPC Agreement at the time of the decision. </p><p>As more countries ratify the UPC Agreement, the scope of the effect of UPC decisions about classical patents will become accordingly greater. The effect of decisions on infringement will, similarly, apply in all those countries that are contracting and ratified member states of the UPC Agreement. </p><p>Compare this with the result of national court actions concerning classical patents: these are limited to the national territory of validation, and to obtain a decision in more than one European court it is necessary to litigate in more than one national court.</p><p>A key question is whether it will be possible to litigate some patents in a classical bundle in the national courts and the rest in the UPC during the transitional period. It is currently unresolved whether an action for revocation and/or infringement of a classical patent, in a national court on a national validation, will prevent a parallel UPC action concerning the remaining validations of this patent. </p><p>At present the favoured view is that it will be possible to do both, but that the classical patent validation subject to the national action will be "carved out" of the UPC action.</p><p>Next in the series: Can we opt out of the Unified Patent Court system?</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at international law firm Taylor Wessing LLP.</i></p><p>
