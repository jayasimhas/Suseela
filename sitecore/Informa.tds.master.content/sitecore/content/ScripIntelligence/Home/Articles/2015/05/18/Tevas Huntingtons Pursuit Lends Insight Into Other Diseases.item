<p>Teva, mostly known for being the world's largest generic company and the maker of the multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), has ventured into the rare disease area, pursuing an orphan medicine for Huntington's disease, a fatal neurodegenerative condition that affects about 30,000 Americans.</p><p>The pathways involved in Huntington's, said Michael Hayden, president of global R&D and chief scientific officer at Teva, have commonality with many other neurodegenerative diseases, including common ones.</p><p>"This may be a pathway, a door, a lever into more common forms of neurodegeneration," he told <i>Scrip</i>. "We are focused on pathways that are similar to rescue injured neurons in many different neurodegenerative disorders. Huntington is our model."</p><p>By focusing on the rare disease, Teva is able to derive insights that may impact diseases that affect much larger numbers of patients, Hayden said.</p><p>Teva revealed on Aug. 12 its new drug application for its experimental Huntington's drug deutetrabenazine, also known as SD-809, was accepted by the FDA as a treatment to help control involuntary jerky movements, known as chorea, associated with the disease.</p><p>Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, an affiliate of Scrip, has put the chances of Teva gaining the FDA's nod for deutetrabenazine at 90%, which is 7% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Currently, there is only one drug on the US market approved for Huntington's chorea &ndash; Lundbeck's and Valeant's Xenazine (tetrabenazine), which gained the FDA's blessing in 2008.</p><p>But Xenazine, a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor, is associated with severe adverse events, including parkinsonism, akathisia and dysphagia. The drug's labeling also carries black-box warning alerting prescribers about the risk of depression and suicidality &ndash; conditions already prevalent in Huntington's patients. </p><p>Xenazine active ingredient, tetrabenazine, initially was developed by Swiss drug maker Roche in the mid-1950s as an antipsychotic to treat schizophrenia. </p><p>But tetrabenazine never gained widespread use for that condition and later was found to be effective in treating chorea, especially in patients with Huntington's. </p><p>While the drug is "highly effective" against chorea, doctors have avoided prescribing the medicine much in the US because of its side effects, Teva's Hayden said.</p><p>Therefore, he said, there remains a great unmet need for a new drug to treat chorea associated with Huntington's &ndash; a condition Hayden said has been called "the most dreadful disease known to man, both because of its lack of treatment and its perpetuity from one generation to the next."</p><p>"It's terminal. There's no way to modify the course of the illness," explained Hayden, who is known as one of the world's most prominent experts of the disease.</p><p>Because Teva is well ahead of other companies in pursuing treatments for chorea related to Huntington's, the Israeli firm stands to potentially dominate the market with deutetrabenazine, which is designed to regulate the levels of dopamine in the brain, he said.</p><p>Using its deuterium technology, which Teva obtained through its acquisition earlier this year of California biotech Auspex Pharmaceuticals, the company has created a "deuterated" form of tetrabenazine &ndash; deutetrabenazine &ndash; which the FDA has recognized as a new molecular entity.</p><p>Deutetrabenazine has been shown to have fewer side effects than tetrabenazine, Hayden said.</p><p>"By deuterating tetrabenazine what happens is you slow down the metabolism and you decrease the occurrence of the metabolites associated with the side effects, while maintaining appropriate levels of the active compound," he said. </p><p>Teva is pursuing several other experimental treatments in a variety of disease areas using the technology, Hayden said, noting Auspex had about 50 compounds in its pipelines, many of which Hayden said his company is devoted to developing. </p><p>Shares of Teva closed at $69.62 on Aug. 12, up 2 cents. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
