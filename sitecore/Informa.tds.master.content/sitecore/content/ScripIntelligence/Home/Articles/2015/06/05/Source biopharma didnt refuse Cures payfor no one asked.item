<p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has not turned up its nose at the idea of having drug makers help cover the costs of the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; a major legislative initiative from the House Energy and Commerce Committee aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise.</p><p>In fact, no one has asked the trade group about any specific pay-for proposals, a source familiar with the industry <i>told Scrip</i>, insisting news reports to the contrary are inaccurate.</p><p>But PhRMA also has not said publicly whether biopharmaceutical manufacturers would indeed step up with funding if called on by Congress to do so &ndash; like in 2009, when the trade group <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-support-of-health-reform-buy-some-love-for-PhRMA-331364" target="_new">sealed a deal</a> with the White House and Democrats to provide at least $80bn in Medicare Part D savings under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i>.</p><p>A PhRMA spokesperson told <i>Scrip </i>the group "remains committed" to working with the House E&C Committee and Congress on efforts to "improve the discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines that help patients live longer, healthier lives." </p><p>The industry group applauded the bipartisan "collaborative and constructive manner" in which the House lawmakers have been engaging stakeholders.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), however, declined to comment.</p><p>The authors of the Cures bill, which is set to be marked up later this week, have not placed any estimates on how much the proposed legislation would cost or where the money will come from to fund it.</p><p>Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House E&C, who initiated the Cures legislative initiative last year, along with Congresswoman Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), has insisted the bill will be fully paid for, although he's not said yet how that will happen.</p><p>Representative DeGette, however, acknowledged at a 30 April Capitol Hill <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">hearing</a> "We have to find the money for what we are going to do."</p><p>The Cures authors have included a proposal in the latest version of the draft legislation to boost the annual budget of the National Institutes of Health by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn over five years</a>. The FDA, however, was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">snubbed</a> on the added funding front &ndash; at least, for now.</p><p>At separate House and Senate hearings in late April, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">pleaded with lawmakers</a> not to task her agency with more unfunded mandates &ndash; like Congress did in the <i>FDA Amendments Act of 2007</i>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
