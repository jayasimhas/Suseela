<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first European law on the marketing authorization of medicines, Directive 65/65/EEC, which came into effect on 26 January 1965. </p><p>Drafted following the thalidomide disaster in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the directive was intended to protect human health by ensuring that no medicinal product would ever be placed on the market without prior authorization. </p><p>In the intervening 50 years, the body of legislation governing pharmaceuticals has burgeoned as lawmakers have striven to strengthen and harmonize regulations in areas like marketing authorization procedures, clinical trials, and post-approval monitoring. </p><p>To mark the anniversary, a conference is being held by the European Commission on Sep. 28 in Brussels, entitled "50 years of EU pharma legislation: Achievements and future perspectives." The event will look at the role of the legislation in protecting public health and promoting advances in science and innovation, and at the many regulatory challenges that still lie ahead.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> will be reporting from the conference, which will feature speakers from the commission, the European Parliament, the EMA, industry, national regulators, academia, and patient groups. The opening speech will be delivered by health commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis and the closing address by Xavier Prats Monn√©, the new director general of the commission's health and food safety directorate.</p><h2>A Brief History</h2><p>Following the introduction of the founding directive in 1965, the 1970s saw the first steps being taken towards a joint European position on marketing authorization evaluations, with the introduction of the "multistate" procedure (later to become the mutual recognition procedure). The following decade witnessed the new "concertation" procedure for high-tech and biotech drugs, which could henceforth only be approved after an opinion from the central Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP; now the CHMP).</p><p>Things took a big leap forward in the 1990s with the introduction of the new centralized approvals procedure and the establishment in 1995 of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), which later became the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Also during the 1990s the mutual recognition procedure was put in place, as were new harmonized rules on the labelling and advertising of medicines.</p><p>The following decade saw a big expansion of the EU's regulatory responsibilities, with the adoption of new legislation on orphan drugs, clinical trials, traditional herbal medicines, biosimilars, pediatric medicines, and advanced therapies, as well as the implementation of the new decentralized approval procedure.</p><p>Over the past few years the regulatory focus has turned again to drug safety, with a new set of pharmacovigilance rules and regular use of risk management plans and post-authorization safety studies, alongside a shift towards an adaptive pathways approach to getting innovative new drugs to patients more quickly. </p><p>But despite the great strides that have been made in EU medicines regulation, many questions remain. Speakers at the anniversary conference will be looking at key issues such as the tension between earlier access to medicines and the need to shield patients from excess risk; issues of transparency and trust; and whether regulators can be gatekeepers and partners with industry at the same time. </p><p>The conference will also address questions such as: Are affordable medicines compatible with high safety standards? Can pharmacovigilance and observational studies replace clinical trials? Is legislation is shaping business or vice-versa? </p><p>The final session will look at future perspectives, challenges and innovation, discussing whether regulation enables innovation (or does it happen anyway?) and whether personalized medicine spells the end of "one size fits all". </p><h2>EMA Anniversary</h2><p>Also this year, the European Medicines Agency celebrated its 20th anniversary with a conference in London in March entitled "<i>Science, Medicines, Health: Patients at the heart of future innovation</i>." See <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EXCLUSIVE-EMA-20th-anniversary-supplement-357355" target="_new">here</a> for <i>Scrip</i>'s exclusive 20th anniversary supplement, featuring interviews with the key players and analyses of the agency's achievements, shortcomings and place in the future EU regulatory environment.</p>
