<p>Just days after Bristol-Myers Squibb revealed it had won a priority review from the FDA for the firm's application for Opdivo (nivolumab) as a treatment for patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior therapy, regulators made a stunning announcement that the agency had granted approval.</p><p>The FDA's decision was not expected until 22 June, the drug's <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date, so the 4 March approval came as a surprise &ndash; setting off a 6.5% jump in BMS' shares (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/June-verdict-expected-for-BMS-Opdivo-in-lung-cancer-357009" target="_new">2 March 2015</a>).</p><p>The company's stock closed the day on 4 March at $65.67, up $3.75, or 6%.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the fastest approval I&rsquo;ve seen in my 15 year career,&rdquo; declared Wall Street analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum, of Evercore ISI. </p><p>Opdivo already had won a speedy US approval this past December for its first approval for the US market &ndash; gaining the FDA's blessing three months early as a treatment for advanced melanoma (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>).</p><p>With Opdivo's new indication, BMS is the first company with an immuno-oncology approved for the US market to treat advanced squamous NSCLC &ndash; news that was likely a punch in the gut to rival Merck, whose developing its own drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for lung cancer.</p><p>Keytruda also is approved in melanoma &ndash; winning that indication this past September (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">4 September 2014</a>).</p><p>BMS said its application was based on its single arm, open-label CheckMate -063 Phase II study, which was designed to assess advanced squamous NSCLC patients who progressed after both platinum-based therapy and at least one additional systemic therapy.</p><p>BMS said Opdivo is the first and only programmed death receptor-1 therapy to demonstrate overall survival in previously treated metastatic squamous NSCLC. </p><p>In the firm's prespecified interim analysis of its Phase III CheckMate-017 trial, Opdivo demonstrated significantly superior overall survival (OS) versus docetaxel, with a 41% reduction in the risk of death. </p><p>The median OS was 9.2 months in the Opdivo arm, versus 6 months in the docetaxel group. </p><p>Because of those positive results, the CheckMate-017 study was stopped early (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Dr Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, said his agency worked &ldquo;proactively&rdquo; with BMS to facilitate the early submission and review of &ldquo;this important clinical trial when results first became available in late December 2014.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This approval will provide patients and healthcare providers knowledge of the survival advantage associated with Opdivo and will help guide patient care and future lung cancer trials,&rdquo; Dr Pazdur said.</p><p>Evercore ISI&rsquo;s Dr Schoenebaum noted the squamous population makes up about 30% of patients with lung cancer. BMS is expected to complete its Phase III second-line non-squamous trial later this year, which he said has &ldquo;high odds of success and should expand the market dramatically.&rdquo;</p><p>Under a scenario of combining the squamous and non-squamous second-line lung opportunities, with an 80% class penetration and a 70% share for BMS, second-line sales could be $4bn to $5bn, Dr Schoenebaum said. </p><p>BMS also is pursuing trials in the first-line lung cancer setting &ndash; a market that is greater than 50% larger than the second-line setting, Dr Schoenebaum pointed out.</p><p><p><p><p>
