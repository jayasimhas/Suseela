<p>A total of 36 candidates have applied for the post of executive director of the European Medicines Agency. </p><p>The post became vacant last November when Guido Rasi, who had held the top job at the EMA for three years, was forced to step down following a ruling by the EU's civil service tribunal annulling his appointment on procedural grounds (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EMA-head-forced-to-step-down-355062" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 14 November 2014</a>). The deadline for applications closed on 28 January, and there are 36 candidates, the European Commission, which is managing the selection process, told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication Scrip<i> Regulatory Affairs</i>.</p><p>It has to be assumed that Dr Rasi, a former head of the Italian drug regulator, AIFA, is one of the applicants and indeed that he has a good chance of being re-selected. Dr Rasi is continuing to play a key role at the EMA. Following his shock departure, the EMA management board moved quickly to approve an amendment to his contract to make him principal adviser in charge of strategy. Dr Rasi is also keeping a high public profile: he is listed as one of the key speakers at The Economist's Pharma Summit which is taking place in London on 26 February. </p><p>The commission summarised the recruitment process as follows: "[There is] a thorough selection process which comprises notably a pre-selection phase, an assessment centre run by external recruitment consultants, interview with the European Commission's Consultative Committee on Appointments and for candidates selected at this stage of the procedure a further interview by the relevant member(s) of the Commission. Thereafter, the European Commission establishes the list of candidates, which is communicated to the Management Board of EMA."</p><p>It could be at least six months before the recruitment process is complete. Selection procedures for the function of executive director of an EU agency may take up to six months to conclude, the commission told <i>SRA</i>, "but this is very much impacted by the complexity of the procedure and the number of applicants".</p><p>This piece first appeared in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>.</p>
