<p>Lupin has snapped up the privately owned niche firm Gavis Pharmaceuticals LLC and Novel Laboratories for $880m, marking India's largest pharma buyout in the US in recent times. </p><p>The deal comes at a time when the Indian firm's sales have been generally jaded by tough conditions in the US, its key market, though parallel news of compliance concerns at the firm's Goa site took some of the shine off the acquisition. </p><p>The deal which apparently went through a competitive bidding process values Gavis at nine times FY14 sales of $96m - a tad pricey some analysts suggested - though Lupin's top brass termed the deal as "fairly competitive" going by the EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] multiples on complex generic asset transactions over the recent past.</p><p>Lupin's CEO Vinita Gupta highlighted the "scale and calibre" of the Gavis pipeline and its "similar DNA" to that of Lupin with reference to development of differentiated finished dosages in-house and commercialization. The deal, she said, allowed Lupin to have "more shots at the goal" and a better chance to get new product launches onto the market.</p><p>"They have very strong organic growth model that they have evolved over the last many years. Very profitable business&#8230; they had 36% EBITDA," Ms Gupta said on a call with the media after the announcement. Lupin expects Gavis' revenue to grow three times by 2018.</p><p>Ms Gupta also told <i>Scrip</i> that while the Gavis deal is fairly capital intensive, Lupin believed that it would be able to demonstrate a return on investment quickly and would still look at acquisition opportunities for its brand business in the US. Ms Gupta had previously in an interview with <i>Scrip</i> outlined plans around Lupin's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupins-CEO-on-the-specialty-asset-hunt-in-the-US-358438" target="_new">specialty asset hunt</a> in the US. </p><h2>Gavis</h2><p>In addition to expanding Lupin&rsquo;s pipeline in areas such as dermatology, and controlled substance products Gavis brings with it a US based R&D organization which fits in well with Lupin's Coral Springs, Florida, inhalation R&D centre and a manufacturing unit in New Jersey &ndash; now Lupin's first site in the US. </p><p>The Gavis manufacturing site will allow Lupin to participate in all US market channels, particularly the government business and controlled substances that requires local manufacturing.</p><p>Gavis also brings with it more than 250 employees, roughly 100 of these focused on R&D.</p><p>GAVIS currently has 66 ANDA filings pending approval with the US FDA and a pipeline of over 65 products under development. To date, GAVIS has filed 25 Para IVs and 8 FTF products. </p><p>The combined company will have a portfolio of 101 in-market products, 164 cumulative filings pending approval and a deep pipeline of products under development for the US &ndash; creating the fifth largest portfolio of ANDA filings with the US FDA.</p><p>The acquisition is expected to be accretive to the earnings from the first full year of operations</p><p>The acquisition also comes at a time when higher price erosion in the US and a slowdown in product approvals had impacted Lupin's growth in the fourth quarter ended March 2015, though approval timelines have since improved, Lupin suggested. </p><p>Sales for the first quarter ended June were down 6.4% to INR 30.74bn ($483.5m), while net profits declined 16% to INR5.25bn. US sales declined sharply to $180m during the first quarter compared with $262m in the same period of FY2015, though the India formulations business grew by 16% to INR8.85bn during the quarter.</p><h2>Plant woes</h2><p>Lupin's top brass termed as "fairly routine" some of the observations around compliance deviations that were reported to have been flagged up by the US FDA at a recent audit at the firm's Goa unit.</p><p>Nilesh Gupta, Lupin's managing director, said that the firm had received nine observations in the Form 483, but these did not include data integrity concerns. A form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p>"It was really about whether certain standard operation procedures were inadequate, they challenged the periodicity of some of the cleaning equipment and &#8230;warehouse management they had certain questions as well. We've already complied with the observations and responded to the FDA. We take quality very seriously," Mr Gupta said.</p><p>The company does not expect the GMP deviations to have an impact on product approvals.</p>
