<p>Merck KGaA is returning to BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc the rights to the Kuvan (sapropterin) drug against rare genetic disorder PKU as the diversified German group seeks to exit non-core areas to focus on cancer, immunology and neurology. </p><p>Merck acquired the rights to to Kuvan and Peg-Pal, another PKU treatment in markets outside of the US and Japan, in 2005. The medicine is the first treatment approved for hyperphenylalaninemia due to the rare metabolism disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) and has orphan drug exclusivity in Europe until 2020. Peg-Pal (pegvaliase) is an investigational treatment that is also designed to treat PKU. </p><p>Under the agreement to reverse that deal, announced Oct. 1 and set to close January 2016, Merck will receive an upfront payment of &euro;340m ($379m), plus up to &euro;185m ($206m) in milestone payments for both products, depending on BioMarin's development activities. </p><p>"Returning the rights of these drugs to BioMarin will allow Merck to fully focus on its core businesses, as well as further align R&D investment behind key strategic areas," Bel√©n Garijo, member of the executive board of Merck and CEO of healthcare said in a statement.</p><p>BioMarin also sounded pleased about getting Kuvan fully back. An early product for BioMarin, it was licensed from Daiichi Suntory Pharma Co. Ltd.&rsquo;s Daiichi Asubio Pharma in 2004 and approved in December 2007 in the US and a year later in the EU.</p><p>"This is an excellent transaction for BioMarin as it provides numerous operational and strategic synergies for the Company," Jean-Jacques Bienaime, BioMarin's chairman and CEO, said in a statement. "We will leverage our established worldwide infrastructure and strong relationships within the PKU community to ensure that patients globally have access to Kuvan, and potentially pegvaliase upon approval. We look forward to expanding our PKU franchise beyond the US and Canadian markets and into our existing commercial footprint of about 60 countries where Kuvan is currently sold." </p><p>BioMarin expects to transition commercialization activities from Merck over the next 6-12 months, and hopes to leverage its global commercial infrastructure to drive further growth of Kuvan in the new territories. The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings beginning in 2016 and accretive to GAAP earnings in 2018.</p><p>BioMarin's management told a same-day analyst conference call that it expects Kuvan will have patent protection in both the US and EU through 2020, and that generic erosion of Kuvan will be comparatively moderate because Kuvan is sold entirely through specialty distributors. </p><p>The Californian group said it plans to initiate discussions with the European Medicines Agency to determine Peg-Pal's path forward in the 28-nation EU, and hopes to communicate detailed EU regulatory plans by mid-2016. Peg-Pal Phase III data is expected in March or April 2016.</p><p>Looking forward, BioMarin told analysts it foresees $1bn of global annual revenues from its PKU franchise comprising Kuvan and Peg-Pal, but it did not say how or when it would hit that sales target.</p><p>For Germany's Merck, the latest transaction with BioMarin is part of an ongoing transformation. </p><p>Over the past four years, the family-controlled, Darmstadt-based conglomerate &ndash; which hasn't launched an important new drug in a decade- has been rebuilding its pharma R&D organization and realigning its healthcare businesses to focus on neurology, oncology, immuno-oncology and immunology, while expanding its footprint in emerging markets.</p><p>Merck Serono&rsquo;s recently installed R&D chief Luciano Rossetti, MD, who joined the company in July 2014 from Merck & Co. Inc., where he was SVP of late-stage development, has accelerated the refocusing of the company&rsquo;s pipeline and discovery activities.</p><p>News of the Kuvan divestment coincided with the group's pipeline update to analysts led by Rossetti, who said Merck has started investigating a novel, potential first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy in clinical trials with the potential to offer an alternative therapy to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 and other immunotherapies. </p><p>Called M7824, Rossett said the investigational molecule has just entered a Phase I, open-label, multiple-ascending clinical trial that aims to enroll 106 patients. This potential first-in-class bi-functional immunotherapy is designed to simultaneously block two immuno-inhibitory pathways used by cancer cells to evade the immune system, thereby controlling tumour growth by restoring and enhancing anti-tumour immune responses. </p><p>"The initiation of the M7824 clinical trial marks the next milestone in Merck's strategy to build an innovative portfolio of cancer immunotherapies that may work synergistically to potentially maximize patient benefit," Rossetti said. "This is the first Phase I trial industry-wide for this class of molecule and we expect to see key data during the second half of 2016." He declined to say what the study would target.</p><p>Merck reiterated during the Oct. 1 analysts call that it expects to have key data on its oncology treatment evofosfamide, a hypoxia-activated pro drug currently tested in clinical phase III trials in soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic cancer, during the fourth quarter of 2015.</p><p>Turning to its avelumab partnership with Pfizer Inc., Merck said it expects to have more than 3,000 patients treated with the PD-L1 compound by 2016 across more than 15 tumor types and lines of therapy. The German group did not elaborate, however.</p><p>Merck, the compound's originator, and Pfizer have been jointly developing avelumab, an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, since November 2014. Under that deal, Pfizer paid out $850m up front and could shell out another $2bn in regulatory and commercial milestones. </p><p>Earlier this year the compound entered Phase III for non-small cell lung cancer. Avelumab is also in development for other cancers including carcinoma (Phase II); breast, colorectal, stomach, melanoma, ovarian, and prostate (all Phase I); and renal (preclinical). Merck and Pfizer will now work on creating an avelumab companion test that assesses PD-L1 protein expression levels in tumor tissue and cells.</p><p>FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for avelumab last Septemer in Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare disease in which malignant cells form in the skin.</p>
