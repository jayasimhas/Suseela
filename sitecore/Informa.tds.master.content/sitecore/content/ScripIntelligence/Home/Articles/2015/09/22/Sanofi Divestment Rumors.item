<p>Following the current trend in big pharma for "realigning" business strategies, Sanofi might be considering the divestment of several units &ndash; if rumors are to be believed. </p><p>Sanofi told <i>Scrip</i> it wouldn't comment on market rumors, but the company is assessing its businesses prior to an investor meeting to be held in November. Sanofi is looking to organize its business operations into just five global business units. In its second quarter results, the company said this new structure would be "implemented beginning in January 2016 and will simplify and focus Sanofi to optimize future growth."</p><p>This review is under the orders of new CEO Olivier Brandicourt, who is no doubt looking to put his stamp on the company after taking the helm <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-official-Bayers-Brandicourt-is-Sanofis-new-CEO-356855" target="_new">earlier this year</a>. He replaced Christopher Viehbacher who was ousted <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-board-ousts-Viehbacher-354729" target="_new">last October</a>. </p><p>The latest rumors claim the big pharma is considering the disposal of its Bio-Surgery and Renal units and weighing up its options for animal health outfit, Merial. </p><p>Sanofi's Bio-Surgery unit was obtained through its acquisition of Genzyme Corp. in 2011. Sanofi does not break out sales figures for its Renal or Bio-surgery units.Â </p><p>Meanwhile, divestment of its animal health business would fall in line with actions made in previous years by some of its big pharma peers. In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">spring 2014</a>, Novartis AG agreed to sell its animal health business to Eli Lilly & Co. for approximately $5.4bn, and in 2013, Pfizer spun out its animal health unit, Zoetis. </p><p>However, on the flipside, Bayer AG &ndash; which is also undergoing reorganization &ndash; is looking into options for expanding its animal health offering. Analysts have predicted that proceeds from Bayer's upcoming spinout of its MaterialScience plastics business, now known as Covestro, could be used to help buy a company that would add products for pets and farm animals. </p>
