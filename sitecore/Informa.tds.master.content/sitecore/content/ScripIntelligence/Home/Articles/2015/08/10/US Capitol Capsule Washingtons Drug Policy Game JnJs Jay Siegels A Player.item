<p>If the biopharmaceutical industry wants its voice to be heard on Capitol Hill, at the FDA and other governmental bodies, it's got to play the Washington policy game &ndash; an essential element for remaining viable.</p><p>And Dr. Jay Siegel, chief biotechnology officer and head of scientific strategy and policy at Johnson & Johnson, is a player.</p><p>With the ongoing regulatory and reimbursement issues with biosimilars, Congress' attempt at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise and the start of the negotiations over the next round of user fees, Dr. Siegel has got his hands full over the next year.</p><p>Dr Siegel, who once aspired to be an astronaut when he was studying medicine at Stanford University, told <i>Scrip</i> he spends about half his time in his new role on policy issues, with the remainder of his time focused on working with J&J's leaders to prioritize research and development projects and set investment and scientific strategies at the company.</p><p>With biosimilars, the challenge is ensuring the promise of access and choice with the products is realized, but doing so within the constraints of maintaining top-tier quality so patients don't end up with second-rate medicines, he said.</p><p>"It's a delicate balance," declared Dr. Siegel, who has been involved in biosimilars issues for more than 15 years, beginning when he was working for the FDA, where he spent 20 years at the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research before joining J&J in 2003.</p><p>While Europe has had a decade of experience with biosimilars &ndash; approving guidelines in 2005 and the first product in 2006 &ndash; the FDA essentially is just getting started, with industry still waiting for some of the most essential guidelines on naming and interchangeability, although the US regulatory agency already has approved its first product, Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), Dr. Siegel noted.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's been products produced in some countries without the appropriate scientific and medical quality standards, which has caused a number of problems related to a lack of safety and efficacy &ndash; a situation that continues to occur in some areas of the world, said Dr. Siegel, who has acted as a representative for the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations to provide "expert input" at two recent World Health Organization meetings on biosimilars. </p><p>Currently, the fight in Washington has focused on reimbursement of the products after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services last month <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Group-Biosimilars-need-unique-CMS-reimbursement-codes-359392" target="_new">proposed</a> to use the same Medicare Part B payment codes for all biosimilars based on the same reference, which some have said could end up jeopardizing the market by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biosimilars-face-uncertain-market-if-CMS-payment-plan-proceeds-359795" target="_new">causing uncertainty</a>.</p><p>Over the past year, much of Dr. Siegel's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fix-for-trials-Patient-engagement-EHRs-biomarkers-networks-352722" target="_new">discussions</a> on Capitol Hill have revolved around the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">passed on July 10</a> by the House, and the Senate's companion effort, Healthier Americans, which is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senate-chance-to-improve-Cures-but-dont-expect-soon-359643" target="_new">still in the early days</a>.</p><p>He said just before Dr. Margaret Hamburg <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Former-FDA-chief-Hamburg-takes-Institute-of-Medicine-job-357672" target="_new">left her role</a> as commissioner of the FDA in early April, she sought "frank" input from Dr. Siegel and others in the industry, including executives from Merck and Amgen, in a small private meeting where she expressed her concerns over provisions in the Cures bill she said could threaten the agency's efficacy standards.</p><p>Those concerns, Dr. Siegel said, "were well heard."</p><p>Indeed, by the time a follow-up meeting had rolled around in June with the same group &ndash; minus Dr. Hamburg &ndash; there had been several tweaks made to the Cures bill, which appeased the FDA, he said.</p><p>But the FDA's concern over a lack of resources to implement the Cures provisions has remained, Dr. Siegel said.</p><p>Indeed, Dr. Stephen Ostroff has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/User-fees-Cures-elections-FDA-bracing-for-the-crash-359689" target="_new">continued to point out</a> the $550m proposed in the Cures bill falls short of the nearly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">$1bn estimated it will cost</a> to put the legislation's measures in place.</p><p>Like the FDA, industry is concerned the agency, which already is short-staffed, will need to pull its scientists from the review process to meet all the other mandates in Cures, Dr. Siegel said.</p><p>An issue J&J is particularly interested in getting addressed through either Capitol Hill's biomedical enterprise overhaul process or through the reauthorization of user fees is improving the regulatory processes and standards for drug-device combination products &ndash; an area the company is "specially positioned," Dr. Siegel said, pointing to products like its Evarrest fibrin sealant patch.</p><p>"We grew up as an industry just like the FDA grew up, where medical devices were one thing and drugs were a whole different thing," Dr. Siegel explained, noting that some of his work at J&J has revolved around building the bridges between those two worlds, which he said has "not been an easy thing to do," but he insisted "needs to get done."</p><p>The Cures bill only included a provision that would require the FDA to issue final guidance on describing the role of all agency centers when reviewing a combination product.</p><p>Dr. Siegel said that's one area he plans to discuss with Senate members as they work through their legislation, an effort being led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA).</p><p>Unfortunately, Dr. Siegel said, the FDA's user fees programs are not set up to handle drug-device combination products.</p><p>For instance, if a drug maker is seeking approval of a medicine that requires an auto-injector, the company pays the user fees to the FDA's drug or biologics centers. </p><p>But the agency's device center, which must sign off on the auto-injector, won't get any user fees to speed its review, so therefore, it doesn't have the same timeline and accountability obligations as the drug and biologics centers, ultimately holding up the product's entry to the US market, Dr. Siegel pointed out.</p><p>The FDA's current regulatory review processes "were written before people envisioned all of the different varieties of combination products," he said, adding those processes are not always transparent about who is responsible for what and how to resolve disputes. </p><p>With so much going on in the drug-device combination R&D area right now, Dr. Siegel said, it's critical the FDA improves its regulatory processes.</p><p>While the agency has made progress in reviewing and approving pharmaceuticals with companion diagnostics, that's still an area that must evolve quicker if the promise of precision medicine is going to be fulfilled, he added.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Want-To-Promote-Off-Label-Pick-Your-Battlefield-359838" target="_new">Want To Promote Off-Label?
