<p>An increased number of thromboembolic events (TE) observed in trials of Lilly's experimental non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) drug necitumumab may mean trouble for the firm's biologics license application (BLA) when it goes before the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) on 9 July.</p><p>Lilly is seeking the FDA's blessing to market necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for use in first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC.</p><p>While the safety profile for necitumumab is similar to what is known for other anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the increased number of TE events in "this already high-risk population is of concern," FDA drug reviewers said in briefing documents released on 7 July ahead of the ODAC meeting.</p><p>Like most drugs scrutinized by FDA expert advisory panels, the key issue for Lilly's necitumumab BLA is the balance of benefit versus risk, the agency's scientists pointed out.</p><p>While Lilly's randomized, controlled, open-labeled, international study of necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with squamous NSCLC, known as SQUIRE, demonstrated a 1.6 month improvement of overall survival, which was statistically significant, another trial, known as INSPIRE, of the drug in combination with Lilly's Alimta (pemetrexed) and cisplatin in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC patients had to be shut down prematurely because of an imbalance in the number of deaths attributed to potential TEs and all-cause deaths observed in the treatment arm.</p><p>At the time INSPIRE was closed, 633 patients were enrolled, out of the 947 planned to be in the study. The available data from INSPIRE showed there was no difference in overall survival &ndash; a median of 11.3 months in the treatment arm, versus 11.5 months in the control arm.</p><p>So what the FDA wants the ODAC to mull over is whether the INSPIRE results in nonsquamous NSCLC impact the risk-benefit assessment of necitumumab for the proposed indication in the squamous NSCLC population, which makes up 30%-35% of lung cancer patients.</p><p>Analysts at Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the chances of gaining the FDA's nod in the squamous NSCLC indication at 83%, which is 1% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Lilly pointed out that while there are some common features with squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, they are "two distinctly different diseases."</p><p>The firm noted that patients with squamous NSCLC tend to be male, have a history of heavy smoking and have high disease burden and poor prognosis.</p><p>While there are many first-line treatment options currently available for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC &ndash; with drugs like Alimta and Genentech's Avastin (bevacizumab) improving overall survival &ndash; those with advanced squamous disease have few options, Lilly argued in documents posted on the FDA's website.</p><p>The FDA, however, recently approved Bristol-Myers' Squibb's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab) for patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC who progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>Merck also is pursuing squamous NSCLC as an indication for Keytruda (pembrolizumab).</p><p>Nonetheless, Lilly said it was developing necitumumab, a second-generation recombinant human mAb directed against EGFR, to "address the pressing need for new effective treatments" in the squamous NSCLC setting. </p><p>But FDA's drug reviewers said the incidences of TEs were higher in the necitumumab-containing arms in both SQUIRE and INSPIRE trials &ndash; 9% versus 5% and 11% versus 6%, respectively, compared with the control arms. </p><p>The most common venous TE events, some fatal, were pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis while the most common arterial TEs were myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents.</p><p>The increased incidence of venous TEs were 9% versus 5% in SQUIRE and 13% versus 8% in INSPIRE, some fatal, the FDA said.</p><p>There also were reports of anti-EGFR-related serious toxicities, hypomagnesemia and skin rash, with the addition of platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>The increase incidence of sudden deaths or death not otherwise specified was 2.2% for necitumumab, versus 0.5% in the control group in SQUIRE, 3.3% for necitumumab versus 1.6% in the control group in INSPIRE. </p><p>In its briefing documents, the FDA did not actually include any voting questions for the ODAC.</p><p>Instead, the agency wants the committee on 9 July to discuss whether the INSPIRE trial results in the nonsquamous NSCLC population impact the benefit-risk assessment of necitumumab for squamous NSCLC, and if the efficacy and safety results of SQUIRE in squamous cell NSCLC support a positive benefit-risk assessment of necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the proposed population. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
