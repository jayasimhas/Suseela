<p>After posting yet another quarter of record-breaking profits on 30 April, Gilead Sciences announced that it would disperse $670m or so of those profits to shareholders in June in its first ever dividend payment. That might be an act of commercial maturity, a sign that Gilead is courting investors who are looking for both growth and dividend yield. Or it could be an act of defiance, a message from management to critics of the company's profits, ethics and transparency that Gilead plans to continue to plough its own commercial furrow.</p><p>The Q1 2015 results on 30 April revealed net profits for Gilead of $4.33bn, a profit margin of 58.5% on quarterly sales of $7.4bn, far above the norm for top tier pharmaceutical companies, and higher even than Gilead's stupendous 2014 profit margin of 48.6%.</p><p>The latest results also showed just how efficiently Gilead evolves its franchises by wrapping its antiviral compounds inside fixed dose combinations. In the three months to March 2014, the $2.7bn in sales of single-agent drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) accounted for 100% of Gilead's hepatitis C franchise sales. Twelve months on, Gilead's Hepatitis C quarterly sales are up 64% to $4.5bn but Sovaldi only accounts for 27%: the other 73% comes from the sofosbuvir-containing fixed dose combination, Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir). Harvoni was only approved in <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">October</a> 2014 by the FDA and in November 2014 by the European Commission.</p><p>Ironically, Gilead's stellar performance has created unease about the sustainability of its revenues and profit. The scale of its financial returns has meant that Gilead's drug pricing policy has long been a particular target for payers and other groups, despite there being many other companies setting far higher prices for less demonstrably effective drugs. In December 2014, pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts negotiated a significantly discounted exclusive deal with AbbVie for its interferon-free HCV drug, Viekira Pak (a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir with dasabuvir), effectively freezing out Gilead from that part of the US HCV market. That wiped nearly $30bn from Gilead's market valuation in little more than a day and, although the stock has rallied, it remains below December levels. After years of out-performing the Amex Biotech Index, Gilead has fallen 20% behind it since November 2014. That doesn't yet signal that Gilead is no longer a growth stock, but its raises the question.</p><p>And there have been other indications in 2015 that Gilead will find market conditions tougher. In February, when presenting its 2014 results, the company said that it anticipated that negotiations with payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), particularly those in the public sector (Medicaid and the Veteran's Administration), would reduce net receipts in the US from its HCV products from 78% of gross proceeds in 2014 to 54% in 2015. Bottom line: Gilead needs to generate 44% more in 2015 in gross HCV sales in the US just to equal its 2014 achievement. </p><p>More recently (28 April), a labor union group and Gilead shareholder, the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, tabled an item for Gilead's 6 May Annual General Meeting asking the company to be more up-front and transparent about payer pressure to lower prices. Its concern centers around the evidence that 28 state Medicaid programs are trying to control the cost impact of the Sovaldi franchise by measures such as limiting coverage to the sickest or demanding evidence of early viral response, and it wants to know how Gilead is handling the risk. The Trust's proposal drew the support of a shareholder lobby group, Institutional Shareholder Services, which issued a report on 23 April noting that Gilead faces both legal action and government investigations over the drugs&rsquo; pricing. </p><p>In the contexts of increasing competition from AbbVie and others and of payer pressure, Gilead's decision to offer its first dividend is intriguing. It will pay $0.43 a share, or 15.6% of its earnings, to shareholders.</p><p>To payers and others who question the pricing of Gilead's products, the decision says: "The drugs are worth it; they save lives and medical costs. Expect continued hard ball on pricing."</p><p>To those who object to the profit levels that Gilead returns, the decision says: "The company intends to maintain high profitability but it will share the proceeds more broadly &ndash; with shareholders."</p><p>To those investors who had lost faith in Gilead's approach in recent months, the decision says "Come back", and to those who have habitually invested in more conservative stocks, it says "Come in."</p><p>The dividend helps aligns corporate and shareholder interests at a time when Gilead may need as many allies as it can rally. </p>
