<p>An FDA panel of outside experts on 14 April recommended US regulators require AstraZeneca and Takeda add new safety information to the labeling of their dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors used to treat type 2 diabetes &ndash; Onglyza (saxagliptin) and Nesina (alogliptin), respectively, and their related products.</p><p>The members of the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drug Advisory Committee (EMDAC) reviewed data from the two firms' cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs), which the FDA asked makers of new diabetes drugs to complete.</p><p>AstraZeneca and Takeda were the first companies to report data from their CVOTs.</p><p>The EMDAC's advice could have implications for other DPP-4 inhibitors, including Merck's Januvia (sitagliptin), whose CVOT results are expected in June, and Boehringer Ingelheim&rsquo;s and Lilly&rsquo;s Tradjenta (linagliptin).</p><p>At issue were some concerns over increases in hospitalizations due to heart failure, along with other adverse effects, like those affecting the renal system, although the data were unclear.</p><p>The EMDAC voted 13-1, with one abstention, AstraZeneca's SAVOR CVOT study demonstrated the use of saxagliptin-containing products, which also includes Kombiglyze XR, in patients with type 2 diabetes had an acceptable cardiovascular risk profile.</p><p>All but one member of the panel voted to add safety information to the saxagliptin products. The lone panelist who didn't, the EMDAC's consumer representative, Bonnie Arkus, president of the Women's Heart Foundation, said the AstraZeneca drugs should be withdraw from the US market &ndash; a sentiment expressed earlier during the public hearing portion of the meeting by Public Citizen's Dr Syd Wolfe.</p><p>SAVOR was a large, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. </p><p>Saxagliptin successfully ruled out a 30% relative increase in CV risk captured using a three component MACE endpoint, but it failed to demonstrate CV benefit.</p><p>Results for the secondary analysis of MACE-plus were consistent with the primary analysis of MACE.</p><p>But there was a 27% increase in the rate to first event of hospitalization for heart failure in saxagliptin-treated patients &ndash; something not seen in the clinical program before approval &ndash; and the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-AstraZenecas-Onglyza-may-increase-death-risk-357841" target="_new">sensitivity analyses</a> suggested a potential increased risk of all-cause mortality in those who got the AstraZeneca drug.</p><p>"The all-cause mortality is a nagging concern," said panelist Dr Erica Brittan, deputy chief of the Biostatistical Research Branch at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But I don't think it's enough concern to evaluate that and I don't think there's any way to get an answer on that."</p><p>The heart failure actually was more of a concern to the EMDAC panelists than the potential all-cause mortality signal.</p><p>AstraZeneca pledged at the 14 April meeting to conduct a mechanistic study of its saxagliptin products to better understand the signal of hospitalization for heart failure found in the SAVOR results &ndash; something panelist Dr Thomas Wang, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said is "certainly warranted." </p><p>Panelist Dr Nakela Cook, chief of staff at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said she believed doctors could "clinically predict" who is at risk for heart failure, and that by so doing, "offers the opportunities for us to tailor the use of the drug."</p><p>Panelist Dr Peter Wilson, director of epidemiology and genomic medicine at Emory University in Atlanta, said he thought observational data could quickly answer the question of whether prescribers should stop the use of saxagliptin if a patient develops heart failure.</p><p>While panelist Dr William Hiatt, a professor of cardiology at the University of Colorado in Aurora, said a lot was learned from the SAVOR study and it "definitively answered" the questions raised by the CV signals seen with GlaxoSmithKline's drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nissen-FDA-removal-of-Avandia-restrictions-wrong-but-unlikely-to-matter-348348" target="_new">Avandia</a> (rosiglitazone) &ndash; which he said led to the FDA's December 2008 guidance calling for makers of new diabetes drugs to demonstrate their products are not associated with an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk &ndash; it did nothing to answer the more targeted questions he'd like to see, such as about heart failure risk. </p><p>Dr Hiatt said he'd rather see studies using "contemporary background therapy" to know if drugs like DPP-4s actually prolong survival.</p><p>"If they don't prolong survival, then I think the diabetes community needs to really show the surrogate A1c means something," he said.</p><p>Panelist James Neaton, a professor of statistics at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said he was "a little bit concerned about moving forward" with CVOTs altogether and warned that "we are going to be scratching our heads even more as the background therapy changes in the control arm of understanding what cardiovascular risk might be associated that we are comparing against."</p><p>"I don't feel that we have completely resolved concerns about potential cardiovascular risks with long-term use" of saxagliptin, said EMDAC chair Dr Robert Smith, a professor of medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. "I would reemphasize the importance of strategies to assess that as we move forward."</p><p>But he stressed that he was "not asking for another study to do that."</p><p>In the afternoon session, in which a larger EMDAC of 16 members discussed Takeda's EXAMINE CVOT study, the panel was unanimous in declaring the results demonstrated the use of the firm's alogliptin-containing DPP-4s &ndash; Nesina, Oseni and Kazano &ndash; in patients with type 2 diabetes had an acceptable CV risk profile.</p><p>In a 13-3 vote, the committee recommended the labeling of the alogliptin-containing drugs should be changed to add new safety information about heart failure and other potential signals, like renal concerns. </p><p>None of the panelists called for restrictions on distribution or for the alogliptin-containing DPP-4s to be removed from the market.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
