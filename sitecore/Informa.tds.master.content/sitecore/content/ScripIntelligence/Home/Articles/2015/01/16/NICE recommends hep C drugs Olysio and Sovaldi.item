<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, has given the go-ahead for two competing hepatitis C drugs to be reimbursed by the NHS; Janssen's Olysio (simeprevir) and Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir).</p><h2>Olysio</h2><p>In its final draft guidance, NICE has recommended Olysio, in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, to treat genotype 1 and 4 chronic hepatitis C in adults. </p><p>The institute deemed the drug to be cost-effective, estimating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of &pound;9,800-14,200 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for genotype 1 patients, and below &pound;20,000 per QALY for genotype 4 patients. NICE said that Olysio "dominated" both Vertex's Incivek (telaprevir) and Merck's Victrelis (boceprevir), both used in genotype 1 patients.</p><p>Janssen welcomed the decision, but noted that it is hoping for an extension to the recommendation shortly. NICE has postponed its appraisal of Olysio in combination with Sovaldi while Janssen gathers real-world data. Peter Barnes, Janssen's medical director, said: "We will continue working with NICE to provide the real world data they have requested, with the hope that it will be accepted and NICE will extend its recommendation to provide access to patients not suitable for interferon-containing regimes."</p><p>Janssen already has reimbursement approval from the Scottish Medicines Consortium (<a href="http://" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 14 October 2014).</p><p>Unconnected with the outcome of its HTA assessments, Janssen has offered a pay for performance scheme in both England and Scotland, which may ease the company's fight to compete against Gilead, which is in a strong position with blockbuster Sovaldi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-combats-Harvoni-competition-with-UK-Olysio-pay-if-you-clear-scheme-354505" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 15 October 2014). Given Sovaldi's concurrent NICE approval, and the imminent threat of market entry by Gilead's combination product Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir), Olysio could be in for a difficult future. Innovative pricing schemes, such as the one Janssen has offered, may be some help.</p><h2>Sovaldi</h2><p>Gilead's Sovaldi has been recommended in a number of patient genotypes, although NICE has put restrictions on some. Since its first draft guidance, however, NICE has expanded the number of patients for whom it is prepared to recommend the drug (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NICE-gives-Gileads-Sovaldi-green-light-353395" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 15 August 2014). Previously NICE had not recommended Sovaldi in any patients with genotypes 4-6, now it has recommended it for some (see table).</p><p>However, the surprising restriction on treatment-na&iuml;ve patients with genotype 2 remains.</p><p>Table: NICE recommendations for Sovaldi</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Â </p>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><p><b>Sovaldi in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><p><b>Sovaldi in combination with ribavirin</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Genotype</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Treatment history</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Recommendation</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Treatment history</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Recommendation</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Adults with genotype 1</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>All</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>All</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>Adults with genotype 2</p>&nbsp;</td><td rowspan="2"><p>All</p>&nbsp;</td><td rowspan="2"><p>Not licensed for this population</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Treatment-na&iuml;ve</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Only recommended for people who are intolerant to or ineligible for interferon</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-experienced</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><p>Adults with genotype 3</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Treatment-na&iuml;ve</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Only recommended for people with cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Treatment-na&iuml;ve</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Only recommended for people with cirrhosis who are intolerant to or ineligible for interferon</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Treatment-experienced</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Recommended</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Treatment-experienced</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Only recommended for people with cirrhosis who are intolerant to or ineligible for interferon</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Adults with genotype 4, 5, or 6</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>All</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Only recommended for people with cirrhosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>All</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Not recommended</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>Despite its high price, which has been criticized by many (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/France-enlists-EU-help-to-squeeze-Sovaldi-price-352910" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 16 July 2014), Sovaldi's estimated ICERs occupy a relatively low range, varying depending on comparator. In genotype 1 patients, the ICER was as low as &pound;700 per QALY gained when Sovaldi was compared to Victrelis plus ribavirin.</p><p>Final and binding guidance for both Olysio and Sovaldi is expected to be published in February. </p><p>However, NHS England has requested extra time to comply with the Sovaldi guidance and will not be obliged to implement it until July. The NHS is concerned about how it can afford to pay for Sovaldi, despite NICE's assurances of its cost-effectiveness.Gilead, which welcomed NICE's recommendation, said it was disappointed by the delay. </p>
