<p>Teva has announced a solid first quarter on the back of a strong performance from its US generics business and has modestly raised its 2015 EPS by $0.05 to $5.05-$5.35. </p><p>The Israeli firm reported total revenues of $4.89 that beat analyst estimates of $4.84bn, although down slightly from first quarter of 2014 when total revenues reached $5bn. Nevertheless, the firm says the figures would have been up by 8% were it not for the impact of foreign exchange.</p><p>The firm's generics business totaled $2.62bn, up by 9% compared with the first quarter of 2014 (up by 18% in local currency). Revenues in the US grew by 37%, mainly thanks to the launch of its generic version of AstraZeneca's proton pump inhibitor Nexium (esomeprazole). Other launches helped drive sales too, including its generic version of GSK's Lovaza (omega-3-acid ethyl esters).</p><p>However, the company's specialty portfolio did not perform so well, with revenues down by 7% compared with 2014 to reach $2bn. The decline was mainly due to lower sales of Teva's MS drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), worth $924 in the first quarter of 2015, down by 14% compared to the previous first quarter. The company puts the decline down to unusually high sales in the first quarter of 2014 because of inventory stocking in connection with the launch of Copaxone 40 mg/mL last January.</p><p>Copaxone sales are likely to take a hit from Sandoz' 20mg generic version, due to be launched in mid-2015. Nevertheless, the hit may not be so bad as Jefferies analysts point out that Teva has managed to switch many Copaxone patients to the thrice weekly 40mg version of the drug and Teva does not foresee patients switching to the generic 20mg version. Jefferies analysts agree that such switchbacks would be minimal given doctor/patient uncertainty over true bioequivalence and payer concerns that patients might switch to a more expensive drug like Biogen's Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) rather than use a generic.</p><p>Meanwhile, analysts are optimistic about the firm's "underappreciated pipeline". Phase IIb results are due in this year for Teva's anti-CGRP antagonist (TEV-48125), the first compound to demonstrate efficacy for both chronic and episodic migraines. The Jefferies analysts believe this product could make its mark in the underserved migraine market. In addition, SD-809 for three movement disorders including Huntington's disease could prove an important alternative to the only other approved drug for this disease, Lundbeck's Xenazine (tetrabenazine).</p><p>M&A will be key to shoring up the Teva's share price, say analysts. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylans-Coury-on-Teva-deal-without-logic-357962" target="_new">Teva made a $82 per share offer for Mylan</a> on 21 April that would consist of 50% cash and 50% Teva stock. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-to-Teva-we-dont-want-your-problems-358077" target="_new">Mylan rejected</a> the offer, but Teva is undeterred and will continue its pursuit of the firm. "The proposed combination of Teva and Mylan would create a leading company in the pharmaceutical industry, well positioned to transform the global generics space. The combined company would have a unique and differentiated business model addressing significant trends and discontinuities prevailing today among patients and healthcare systems around the world," said the firm in a statement about its first quarter results.</p><p>
