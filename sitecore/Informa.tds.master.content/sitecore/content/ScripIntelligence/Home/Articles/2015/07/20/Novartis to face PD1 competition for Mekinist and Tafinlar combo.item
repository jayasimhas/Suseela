<p>The $20bn Novartis-GSK mega deal has brought the Swiss firm new opportunities this week as the European Medicines Agency announced CHMP positive opinions for Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and Mekinist (trametinib) as well as Revoldade (eltrombopag). However, Datamonitor Healthcare believes that sales of the melanoma combo in unlikely to be transformational for the market or the company thanks to pricing pressures and competition from anti-PD1s.</p><p>Tafinlar and Mekinist won a green light as combination treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Joseph Hedden, a senior analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare, says the data backing up the combination is good. "They show a pretty convincing overall survival advantage for the combination over Tafinlar monotherapy. Novartis showed data at a PR event showing overall survival of 25.1 months versus 18.7." He added that combining the drugs somewhat negates the problems of treatment resistance seen in the monotherapies. </p><p>Novartis believes that Tafinlar and Mekinist, already approved as monotherapies, are potential blockbusters. However, Dr Heddon does not think that the new combo indication will bring more than a modest boost to sales of the two drugs. In the first place their commercial potential is limited because they only treat about half the overall melanoma patient population - those with the BRAF V600E mutation. </p><p>Despite the trial results supporting the drug, Mr Heddon expects "push back on price" as payers would have to fork out for two expensive drugs rather than just one. But more importantly, the combination will have to compete against anti-PD1s, Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and BMS' Opdivo (nivolumab), both approved in the EU. "They are positioned across multiple therapy lines and are therefore directly competing with Mekinist and Tafinlar as monotherapies, and now the combination therapy." He expects the anti-PD1s will eat into the share of the existing approved drugs as they are suppored by impressive data and can be used in all patients, although Dr Hedden points out that attempts to identify biomarkers are ongoing. "There is much excitement about combinations with other drug classes, and in general there is so much buzz around immunotherapy."</p><p>The news of their likely approval in combination comes more than a year after GSK withdrew the filing for the drugs in the EU after the CHMP indicated it needed more data. Both are already approved as monotherapies. </p><p>The CHMP based its positive opinion on results from the Phase III COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies. The latter showed that the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist achieved a statistically significant overall survival benefit compared to Tafinlar monotherapy. The COMBI-v study showed that the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist achieved a statistically significant overall survival benefit compared to (Daiichi Sankyo's Zelboraf) vemurafenib monotherapy.</p><p>The combo was approved in the US in 2014 through the Accelerated Approval Program, with final approval dependent on results of the Phase III MEK115306/Combi-D trial. Novartis also announced that the FDA has announced a priority review for full approval of Tafinlar and Mekinist combination in BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma.</p><h2>Revolade</h2><p>Meanwhile, Revolade, known in the US as Promacta, won a CHMP nod for adult patients with acquired severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) who were either refractory to prior immunosuppressive therapy or heavily pretreated and are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. If approved, it will be the first treatment in its class for SAA patients who have not responded to or are ineligible for existing treatments, says Novartis.</p><p>Revolade is already approved for treating thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to other treatments, and in over 45 countries worldwide for the treatment of thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts) in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow them to initiate and maintain interferon-based therapy.</p><p>Novartis said it hopes to drive sales of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-talks-up-potential-blockbusters-359554" target="_new">drug outside the US</a>, where it had little presence with GSK.</p><p>The CHMP also okayed a change to the marketing authorization for Astellas' Qutenza (capsaicin). It is now indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain. It was previously indicated for non-diabetic adults.</p>
