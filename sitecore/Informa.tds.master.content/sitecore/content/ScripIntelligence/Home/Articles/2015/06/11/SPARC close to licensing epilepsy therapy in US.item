<p>Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) is at an advanced stage of licensing discussions with potential partners for Elepsia XR (levetiracetam extended-release tablets), its epilepsy therapy that is expected to pare the pill burden for patients. SPARC is the listed spin-off R&D arm of Sun Pharma of India.</p><p>More than 55% of epilepsy patients in the US need more than six pills a day, with over 80% requiring a daily dosage of 1000-3000mg. </p><p>Elepsia XR has been approved as 1000mg and 1500mg once-daily tablets and SPARC had previously indicated that patients may pay a higher co-pay (Tier 2) compared with generics for he reduced pill burden.</p><p>In an update on its product pipeline to investors on 10 June, SPARC said that it hoped to market Elepsia XR at a significant premium to generics and is eyeing commercialization in the US by the second half of 2015&ndash;2016. </p><p>"We are in the process of finalizing an appropriate commercial arrangement for taking this product to market in the US this year," SPARC's CEO, Anil Raghavan, told investors.</p><p>Elepsia XR was approved by the US FDA in March this year and is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in epilepsy patients 12 years of age and older. </p><p>Some analysts, though, appeared less enthused about the prospects for Elepsia XR in the US, given, among other reasons, that Sun was not perhaps one of the potential licensing partners.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i> that he believed that Elepsia XR, though an NDA, will need to be benchmarked with generic pricing and to that extent justifying significant marketing costs may prove to be a challenge.</p><p>Mr Mehta, however, believes that the fact that Elepsia XR commercialization in the US is anticipated by the second half of 2015&ndash;2016, could indirectly imply that things may be on track in resolving issues at Sun Pharma's Halol unit, unless alternative supply plans had been sewn up.</p><p>Elepsia was to be manufactured at the Halol site in India, currently under a cloud over cGMP compliance issues with the FDA.</p><p>On 9 June, SPARC licensed out its Xelpros(latanoprost BAK-free eye drops) to a subsidiary of Sun Pharma for the US market, in return for an up-front payment of $3m and other milestone payments, both totalling $16m. SPARC is also eligible for certain defined royalties and additional milestone payments linked to the actual sales performance of Xelpros. </p><p>Last year the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter for the NDA for Xelpros, which has since been replied to and a response is awaited. </p><p>"The most important part of the CRL was that there was no additional demand for any clinical data or preclinical data on safety or efficacy. We have now responded to the CRL and are back in the regulatory process," Mr Raghavan said.</p><p>SPARC had previously indicated that it <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-to-launch-breast-cancer-therapy-in-India-upbeat-on-US-prospects-350306%5d" target="_new">estimates the potential patient population</a> for its product to be about 15% of patients on Pfizer's Xalatan (latanoprost ophthalmic solution) and its generics and new patients with high risk of developing ocular surface disease. </p><p>Other prominent pipeline products include SPARC's paclitaxel injection concentrate for nanodispersion (PICN), for which it has FDA "concurrence" on a Phase 3 metastatic breast cancer protocol and certain encouraging data in cholangiocarcinoma and its salmeterol and fluticasone dry powder inhaler.</p><h2>deprioritization</h2><p>The investor update also referred to the deprioritization of five SPARC clinical stage programs following a commercial assessment and portfolio reorganization. SPARC's top brass described this as part of an ongoing effort to keep its portfolio "relevant and sharp".</p><p>The deprioritized programs include SUN-L731 (a highly selective and potent LTD4 antagonist), venlafaxine ER 300mg, SUN-597 nasal/inhalation, latanoprost+timolol in the EU and baclofen GRS for alcohol dependence also in the EU. Some of these, though, are being evaluated for India and certain emerging markets, an investor presentation said.</p>
