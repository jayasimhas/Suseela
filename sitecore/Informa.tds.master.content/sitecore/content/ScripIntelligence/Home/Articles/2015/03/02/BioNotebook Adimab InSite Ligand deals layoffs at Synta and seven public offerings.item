<p>Lebanon, New Hampshire-based Adimab's new agreement with Sanofi is the drug discovery firm's second bi-specific antibody agreement in less than a month after the company revealed an expanded collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline in January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-JP-Morgan-week-deal-roundup-356162" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Sanofi has the right to develop and commercialize all bi-specific molecules that Adimab will generate for the French big pharma against multiple undisclosed targets. Sanofi will pay Adimab upfront, research and technical milestone fees for the company's discovery work. For each bi-specific antibody licensed, Sanofi will pay license and milestone fees plus royalties.</p><p>Adimab, which does not develop biologics for its own portfolio, earns all of its revenue from collaborations like the ones with GSK, Sanofi and other partners: Merck & Co, Roche, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences, Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Celgene and various small-to-mid-sized biotech companies. The company turned its first profit in 2013 after signing its original deal with GSK (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Adimab-turns-profit-on-deals-with-GSK-Biogen-345321" target="_new">27 July 2013</a>).</p><p><b>InSite licenses eye drugs to Nicox for EMEA</b></p><p>Nicox will pay Alameda, California-based InSite Vision $3m up front and up to $13.75m in milestone fees plus royalties to license AzaSite (1% azithromycin), AzaSite Xtra (2% azithromycin) and BromSite (0.075% bromfenac) for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. </p><p>AzaSite is approved in the US to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, but AzaSite Xtra is in preclinical development. InSite plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the US FDA during the first quarter of 2015 for BromSite in the treatment of inflammation and prevention of pain associated with cataract surgery (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-InSite-Opexa-AcceleronCelgene-348910" target="_new">19 December 2013</a>).</p><p>France-based Nicox plans to submit marketing authorization applications (MAAs) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by the first quarter of 2016 for AzaSite, AzaSite Xtra and BromSite and launch the products in late 2017. </p><p><b>Ligand's SERM licensed for women's health in third deal</b></p><p>Sermonix Pharmaceuticals will pay an undisclosed upfront fee and up to $45m in milestone fees plus 6% to 10% royalties to license lasofoxifene from Ligand Pharmaceuticals. It's the third agreement that Ligand has negotiated since 2011 when Pfizer gave up its rights to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) following the big pharma's acquisition of Wyeth and its SERM Conbriza (bazedoxifene). Pfizer and Ligand began working on lasofoxifene in 1991.</p><p>San Diego-based Ligand licensed lasofoxifene to Aduro Biotech for $2.7m in milestone fees plus 5% royalties in 2013 for development of a novel formulation targeting women's health (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ligand-tries-again-to-squeeze-money-from-lasofoxifene-with-Azure-licensing-deal-345233" target="_new">24 July 2013</a>). Ethicor Pharmaceuticals also acquired rights in July 2013 to make and distribute lasofoxifene as an unlicensed medicinal product in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the Indian subcontinent. </p><p>Sermonix has rights to lasofoxifene in the US and other territories, and the company plans to seek regulatory approvals in several women's health indications. Sermonix founder and CEO David Portman, who was principal investigator for Phase II and III lasofoxifene clinical trials and was actively involved during the oral drug's clinical development, said it has shown efficacy in conditions that affect women in mid-life with benefits for the vagina, bone and breast.</p><p><b>Synta's strategy shifts, requires fewer employees</b></p><p>Synta Pharmaceuticals has decided to focus its research and development on the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor ganetespib and the Lexington, Massachusetts-based company's Hsp90 drug conjugate (HDC) platform, resulting in a 20% work force reduction. Combined with prior job cuts, Synta's head count has dropped from 133 to 90 since the beginning of 2014. All future R&D outside of ganetespib and the HDC platform will be sourced from external partners. </p><p>Ganetespib is being evaluated in Phase III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clinical trials. The AML trial and Phase II trials in ovarian and breast cancer are investigator-sponsored studies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INTERVIEW-I-SPY-2-investigator-on-cancer-study-Syntas-ganetespib-350613" target="_new">13 March 2014</a>). A Phase I trial for Synta's first HDC may begin in the first quarter of 2016. Final data from the GALAXY-2 study in NSCLC are expected in the first half of 2016, followed soon after by a new drug application (NDA) submission to the US FDA if the Phase III clinical trial is successful.</p><p><b>Seven stock, warrant and debt offerings: Ultragenyx, Ziopharm, Immunomedics, Ohr, Oncothyreon, Bind, Actinium</b></p><p>The first week of February continued a frantic pace of fundraising while biotech stocks remain in favor with investors, despite currency headwinds and drug pricing battles that have plagued big pharma and large biotech stocks during year-end 2014 earnings season. </p><p>Here's a list of recent offerings that will gross $20m or more:</p><p>* Rare drug developer Ultragenyx will garner at least $162m from the sale of 3m shares priced at $54 each to fund early-stage and commercial programs. The Novato, California-based company is trading at more than two times its $21 initial public offering value from a year ago (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Ultragenyx-doubles-as-4-IPOs-enter-market-CytRx-Regado-raise-cash-349740" target="_new">1 February 2014</a>).</p><p>* Boston-based Ziopharm Oncology priced 10m shares at $8.75 each for $87.5m in gross proceeds to fund general expenses, including development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technology that it recently licensed in partnership with Intrexon from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-JP-Morgan-week-deal-roundup-356162" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>).</p><p>* Immunomedics of Morris Plains, New Jersey is selling $85m worth of 4.75% convertible senior notes due in 2020 primarily to fund an ongoing Phase III clinical trial for clivatuzumab tetraxetan, Phase II trials for IMMU-132 and IMMU-130, and to advance other programs in 2015 and beyond for cancer, autoimmune diseases and other severe indications. </p><p>* New York-based Ohr Pharmaceuticals priced 3.7m shares at $6.75 each for $25m in gross proceeds to fund clinical trials for OHR-102 in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other ophthalmology indications as well as preclinical development for other programs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ohr-sinks-on-missed-AMD-endpoint-in-interim-look-352505" target="_new">25 June 2014</a>).</p><p>* Oncothyreon in Seattle, Washington is selling 13.5m shares of common stock at $1.50 each for $20m in gross proceeds plus 1,333 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock at $1,500 per share to gross another $2m. Total net proceeds should be $20.7m. The company regained ONT-380 from Array BioPharma in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Ten-deals-and-a-breakup-GileadOno-VernalisNovartis-SorrentoNantWorks-and-more-355774" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>).</p><p>* Cambridge, Massachusetts-based nanomedicine developer Bind Therapeutics priced 3.74m units at $5.75 each for gross proceeds of $21.5m. Each unit is comprised of one common stock share and 0.6 warrants to buy another share of common stock at an exercise price of $6.60. The company's share price fell in November when Bind reported low response rates in its first-ever cancer clinical trial (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Bind-declines-on-mixed-lung-cancer-results-355152" target="_new">20 November 2014</a>).</p><p>* Actinium Pharmaceuticals is selling 4.4m shares of common stock at $4.50 each along with warrants to buy 3.3m shares at $6.50 each. The New York-based cancer drug developer will gross $20m to fund ongoing mid- and late-stage clinical trials and preclinical development.</p><p><p><p><p>
