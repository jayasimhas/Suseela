<p>Novartis's pharmaceutical sales struggled in the fourth quarter of 2014 because of increased generic competition, but its own generics division Sandoz and ophthalmology unit Alcon both saw increases in the quarter. </p><p>Overall group net sales in 4Q 2014 were $14.6bn, almost matching analyst expectations for the quarter of around $14.7bn. CEO Joe Jimenez used his time at the big pharma's annual results conference on 27 January in Basel to reassure investors that the company will continue to perform despite possible issues with the Swiss franc following a recent move by the Swiss central bank to scrap its policy of capping the currency's value. </p><p>Mr Jimenez highlighted that in 2014 the company made savings of $1.6bn through cost cutting efforts and planned to do the same or better in the coming year. He also drew attention to the fact that 78% of Novartis's costs stem from outside of Switzerland. But as a whole he said that in the current industry environment where there is such a pressure on payers Novartis must streamline business costs.</p><h2>FY 2014 takeaway figures </h2><table><tbody><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>FY 2014</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>FY 2013</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Net sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$57.9bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$57.3bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Operating income</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10.7bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10.6bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>EPS</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$4.21</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.70</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Pharma sales </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$31.8bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$32.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Alcon net sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10.8bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10.5bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Sandoz net sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$9.6bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$9.1bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p>Overall net sales for Novartis's continuing pharma products (which removed any products included in its April 2014 megadeal agreement with GlaxoSmithKline; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-NovartisGSKLilly-swapping-extravaganza-explained-351569" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 2 May 2014</a>) were $7.9bn in 4Q 2014, down from $8.3bn in same period 2013. The Swiss drug maker put the loss in large part down to generic competition for heart disease drug Diovan (valsartan). It said loss in exclusivity for Diovan impacted full year sales by approximately $2.4bn. However, Novartis's "growth products," which include Gilenya, Afinitor, Tasigna, Galvus, Lucentis, Xolair, its COPD portfolio and Jakavi, brought in a collective $3.6bn in the quarter.</p><p>Gilenya, an oral multiple sclerosis therapy, achieved the highest sales of the company's growth products, with $666m in 4Q 2014. Sales of Tasigna were $428m, Afinitor $426m, Xolair $200m, and Jakavi $84m. </p><p>Novartis's vaccines unit saw net sales decline 25% in 4Q 2014 compared with the final quarter of 2013. Total net sales for the unit reached an unexceptional $494m in the quarter. However, Novartis said solid demand across the product portfolio was driven by its meningitis franchise, which benefited from sales of Menveo, Menjugate and recently launch meningitis B vaccine, Bexsero. In October last year Novartis announced it was selling off its flu vaccines portfolio to Australian firm CSL at the knockdown price of $275m (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-sells-flu-vaccine-business-at-knockdown-rate-354672" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 October 2014</a>). It reiterated that this transaction would be closed by the end of this year. </p><p>Novartis's CEO also pinpointed the firm's positive performance in emerging markets in 2014, where sales of growth products increased 14% to $4.7bn. Mr Jimenez said the company did especially well last year in China, despite general issues for the pharma industry as a whole in the region.</p><h2>key new products</h2><p>Novartis is relying on its growth products, which have all recently launched or retain patent protection through 2018, as well as newly approved drugs, to continue the firm's progress. </p><p>David Epstein, division head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals, said during the company's results conference that Novartis's marketed portfolio was "one of the youngest in the industry". </p><p>In January 2015 Novartis gained approvals in the US and Europe for Cosentyx (secukinumab) as a treatment for psoriasis, following on from a December approval in Japan for the product as a treatment for psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis.</p><p>Mr Epstein said "in time Cosentyx will become one of the biggest products in our portfolio." He touted the drug's "superior efficacy" against current market-leading psoriasis therapies and its "very large market opportunity" as two key factors in its progress and potential. </p><p>For other key products, Novartis noted that the US FDA recently recommended approval for Sandoz's biosimilar filgrastim for use in all indications included in the reference product's (Amgen's Neupogen) label. </p><p>Meanwhile, Novartis has also filed for approval of heart failure therapy LCZ696 in the US and Europe. In the EU the CHMP has granted accelerated approval for the product, shortening its review process time. In December 2014, the big pharma also completed filings for QVA149 and NVA237 for the long-term maintenance treatment of COPD. </p><p>Mr Jimenez said: "2014 will go down in history as a great year of innovation for Novartis."</p><h2>moving into 2015</h2><p>Mr Jimenez highlighted five priorities for Novartis in 2015: strong financial results and discipline; strengthening of innovation; completion of the company's portfolio transformation; the capture of cross-divisional synergies; and continuation of plans to maintain a high-performing organization. </p><p>The company also outlined its goals for the first half of the new year, some of which it has already met with the EU and US approvals of Cosentyx. Other targets for 1H include FDA action on the new formulation, film-coated Exjade (deferasirox) tablets, regulatory filings in the US and EU for Cosentyx in two more indications (psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis), and the verdict from the EMA's CHMP on Zykadia (ceritinib) in ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>In 2015, Novartis expects net sales to grow by a mid-single digit and predicts core operating income will increase ahead of sales at a high-single digit rate. The company sees this growth following the close of the GSK transaction on 31 March 2015. </p>
