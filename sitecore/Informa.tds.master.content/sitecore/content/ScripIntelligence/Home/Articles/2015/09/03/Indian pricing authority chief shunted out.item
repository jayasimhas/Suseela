<p>Whether it is due to heavy duty lobbying by pharma or not, the controversial chief of India's apex pharmaceutical pricing authority is on his way out.</p><p>Injeti Srinivas, chairman of India's National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and someone who was seen as being at loggerheads with industry for the most part, will now move to become director general, Sports Authority of India, a government communiqu√© dated 10 March said.</p><p>The appointments committee of the cabinet has cleared Mr Srinivas's new posting, a statement from the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions said. Mr Srinivas, though, would continue to hold the position of NPPA chair on ''additional charge basis'' until the appointment of a new incumbent to the post or until further orders, whichever is earlier.</p><p>Predictably, the development elicited polarized views. Pro-health groups claimed that a ''vigilant'' regulator was being shunted under pressure from industry and suggested that India's department of pharmaceuticals needed to distance itself from pharma lobbying.</p><p>''Ideally the NPPA should be free from political and lobby pressure like the Election Commission if it intends to make a real impact,'' a health activist told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Industry, however, seemed relieved at the change of guard at the NPPA.</p><p>Some industry experts claimed that the outgoing chief was more ''activist-like'' and failed to see the difference between ''partnering with the industry and succumbing to its pressure.'' </p><p>''This is often the fate of bureaucrats who look for some autonomy in functioning. This was the case with another chairman of the NPPA earlier too in the early 2000s. The NPPA, under this chairman, unfortunately overstepped its brief a few times. While a senior ranking government official is not expected to play by industry rules, it is definitely fair to expect him to abide by the rules set by his own department,'' one industry expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic firms, told <i>Scrip</i> that any regulator typically has a ''dual role'' of protecting the interests of the consumer and the development and growth of industry, and without that balance, the availability of products would be compromised.</p><p>Others cited instances of heightened drug shortages and companies applying to discontinue production of medicines under price control over the recent past as a result of an unviable pricing policy <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-pricing-body-initiates-action-to-check-essential-meds-shortage-353854%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 12 September 2014)</a>. </p><p>The outgoing NPPA chief could not immediately be reached for a comment.</p><h2>Controversial tenure</h2><p>Mr Srinivas, who joined the NPPA in June last year, came with wide-ranging experience within the government including senior positions in the commerce ministry, but his stint with the prices regulator probably positioned him among the more controversial chiefs of this body.</p><p>Things went terribly downhill last year when the NPPA capped the prices of 108 "formulation packs" in the diabetes and cardiovascular segments, including products such as Merck & Co's Januvia (sitagliptin) and GSK's Volibris (ambrisentan), exercising certain special powers under para 19 of the Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013 &ndash; a move which pharmaceutical firms had slammed as unjustifiable <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Industry-cries-foul-as-India-caps-drug-prices-in-public-interest-352867%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 14 July 2014)</a>. Paragraph 19 authorizes the government, in extraordinary circumstances, to fix, in the public interest, the ceiling price or retail price of any drug for such period as it deems fit. </p><p>Industry went on to challenge the move in court <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-price-control-opera-in-court-but-confusion-prevails-353156%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 1August 2014)</a> and the case is ongoing.</p><p>But more drama followed and embarrassingly the NPPA was subsequently nudged to withdraw internal guidelines issued under Paragraph 19 with immediate effect. This was apparently prompted by an opinion from the Solicitor General of India, who indicated that the NPPA may have exceeded its brief by capping prices of drugs that are outside the controlled national list of essential medicines (NLEM) in India. The Solicitor General is reported to have opined that that the NPPA should excise powers under para 19 sparingly and under truly extraordinary circumstances such as an epidemic or a restricted supply of life-saving medicines <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-Court-seeks-clarity-on-price-regulators-action-354217%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 September 2014)</a>. </p>
