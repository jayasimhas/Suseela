<p>Investment company Syncona and UCL Business, the technology transfer arm of University College London, have together set up a new player in the CAR-T field, Autolus. Syncona has given the start-up a &pound;30m cash injection to get going.</p><p>Autolus's focus will be the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies for hematological and solid tumors. The company has been founded on the work of UCL's Dr Martin Pule, whom CEO Edward Hodgkin describes as "a very special individual". Mr Hodgkin, who is a partner at Syncona, told <i>Scrip </i>that Dr Pule has provided Autolus with both a pipeline of product candidates based on proprietary targets, and a series of technologies aimed at solving some of the problems associated with CAR-T.</p><p>Dr Pule, who will be chief scientific officer at Autolus, has developed two technologies which Autolus believes will differentiate its products from the rest of the market. The first is designed to better target tumor cells, and the second is aimed at controlling the activity of T-cells to overcome the severe side effects associated with CAR-T therapy. The company has not disclosed how either technology works for intellectual property reasons.</p><p>Autolus will use its &pound;30m series A funding to progress its pipeline candidates towards the clinic, and Mr Hodgkin noted that the money should be enough to take "several CAR-T products through to Phase Ib proof-of-concept." </p><p>In addition, Autolus has created ties with several London-based academic groups, in the hope of speeding up progress to the clinic. King's College London will manufacture viral vectors for Autolus, and a group at Great Ormond Street Hospital will be in charge of cell handling. Meanwhile, the Phase Ib studies will be conducted at UCL's hospital. "All this is a way of leveraging what already exists to get quickly to proof-of-concept," said Mr Hodgkin.</p><p>Autolus is currently hiring, but has already bagged Christian Itin as chair. Mr Itin was previously CEO of Micromet, which developed bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody Blincyto (blinatumumab). Blincyto was licensed by Amgen and has been approved in the US, where it sells at $178,000 per treatment course (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-prices-leukemia-drug-Blincyto-at-178000-355729" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 18 December 2014).</p><p>The company's ambition is to take its products to the market as a sustainable entity. But Autolus is starting up in what is already a competitive market, populated by big pharma players. Novartis in particular has made great strides with CAR-T therapies, presenting promising Phase II data for its acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) candidate, CTL019, at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-Novartiss-CAR-T-therapy-performs-well-in-pediatric-trial-355523" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 9 December 2014).</p><p>Meanwhile Amgen has swooped in to sign a deal for Kite Pharma's preclinical pipeline, while Kite also has products in Phase I/II (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-hangs-on-to-Kite-in-CAR-T-race-355933" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 5 January 2015). Juno Therapeutics has several clinical stage candidates (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-CAR-T-cell-therapies-generate-buzz-355536" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 10 December 2014), and Janssen and Cardio3 BioSciences have both recently joined the fray (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cardio3-acquires-broad-acting-CAR-T-portfolio-from-US-firm-Celdara-355943" target="_new">6 January 2015</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Janssen-touts-Transposagen-technology-in-CAR-T-collaboration-355247" target="_new">25 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Hodgkin noted that although many of these companies have seen "stunning efficacy" against one particular antigen, CD19, Autolus hopes to be able to reproduce this efficacy in other tumor types. Dr Pule commented, "The key will be to remain at the cutting-edge of T-cell engineering to create a new generation of programmed T-cells acting as autonomous agents to kill tumour cells. What we've seen so far in the CAR-T field is only the beginning."</p>
