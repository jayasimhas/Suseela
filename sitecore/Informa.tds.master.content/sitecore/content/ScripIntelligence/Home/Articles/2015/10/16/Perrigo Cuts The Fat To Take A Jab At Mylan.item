<p><p>Moving up its earnings call, announcing share repurchases and layoffs, and even looking at strategic options for one of its units, Perrigo is pulling no punches in the battle against Mylan NV. The generics company is determined to decrease any potential "synergies" Mylan could get out of the deal. </p><p>During an announcement of its third quarter earnings on Oct. 22 &ndash; which the company typically conducts during the first week in November &ndash; the generic drugmaker told investors that it would begin the process to sell off its US vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business. The divestment, if it should happen, will result in laying off 800 employees and will save the company $35m in operating costs. </p><p>Beyond that, Perrigo is moving several of its other functions to its base in Ireland. The company gained the Irish tax domain in its acquisition of Elan, but had only moved a few of the corporate functions there. The company is going to consolidate its operations, including supply chain and procurement management activities in Ireland and by moving its global R&D management there. Perrigo expects to realize $105m in operational and tax benefits from the move. </p><p>Both of these initiatives are meant to stick it to potential acquirer Mylan, which has promised approximately $800m in synergies over four years should its takeover of Perrigo be realized. </p><p>"Perrigo is taking out costs that Mylan would have been taking out and so this makes the deal less accretive to Mylan and thus makes the deal incrementally less attractive to Perrigo shareholders," noted UBS analyst Marc Goodman in an Oct. 22 note to investors. </p><p>Perrigo argued once again during its earnings call that the deal is not accretive and that "there is virtually no alignment between our businesses that would service the basis for generating at least $800m in synergies," said Perrigo's Chief Financial Officer Judy Brown. </p><p>"Using basic math, if you assume 25% synergy achievement in 2016 and a Perrigo shareholder ownership of 40%, this is $65m in after-tax net income benefit in 2016 to Perrigo shareholders. In contrast, the optimization actions we announced today had an effective tax rate of between 14% and 15%, which generates $94m in after-tax benefit going directly to Perrigo shareholders in 2016," she added. </p><p>Perrigo Chairman and CEO Joe Papa reiterated several times during the call that the offer from Mylan is just "a bad deal." </p><p>Mylan has been pursing Perrigo since April and has received nothing but harsh words and rebuffs from its target. Mylan took its offer hostile <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-and-Horizon-launch-their-hostile-bids-360363" target="_new">in mid-September</a>, offering Perrigo shareholders $75 in cash and 2/3 of a Mylan share per Perrigo share. Perrigo investors have until Nov. 13 under Irish takeover laws to decide to tender their shares to Mylan. The outspoken acquirer has said that it will only drop its pursuit of Perrigo if less than 50% of Perrigo's are tendered. Should more than 50% of Perrigo shares tender, Mylan will oust Perrigo's board of directors and <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-Confident-It-Will-Control-Perrigo-361040" target="_new">take control of the company</a>. </p><p><b>Not So Into M&A</b></p><p>In a further attempt to keep shareholders from handing over their shares to Mylan, Perrigo announced that it will begin a $2bn share repurchase program. $500m in shares will be repurchased in the fourth quarter &ndash; with one caveat, the buybacks won't begin until after the Mylan tender offer has expired. </p><p>While Papa believes Mylan is a bad deal, he didn't sound particularly interested in any other opportunities either. "Just because we have a bad deal in front of us from Mylan, I don't think I want to put ourselves on the shot clock to say, 'Okay, now is the time to sell the business.' You obviously see what the markets look like right now," the exec said during the call. "We think that this is not the right time to sell our company. If there is an offer that comes on the table, the Perrigo Board of Directors, as we said previously, is not against deals. We just don't want to do a bad deal."</p><p>Keeping that in mind, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-Looking-To-Make-A-Deal-360513" target="_new">Perrigo isn't against smaller M&A</a> and has said it is looking for products to add to its Omega Pharma business, which is purchased earlier this year. Perrigo promoted John Hendrickson to president of the company, a position previously held by Papa, from EVP of global operations and supply chain. "In combination with John's promotion we are streamlining the top tier of our organizational structure, increasing efficiency and enabling me to focus more time on overall strategy and executing on our M&A priorities," said Papa. </p><p><p>
