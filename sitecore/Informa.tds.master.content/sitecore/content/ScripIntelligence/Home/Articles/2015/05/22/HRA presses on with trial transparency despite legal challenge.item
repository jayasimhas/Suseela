<p>Just why the London-based CRO, Richmond Pharmacology, has decided to challenge the UK Health Research Authority's clinical trial transparency policies is still not clear, but it could well be that the CRO has the HRA's new requirement on trial registration in its sights.</p><p>On 1 April the HRA amended its policy to require trial sponsors to declare that all their clinical trials in active recruitment in the UK have been registered, including those that were approved before the trial registration requirement came into effect on 30 September 2013 &ndash; the so-called "extended compliance check".</p><p>Shortly before that, Richmond Pharmacology applied for, and has now been granted, permission to seek judicial review of the HRA's transparency policy, saying it "strongly believes" that the HRA acted unlawfully in respect of its implementation. </p><p>In a statement issued on 22 May, four days after <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper ran a story on the legal challenge, the CRO said it was "forced to bring a judicial review process because the HRA persistently refused to consider its legal position whilst making this stance clear in public meetings", and that it "looks forward to the court's decision in July". </p><p>The firm is not commenting further on the exact grounds for its challenge, and neither would its lawyer give any more details at this time. While the HRA itself could not say anything about the grounds of the claim "due to the legal sensitivities", it said in a statement that the claimant had been granted permission to proceed, "although not in respect of all its grounds of claim". </p><p>The authority pointed out that the merits of the claim were not considered at the permission stage but would be dealt with at the substantive hearing. "The HRA is due to file detailed grounds of defence shortly, and will continue to act in line with its statutory duties and responsibility to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research," it said. </p><p>However, it did provide a follow-up statement highlighting the changes that were made to the transparency policy on 1 April. "The objectives of the extended compliance check introduced in April 2015 remain unchanged and are fundamental to the HRA duties to promote research transparency," the HRA stressed. </p><p>Asked whether these changes to the policy might be one of the grounds of the CRO's challenge, the HRA said it thought that was "a reasonable conclusion to come to". Whatever the grounds, though, transparency campaigners are not best pleased by the CRO's action. </p><p>AllTrials said that the HRA had been set up to protect and promote the interests of patients and the public in health research, and to make trials more transparent, and that if the decision in the judicial review goes against it, "this fantastic work could be overturned". It noted that the HRA had consulted widely on its proposals at every stage and had received "overwhelmingly positive support". </p><p>S&iacute;le Lane, director of campaigns for Sense About Science, a co-founder of AllTrials, said it was "shocking that a company is using court action to try to stop transparency. Hidden and unregistered trials are compromising patient care, and, rightly, causing public outrage. The HRA has really led the way with its proposals to check that clinical trials aren&rsquo;t kept hidden during the trial approval process." </p><h2>Pressing on</h2><p>Meanwhile the HRA, which joined AllTrials in February 2013, is showing no signs of tempering its efforts to seek the widest possible registration of clinical trials. </p><p>In a 22 May update of its "key messages and Q&A" document, it said that it had "a duty to promote transparency and researchers, sponsors and funders correspondingly having responsibilities to participants in research, patients and the wider public and research communities". </p><p>Under the HRA policy, trials are expected to be registered in a publicly accessible registry before the first participant is recruited, and it is "a breach of the favourable ethical opinion if clinical trials are not registered within six weeks of the first participant being recruited", it says. "Increasingly others such as funders and publishers are setting standards for transparency. Some publishers will not publish studies where the study is not registered before the first participant is recruited."</p><p>While there are currently no specific sanctions for failure to observe the HRA's requirements, the authority is now looking at a number of further measures and potential sanctions for non-compliance, on which it expects to consult later this year. It says these would run "in shadow form" until the provisions of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) come into effect sometime in mid-2016. </p><p>At present, the HRA's registration requirement applies to all clinical trials of medicines, devices or other clinical interventions, although the authority approves a wide range of other studies, and is now looking at whether these might be suitable for registration too.</p>
