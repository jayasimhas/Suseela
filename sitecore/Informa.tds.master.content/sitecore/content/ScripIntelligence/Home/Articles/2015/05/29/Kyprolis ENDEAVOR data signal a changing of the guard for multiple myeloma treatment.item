<p> Amgen revealed more data from the ENDEAVOR study that further demonstrate Kyprolis's (carfilzomib; Amgen/Ono Pharmaceutical) superiority to Velcade (bortezomib; Takeda/Johnson &amp; Johnson) as a second-line treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma. </p> <p> As suggested by Datamonitor Healthcare in its <a href="https://www.futureofoncology.com/asco-2015-conference-review" target="_new">ASCO 2015 Conference Review</a>, the drug could surpass Velcade to become the multiple myeloma market leader if Amgen can also secure a first-line label expansion for Kyprolis. However, the late-stage clinical pipeline in multiple myeloma is highly active, meaning Kyprolis could face intense competition in the future. </p> <p> Amgen said in March that Kyprolis treatment resulted in a significant, two-fold improvement in PFS over Velcade, which is the current standard of care. New data presented at ASCO 2015 further demonstrate Kyprolis's superiority to Velcade. The presenter of the ENDEAVOR data, Dr Meletios Dimopoulos, went as far as to claim that Kyprolis now represents the new standard of care for multiple myeloma. </p> <p> The ENDEAVOR study recruited 929 relapsed multiple myeloma patients who had received one to three prior treatments. Participants were randomized to receive either Kyprolis or Velcade in combination with dexamethasone, with treatment cycles repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The study met its primary endpoint, with Kyprolis producing a highly significant improvement in median PFS over Velcade (18.7 months vs 9.4 months; p&lt;0.0001). Kyprolis&rsquo;s superiority over Velcade was noted irrespective of age and prior Velcade exposure. While OS data were immature, Kyprolis treatment was also associated with significantly higher ORR than Velcade (76.9% versus 62.6%) including a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing complete response (12.5% versus 6.2%). These efficacy data are striking and unequivocally show that Kyprolis is superior to Velcade for the second-line treatment of multiple myeloma. </p> <p> Kyprolis&rsquo;s tolerability was on a par with Velcade; overall study discontinuation due to TAEs was 14.0% and 15.7% for the two drugs, respectively. The incidence of TAEs was the same among both treatment groups, although Kyprolis had a slightly higher association with severe TAEs (48% versus 36%). Kyprolis therapy had a much lower association with peripheral neuropathy compared to Velcade (6.3% versus 32.0%). This is important, as peripheral neuropathy has often been a treatment-limiting adverse event with Velcade. However, higher incidences of hypertension, dyspnea, cardiac failure, and acute renal failure were observed in the Kyprolis arm compared to the Velcade arm. </p> <p> ENDEAVOR is one part of Amgen's wider expansion strategy for Kyprolis, with the company having already shown Kyprolis to be an appropriate third-line treatment for multiple myeloma. Positive ORR data from the 266-patient Phase IIb 003-A1 study supported an accelerated approval in the US in July 2012, although the drug is not yet available in the EU. Kyprolis is also undergoing review in the US and EU for the second-line treatment of multiple myeloma, using data from the ASPIRE study to support regulatory filings. ASPIRE, first presented at the 2014 American Society for Hematology annual meeting, showed that combining Kyprolis with Revlimid (lenalidomide; Celgene) and dexamethasone yielded a median PFS of 26.3 months, compared to 17.6 months for Revlimid and dexamethasone alone. These latest data from ENDEAVOR will bolster Amgen's attempts to position Kyprolis as an appropriate second-line treatment and alternative to Velcade, either as a monotherapy or as part of a combination regimen with Revlimid. </p> <p> Amgen is also targeting a first-line label expansion for Kyprolis with its CLARION study. This trial, initiated in March 2013 and due to complete by November 2017, is comparing Kyprolis to Velcade when either drug is combined with melphalan and prednisone in over 800 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Considering the success of ENDEAVOR, Datamonitor Healthcare considers it likely that Kyprolis will also demonstrate superiority over Velcade as a first-line therapy in the CLARION study. It is important to note that the 2014 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines already recommend Kyprolis as a first-line treatment option in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, even without formal regulatory approval. Nevertheless, data from CLARION will help physicians to make the appropriate choice between Kyprolis and Velcade in their newly diagnosed patients. </p> <p> Kyprolis has already enjoyed relatively strong uptake considering its entry as a third-line treatment; Amgen reported sales of $331m in 2014, its second full year on the market. This can be contrasted with $140m for Velcade in 2005, its second full year, with Velcade also having enjoyed a broader geographic launch. As Amgen launches Kyprolis across important EU and Asian markets, Datamonitor Healthcare expects its sales to continue to grow rapidly. This will be further supported by the effect of the ENDEAVOR study and potential label expansions into the second- and first-line treatment settings. It is therefore possible that Kyprolis will reach and surpass the approximately $3bn in annual sales that Velcade currently generates. </p> <p> These latest clinical data suggest that Kyprolis will emerge as a major disruptive force in the multiple myeloma market, but there are other developmental therapies that may challenge this situation in the future. The most notable of these are elotuzumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb), which targets a new pathway for multiple myeloma drugs in CS1, and ixazomib (Takeda), a potential competing proteasome inhibitor. </p> <p> Bristol-Myers Squibb presented the first pivotal data from its clinical development program for elotuzumab at ASCO 2015. The ELOQUENT-2 trial met its primary PFS endpoint, showing an additional 4.5-month benefit over the comparator arm, Revlimid and dexamethasone alone, in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. Furthermore, ORR was significantly higher in the elotuzumab arm compared with the control arm (79% versus 66%). While the magnitude of the PFS benefit for elotuzumab in this trial compared to Kyprolis's 8.7-month improvement in ASPIRE was lower, the potential emergence of a new drug class is exciting for the multiple myeloma market. Furthermore, Bristol-Myers Squibb is also conducting further clinical development of elotuzumab as a combination with Velcade in relapsed multiple myeloma, as well as in newly diagnosed patients in combination with Revlimid. </p> <p> Takeda's ixazomib represents a more direct threat to Kyprolis, being a member of the same drug class and also an orally formulated drug. It is likely to share the proteasome inhibitor class's broad spectrum of efficacy and be appropriate for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, as well as heavily pretreated relapsed patients. Takeda has already announced that its TOURMALINE-MM1 study, in which ixazomib was administered alongside Revlimid and dexamethasone, met its primary PFS endpoint, although no details on the magnitude of benefit are known. Like Kyprolis, ixazomib is associated with a much lower incidence of peripheral neuropathy, which when combined with its oral administration may provide compelling competition for the other proteasome inhibitors. </p> <p> This article forms part of Datamonitor Healthcare's <a href="https://www.futureofoncology.com/asco-2015-conference-review/" target="_new">ASCO 2015 Conference Review</a>. </p> <p>
