<p>The head of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) &ndash; the National Institutes of Health (NIH) center created in late 2011 to serve as the US hub for catalyzing advancements in translational science &ndash; likes to say his agency is all about getting "more treatments to more patients more quickly."</p><p>And for NCATS, a big part of doing that is figuring out how best to predict which drugs work most effectively in which diseases with the fewest adverse effects. </p><p>Basically, the agency is working on developing a crystal ball for drug R&D &ndash; or actually, a few of them.</p><p>Indeed, NCATS has several initiatives and programs it's tackling.</p><p>Most recently, NCATS got to claim somewhat of a victory when research the agency supported through its "Discovering New Therapeutics Uses for Existing Molecules" program resulted in the finding that a shelved drug from AstraZeneca, saracatinib (AZD0530), a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which initially was developed for cancer, but failed, had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Failed-AstraZeneca-cancer-drug-provides-hope-for-Alzheimers-357609" target="_new">positive preclinical results in Alzheimer's</a> &ndash; providing new hope for that disease and the first "fruit" of the agency's program. </p><p>The idea behind the New Therapeutics Uses program, said NCATS chief Dr Christopher Austin, was to have sort of a "Match.com" to bring together academic investigators with compounds no longer being developed by biopharmaceutical companies and rescue those medicines for new uses, or repurposing.</p><p>The agency <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-big-pharmas-join-NCATS-project-to-dust-off-shelved-drugs-331710" target="_new">started with nine projects</a> under the program, he said, adding that another one of them also is close to reaching a major milestone &ndash; possibly in about three months.</p><p>While repurposing drugs that already have gone through the preclinical and human safety studies could help get medicines to the market sooner, NCATS also is working on ways to better screen compounds so that one day, those early tests may perhaps be a thing of the past &ndash; allowing researchers to know before an agent is tried out in animals and humans whether it is safe or toxic and the likelihood of its effectiveness against a certain disease. </p><p>Using robots, NCATS currently is running high throughput tests on 500,000 chemical agents per week at multiple doses to test their dose-response curves. </p><p>The agency has now generated about 600 million dose-response relationships &ndash; the most in pharmacological history, Dr Austin told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Previously, there had only been about 1 million, he said.</p><p>Dr Austin noted that most of the compounds that exist have no known activity in the human biological systems.</p><p>Ideally, he said, scientists should be able to say, "This is the target. Tell me the drug that works against it."</p><p>But, Dr Austin lamented, for many diseases, "We currently have no idea."</p><p>"The fact we need the robots is a tacit admission we have no idea what we are looking for because we have to test 500,000 random compounds," he said. </p><p>While right now it may appear NCATS is searching for a location without a map &ndash; going in numerous directions, with the potential that with luck, it will eventually find the site &ndash; ultimately, the agency wants to create the "Google Map" for drug R&D, Dr Austin said.</p><p>"We are topographers" attempting to figure out "the rules Mother Nature is trying to tell us," he declared. </p><p>Another program NCATS is working on to better predict a drug's safety and effectiveness before testing it in humans, and therefore streamlining the R&D process, is its tissue chip initiative, in which it is partnering with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, part of the Department of Defense, and the FDA.</p><p>The agency's are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-backs-NCATS-reveals-plans-to-move-ideas-from-lab-to----market-321330" target="_new">collaborating</a> to develop 3-D tissue chips loaded with human cells, which are intended to model the structure and function of human organs, like lungs, livers, hearts and kidneys, with the idea to ultimately combine the chips into an integrated system that could mimic the complex functions of the human body.</p><p>Then, Dr Austin said, compounds could be tested on the chips to tell if the agents are toxic and show activity against specific diseases.</p><p>If the chips are successful, scientists could avoid using animals altogether for toxicity testing, he said. That is, as long as no organization advocating for the ethical treatment of chips pops up and protests, Dr Austin quipped. </p><p>He said the research on the chips is moving much faster than NCATS and its partners initially thought it would &ndash; with the projects well ahead on reaching their milestones.</p><p>Dr Austin said the validation data, which is about a year away, likely will show some of the chips may not respond the way they are intended and may need to be reengineered.</p><p>"This is going to be an evolution," he said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr Austin said there is great potential the tissue chips could be available for use in as little as three years.</p><p>Having such a tool, he said, could prevent drug makers from pursuing compounds that are too toxic or have no activity in a disease &ndash; ultimately saving untold dollars and time. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Former-FDA-chief-Hamburg-takes-Institute-of-Medicine-job-357672" target="_new">Former FDA chief Hamburg takes Institute of Medicine job</a></p><p>Former FDA chief Dr Margaret Hamburg waited only a few days before leaping into a new job with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), where she is serving as the new foreign secretary.</p><p>In her new role, Dr Hamburg, whose last day at the FDA was 4 April, is serving as a senior adviser on international matters to the IOM's president, Dr Victor Dzau, and the organization's council.
