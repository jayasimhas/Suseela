<p>The Israeli company Can-Fite BioPharma's Phase II/III trial of its lead product CF101 has failed to meet its primary endpoint in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. This was the second major failure for the product, a first-in-class A3 adenosine receptor agonist, after disappointment<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Can-Fites-CF101-fails-in-PhIII-dry-eye-study-349038" target="_new"> in a Phase III trial in dry eye syndrome</a> at the end of 2013, and shares in the firm on the New York Stock Exchange dropped by 60% to close at $2.20 on 30 March.</p><p>The 326-patient study used Psoriasis Area Sensitivity Index (PASI) score relative to placebo treatment as the primary endpoint, with the secondary endpoints including Physicians' Global Assessment (PGA) score and various safety parameters.</p><p>CF101 was found to be safe and well tolerated but the proportion of patients treated with CF101 who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in disease severity at week 12 (PASI 75) was 8.5% versus 6.9% in the placebo group. For PGA, 6.4% of patients treated with CF101 achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 12 compared with 3.4% of the placebo patients. </p><p>"We are disappointed that our trial did not meet its primary endpoint. Regretfully, in the PASI 75 and PGA we did not see any real effect in patients over placebo. We have not yet completed our analysis of secondary endpoint and sub-group analysis and intend to complete it in the near future. Can-Fite is continuing its research and development efforts in relation to its drugs and indications in the pipeline," said CEO Dr Pnina Fishman. </p><p>Despite its potential for oral dosing, the proportions of patients achieving PASI 75 with CF101 fell way short of those seen with other novel injectable anti-inflammatory agents. Recently Boehringer Ingelheim <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BI-enters-psoriasis-fray-by-knocking-out-Stelara-357415" target="_new">reported impressive Phase II results</a> for its anti-IL23 product BI-655066, when pitted against the current standard of care, ustekinumab (Johnson & Johnson's Stelara) in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 77.1% of BI-655066 patients achieved the more stringent PASI 90 measure compared with 40% of Stelara patients. Secondary endpoint measures showed 90% of BI 655066 patients had clear or almost clear skin versus 67.5% for ustekinumab using sPGA (static Physician Global Assessment).</p><p>Even so, Can-Fite says it is preparing a Phase III trial for the oral small-molecule A3 adenosine receptor agonist in another inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, again an area of increasing competition.</p><p>Can-Fite is also developing two other adenosine A3 receptor modulators: CF102 in cancers, including colon, prostate and melanoma; and CF602 in erectile dysfunction. </p><p>The only other company that appears to be developing an adenosine A3 agonist product is South Korean firm Huons, which has a product HU-010 in Phase II for ischemic stroke. </p><p>
