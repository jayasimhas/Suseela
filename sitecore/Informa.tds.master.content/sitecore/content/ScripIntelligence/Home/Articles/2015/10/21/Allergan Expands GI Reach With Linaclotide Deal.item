<p>Allergan PLC is bolstering its gastrointestinal portfolio by purchasing rights from the Spanish drug maker Almirall SA to sell US-based Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc's GI drug linaclotide in the 28-nation European Union, Switzerland, Turkey and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Mexico. </p><p>Linaclotide is currently approved in the US, where Allergan co-promotes the drug with Ironwood under the name Linzess to treat adults with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), as well as in a number of other countries for adults with IBS-C including in the EU, where the therapy is marketed as Constella. Ironwood, headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., is also partnering with AstraZeneca PLC of the UK to develop and market linaclotide in China, and has worked with Astellas Pharma Inc to co-develop and commercialise the medicine in Japan. </p><p>"This agreement allows us to add Constella to our existing GI portfolio in select countries internationally and paves the way for future GI treatments in our own pipeline," said Paul Navarre who heads Allergan's international brands division. The Dublin, Ireland-based group's therapeutic focus includes the central nervous system (CNS), eye care, gastrointestinal (GI), women's health, cardiovascular, infectious disease and urology drugs.</p><p>Commenting on the transaction, announced Oct. 27, Ironwood's chief commercial officer Tom McCourt noted in a statement that "Constella is the only prescription product approved for IBS-C patients in Europe, providing them with a treatment option that can improve symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and constipation which are associated with this disorder." Estimates indicate that 10% to 15% of Europe's population suffers from irritable bowel syndrome. One-third of patients with IBS are thought to have IBS-C and suffer chronically from both abdominal pain and constipation. </p><p>A spokesperson for Almirall in Barcelona, Spain said that the deal was good news for the Spanish drug maker, "as we will be able to dedicate more resources to increase promotion of products in our existing portfolio and to the future needs linked to business development projects. This agreement will help Almirall accelerate its strategy of focusing on dermatology, which will drive the future growth of our company." European sales figures have not been reported by Almirall or Ironwood, but the product was not included in the Spanish firm's 15 top-selling drugs for 2014, the smallest of which reported 2014 sales of &euro;14.7m. </p><p>Linaclotide was originally cleared by the FDA in August 2012 to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) at a daily dose of 145 mcg and for the treatment of IBS-C at a daily dose of 290 mcg. Revenue from sales of the drug in the US could grow if Allergan is able to win FDA approval for a low-dose formulation of linaclotide to treat CIC. A Phase III clinical trial in CIC will be completed during the second half of 2015 and Allergan expects to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA in the first half of 2016 for the low-dose Linzess (Linaclotide) formulation.</p><p>Linaclotide was approved in 2012 in the EU by the bloc's executive body, the European Commission. It was approved in Mexico two years later as a treatment for adults suffering from IBS-C or CIC under the brand name Linzess and marketed there by Almirall through a sublicense from Allergan. Allergan is commercialising linaclotide in Canada under the brand name Constella. </p><p>In its second-quarter update in August, Allergan said US sales of Linzess for IBS-C rose 79% year-over-year to $112.1m for the quarter, thanks to a DTC advertising campaign and the conversion of patients on OTC products. </p><p>Allergan did not disclose how much it paid to license Constella.</p><p>
