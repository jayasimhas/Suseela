<p>'No surprise' apparently, as GW Pharmaceuticals and Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc. report negative top-line results from the remaining two Phase III trials of their cannabis extract product Sativex (nabiximols) for the treatment of pain in advanced cancer patients who experience inadequate analgesia during optimized chronic opioid therapy. </p><p>The result was consistent with data from the first Phase III trial, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Surprise-Phase-III-failure-of-GWOtsukas-Sativex-in-cancer-pain-356019" target="_new">which had come as a surprise</a>, at the start of the year.</p><p>Sativex is approved in 27 countries outside the US and launched in 15 as a treatment for MS spasticity. However, Otsuka &ndash; which holds US rights to the product &ndash; has been pursuing cancer pain as the initial US target indication for Sativex. Under the terms of GW's agreement with Otsuka, Otsuka is responsible for funding the cancer pain program. GW has not been pursuing the cancer pain indication outside of North America.</p><p>A pre-specified pooled analysis of patients across the two Phase III trials which involved clinical sites in the US (one of which was the earlier failed trial) showed a statistically significant improvement for Sativex compared with placebo (p=0.024), with several secondary efficacy endpoints exhibiting p-values of less than 0.05. GW and Otsuka have submitted a request to meet with the US FDA to discuss the clinical relevance of these data.</p><p>"In light of the missed primary endpoint in the first trial earlier this year, these additional results are not a surprise," said GW's CEO Justin Gover. However, he was "encouraged" by data which showed positive outcomes for US patients when analyzed as a separate cohort. "We believe that this finding may provide important guidance in determining the optimal target patient population for Sativex and look forward to a discussion with the FDA on a potential path forward."</p><p>According to the companies, 'Trial 2' was "in favor of Sativex" and approached statistical significance for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (p=0.085). The trial recruited 397 patients at clinical sites in the US, Mexico and Europe, with 30% of the trial population from the US. Patients received Sativex or placebo as adjunctive treatment to optimized opioid therapy and remained on stable doses of their background opioid therapy during the study. </p><p>A third study, which was conducted entirely outside the US and which used a different clinical design, failed to show separation from placebo on the primary endpoint.</p><p>In 2013 GW filed an IND with the FDA to conduct a pivotal Phase III program to evaluate Sativex for MS spasticity in the US. This program would also have been funded by Otsuka. GW said in 2014 that a special protocol assessment (SPA) was ongoing with the FDA for MS spasticity.</p><p>
