<p>Scientists at Janssen (Johnson & Johnson, formerly Crucell Vaccine Institute) have found a way to induce antibodies that could lead to the development of an effective universal flu vaccine and eliminate the need for annual injections. </p><p>Previous research has shown that some people can produce antibodies that can protect against many subtypes of influenza because they target a site on the influenza virus that does not mutate rapidly &ndash; the hemagglutinin (HA) stem which attaches the virus to target cells. But these broadly neutralizing antibodies are rare. </p><p>Working with colleagues at The Scripps Research Institute, the researchers using a rational design and library approach to engineer stable HA stem antigens (&lsquo;mini-HAs&rsquo;) based on an H1 subtype sequence. Reporting their work in the journal <i>Science</i> (Aug. 24), the scientists said they have produced one that exhibited structural and broadly neutralizing antibody binding properties comparable to full-length HA. It completely protected mice in lethal challenge models, and reduced fever following sublethal challenge in cynomolgus monkeys.</p><p>Antibodies elicited by this mini-HA in mice and nonhuman primates bind a wide range of HAs, compete with human broadly neutralizing antibodies for HA stem binding, neutralize H5N1 viruses, and mediate antibody-dependent effector activity, the researchers found. </p><p>"This study shows that we're moving in the right direction for a universal flu vaccine," said Ian Wilson, Hansen Professor of Structural Biology and chair of the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology at TSRI. "If the body can make an immune response against the HA stem, it's difficult for the virus to escape." The HA stem is so vital for virus replication that mutations in it are unlikely to survive. The next step is to see whether these results can be repeated in humans. </p><p>Janssen is not alone in seeking to rid patients of the need for annual flu jabs. The most advanced in this area appears to be BiondVax Pharmaceuticals and Immune Targeting Systems which both have candidates at Phase II. Inovio has a product in Phase I testing while around 12 other companies are investigating preclinical candidates. Current major players in the annual flu vaccine area include Novartis, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>
