<p>India is expected to ease restrictions around the availability of oseltamivir as it grapples with a surge in cases of influenza A H1N1 amid allegations of shortages of key medicines. </p><p>India's Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB), the highest technical body under the country's Drugs and Cosmetics Act, has recommended that oseltamivir be permitted to be sold as a Schedule H1 drug, rather than with tighter controls under Schedule X of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules.</p><p>The DTAB's recommendation, when notified by the government, is expected to improve availability of the drug significantly opening up sales of the product across India's estimated 600,000 plus chemists, subject to certain conditions under Schedule H1. </p><p>The DTAB, whose members include India's director general of health services Dr Jagdish Prasad and the Drugs Controller General of India, Dr GN Singh, was of the view that oseltamivir has been in use in many countries and there have been no reports of resistance being developed, details of the minutes of a 16 February meeting of the body said. </p><p>The DTAB agreed that the previous notification of 2009 restricting sales of the drug under Schedule X be withdrawn.</p><p>The Indian generic firm Cipla had earlier made a representation arguing that the restrictions imposed under Schedule X had impacted the sale of the drug.</p><p>India had in 2009 placed oseltamivir in Schedule X amid concerns that indiscriminate and unregulated access to the medicine could lead to the H1N1 virus developing resistance to the drug thereby rendering it ineffective.</p><p>As a result only chemists who hold a licence to stock and sell drugs specified under schedule X of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules [there are an estimated 2,500 such licensees] can currently dispense such medicines against prescriptions. Schedule X also requires patients to produce two copies of the prescription, one of which will need to be retained by the chemist for about two years. Every distributor, stockist and dealer holding stocks of drugs such as oseltamivir under Schedule X is also required to submit to the concerned licensing authority in the state or union territory, a monthly statement, with details on the quantity of such drugs available with them. </p><p>While the Indian government has maintained that there is ''no shortage of drugs or any other logistics'', local media reports have highlighted several instances of non-availability of oseltamivir. The pharmaceutical industry has, however, claimed that this is a result of the government's own 'restricted' sales policy <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Drugs-shortage-or-not-H1N1-claims-600-lives-in-India-356819%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>A potential shift to Schedule H1 is expected to ease availability concerns, though drugs under this schedule also require record keeping by pharmacies and specified boxed labelling by pharmaceutical companies. </p><p>Supply of drugs specified in Schedule H1 are required to be recorded in a separate register at the time of the supply giving the name and address of the prescriber, the name of the patient/drug and the quantity supplied. Schedule H1 is currently aimed at curbing the indiscriminate use of certain third and fourth generation antibiotics, certain habit forming medicines and anti-TB drugs. </p><p>India has reported 841 deaths and 14,673 cases of influenza A H1N1 between January and 22 February this year &ndash; the loss of lives already way ahead of 2014's figures of 218 swine flu deaths and 937 cases. Ahmedabad city in the state of Gujarat, one of those severely hit, had recently issued prohibitory orders against mass public gatherings as part of efforts to control the spread of the disease.</p>
