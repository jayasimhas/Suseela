<p>SciClone Pharmaceuticals has picked up rights in China and other selected Asian markets to Theravance Biopharma's antibiotic Vibativ, expanding its regional anti-infective portfolio and providing its new partner with access to a potentially large market opportunity where resistance problems are spreading.</p><p>Under the deal, SciClone gains exclusive development and commercialization rights in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Vietnam to Vibativ (telavancin), Theravance once-daily injected lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, which it will develop initially for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP).</p><p>"We really saw an alignment of goals, objectives and capabilities. SciClone already has an established business in China and was looking for products in acute care, and there was a good match of strategic interests," Theravance chair and CEO Rick Winningham told <i>Scrip's</i> sister publication <i>PharmAsia News.</i> "We are continuing to build a global network of regional and market partnerships and wanted to add SciClone as they understand the market in China."</p><p>The alliance is worth $6m in upfront and regulatory milestone payments to Theravance, which will also supply clinical and commercial quantities of the drug to its new partner at an agreed transfer price.</p><p>Neither Winningham nor SciClone president and CEO Dr Friedhelm Blobel would disclose additional financial details such as any royalty arrangements, although these may be released as the product progresses through development, Mr Winningham stressing that the supply deal would provide a revenue stream for Theravance.</p><p>He noted that the two companies would also continue to discuss potential additional indications, which include complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and bacteremia, Dr Blobel confirming that "these have not been excluded." Mr Winningham pointed to the broad potential of telavancin, noting that blood infections were another area where studies are already underway in the US.</p><h2>expansion and presence</h2><p>The new alliance marks a continuation of Theravance's strategy of seeking licensing out agreements for Vibativ in global markets, where it already has deals with various companies including in Europe, Russia, Canada and the Middle East.</p><p>The South San Francisco-based firm will continue to look for partners in other regions and "we expect further regional deals such as in Korea, Japan and Asia over time," Mr Winningham said.</p><p>In China, SciClone was seen as attractive due to its capabilities and market presence, he said. The company is based in Foster City, California but has its main commercial business in China, where it has infrastructure ranging from regulatory affairs through clinical development to commercial operations.</p><p>SciClone will be responsible for, and will fund, all development, regulatory and commercial activities for Vibativ in its territories as part of the alliance.</p><p>"We see Vibativ as a great addition to our portfolio. We are focused on differentiated products and it will fit well with our main product Zadaxin in the anti-infective area," Dr Blobel said.</p><p>Telavancin, which acts on both bacterial cell wall synthesis and cell membrane function, is already commercialized in the US for HABP/VABP caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> when other treatments are not suitable, and adults with cSSSI caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains (MRSA) of <i>S aureus</i>. It is also approved in Europe for similar uses.</p><p>Telavancin faced setbacks in the West after being taken off both the US and EU markets for several years after it was first launched, but this was due to concerns with a former manufacturer rather than drug itself. Re-launches took place in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and Theravance has since conducted several new analyses and studies to support the re-introductions and to differentiate telavancin from vancomycin, from which the molecule was re-engineered.</p><p>Dr Blobel pointed to synergies in China with Zadaxin (thymalfasin; synthetic thymosin alpha 1), an immunostimulant which is approved for various uses in the country including chronic hepatitis B and as a vaccine enhancer.</p><p>Both he and Mr Winningham highlighted the spread of resistance to penicillin and similar antibiotics as well as to vancomycin in China, which MRSA is also spreading. "There is important clinical need for products such as Vibativ," Dr Blobel stated, also pointing to its suite of clinical studies for multiple resistant Gram-positive infections.</p><h2>China development plans</h2><p>"At the base case, we are assuming that we will have to do a clinical study in China to get approval, and this could be a multi-year process" Dr Blobel told <i>PharmAsia News.</i></p><p>"However, there could be room for an accelerated approval pathway due to the possibility of emergency use in patients in whom vancomycin can't be administered. In addition, 64 Chinese patients were included in the global trials for telavancin, giving us at least some experience in this population."</p><p>A local trial in around 250 patients would normally be required, but there might be some flexibility for a post-marketing study in conjunction with the existing data, he observed. But the exact approach for a regulatory application has yet to be discussed with authorities, "and it is difficult to give timelines at this stage. There is also a 12-month queue for applications," he noted.</p><p>Assuming Vibativ is approved, SciClone would plan to set up a dedicated commercial team for the drug in China, and to expand this in parallel with sales, Dr Blobel said. "The Zadaxin team would also open doors and we certainly expect to see synergies there."</p><p>Late last year, SciClone also acquired exclusive rights in China to two cardiovascular drugs from the US firm The Medicines, Angiomax (bivalirudin) and Cleviprex (clevidipine).</p><p>This article was also published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/29/takeda-offers-24bn-nofault-settlement-of-actos-suits" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
