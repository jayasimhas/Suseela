<p>There is no proven benefit for either Dendreon's prostate cancer treatment Provenge (Sipuleucel-T) or Gilead's Zydelig (idelalisib) for follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, according to IQWiG, Germany's health technology appraisal body. </p><p>The institute has conducted two separate assessments as part of the AMNOG pricing and reimbursement process and the findings could not only impact the price the drugs eventually achieve, but also whether or not doctors are likely to prescribe them.</p><p>If the GBA, the body in charge of the AMNOG assessments, agrees that there is no proven additional benefit, it will be harder for the companies to convince the GKV, the association of sick funds, that they deserve a better price than the comparators set out by the GBA. </p><p>In addition, sick funds and physician associations often use an assessment concluding no added benefit to dissuade doctors from prescribing the drug, according to Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Tijana Ignjatovic. However, how closely physicians follow this advice will depend on what they themselves think of a drug's benefits, she adds. Therefore, if the GBA does not alter the assessment, Provenge will likely fare poorly against Zytiga, which did win an endorsement for additional benefit, said Dr Ignjatovic. Meanwhile, how well Pharmacyclics/Johnson & Johnson's Imbruvica performs in the ongoing AMNOG assessment could affect Gilead's prospects for Zydelig, she added.</p><p>Gilead, claimed IQWiG, did not provide suitable data to support Zydelig's benefits over the comparators selected by the GBA. For refractory follicular lymphoma, the GBA chose best supportive care as the comparator. For CLL, there were several scenarios: best supportive care for both treatment-na&iuml;ve patients and patients with relapsed and refractory CLL if another chemotherapy or other tumor-targeted treatments are not an option; in relapsed CLL patients for whom further chemotherapy is possible the comparator was chemotherapy in combination with rituximab; in refractory CLL in which antineoplastic treatments are an option, the comparator was to be individually optimized treatment specified by the physician.</p><p>However, none of the data provided met the specifications. For instance, IQWiG complained that Gilead went against the GBA's specifications by combining in its analysis patients with relapsed and refractory CLL, which lead to "deviations regarding the appropriate comparator therapy". </p><p>Moreover, in making its case for patients with refractory follicular lymphoma and for two treatment situations of CLL, Gilead only used results from one-arm studies without adequately comparing the results with the appropriate comparator.</p><p>For Provenge, the GBA gave Dendreon three comparator options, and the firm chose watchful waiting while maintaining hormone blockade (conventional androgen deprivation therapy). </p><p>Meanwhile, IQWiG was unable to meaningfully interpret mortality data and complained that there was a risk of bias in the studies because a large number of patients in the trials supporting the drug were able to change treatment. </p><p>The institute also added that there were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for further patient-relevant outcomes, including morbidity and certain side-effects. Therefore there was no evidence of added benefit, said IQWiG. </p><p>
