<p>The FDA on Aug. 18 unveiled a newly revised manual of policies and procedures (MAPP) intended to improve the communications between regulators reviewing abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and the companies that have submitted them.</p><p>The changes to the MAPP, <i>Communications with Industry with Respect to Pre-GDUFA Year Three Abbreviated New Drug Applications</i>, came about after industry had complained about the initial document, released in September 2013.</p><p>The FDA said the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/UCM369599.pdf" target="_new">revised MAPP</a> document would enable the agency's generic drug program staff to proactively communicate with companies about the review status of their ANDAs and provide advance notice of critical regulatory correspondence. </p><p>The purpose of the earlier version of the FDA's MAPP was to direct all applicant communications to the regulatory project manager (RPM).</p><p>But, an agency official told a small group of reporters, "Industry strongly complained that in practice the effect of the MAPP was to limit communications between applicants and FDA."</p><p>"Industry expressed very strong concerns that without some information concerning the review status of submissions and the potential timing of action on submissions it was very difficult for applicants to plan product launches and to conduct other types of very important business planning," the official said.</p><p>In short, he said, generic drug makers felt the MAPP was "disruptive and unhelpful."</p><p>But the FDA listened to industry's strong concerns, "and upon reflection, agreed with many of them," the official said.</p><p>"Even though it's novel to revise a MAPP in response to strong industry concerns, we worked with industry to try to identify exactly what the pain points were and then revised our policies to dramatically expand communications between RPMs and others in FDA concerning the review status of submissions, deficiencies and potential times for actions," he said.</p><p>The revised policies and procedures already have been in place for the past couple of months, with members of the generic drug industry declaring that communication transparency has "improved substantially," the FDA official told reporters.</p><p>The MAPP is intended to primarily be used by regulators in the Office of Generic Drugs and the Office of Pharmaceutical Quality, although it may apply to others at FDA, given review efforts on ANDAs cut across several areas of the agency, officials said.</p><p>They noted that the RPM is the key person responsible for a series of communications with industry.</p><p>"From their view, it starts with when the application is filed," an FDA official said.</p><p>The RPM, he added, is assigned as the "champion" for the ANDA.</p><p>And if for any reason that person is reassigned, the new RPM would be expected to make a new introductory phone call to the company.</p><p>The MAPP lays out step-by-step how the communication process should go, including letting the applicant know the target action date assigned to the particular application so they have an idea when the FDA anticipates completion of all the necessary reviews for the product.</p><p>"There is little in the way of mandates that help companies navigate when decisions are going to be made, so we've created our own target action dates to try to help people get a better understanding what's going on," the FDA official said. "We've matured to the point where we can release these dates to the companies themselves. That is going to be an important communication early on in the process from the company's perspective."</p><p>David Gaugh, senior vice president of sciences and regulatory affairs at the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, welcomed the revised MAPP &ndash; declaring his organization was "pleased to see progress is beginning to be made in efforts to enhance communications and transparency" between the FDA and generic manufacturers. </p><p>The revised MAPP, he told <i>Scrip</i> in a statement, "shows that the FDA is committed to making continued process improvements that can lead to more meaningful, transparent communication throughout the application and approval process." </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
