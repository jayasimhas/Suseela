<p>Nektar Therapeutics says topline results from its Phase III BEACON study evaluating single-agent NKTR-102 in patients with advanced breast cancer show that it failed to meet its primary endpoint. However, the company still sees a future for the drug in certain subsets of patients. </p><p>The 852-patient study saw women treated with NKTR-102 live an average of 12.4 months compared with 10.3 months for those in the control group, which was not statistically significant.</p><p>However, in two sub-group analyses, in women whose cancer had spread to the brain and to the liver, the results were more promising. </p><p>In patients with brain metastases, those receiving NKTR-102 lived for an average of 10.0 months compared to 4.8 months. In patients with liver metastases, NKTR-102 showed an improvement of 10.9 months versus 8.3 months.</p><p>"Given the significant need for new drugs to treat patients living with advanced breast cancer, we will be exploring potential regulatory paths forward for NKTR-102 in metastatic breast cancer. We've shared these data with the key investigators and they have clearly expressed that these results, particularly those in patients with brain and liver metastases, are very important and clinically meaningful for patients with this devastating disease," Nektar told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p><b>trial details</b></p><p>BEACON compared NKTR-102 to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician's choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.</p><p>In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, NKTR-102 provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival (OS) over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving NKTR-102 compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC). Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the NKTR-102 group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which was not significant. </p><p>In a pre-specified subgroup of patients with a history of brain metastases, NKTR-102 showed an improvement of 5.2 months in median OS (10.0 months compared to 4.8 months, n=67, HR 0.51, p-value < 0.01).="" the="" proportion="" of="" patients="" with="" brain="" metastases="" with="" 12-month="" survival="" was="" 44.4%="" in="" the="" nktr-102="" arm="" as="" compared="" to="" 19.4%="" in="" the="" control=""></p><p>In a pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry, NKTR-102 showed an improvement of 2.6 months in median OS (10.9 months versus 8.3 months, n=456, HR 0.73, p-value < 0.002).="" in="" these="" patients="" with="" baseline="" liver="" metastases,="" the="" proportion="" of="" patients="" with="" 12-month="" survival="" was="" 46.9%="" in="" the="" nktr-102="" arm="" as="" compared="" to="" 33.3%="" in="" the="" control=""></p>
