<p>Partners AbbVie and Roche's Genentech scored an important win for their B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in a Phase II clinical trial that met the study's primary endpoint in hard-to-treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, setting the stage for potential accelerated approval.</p><p>Venetoclax could boost AbbVie's position in oncology generally and CLL specifically following the company's recent $21bn acquisition of Pharmacyclics and its blockbuster CLL drug <i>Imbruvica</i> (ibrutinib) &ndash; the second marketed oncology drug in AbbVie's portfolio. US and EU approvals for venetoclax also would help Roche/Genentech protect its long-time leadership position in CLL with <i>Rituxan</i> (rituximab) and <i>Gazyva</i> (obinutuzumab).</p><p><b>Positive Results</b></p><p>AbbVie intends to submit applications seeking US FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals based on data from a Phase II trial in which a clinically meaningful proportion of relapsed, refractory and previously untreated CLL patients with a 17p deletion achieved an objective response.</p><p>AbbVie and Roche reported top-line results from the open-label, single-arm study on Aug. 12 noting that the primary endpoint &ndash; the objective response rate (ORR) among individuals with CLL who failed previous treatment and those who had not undergone chemotherapy &ndash; had been achieved. The clinical trial enrolled 157 patients, including 107 in the main cohort to evaluate efficacy and 50 people in the safety expansion cohort.</p><p>No ORR details were provided and the companies did not share data regarding secondary endpoints: complete and partial remission rates, duration of response, and overall and progression-free survival. Both AbbVie and Roche noted that the safety data were consistent with previous venetoclax studies and no new safety signals were observed. The Phase II results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.</p><p>The US FDA granted a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/AbbVieRoche-CLL-drug-venetoclax-deemed-breakthrough-358229" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> in May for venetoclax in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion. Up to 10% of the 14,620 newly diagnosed CLL patients each year have a 17p deletion &ndash; a mutation in which part of chromosome 17 is absent. About 30% to 50% of relapsed and refractory CLL patients have a 17p deletion. Median life expectancy for patients with the genetic mutation is two to three years.</p><p>Venetoclax selectively inhibits the BCL-2 protein, which prevents apoptosis (cell death) for some cells, including lymphocytes. The drug's mechanism "may help restore the natural process that allows these leukemic cells to self-destruct," representing a new way to treat CLL patients with a 17p deletion &ndash; a group with few effective treatment options.</p><p><b>Competition In The Field</b></p><p>Scrip affiliate Sagient Research noted in an Aug. 12 BioMedTracker report that at least two other therapies have shown high levels of activity in CLL patients with 17p deletions &ndash; AbbVie's Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Imbruvica and the Gilead Sciences PI3K delta inhibitor <i>Zydelig</i> (idelalisib). Patients with 17p deletions generally respond poorly to chemotherapy with or without Rituxan.</p><p>Pharmacyclics and partner Johnson & Johnson won FDA approval for Imbruvica in previously treated CLL in February 2014, but the label was expanded four months later for <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharmacyclics-Janssen-win-early-Imbruvica-label-expansion-in-CLL-353077" target="_new">first-line treatment of CLL</a> patients with a 17p deletion. </p><p>Zydelig <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-wins-Zydelig-OK-but-Pharmacyclics-scores-353001" target="_new">was approved in the US</a> in combination with Rituxan to treat relapsed CLL in July 2014. Gilead filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) in May seeking to add data to its label from a study in which relapsed CLL patients were treated with Zydelig plus <i>Arzerra</i> (ofatumumab), which Novartis <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartis-winces-as-GSKs-ofatumumab-crashes-in-DLBCL-351915" target="_new">recently acquired</a> from GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>Sagient analyst Jolene Lau noted in her BioMedTracker report that the Phase II venetoclax monotherapy study began in July 2013 before Imbruvica won approval to treat CLL. She said the venetoclax study participants probably were not treated with Imbruvica and Zydelig prior to enrollment in AbbVie's and Roche's clinical trial.</p><p>"If venetoclax is approved, a key question is how this agent will be sequenced relative to other targeted therapies. The Phase III MURANO trial (venetoclax with rituximab) is enrolling [relapsed/refractory] CLL patients, some of whom will have failed ibrutinib treatment," Lau wrote.</p><p><b>Expanding Portfolios</b></p><p>Approval of venetoclax would add another drug to AbbVie's oncology portfolio and give the company a CLL franchise beyond Imbruvica, which is expected to generate $1bn in sales this year. And given venetoclax's efficacy in 17p deletion patients, the BCL-2 inhibitor also offers an option for combination therapy with Imbruvica &ndash; another way to expand sales for the drug that <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-outdoes-rumored-JandJ-bid-with-21bn-Pharmacyclics-buy-357078" target="_new">AbbVie acquired</a> through its big bet on Pharmacyclics earlier this year.</p><p>Two Phase I investigator-sponsored clinical trials are under way to test venetoclax with Imbruvica. Jeffrey Jones of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center is evaluating venetoclax in combination with Gazyva and Imbruvica in the treatment of 68 relapsed, refractory and untreated CLL patients. Craig Portell at the University of Virginia is conducting a 28-patient dose-finding study for venetoclax plus Imbruvica in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JanssenPharmacyclics-drug-Imbruvica-2nd-FDA-breakthrough-to-cross-finish-line-348135" target="_new">mantle cell lymphoma</a> (MCL), which was Imbruvica's first approved indication in November 2013.</p><p>The BCL-2 protein targeted by venetoclax is linked to the development of treatment resistance in various blood cancers and it is expressed in CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). ProNAi Therapeutics also is developing a BCL-2 inhibitor known as PNT2258, which is in Phase II for CLL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other blood cancers.</p><p>Novartis, Bio-Path Holdings, Mirna Therapeutics, Servier and ValiRx have drugs targeting BCL-2 in preclinical development to treat solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, according to the BioMedTracker database. Mirna's MRX34 also is in Phase I for liver cancer. Suspended BCL-2 programs include AbbVie's navitoclax, Genta's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/The-end-really-is-nigh-for-Genasense-in-melanoma-316028" target="_new">Genasense</a>, obatoclax from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Oncothyreon's ONT-701.</p><p>In addition to AbbVie's and Roche's ongoing Phase II and III clinical trials in CLL, the companies are testing venetoclax as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents in Phase I and II trials for the treatment of DLBCL, indolent NHL (iNHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma.</p><p>Roche already had a big stake in the CLL and NHL markets, along with partner Biogen Idec, via Rituxan. But with the established monoclonal antibody's patent life coming to an end in 2018, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/APPROVED-GenentechRoche-Gazyva-1st-breakthrough-designated-drug-to-enter-US-market-347792" target="_new">Gazyva</a> and potentially venetoclax will provide a needed boost to the company's oncology franchise. And while Gazyva and Rituxan <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roches-Gazyva-to-steal-rituximabs-CLL-crown-348622" target="_new">both target CD20</a>, venetoclax adds a new mechanism of action to Roche's portfolio.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
