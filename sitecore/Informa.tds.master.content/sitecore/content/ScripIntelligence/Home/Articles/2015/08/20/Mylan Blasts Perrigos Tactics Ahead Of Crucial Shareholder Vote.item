<p>The war of words between generics company Mylan NV and potential takeover target Perrigo Company PLC is heating up. Mylan is accusing Perrigo of making "misleading statements" about the proposed acquisition, a position backed, Mylan says, by rulings in its favor by the Irish Takeover Panel.</p><p>The moves come just days before a crucial vote by Mylan shareholders on whether to pursue a tender offer for Perrigo, a vote that could also indicate if M&A activity in the generics sector is being chilled by turmoil in the world's economies including China.</p><p>Earlier in August, Perrigo made comments about Mylan's acquisition plans undervaluing the OTC manufacturer, and about the potential adverse effects of Mylan's decision to lower the threshold of acceptances it needs from Perrigo shareholders from 80% to more than 50%. </p><p>But the Irish Takeover Panel has just ruled against Perrigo for making these statements. The panel "today has issued a formal statement noting in detail the inaccuracies in Perrigo's pubic commentary. We are hopeful that today's statements will provide Mylan and Perrigo shareholders with even greater confidence in Mylan's previous statements about the compelling nature of this transaction," said Mylan executive chair Robert Coury in a statement released late on Aug. 25.</p><p>The panel objected to several statements made in an announcement made by Perrigo on Aug. 13, 2015, including the following:</p><ul><li>The statement, "Mylan already proposed a dilutive deal that substantially undervalues Perrigo" breached rule 19.3 (a) as it was unclear that the term "dilutive" described the effect on Mylan shareholders as Mylan currently expects its proposed offer would be dilutive to its adjusted annual earnings per share for the first three months only following consummation of the offer and compulsory acquisition. </li><li>The statements, "today's announcement makes it even worse"; "under Irish law this structure all but guarantees that the promised synergy realization will fail", breach rule 19.3(a) as merely dropping the acceptance condition to greater than 50% does not of itself mean that Mylan will not acquire 80% of the outstanding Perrigo shares pursuant to its offer without any consequential effects on Mylan's projected synergies.</li><li>The statement "we are confident that there is no rational path to a full acquisition of Perrigo" breached rule 19.3 (a) as the lowering of the acceptance condition to greater than 50% does not of itself mean that Mylan will not acquire 80% of the outstanding Perrigo shares pursuant to its offer.</li></ul><h2>Changing Generics Landscape</h2><p>Mylan originally announced in April 2015 that it planned a takeover of Perrigo that valued the company at $29bn. But since then, the M&A landscape among generic companies has changed. The leading generics company Teva Pharmaceutical Industries announced July 27 it had dropped its pursuit of Mylan and instead would buy Allergan Generics for $40.5bn.</p><p>Mylan's Aug. 25 statement comes before the Aug. 28 vote by Mylan's shareholders on whether to back the company's efforts to acquire Perrigo. If Mylan's plans are approved by its shareholders, the company will launch a tender offer to acquire Perrigo's shares.</p><p>Even if the Mylan shareholder vote is positive, Perrigo still has a number of options to deflect the generic company's attention. Company executives could find a larger suitor, such as Reckitt Benckiser, Sanofi or even Johnson & Johnson, say analysts at US firm BTIG in an Aug. 17 note. That's what happened with Valeant's proposed acquisition of Allergan, in the end sold to Actavis, they point out. </p><p>If Perrigo shareholders do not vote for Mylan, it has the option to acquire other assets; it is not duty bound to raise the offer price for Perrigo, Leerink analysts commented.</p>
