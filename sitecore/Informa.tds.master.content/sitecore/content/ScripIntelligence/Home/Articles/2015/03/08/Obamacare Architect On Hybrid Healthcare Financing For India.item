<p>Better health outcomes and access to affordable quality healthcare can be achieved in emerging economies like India through the co-existence of public funding combined with private and community insurance schemes, according to Dr Elizabeth Fowler, vice president, global health policy, Johnson & Johnson.</p><p>Dr Fowler, who played a critical role in developing the Senate version of the US Affordable Care Act (ACA), said that given the "variations" in political support for healthcare, per capita income and disease burden across Indian states, achieving universal health coverage will require centralized pooling of funds at the national level and allocation to the states based on their health needs. </p><p>This should be irrespective of the contribution of funds raised by those states, said Dr Fowler, who co-authored along with colleague Dr Ashoke Bhattacharjya a report on healthcare financing in India. Dr Bhattacharjya is executive director, global health systems and innovation policy, at J&J.</p><p>Their report, Universal Health Care and Sustainable healthcare financing in India: Lessons from other major healthcare markets, was presented at the fourth Healthcare Access Summit of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) in Mumbai on Aug.7. </p><p>Dr Fowler also underscored that current levels of healthcare spending in India are inadequate even if the state level spending becomes more efficient.</p><p>Public sector health expenditure in India currently stands at about 1.04% of GDP out of total expenditures of about 4.1% of GDP. Roughly two thirds of public health expenditures are attributed to contributions from states. India's Draft National Health Plan had earlier reaffirmed plans to increase the share of government spending and bring in some form of universal healthcare coverage.</p><p>The report noted how a balanced public-private approach to health financing and coverage should be supported by "enabling" government and regulatory policies on insurance plan design, quality of care standards, and economic incentives that will make such a multifaceted approach sustainable.</p><p>"Appropriate regulatory and government policies can and should be undertaken to ensure broad coverage and provisioning of quality health care while protecting patients from discriminatory practices or behaviours by private insurers," it added.</p><p>Asked whether India could draw on any provisions from the Affordable Care Act as it develops its own model for healthcare financing, Dr Fowler said that one lesson that came out of Obamacare was thinking about how to use the private sector.</p><p>"The private sector played an important role in bringing about the development of the ACA and were partners rather than working against the government, which I think was an important part of getting it done," Dr Fowler told <i>Scrip</i> at the side lines of access summit.</p><p>She also referred to some of the consumer protections that were really important in the ACA.</p><p>"If you're moving towards a role for private insurance, it&rsquo;s critical to think about how to make sure that patients get the best value for premiums paid for the coverage &ndash; that would be another area."</p><p>ACA reformed the private individual insurance market. Prior to ACA individual insurance was regulated at the state level. Some US states enforced restrictions on medical underwriting that discriminated against people with pre-existing health conditions by denying them coverage altogether, charging higher premiums, or excluding coverage for those health conditions. ACA, however, applied important consumer protections to all states, details in the report added. </p><p>Dr Ashoke Bhattacharjya said that more diversified healthcare funding models like in Singapore and the US provide greater flexibility of choice and innovation but do have their gaps and there are equity concerns.</p><p>"The larger point is that there is no magic formula. We have to adopt an eclectic approach to these healthcare approaches and India will have to fashion its own. But it's clear that it has to be this combination of public and private and community [approach]" he said.</p><p>Earlier Dr V K Subburaj, secretary, department of pharmaceuticals, told the summit that more Indian states should potentially consider the Tamil Nadu model of healthcare that offers free medicines and insurance coverage to large part of the state's population.</p>
