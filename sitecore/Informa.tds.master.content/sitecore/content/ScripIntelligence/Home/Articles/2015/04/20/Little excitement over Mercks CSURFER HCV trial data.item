<p>After 12 weeks of treatment with Merck's once-daily treatment regimen of 100mg of grazoprevir, a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and 50mg of elbasvir, 99% of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 (GT1) in the prespecified primary population for analysis of efficacy data achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12).</p><p>But the data fell flat with Wall Street &ndash; with shares of Merck only gaining 16 cents on 23 April, before closing the day down 18 cents at $57.51.</p><p>The data, which were presented at the 50th annual Congress of the European Association of the Study of Liver, were the first reported from Merck's Phase II/III C-SURFER trial, a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating patients infected with chronic HCV GT1 with advanced CKD with or without liver cirrhosis. </p><p>Treatment-na&iuml;ve patients and patients who failed prior pegylated interferon HCV therapy, with or without cirrhosis, all of whom had CKD stages 4 or 5, were enrolled in the study. </p><p>Patients the C-SURFER study were randomized to one of two study arms: the immediate treatment group, grazoprevir/elbasvir once-daily for 12 weeks; or the deferred treatment group, initially placebo for 12 weeks followed by a four week follow-up period and then treatment with grazoprevir/elbasvir once-daily for 12 weeks. </p><p>Merck noted that 11 patients received grazoprevir plus elbasvir once-daily for 12 weeks with intensive pharmacokinetic sampling in the open-label portion of the study.</p><p>Of the 122 patients who received grazoprevir/elbasvir, 83% were treatment-na&iuml;ve, 36% had diabetes, 18% had stage 4 CKD, 82% had stage 5 CKD, 75% were receiving hemodialysis and 45% were African-American. </p><p>Among those patients who received at least one dose of grazoprevir/elbasvir, 5% were excluded from the prespecified primary efficacy analysis population, or modified full analysis set, due to missing data caused by death or early discontinuation for reasons unrelated to study drug. </p><p>In the modified full analysis set, 99% of patients receiving grazoprevir plus elbasvir achieved SVR12. </p><p>One GT1b infected, non-cirrhotic, interferon-intolerant patient showed a viral relapse at follow-up week 12.</p><p>Merck was awarded two breakthrough therapy designations (BTDs) from the FDA earlier this month for grazoprevir/elbasvir: one as a treatment for patients with chronic HCV GT1 with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and the other as a treatment for patients infected with chronic HCV GT4. </p><p>Merck initially was awarded the BTD for a broader HCV GT1 indication. But the FDA had notified the company the agency <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">planned to rescind</a> the status after other drugs, like Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) and AbbVie's Viekira Pak (paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), had essentially provided a cure for HCV.</p><p>Merck, however, worked with regulators to find a more focused indication for the firm's combination HCV drug grazoprevir/elbasvir and the FDA ended up <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-replaces-rather-than-rescinds-Mercks-breakthrough-status-357726" target="_new">replacing</a> the BTD rather than rescinding it.</p><p>Grazoprevir/elbasvir is being studied in multiple HCV genotypes and in patients with difficult-to-treat conditions such as HIV/HCV co-infection, advanced chronic kidney disease, inherited blood disorders, liver cirrhosis and those on opiate substitution therapy, Merck said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
