<p>Trevena Inc.'s stock shot up this week on the news its post-operative pain drug met primary endpoints in a Phase IIb study &ndash; showing superiority over morphine. </p><p>TRV130 achieved its primary endpoint of statistically greater pain reduction than placebo over 24 hours in patients undergoing abdominoplasty surgery. Furthermore, TRV130 &ndash; a mu opioid receptor biased ligand &ndash; was superior to morphine in pre-specified secondary measures, exhibiting significantly reduced nausea, vomiting, and hypoventilation events.</p><p>On the back of these positive data, Trevena will have an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA in the next few months. The company plans to launch a Phase III trial in early 2016. </p><p>Trevena's stock (traded on Nasdaq) has been on a steady rise since the data were release late on Aug. 31, reaching its highest price this year to date of $10.64 per share, on Sept. 1 &ndash; up from $6.05 the Friday before. </p><p>Analysts at Sagient Research's BioMedTracker said TRV130's positive side effect profile will increase the drug's attractiveness in comparison with already available and well established pain treatments. In the Phase IIb trial TRV130 had significantly less hypoventilation events with the best results at the 0.1 mg dose versus morphine (15% vs 53%). "Respiratory depression is a major safety concern when using morphine for pain relief," BioMedTracker said. </p><p>"Additionally, the gastrointestinal effects of TRV130 were better than with morphine and this is important as these side effects (nausea, constipation and vomiting) can lead to increased hospital stays," BioMedTracker analysts noted. The database tracker has increased its likelihood of approval rating for Trevena's product to 24%, 7% above the average for a product at a similar stage of development. </p><p>In the Phase IIb study the TRV130 0.1 mg regimen reduced average pain scores (LS mean change in time-weighted average over 24 hours) by 2.3 points (p<0.0001 vs.="" placebo).="" the="" trv130="" 0.35="" mg="" regimen="" reduced="" average="" pain="" scores="" by="" 2.1="" points="" (p="0.0003" vs.="" placebo),="" similar="" to="" morphine,="" which="" reduced="" average="" pain="" scores="" by="" 2.1="" points="" (p="0.0001" vs.=""></0.0001></p><p>Adverse events associated with TRV130 were largely opioid-related; the most frequently reported events were nausea, vomiting, hypoventilation and headache. Opioid-related adverse events were generally less frequent in the TRV130 groups compared to morphine. No drug-related serious adverse events were reported in the study.</p><p>In the latest clinical trial IV pain medication administration was driven by the patient following an initial loading dose, in a previous trial the drug was administered every three hours. Given positive results with both delivery methods the company plans to apply for a broad acute pain label, depending on replication of positive effects in a larger Phase III program. </p>
