<p>Amgen has a broader indication for its acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) treatment Blincyto (blinatumomab) in its sights after top-line Phase II data looked positive in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) B-cell precursor ALL.</p><p>The bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T cell engager (BiTE) antibody construct product became the first single-agent immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL last December; it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-prices-leukemia-drug-Blincyto-at-178000-355729" target="_new">was launched in the US</a> a few weeks later at a price of $178,000 for a standard treatment course, higher than some analysts were expecting.</p><p>The new open-label, single-arm study showed blinatumomab monotherapy induced a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematological recovery within two cycles of treatment in a clinically meaningful number of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive disease, Amgen said. Overall safety results from this study were consistent with the known blinatumomab safety profile, it added. The full data will be reported at a future medical conference.</p><p>The company notes that about one quarter of adult ALL expresses the oncogenic protein BCR-ABL1 that results from the t (9;22) chromosome translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome. </p><p>Amgen's executive vice president of R&D Dr Sean Harper described the results as encouraging, and said the company was hopeful that its "comprehensive ALL development program for blinatumomab &#8230; will continue to demonstrate clinical effectiveness for patients with this serious disease and support blinatumomab as a potential treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell precursor ALL."</p><p>
