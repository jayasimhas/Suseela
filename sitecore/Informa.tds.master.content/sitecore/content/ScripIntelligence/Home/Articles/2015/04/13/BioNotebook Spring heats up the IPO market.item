<p><p>Healthcare initial public offerings have outpaced other sectors over the last 12 months, according to Renaissance Capital, which notes there have been 20 Healthcare IPOs in 2015 so far that have brought in total proceeds of $1.5bn. </p><p>The IPOs have been rolling in over recent weeks &ndash; maybe, it's the spring air that is revitalizing the market. The most notable announcement this week was from AbbVie partner Galapagos that is hoping to ride the wave of positive results that the pair announced a day earlier for their rheumatoid arthritis drug. </p><h2>Galapagos</h2><p>Belgian biotech Galapagos filed a form with the SEC on 15 April showing its intent to IPO on the NASDAQ under the symbol GLPG, with hopes of raising $150m. The firm is riding the wave of positive sentiment that investors showed after Galapagos announced positive results for its Phase II JAK1 inhibitor filgotinib in rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie currently <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AbbVies-ducks-get-in-a-row-as-Galapagos-reports-promising-RA-data-357897" target="_new">has the option to in-license</a> the drug and is expected to opt into the partnership before the end of the year. </p><h2>KemPharm</h2><p>On the same day that Galapagos opted for the IPO option, Iowa-based KemPharm announced its intentions to <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/KemPharm-seeks-58m-via-IPO-357258" target="_new">trade on the public markets</a> under the symbol KMPH on the NASDAQ. KemPharm, which focuses on improving already approved drugs in the CNS space, is planning to sell 5m shares at $11 apiece, with hopes of bringing in $52m. The firm debuted on the NASDAQ on 16 April, opening at $11.75, but falling shortly after to linger nears its offering price. </p><h2>Cidara Therapeutics</h2><p>The San Diego maker of anti-infectives and fungal treatments <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cidara-plans-IPO-to-fund-antifungal-pipeline-357313" target="_new">priced its initial public offering</a> on 15 April at $16 per share, planning to sell 4.8m shares to bring in $77m. The offering was priced at the high end of its proposed range of $14 to $16 and began trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CDTX. The company's lead pipeline prospect, CD101, is a treatment for candida infections, which result in the bulk of hospital infections and often death. </p><h2>Aduro Biotech</h2><p>Berkeley, Calif.-based biotech Aduro jumped though the IPO window on 15 April with hopes of bringing in $107.7m in an offering of 1.05m shares at $17 apiece. The immunotherapy company easily surpassed that on its first day of trading, closing at $42 per share and bringing in almost $120m for immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Just two weeks before its public debut, it inked a partnership with immunotherapy leader Novartis. Aside from the offering, Aduro sold $25m in stock to its new partner. </p><h2>Carbylan Therapeutics</h2><p>After trimming its offering and <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Are-investors-cooling-to-new-biotech-offerings-356882" target="_new">delaying its entrance</a> to the public markets by two months, Carbylan was able to sell 13 million shares at $5 apiece to bring in $65m, well below the $93m it was hoping to bank in February. The biotech began trading on the NASDAQ on 09 April under the symbol CBYL and closed its first day of trading up 11%. </p><h2>Other offerings</h2><p>Firms that are not new to the public market decided to take advantage of investors' spring-fueled good mood by hosting public stock offerings of their own in recent weeks. Israeli biotech Foamix, which specializes in dermatology, priced 6.5m shares at $9.30 apiece. CNS-focused SAGE Therapeutics priced 2.3m shares at $52.50 apiece, while diabetes shop Biodel hoped to bring in $30m with its offering of 32.6m shares at $0.92 per share. Seattle-based Immune Design opted to sell 3m shares at $26.50 a piece to raise $79.5m to support its immunotherapy pipeline. Cambridge, Mass.-based kidney disease drug developer Akebia Therapeutics priced 7.3m shares at $8.25 per share to raise $56.1m. </p><p><p><p>
