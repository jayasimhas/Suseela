<p>Any benefits of the UK leaving the EU would be far outweighed by the disadvantages in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, not least the loss of participation in EU research projects and clinical trials, and could lead to a loss of jobs and a downturn in inward investment in the UK.</p><p>If it decided to leave, the UK could decide to keep some of the legislation based on EU directives, but it would lose influence over the future direction of pharmaceutical regulation, and it is still far from clear what would happen in key areas such as centralized EU approvals.</p><p>These were among the issues raised at a 2 July discussion in Brussels on the pharma and health policy impacts of a possible "Brexit". Organized by Burson-Marsteller and <i>Scrip Intelligence</i>, the event was held to further the debate ignited by <i>Scrip</i> with its article on "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/18-ways-a-Brexit-would-affect-Pharma-358448" target="_new">18 ways a Brexit would affect pharma</a>", which was published on 15 May following the UK general election that gave prime minister David Cameron the mandate to go ahead with an EU referendum by the end of 2017.</p><p>Participants included representatives of pharmaceutical companies, EU institutions, doctors, hospital organizations and the health research community. The event was held under Chatham House rules, whereby opinions expressed by participants are unattributed so as to allow a more free-ranging debate on what may be delicate or controversial topics.</p><p>The near-unanimous feeling among panellists and delegates at this event was that a Brexit would be bad news for both the UK and the EU. Some pointed out the importance of mentioning the possible positives, such as the UK being free to implement its own regulatory environment and trade deals, but overall these seemed to represent scant compensation for the many drawbacks.</p><p>It was suggested that the uncertainties over the trading and other links between the UK and the EU caused by a Brexit could deter inward investment in the UK. Many firms use their base in the UK to distribute to the other member state, and the stability of trading conditions is a vital factor in investment decisions. </p><p>Several delegates mentioned the UK's possible exclusion from the future EU clinical trials regime, which is intended to facilitate the start of multicentre trials via a single portal for approval submissions. Exclusion could well deter companies from conducting trials in the UK, as they would have to seek a separate approval there. </p><p>On the marketing authorization front, the question of what would happen to the validity in the UK of existing and future EU centralized drug approvals was addressed, but not answered (enquiries by <i>Scrip</i> have to date yielded no responses on this issue). </p><p>Moreover, the relocation to another EU country of the European Medicines Agency &ndash; which has just moved into its new Canary Wharf offices &ndash; would result in a loss of highly skilled jobs in London. The capital would also have to give up its branch of the central division of the future Unified Patent Court, for which the previous government fought strongly and which will deal with chemical patents (including pharmaceuticals). </p><h2>Research benefits lost</h2><p>The future of the UK's role in EU research was a key concern among numerous delegates who pointed out that the UK receives a large chunk of research funding and other benefits through the structures such as the European Research Council, the EU framework programme and Horizon 2020, which would be lost in the event of a Brexit &ndash; as would participation in the public-private Innovative Medicines Initiative. </p><p>As an example of how quickly this would happen, one delegate cited Switzerland, which recently imposed restrictions on the free movement of EU citizens into the country and was immediately suspended from access to any new Horizon 2020 funding or programmes; the same would happen to the UK immediately after a "No" vote in the referendum, it was asserted. </p><p>The UK might be able to negotiate some terms of access to some EU research funding, these would likely be very restrictive, so the UK would need to increase its research budget, which was unlikely as the budget was more likely to go down in future. Any such restrictions could also lead to a flight of experienced researchers to countries with continued access to funding and major research collaborations, while UK universities would lose their ability to take a leading role in international research consortia.</p><h2>Where's the pharma industry voice?</h2><p>A key question raised was: where is the voice of the pharmaceutical industry in this debate? The industry has been conspicuous by its absence from the discussion, while other sectors such as the automobile industry have stated their position in favour of continued membership. </p><p>While industry delegates at the panel discussion expressed strong support for the UK remaining in the EU, it was suggested that maybe big pharma did not want to speak out too loudly in public because its intervention might be counterproductive in view of its often poor public image. </p><p>Another possibility was that while many CEOs want the issues to be pointed up more widely in order to shape the debate, they are reluctant to take a public position in favor of membership until prime minister David Cameron has presented the other member states with details of his negotiating stance. At that point they would have something more concrete to campaign on, rather than being seen to support a Yes vote at all costs. </p><p>It was pointed out that the European industry federation EFPIA is working on a study on the pros and cons of a Brexit for the pharma sector, with planning still at the early stages.</p><p>More generally, the discussion turned to what kind of future relationship the UK might have with the EU if it decided to leave: a member of the European Economic Area (like Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) perhaps, or standing completely outside it, like Switzerland, with its very own regulatory regime.</p><p>One delegate pointed out that while Switzerland was home to two of the world's biggest pharma firms, it could be that this was due more to the financial environment than to the actual regulatory or academic environment. If the UK were to take a Swiss-style approach, it might have to become a similar kind of jurisdiction in order to attract the necessary investment. The feeling in the room was that given the complexities of a full exit, shifting from EU to EEA membership might be as far as the UK could practicably go.</p><p>Some felt that it was important to stress the positive aspects of EU membership rather than just the negative consequences of leaving, and that more people needed to become engaged in the public debate, including those in the medical profession and the research community, who so far have tended to stay out of the discussion. </p><p>Others suggested that at the end of the day it was not the rational calculations of the advantages and drawbacks of EU membership on which voters would make up their minds: the emotional aspects had to be addressed too. </p><p>In the meantime, with the debate gathering pace, <i>Scrip</i> intends to keep up the momentum by talking to key players and soliciting their views on the pros and cons of a UK exit from the EU in the many areas of policy, research and healthcare that would be affected. </p>
