<p>The drive for consolidation in the generic pharma sector is generating plenty of headlines and hot air. For those feeling a little confused about what exactly is going on with those generic company M&A pursuits, here's a brief summary of the latest. </p><p>Further rumors churn around that awkward threesome of Teva, Mylan and Perrigo. </p><p>Tip-offs continue to flow from those elusive "people in the know"&ndash; who remain unnamed and one sometimes suspects might not completely exist. </p><p>According to those "sources" (who so often get stocks buzzing), Israeli drug maker Teva is set to make its first formal approach for generic competitor firm Mylan, with a raised offer of as much as $43bn, up from its indicative bid of $40bn. This would value shares in Mylan at between $86 and $88 per share. In April, Mylan rejected an offer which valued it at $82 a share, or $40bn.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Ali Al-Bazergan noted that, "A deal with Mylan would augment Teva's leadership in generics, cushion the company from considerable losses over several patent expiries for lead drug Copaxone, and realize some considerable cost synergies and tax savings."</p><p>Teva's pursuit has been complicated by the fact that Mylan is officially based in the Netherlands following its acquisition last year of overseas assets from Abbott Laboratories. This deal gave Abbott a 14.2% stake in Mylan. And Abbott is said to be leaning away from a Teva acquisition.</p><p>Meanwhile, a formal offer by Teva for Mylan is likely to include a request for a general shareholder meeting to remove members of the Mylan board of directors. If Mylan does not take the necessary steps to convene a meeting, Teva, via its 4.6% ownership of the company, has the ability to directly appeal to the Dutch legal system (together with additional shareholders) to request a shareholder meeting. </p><p>In the background, while Mylan fends off the unwanted Teva approach, it in turn is still chasing an unwilling Perrigo &ndash; a transaction that Abbott supports. </p><p>But nothing is simple in the world of mass M&A. Perrigo, in attempt to block a takeover from Mylan, is rumored to be chasing a number of smaller generic companies. Perrigo has been linked with a bid for Roxane Labs, the US generic drugs business of Boehringer Ingelheim, alongside other potential contenders including UK-listed Hikma and Dublin-based Mallinckrodt.</p><p>An acquisition of one of these companies, or similar, by Perrigo would be yet another hurdle for Mylan in its acquisition chase. </p><p>Teva's latest $43bn offer for Mylan is expected to be announced as early as this week. </p><h2>state of play in India</h2><p>Generic consolidation is not confined to this trio of deal makers and their potential substitutes. Recently we saw Actavis finally <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827?autnID=/contentstore/scripnews/codex/cc480eb9-b801-11e4-9472-f1990ec59256.xml" target="_new">close a deal</a> with botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) maker Allergan for $66bn. Meanwhile, India, home to many a generic giant, is never short on M&A gossips.</p><p>For example, Cipla is often cited as a potential sell-off target. It was linked to a possible buyout by acquisition-hungry Teva in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cipla-denies-sell-off-plans-as-reports-cite-Teva-as-persistent-suitor-351668" target="_new">May last year</a>. Cipla's top brass told <i>Scrip</i> at the time that it "vehemently" denied any plans to sell, with the company's official spokesperson terming the sell-off reports as "baseless." However, local publications said Teva had twice made an offer for Cipla &ndash; apparently valuing the company at approximately $6bn. </p><p>Also, Indian firms Sun and Lupin appear to be seeking new assets at a rapid pace and both are seen as potential buyers in the space &ndash; even if the firms are considered price conscious. Recently, Lupin made moves into Russia when it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-steps-into-Russia-via-Biocom-buy-359230" target="_new">snapped up generic company ZAO Biocom</a>. Established in 1991, Biocom is focused on therapies in segments such as cardiovascular, CNS and antimicrobials for systemic use, in addition to contract manufacturing and secondary packaging.</p><p>At least we can't complain that generics are boring.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-and-Mylan-War-of-words-continues-358871" target="_new">Teva and Mylan: War of words continues </a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Perrigo-acquires-GSK-products-as-Mylan-hovers-358705" target="_new">Perrigo acquires GSK products as Mylan hovers</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Rejections-All-Around-Mylan-to-Teva-Perrigo-to-Mylan-357994" target="_new">Rejections All Around: Mylan to Teva, Perrigo to Mylan</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-defends-its-deal-plans-for-Mylan-358207" target="_new">Teva defends its deal plans for Mylan</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-not-seeing-the-value-in-Mylan-offer-358127" target="_new">Perrigo not seeing the value in Mylan offer</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-to-Teva-we-dont-want-your-problems-358077" target="_new">Mylan to Teva: we don't want your problems</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylans-Coury-on-Teva-deal-without-logic-357962" target="_new">Mylan's Coury on Teva: deal 'without logic'</a></p><p><p><p>
