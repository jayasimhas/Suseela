<p>AstraZeneca's share price dropped on 16 February following a US court ruling invalidating a patent for the UK drug maker's asthma therapy Pulmicort Respules (budesonide inhalation suspension), and prompting Actavis to launch a generic version.</p><p>The US District Court for New Jersey ruled that US Patent No 7,524,834 protecting Pulmicort is invalid, meaning generic competitors can market their own versions of the product in the US. The patent had been set to expire in 2018, with pediatric exclusivity extending into 2019.</p><p>AstraZeneca said it strongly disagreed with the decision and was now considering all legal options, including an appeal.</p><p>Nonetheless, its shares (traded on the London Stock Exchange) were down 1.7%, or 78 pence, in afternoon trading on the 16 February. AstraZeneca added, "This decision will not impact guidance for 2015, which is that sales revenue is expected to decline by mid-singledigit percent at constant exchange rates and core EPS is expected to increase by low single-digit percent at CER."</p><p>Sales of Pulmicort were $946m in 2014, but this figure was heavily influenced by a 35% growth in emerging markets. </p><p>AstraZeneca had filed patent infringement lawsuits against Apotex, Watson Laboratories and Breath, and Sandoz for infringement of US patents directed to methods of use and formulation and form of active ingredient for Pulmicort. Actavis was also preparing to launch a generic version of the drug. </p><p>In April 2013, the New Jersey court invalidated AstraZeneca's patent, but that ruling was reversed and remanded in October 2013 by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Federal-Circuit-temporarily-blocks-Actavis-sales-of-generic-Pulmicort-343566" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 May 2013</a>). But now, following this most recent ruling on the product's loss intellectual property protection, Actavis has launched a generic version of the drug. An Abbreviated New Drug Application for its generic received final approval from the FDA back in August 2012.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US ruling is also bad news for Teva which had been marketing a generic version of the product since 2009 under an agreement with AstraZeneca. </p><p>Pulmicort is a corticosteroid administered via a nebulizer for the treatment of asthma in children and adults.</p><p>Respiratory is a key area of development for AstraZeneca in 2015 and the firm is already attempting to bulk up its asthma offering. A highlighted clinical asset in the company's full year 2014 financial statement was AZD9412 (inhaled interferon beta), a Phase II compound in development as a treatment for severe asthma. </p><p>
