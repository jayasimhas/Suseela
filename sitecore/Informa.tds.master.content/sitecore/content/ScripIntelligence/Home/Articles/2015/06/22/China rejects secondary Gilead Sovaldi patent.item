<p>China's patent agency, the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), has turned down Gilead Sciences' patent application for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), igniting a firestorm across the industry.</p><p><p>China's rare move to reject a drug patent application, in this case for a prodrug of Gilead's hepatitis C therapy Sovaldi, could spark other countries to follow its lead and take tougher positions over granting protection to the controversial product.</p><p><p>According to the US based advocacy group Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), the patent application for Gilead's blockbuster nucleotide analog hepatitis C drug has been rejected by the Chinese IP regulator. The decision followed a pre-grant opposition by I-MAK, which together with other groups has also challenged patent applications in other markets including the EU, India and Russia.</p><p><p>Key sofosbuvir patents have already been rejected in India and Egypt.</p><p><p>The patent application, numbered CN200880018024.2, was filed on March 26, 2008. A prodrug is an inactive ingredient that becomes metabolized to an active form once taken into the body. In the case of sofosbuvir, it is a phosphoramidate prodrug of nucleoside derivatives that I-MAK is arguing is a modified version of an earlier compound and therefore not novel.</p><p><p>Although there was no formal announcement or explanation from SIPO, the agency noted the sofosbuvir application had been rejected in a routine notice of patent rulings; Gilead has so far not issued any statement on the decision. The company's primary China patent for sofosbuvir chemical substance remains unaffected, and this won't expire until 2024.</p><p><h2>ripple effect?</h2><p><p>Still, the ruling could set off a ripple effect in other emerging markets, especially those excluded from a pact signed by Gilead earlier this year to expand market access for the expensive drug, which is priced at around $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 for a 12-week course, in the US.</p><p><p>In an agreement signed last September, the Forest City, California-based company slashed the cost of Sovaldi to $300 a bottle, or roughly $10 per pill, in India as part of an initiative to bring a vastly cheaper version of the medicine to over 90 developing countries. Seven Indian manufacturers were selected to make the cheaper version.</p><p><p>But there were notable exclusions from the deal, including some large emerging markets with high hepatitis C infection rates such as China, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Ukraine.</p><p><p>China in particular has a large hepatitis C population, with nearly 30m people living with the chronic viral infection, the highest number worldwide.</p><p><p>The exclusions drew fire from patient rights advocacy groups including MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF).</p><p><p>Commenting on the new Chinese decision, MSF said Sovaldi was "exorbitantly priced" in many countries, noting hepatitis C affects around 150m people globally and that its complications kill 350,000-500,000 annually.</p><p><p>China could also become an important supplier of raw materials and finished sofosbuvir, helping to drive down global prices, it added.</p><p><p>In a statement on the new ruling, MSF Access Campaign's director of policy and analysis, Rohit Malpani, said the Chinese decision "goes to show that there are serious questions about whether this drug merits patenting, and sends a strong signal to other countries that are currently reviewing patent applications".</p><p><h2>Chinese generics on horizon</h2><p><p>Amid the brouhaha over the Chinese rejection, several domestic drug makers in the country are already taking steps towards launching generic versions of sofosbuvir in the world's second largest pharma market.</p><p><p>According to SIPO's database, at least three manufacturers including Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals have obtained patents for sofosbuvir tablet manufacturing. Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical, a Shanghai-listed firm, said late last year that the China FDA had accepted its application to conduct clinical trials for generic sofosbuvir.</p><p><p>But even after conducting all the necessary studies, Kelun could still be prevented from obtaining a regulatory approval due to the patent protection situation, industry observers have noted.</p><p><p>However, that could change with the most recent Sovaldi patent rejection from SIPO, which could open the gate for domestic drug makers to step out and challenge the patent, some say.</p><p><p>Pointing to China's role as the largest global producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, MSF said there had been limitations on the use of sofosbuvir raw material "because of patent barriers," and that the rejection of the secondary patent in the country creates "greater potential for generic sofosbuvir to enter the Chinese market earlier."</p><p><p>In another recent patent ruling, the Beijing Supreme People's Court ruled that Bayer's patents for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection were invalid. Marketed as Baifule, the product is selling CNY700m ($120m) per year in China, but the plaintiff, Peking University Medical Group's Fountain Pharmaceutical Institute, won a suit challenging the patent.</p><p><h2>compulsory licensing option?</h2><p><p>Also, China's health regulators are contemplating using compulsory licensing in a bid to improve patient access to selected expensive drugs.</p><p><p>The National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) has prioritized compulsory licensing as a topic for concentrated study in 2015. Although China has previously released a more definitive pathway for companies to pursue compulsory licenses, paving the way for generics of innovative therapies, no firms have so far used the procedure.</p><p><p>On the other side of the coin, China's cabinet, the State Council, recently issued a well-publicized policy to encourage innovation, including measures to stimulate intellectual property reform and to achieve breakthroughs in high-profile and key areas.</p><p><p>(Additional information added by Ian Haydock in Tokyo.)</p><p><i>This article has also been published in</i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p>
