<p>GlaxoSmithKline is to invest $4m a year for five years to fund a new HIV research center focused on discovering a cure for HIV/AIDS at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a jointly owned new company called Qura Therapeutics which will handle the business side of the partnership.</p><p>GSK's says its investment in the HIV Cure center is separate from its investment in the discovery of novel antiretroviral (ARV) therapies at ViiV Healthcare, the HIV joint venture owned by GSK, Pfizer and Shionogi. GSK's HIV Discovery Performance Unit will continue its work on new ARVs in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina. However, ViiV will play an advisory role to the HIV Cure center and Qura Therapeutics.</p><p>A small research team from GSK will move to Chapel Hill to be co-located with UNC researchers. The University will provide laboratory space on its medical campus for the HIV Cure center and the new company.</p><p>UNC-Chapel Hill and GSK will focus on the latest scientific approaches to curing HIV, including a leading new research approach known as "shock and kill." The approach is based on unmasking the dormant virus that persists in people with HIV infection despite successful drug therapy, and augment the patient's immune system to clear these last traces of the virus and infected cells. Part of this new paradigm was first tested at UNC-Chapel Hill and in 2012 a team led by UNC-Chapel Hill researchers demonstrated that latent HIV might be unmasked by new therapies. Recently, researchers at the university received US FDA approval for a study in HIV-positive volunteers to combine this technique and an immune-boosting strategy.</p>
