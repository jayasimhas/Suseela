<p>Biotechnology investor and prognosticator Steven Burrill has stepped out of the spotlight after being hit with a lawsuit accusing him of fraud and now he's being sued by investors in the venture capital fund cited in the first legal action.</p><p>Mr Burrill has been conspicuously inconspicuous since June 2014 when one of his former employees filed a lawsuit that said he stole millions of dollars from Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III, the same fund which is now suing him for fraud, breach of contract and other charges. The new lawsuit sheds additional light on the alleged diversion of money from the venture capital fund to the detriment of the fund's profitability.</p><p>Ann Hanham and two other managing directors at Mr Burrill's namesake investment and advisory firm, Burrill & Co in San Francisco, discovered debits from Burrill Fund III that were not allowed under the fund's agreement with investors. Dr Hanham claimed in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trusted-biotech-investor-advisor-Burrill-accused-of-fraud-352433" target="_new">lawsuit</a> she filed more than a year ago that she was fired for raising the issue and reporting her concerns to the fund's investors.</p><p>The investors took fund management responsibilities away from Mr Burrill in light of the allegations and they now have filed their own lawsuit seeking the return of their money and additional damages based on losses the fund has incurred without adequate cash flow to cover its investment commitments.</p><p>Dr Hanham estimated the fraud at $19.2m in her lawsuit and the fund's investors put the allegedly stolen cash total at $17.6m plus more than $30m in losses caused by the alleged theft. Both lawsuits, which were filed in San Francisco Superior Court, name Burrill & Co's chief administrative officer and chief legal counsel Victor Herbert as well as controller and chief financial officer Helena Sen as co-defendants with Mr Burrill.</p><p>The investors' lawsuit relies heavily on Dr Hanham's observations as well as the venture fund's recently completed investigation. The fund's legal filing provides a full accounting of management fees starting in September 2006 that were transferred to Mr Burrill's various business entities through September 2013 in advance of scheduled payments and in excess of negotiated fees under the venture capital fund's limited partnership agreement (LPA). </p><p>"Defendants' theft crippled the Fund's operations; it rendered the Fund unable to make follow-on investments it was committed to make, with the result that the Fund was penalized by being stripped of substantial portions of the investments it had made in the past. Defendants thus caused the Fund to suffer more than $30 million in investment losses, and to lose out on investment gains it otherwise would have earned," according to the VC fund's lawsuit.</p><p>The legal claim includes 16 causes of action &ndash; fraud, misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, interference, conspiracy and other charges &ndash; and asks the court to force Mr Burrill, his companies, Mr Herbert and Ms Sen to pay restitution and damages based on their alleged misdeeds.</p><p>However, it's uncertain where millions of dollars to compensate the fund would come from, since Mr Burrill's businesses are essentially shut down and multiple civil and criminal federal investigations are under way. </p><p>Indeed, Mr Burrill issued his annual Burrill Report giving predictions for the year in biotech in late December via his Burrill Media web site, but it appears that the site has not been updated since January. Unlike the past several years, Mr Burrill did not present his 2015 forecast for biotech in June at the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) annual conference.</p><p>Mr Burrill did not respond to <i>Scrip</i>'s messages seeking comment.</p><p><p><p><p>
