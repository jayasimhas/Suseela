<p>Amgen has asked the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to block next week's launch of a biosimilar of the firm's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) until the judges have considered the company's motion for a rehearing and, if granted, review of its lawsuit against Novartis unit Sandoz.</p><p>Amgen on Aug. 27 filed an emergency motion for an injunction to stop Sandoz from marketing Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) come Sept. 2 &ndash; a date the court had earlier set for the biosimilar to enter the US market.</p><p>Both sides had filed petitions with the court last week to seek a rehearing before the full Federal Circuit, or en banc, after a three-judge panel handed down a win, but also a loss, to Amgen and Sandoz on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">July 21</a>.</p><p>The court on Aug. 25 invited Amgen and Sandoz to each file responses to those petitions by Sept. 8.</p><p>Even though Amgen was mum about Zarxio's launch when the company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">filed its petition last week</a>, New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter, said there's no doubt the firm is concerned Sandoz is free to market its biosimilar on Sept. 2.</p><p>He noted the Federal Circuit typically would take at least 10 working days after responses are filed to vote on whether to grant a review. </p><p>"This leaves a significant gap in which Sandoz could launch its product before the Federal Circuit has decided whether Amgen's petition has raised a question meriting review by the full court," Cerwinski said.</p><p>But the Federal Circuit has been willing before to grant temporary injunctions to freeze the status quo while it considers the merits of appeals of district court judgments in pharma cases, and in fact, it did so already in the Amgen case when the company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-court-delays-NovartisSandoz-biosimilar-Zarxios-marketing-358232" target="_new">requested relief</a> after filing its notice of appeal. </p><p>"But history shows that even when granted, such injunctions do not necessarily indicate how the Federal Circuit feels about the merits of the case," Cerwinski told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Zarxio, whose nonproprietary name is set to change within the next 90 days from filgrastim-sndz to filgrastim-bflm under a new <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-Letter-Word-FDAs-BiosimilarsBiologics-Distinction-360142" target="_new">proposed rule</a>, was the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">first biosimilar approved</a> by the FDA, which granted its blessing in March.</p><p>Amgen's lawsuit is another first &ndash; the pioneer case <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">testing the complexities</a> of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the law that granted the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>"This appeal involves issues of first impression as to the correct statutory construction of the BPCIA," Amgen told the court in the firm's Aug. 27 petition.</p><p>At issue in the case, whose oral arguments were heard by the Federal Circuit panel on June 3, was whether Sandoz failed to comply with the disclosure and negotiation procedures outlined in the BPCIA about what patents would be litigated &ndash; often called the "patent dance &ndash; when it withheld its 351(k) biosimilars application and manufacturing information from Amgen.</p><p>On the first question, the Federal Circuit panel sided with Sandoz &ndash; declaring in a 2-1 verdict the company and other biosimilar makers could <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">opt out</a> of the patent dance and would not have to disclose their applications and manufacturing details if they chose to do so.</p><p>But on the second question, Amgen prevailed, with the panel ruling 2-1 that when a company opts out of the patent dance, BPCIA's 180-day notice of commercial marketing is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval &ndash; telling Sandoz it could not market Zarxio until Sept. 2.</p><p>"As a developer of both innovative biologics and biosimilars, Amgen believes that the application, review and approval of biosimilars should proceed in compliance with all the provisions of the BPCIA," the firm told <i>Scrip</i> in a statement. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
