<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb on Oct. 1 revealed it had gained the FDA's blessing under an accelerated approval to market Opdivo (nivolumab) plus Yervoy (ipilimumab) to treat patients with BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma &ndash; the first immuno-oncology combination regimen approved in the U.S. in cancer.</p><p>"Approval of the regimen marks a new development, demonstrating the potential of targeting distinct and complementary immune system pathways, offering patients a novel combination treatment," BMS declared.</p><p>"We are currently witnessing a turning point in cancer history, based on the significant impact immuno-oncology is making in the lives of patients with metastatic melanoma," added Tim Turnham, executive director sat the Melanoma Research Foundation.</p><p>BMS' Opdivo, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor, already was approved in the U.S. for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">melanoma</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">non-small-cell lung cancer</a> (NCSLC) &ndash; gaining those FDA nods faster than anyone anticipated and well ahead of their <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action dates.</p><p>The company's Yervoy, a human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-blocking antibody, has been approved in the U.S. since March 2011 as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.</p><p>But using the drugs as a combination regimen, which includes four cycles of the Opdivo plus Yervoy, followed by Opdivo monotherapy, isn't cheap and looks to have a shocking price tag at first glance &ndash; $256,000 for a full year, if patients stay on the regimen for that long.</p><p>BMS spokeswoman Carrie Fernandez, however, explained the regimen's price would vary by patient, depending on the length of therapy. </p><p>And she pointed out that the cost of the four combination doses of Opdivo plus Yervoy &ndash; what was studied in BMS' CheckMate -069 trial, on which the approval was based &ndash; is about $141,000, which Fernandez said is actually only about 6% more than the cost of Yervoy alone. </p><p>Plus, Fernandez added, the $141,000 may actually be less for some patients than the sequence of using Yervoy first followed by Opdivo. </p><p>Opdivo's monotherapy indication calls for the drug to be used in patients previously treated with Yervoy, and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</p><p>The price of the combination regimen was based on a lower dose of Opdivo, or 1mg/kg, and the monotherapy dosing for Yervoy, at 3mg/kg, Fernandez noted.</p><p>She emphasized that only patients who continue to respond to therapy will stay on the treatment.</p><p><b>Keytruda Competition</b></p><p>Opdivo as a monotherapy runs $12,500 per month &ndash; the same as Merck's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">gained an early approval</a>, and in fact, beat BMS' drug across the finish line last year as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression in patients previously treated with Yervoy, and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.</p><p>So patients, with the blessing of their insurers, may be willing to pay more for the Opdivo-Yervoy combination rather than first trying Yervoy and then moving to either Opdivo or Keytruda.</p><p>Even though Keytruda was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor approved in the U.S., Opdivo is well ahead of it in adding indications &ndash; with Merck's drug currently only having the one approval, which also came under the FDA's accelerated program.</p><p>But <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Mercks-Keytruda-A-Remarkable-Science-To-Success-Story-360381" target="_new">Merck is aiming to catch up</a>, and in fact, the FDA is set to make a decision on Oct. 2 for Keytruda in NSCLC.</p><p>Merck also has submitted applications to expand the drug's use to broader populations with melanoma, with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Keytruda-Wins-Expanded-Melanoma-Priority-Review-Also-A-Delay-360014" target="_new">decisions anticipated in December</a>.</p><p><b>Opdivo-Yervoy Study</b></p><p>BMS' double-blind, randomized Phase II CheckMate -069 study enrolled 140 patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma and included patients with both BRAF wild-type and BRAF mutation-positive melanoma.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was objective response rate (ORR) in patients with BRAF wild-type tumors. </p><p>Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed duration of response and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BRAF V600 wild-type melanoma.</p><p>Patients received Opdivo 1mg/kg plus Yervoy 3mg/kg every three weeks for four doses during the combination phase, followed by Opdivo 3mg/kg every two weeks during the monotherapy phase. Treatment was continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. </p><p>In the Yervoy monotherapy group, patients were treated with 3mg/kg of that drug every three weeks for four doses with matched placebo.</p><p>BMS reported that of the 95 patients randomized to receive the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen, 50% were 65 years or older and 13% were 75 years or older.</p><p>The company said 59% of the patients completed all four doses in the initial combination phase over a median of 9.1 weeks.</p><p>Among patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, the regimen demonstrated a significantly superior response rate of 60%, versus 11% for Yervoy alone.</p><p>BMS said 17% of patients experienced a complete response in the BRAF wild-type population.</p><p>The firm said partial responses were observed in 43% of the regimen group, with there was 11% in the Yervoy monotherapy group.</p><p>The company said 79% of patients had ongoing responses of at least six months at the time of analysis, and of those patients, 14 had a duration of response of at least six months, but less than nine. BMS said 20 patients had a duration of response of at least nine months. </p><p>The remaining 21% of the patients had a duration of response ranging from three to seven months and have progressed after response, died, or received subsequent therapy. </p><p>Along with higher ORR and more complete responses, the Opdivo plus Yervoy regimen demonstrated a 60% reduction in the risk of progression among BRAF wild-type patients, versus Yervoy alone.</p><p>The median PFS was 8.9 months with the regimen, compared with 4.7 months with Yervoy alone.</p><p>Because the Opdivo plus Yervoy was granted an accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response, BMS noted it must complete confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
