<p>About 11.7 million Americans have signed up for or were re-enrolled in private health insurance plans through the online marketplaces, or "exchanges," created under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell declared on 9 March.</p><p>While she acknowledged that number is likely to change as the year continues &ndash; with additions and subtractions as figures are refined, like was the case in 2014 &ndash; Secretary Burwell said she was pleased all the same. </p><p>She said more than half of the 11.7 million who enrolled through HealthCare.gov were new customers.</p><p>Nearly 7.7 million, or 87%, who selected a plan through HealthCare.gov qualified for an average tax credit of $263 per month. More than half who received the financial assistance will be paying $100 or less per month, after the tax credits, for their insurance, Ms Burwell said from the White House on 9 March at an event marking the successful enrollment for 2015.</p><p>The HHS chief also said she was "confident" the Obama administration would prevail at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">US Supreme Court</a> in a case in which challengers of the law are arguing Congress intended for the tax credits to only be available to Americans who enroll in ACA plans through exchanges established by the states </p><p>"The law is clear. The text and structure of the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> demonstrate that individuals in every state are eligible for tax credits," she said.</p><p><b>Related Stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-grapples-with-words-in-never-ending-Obamacare-saga-357077" target="_new">Supreme Court grapples with words in 'never-ending' Obamacare saga</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Oops-US-feds-goof-on-800000-Obamacare-tax-forms-356876" target="_new">Oops!
