<p>The End of the Affair, a 1951 novel by Graham Greene, depicts some of the worst human emotions that can accompany the ending of a relationship, and then after a break of two years, the re-ignition of those emotions in an investigative post-mortem. Way back at the start of this century I invested in a gene therapy company. Although the inevitable end of the affair caused me some heartache, unlike the principal characters in Mr Greene's classic novel I found it a valuable cathartic learning experience to have lost some money in this unproven area of biotechnology.</p><p><p>I recently thought about re-kindling the relationship and investing once again in companies working on gene therapy but before I 'pulled the trigger', the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-backing-off-bluebird-partnership-358728" target="_new">return of most of the rights by Celgene</a> on bluebird bio's gene therapy program gave me a reason to think twice. Ironically, the broad collaboration between Celgene and bluebird was on the <i>ex vivo</i> genetic modification of T-cells, where I remain interested. However, bluebird's collaboration was so early and so far behind the leaders in CAR-T cell therapy in hematological cancers that I never considered bluebird as a potential investment. It appears that now, neither does Celgene except for the one area of expertise &ndash; B-cell malignancies &ndash; and it gave a $25m donation to soften the blow for bluebird.</p><p><p>Typically, when a big partner hands back the rights to a small partner the share price of the smaller partner suffers on the day of the announcement. Celgene has demonstrated this previously, delivering a 20% next-day dent to Morphosys's share price when it announced the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-drops-Morphosyss-daratumumab-chasing-anti-CD38-MAb-357522" target="_new">return of the anti-CD-38 monoclonal antibody</a> MOR202. No such judgement on the broad applicability of bluebird's gene therapy platform was enacted last week as its share price actually finished slightly up at the end of the trading day following the announcement. The generosity of the bluebird investors may have been fueled in part by the fact that they actually got to hear from the company, in a conference call which was convened on the evening of the announcement. The company's quarterly financial results merit no such discussion or public interaction. Nevertheless, the purpose of this conference call was clearly to enable bluebird and the analysts working for the investment banks who will make money selling its shares in its future secondary offerings to effuse calm and promulgate the lack of significance in Celgene's almost complete exit. Of the sell-side coverage I read, no analyst regarded Celgene's exit as a negative, no one downgraded or reduced their price target and some even suggested that the maturing bluebird was better off without Celgene. It was no wonder, therefore, that investors who had not suffered the previous failures of gene therapy like me saw no detriment to the company on Celgene's exit.</p><p><p>The sell-side was right about one thing, however. The early-stage CAR-T research at bluebird is a tiny part of the valuation of the company. Most of its valuation is related to the un-partnered LentiGlobin gene therapy programmes in beta-thalassemia major and sickle cell disease (SCD). The <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=lentiglobin&Search=Search" target="_new">clinical trials website</a> lists just three trials recruiting patients involving bluebird's LentiGlobin gene therapy platform. The one study in SCD has an estimated enrolment of eight patients, with detailed data on two having been reported at the recent Congress of European Hematology. The two clinical studies in beta-thalassemia are being conducted in an estimated total enrolment of 25 patients. Data on only one patient have so far been reported. With a market capitalization of $6.23bn, that's a staggering $188m per patient in clinical trials and an even more eye-popping $2.07bn per detailed patient data report.</p><p><p>Whilst no investors seem to be jumping ship from bluebird yet, in two other early-stage and equally risky technologies, the management of the companies recently voted with their feet. The CEO of Regulus Therapeutics and the CSOs of Regulus and Sangamo BioSciences all announced exits from their respective companies last week. In the case of Regulus, neither the CEO's recent share sales nor the termination of the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration alarmed investors anywhere near as much as the CEO's unexpected exit, since his previous <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-The-impossible-takes-a-little-too-long-327642" target="_new">abrupt departure from Anadys</a> was a prelude to the company's demise. </p><p><p>At the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/STOCKWATCH-JPM-notes-349441" target="_new">JP Morgan conference presentation two years ago</a>, I compared the bluebird CEO's conference presentation to a gathering of a religious cult, right down to some of the audience's murmurs of agreement during his sermon. It's a strange coincidence that investors' faith in risky unproven technologies and their shepherds has a parallel in the finding of religion in Graham Greene's novel The End of the Affair. In more contemporary Uber-speak, we currently have surge-pricing in early-stage biotech companies with very limited clinical data. At some point the rain will stop, IPOs will be pulled and the NASDAQ Biotech Index will stutter before faltering. Wait a minute, we're already there.</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Celgene and Morphosys.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
