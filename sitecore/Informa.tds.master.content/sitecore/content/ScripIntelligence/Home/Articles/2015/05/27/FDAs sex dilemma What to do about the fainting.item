<p>While the very thought of a &ldquo;romp in the hay&rdquo; may have had women in <i>Gone with the Wind</i> fainting, passing out is a particular problem for those who want to engage in sex with the help of a little pill.</p><p>Unfortunately, fainting, along with low-blood pressure, are big concerns of the FDA for Sprout Pharmaceuticals&rsquo; investigational pill flibanserin, which is intended to boost a woman&rsquo;s libido.</p><p>US regulators on 2 June raised concerns about those adverse effects with flibanserin, calling them "serious" and something that could be exacerbated when the drug is used concomitantly with alcohol.</p><p>The FDA is grappling with whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan would truly ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. </p><p>Therefore, regulators are convening a joint meeting on 4 June of the FDA's Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs (BRUDAC) and Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committees to help the agency find a solution.</p><p>Flibanserin's new drug application (NDA) has been a particularly tricky one for the FDA.</p><p>Indeed, the NDA is under review by the agency for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sprout-hopes-3rd-time-better-for-sex-pill-at-FDA-356796" target="_new">third time</a> as a treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) &ndash; being twice rejected before, first in 2010 when Boehringer Ingelheim owned flibanserin, and in 2013, after Sprout took over development of the product.</p><p>The fact that the FDA has not approved a female sexual dysfunction drug when there are now several products on the US market for men has led some to accuse the agency of gender bias, claiming regulators are holding medications intended for women to a more stringent standard.</p><p>But Dr Hylton Joffe, director of the FDA's Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products, said the agency "rejects" those claims, calling them "misleading and inaccurate." </p><p>Dr Joffe insisted the FDA's regulatory decision for each product is "based on an assessment of whether the benefits outweigh the risks, and does not take gender into consideration."</p><p>In a memo to the BRUDAC and DSaRM panelists released on 2 June ahead of the joint meeting, Dr Joffe said the NDA for flibanserin "raises challenging scientific issues." </p><p>Flibanserin is not a hormonal drug but rather a post-synaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor agonist and 5-HT 2A antagonist.</p><p>The drug's exact mechanism in treating HSDD is unknown, but it's thought flibanserin corrects an imbalance of levels of the neurotransmitters by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine &ndash; both responsible for sexual excitement &ndash; and decreasing serotonin, which is responsible for sexual inhibition</p><p>There currently are no medications approved by the FDA for HSDD.</p><p>But Dr Joffe said the FDA has recognized "for a long time" there are women who have reduced sexual desire that causes distress and who may benefit from a safe and effective treatment. </p><p>"This condition is clearly an area of unmet medical need," he said. </p><p>But Dr Joffe also stressed that the FDA is, nonetheless, required to base its regulatory decisions on an assessment of whether the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks rather than need. </p><p>Flibanserin, however, "has a challenging benefit/risk assessment," he said.</p><p>Dr Joffe said the FDA was convening the joint BRUDAC and DSaRM adcomm to "obtain outside, independent, expert advice from a multidisciplinary panel as to whether the benefits of flibanserin outweigh its risks." </p><p>He said the FDA also expects to hear from the public at the meeting &ndash; noting the "extensive publicity surrounding flibanserin."</p><p><b>Efficacy</b></p><p>To support the flibanserin NDA, Sprout submitted the results of three Phase III studies of the drug in treating HSDD in premenopausal women. </p><p>All three trials used the two co-primary efficacy endpoints of satisfying sexual events (SSEs) and sexual desire. </p><p>The key secondary endpoint in the trials measured distress related to sexual desire.</p><p>Dr Joffe noted that all three of the Phase III trials showed there was a statistically significant improvement with flibanserin versus placebo in the number of satisfying sexual events and in distress related to sexual desire. </p><p>But two of the trials failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over placebo in the co-primary endpoint of sexual desire, which was assessed using a daily electronic diary.</p><p>Those two trials, however, did show a statistically significant improvement over placebo for the secondary endpoint that used the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to assess sexual desire. </p><p>The third trial used FSFI as the pre-specified co-primary endpoint for sexual desire and showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo, consistent with the FSFI findings in the two earlier studies, Dr Joffe pointed out.</p><p>While he said the FDA is not in full agreement with Sprout that the FSFI is optimized for assessing sexual desire, Dr Joffe said statistically significant differences between flibanserin and placebo were demonstrated for SSEs, sexual desire measured by the FSFI and distress related to sexual desire &ndash; findings he called "consistent" across the three of the Phase III studies, "demonstrating a pharmacologic effect of flibanserin in the patients studied." </p><p><b>Safety concerns</b></p><p>But Dr Joffe said the FDA must weigh whether those benefits of using flibanserin are worth the "serious risks" of low-blood pressure, or hypotension, and fainting, or syncope &ndash; two adverse effects that hung up the drug on its last go-round with the agency.</p><p>Plus, he said, the risks of hypotension and syncope are "amplified" by drug interactions &ndash; mostly when flibanserin is used with CYP3A4 inhibitors &ndash; or when women drink alcohol after taking the medicine.</p><p>While Dr Joffe said the FDA does not currently foresee the need for additional risk management options beyond labeling to manage the drug-drug interactions with flibanserin, "alcohol is more challenging to mitigate," particularly because Sprout's drug requires chronic administration and "alcohol use, including binge drinking, is pervasive in our society." </p><p>In an alcohol interaction study, 16% of the participants experienced "clinically significant" adverse events of severe hypotension and syncope within 1.5 to 4 hours after the co-administration of alcohol and flibanserin &ndash; events that required medical interventions.</p><p>Dr Joffe acknowledged most of the 25 participants in the alcohol study were men &ndash; 23, versus two women &ndash; so the risks of hypotension and syncope with concomitant use of flibanserin in women and less frequent drinkers were not adequately characterized. </p><p>Flibanserin was studied initially also in men because Boehringer &ndash; the original NDA holder &ndash; was developing it as treatment for depression.</p><p>Dr Joffe argued that based on gender differences in body size, blood volume and potential pharmacological responses to drugs, one could anticipate the risks of concomitant use of alcohol and flibanserin in women would be "at least as concerning as seen in men." </p><p><b>To approve or not to approve</b></p><p>The questions raised about the alcohol study are among those the FDA wants its outside advisers to wrestle with at the 4 June meeting.</p><p>Regulators plan to ask the committee about the feasibility of avoiding alcohol indefinitely while using flibanserin &ndash; taking into account the prevalence of alcohol use in the US &ndash; or if alcohol use should be contraindicated in patients using the drug altogether.</p><p>Also expected to be a key debate is whether the REMS would mitigate flibanserin's risks of fainting and low-blood pressure and if such a requirement is deemed necessary, whether to include additional elements beyond a medication guide and communication plan, such as elements to assure safe use with pharmacy certification and provider certification. </p><p>The panelists will then vote on whether the overall benefit-risk profile of flibanserin is acceptable to support the drug's approval to treat HSDD in premenopausal women with labeling alone to manage the risks or if certain risk management options are necessary.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
