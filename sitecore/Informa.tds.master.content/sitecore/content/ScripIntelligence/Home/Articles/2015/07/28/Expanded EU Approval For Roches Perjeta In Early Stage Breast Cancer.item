<p>The European Commission (EC) has approved Roche Holding AG's <i>Perjeta</i> (pertuzumab) in combination with <i>Herceptin</i> (trastuzumab) and chemotherapy, for use before surgery in adult patients with HER2-positive, locally advanced, inflammatory or early stage breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.</p><p>The EC approval is based primarily on data from the neoadjuvant Phase II NeoSphere study, which showed almost 40% of people receiving the combination of Perjeta, Herceptin and chemotherapy achieved pathological complete response (pCR) in the affected breast and local lymph nodes compared to 21.5% of people who received Herceptin and chemotherapy alone. </p><p>Perjeta's approval marks the first neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment approved by the EC based on pCR data. However, in 2013 Roche's product was approved for the same early stage breast cancer indication in the US based on pCR. It is noted in the US prescribing information for the product that, "No data are available demonstrating improvement in event-free survival or overall survival."</p><p>As well as the US, Perjeta is already approved for this indication in 21 other countries.</p><p>Both Perjeta and Herceptin work by binding to the HER2 receptor, but in different places. The combination is thought to provide a more comprehensive blockade of HER signaling pathways, preventing tumor cell growth and survival. </p><p>Perjeta was already approved for use in people with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.</p>
