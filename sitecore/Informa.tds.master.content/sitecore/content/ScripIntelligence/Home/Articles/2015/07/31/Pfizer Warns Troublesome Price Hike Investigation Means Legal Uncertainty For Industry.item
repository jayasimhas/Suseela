<p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has issued a provisional opinion finding that Pfizer and Flynn Pharma charged "excessive and unfair" prices for anti-epileptic phenytoin sodium capsules, rocketing the cost for the NHS. But Pfizer claims that it tried to find a profitable and sustainable way of providing the loss-making drug to the NHS, complaining that the CMA is creating greater legal uncertainty for companies.</p><p>Pfizer said that an investigation into excessive pricing was "particularly troublesome in an industry that is already subject to price regulations". It added that the investigation meant further legal uncertainty for the industry because one legal authority reviews and agrees prices and then another authority investigates. Prices approved under the department of health's Drug Tariff then come under the scrutiny of the CMA, which does not give companies clearance in advance for their prices, it said.</p><p>In May 2013, the CMA launched a formal investigation into a suspected breach of competition law in relation to the supply of pharmaceutical products. The case goes back to 2012 when Pfizer sold the distribution rights to its branded capsules, Epanutin, to Flynn Pharma, which genericized, or de-branded, the drug and sold them as Phenytoin Sodium Flynn Hard Capsules. Pfizer continued to manufacture the product for Flynn, but at prices that were much higher than those it had previously charged. The CMA says Pfizer wanted between eight and 17 times more than it had historically charged. Flynn then sold the drug to NHS customers at prices that were between 25 and 27 times higher than those historically charged by Pfizer. </p><p>Before September 2012, when Flynn started selling the drug, the NHS spent around &pound;2.3 million a year on phenytoin sodium capsules. "This spend, paid to Flynn and other suppliers of phenytoin sodium capsule, was just over &pound;50 million in 2013 and over &pound;40 million in 2014," said the CMA.</p><p>The CMA's preliminary view is that the two firms have abused a dominant position by charging high and unfair prices and that they are in breach of UK and EU competition law. "While businesses are generally free to set prices as they see fit, those that hold a dominant position have a special responsibility to ensure that their conduct does not impair genuine competition and that their prices are not excessive and unfair. The prices that the CMA is concerned about in this case are very high compared to those prices previously charged and have led to a big increase in the total NHS drug bill for what is a very important drug for tens of thousands of patients, "said Anne Pope, the CMA's senior director of antitrust enforcement.</p><p>However, the authority emphasized that its findings were provisional and that "no conclusion can be drawn at this stage that there has, in fact, been any breach of competition law." It added that it would consider any representations from the two companies before making any final decisions about infringements. But if the companies have been found guilty of infringing the law, they could be penalized with a fine of up to 10% of its annual worldwide group turnover. </p><p>Both Flynn and Pfizer say they have fully complied with all pricing regulations. According to Pfizer, Epanutin was a loss making product before its divestment to Flynn and the US giant had to decide whether or not to drop the product all together. It maintains that if it had dropped the drug, the NHS would have to have spent more on switching patients to phenytoin sodium tablets, the nearest alternative to Flynn capsules. "Ensuring a sustainable supply of products is of paramount importance to Pfizer and was at the heart of our decision to divest the product," said Pfizer.</p><p>Flynn Pharma's director, David Walters, pointed out that since the investigation it had reduced the price of its 100mg capsule by 20% to 64p and the price of its 300mg capsule by 15%. The price decreases come as a result of the launch of generic competitors. One 100mg tablet now on the market is priced at &pound;1.07, 67% higher than Flynn's 100mg capsule, said Mr Walters.</p><p>He added that the firm was complying with the investigation and that it would defend its position vigorously. </p><p><p><p>
