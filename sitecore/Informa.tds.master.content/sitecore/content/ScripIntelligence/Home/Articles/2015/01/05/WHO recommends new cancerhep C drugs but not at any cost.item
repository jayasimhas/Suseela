<p>In what is being hailed as a groundbreaking event, the World Health Organization's has decided to add some of the newest drugs for cancer, hepatitis C and TB to its Essential Medicines List (EML). </p><p>The decision is a welcome one, as it will help to improve access worldwide to products with clear clinical benefits, but it comes with a caveat that pharmaceutical companies will have to heed: some of these drugs are very expensive, and one way or another their prices will have to come down.</p><p> "When new effective medicines emerge to safely treat serious and widespread diseases, it is vital to ensure that everyone who needs them can obtain them," said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. "Placing them on the WHO Essential Medicines List is a first step in that direction." </p><p>Among the products making it into the latest edition of the EML &ndash; presented on 8 May &ndash; are 16 for cancer, five for hepatitis C, and a range of drug combinations for multi-drug and extensively resistant TB.</p><p>The move was described as "seismic" by the consumer organization Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), which monitors developments in the area of innovation and access to medical technologies. </p><p>Ellen 't Hoen, who founded the Medicines Patent Pool and specializes in access to medicines, said the additions to the list raised "some key questions about high prices, patents and access to medicines". Governments, companies and the international community need to act to make sure that these products become affordable and available, she said. "An essential medicine needs to be an affordable medicine!"</p><h2>The EML</h2><p>The EML is a key tool in helping countries &ndash; especially developing ones &ndash; to decide which products they should purchase in order to address their priority health needs and to develop their own national lists of essential drugs. The EML consists of a core list of minimum medicines needs for a basic healthcare system, as well as a complementary list of essential medicines for priority diseases where specialized diagnostic or monitoring facilities or specialist medical care are needed.</p><p>The list is updated every two years by the EML Expert Committee, which is composed of specialists from academia, research and the medical and pharmaceutical professions. Over the past decade, the list has changed in response to evolving public health challenges, with the addition of products such as antiretrovirals for HIV and special formulations for non-communicable diseases. </p><p>Meeting on 20-24 April, the committee updated both the EML and the EMLc, which lists essential medicines for children. It considered 77 listing applications, including 29 treatment regimens for cancer as well as some innovative drugs for hepatitis C and TB, and recommended the addition of 36 new medicines to the EML, and 16 to the EMLc. It also advised the inclusion of medicines in other areas like coagulation, HIV and cardiovascular.</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>In the cancer area the committee decided to revise that whole segment of the EML because of new breakthroughs in cancer treatment over the past couple of years. It recommended the addition of 16 new medicines and endorsed the use of 30 medicines already listed as part of clinically effective treatments. Among the new additions were some high-cost drugs like trastuzumab, rituximab and imatinib, as well as bendamustine, capecitabine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and transretinoic acid.</p><p>"Some of these medicines produce relevant survival benefits for cancers with high incidence, such as trastuzumab for breast cancer," said Kees De Joncheere, the WHO's Director of Essential Medicines. "Other treatment regimens for rare cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, which can cure up to 90% of patients, were added to set a global standard."</p><p>KEI said that "credit for this quiet revolution" that saw the additional of costly cancer drugs "must go to the WHO's Department of Essential Medicines and Health Products (EMP) in shepherding the review of subsection 8.2 on cytoxic and adjuvant medicines (cancer medicines) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and its partners for conducting a Cancer Medicines Review in 2014". </p><h2>Hepatitis and TB</h2><p>In the case of hepatitis medicines, the committee recommended that a new section be inserted in the core list to include drugs for viral hepatitis infections, with subsections for hepatitis B and C. It advised the inclusion of the following drugs: entecavir and tenofovir for hepatitis B, and six oral direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C including daclatasvir, ledipasvir + sofosbuvir, ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir (with or without dasabuvir), simeprevir, and sofosbuvir. The recommendations for inclusions were based on the comparative efficacy, increased tolerability and the potential public health impact of these medicines, the committee observed.</p><p>As for TB, which claimed 1.5m lives in 2013, most of them in low- and middle-income countries, the WHO said that "after about 45 years of scarce innovation for TB medicines", a number of new products for multi-drug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant disease were recommended for inclusion in the EML: bedaquiline, delamanid and linezolid on the complementary list, and terizidone (as an alternative to cycloserine) on the EMLc. It also recommended the addition of rifapentine to the core list of EML and EMLc for the treatment of latent TB infection.</p><p>Price, though, is uppermost in the WHO's mind, given the high cost of many of these new drugs. It warned of the "urgent need to take action to promote equitable access and use of several new highly effective medicines, some of which are currently too costly even for high-income countries". </p><p>The high prices of the hepatitis C products, for example, "currently make them unaffordable and thus inaccessible to most people who need them," the organization observed. "Treatments for hepatitis C are evolving rapidly, with several new, highly effective and safe medicines on the market and many in the development pipeline," said Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Systems and Innovation. </p><p>"While some efforts have been made to reduce their price for low-income countries, without uniform strategies to make these medicines more affordable globally the potential for public health gains will be reduced considerably."</p><p>In some cases, such as the MAbs for cancer, this may mean turning to biosimilar versions that offer discounts to the price of the originator drugs. The matter was raised in a resolution passed during last year's World Health Assembly, which said the WHO was "conscious that similar biotherapeutic products could be more affordable and offer better access to treatments of biological origin, while ensuring quality, safety and efficacy".</p><h2>Off-label uses</h2><p>The committee also touched on another sensitive topic: off-label use of medicines as a way of lowering treatment costs. It recommended supporting off-label uses "in cases where there is clear evidence of major health benefits" but not necessarily a licensed indication, and specifically mentioned the controversial case of the off-label use of Roche's bevacizumab (Avastin) in place of the licensed, but much more expensive, ranibizumab (Lucentis) from Novartis.</p><p>Dr De Joncheere said that the EML included medicines "on the basis of safety and efficacy evidence, not on the basis of approved indications within national jurisdictions or availability of licensed alternatives". For example, when the committee reviewed an application to include ranibizumab for severe eye diseases such as macular degeneration, it "looked at the evidence base and the price difference with bevacizumab &ndash; the medicine currently listed. The committee agreed to maintain bevacizumab as the preferred medicine, rejecting the ranibizumab application," Dr De Joncheere noted.</p><p>"It is important to understand that the Essential Medicines List is the starting block and not the finishing line," Dr Kieny observed. "Its purpose is to provide guidance for the prioritization of medicines from a clinical and public health perspective. The hard work begins with efforts to ensure that those medicines are actually available to patients."</p>
