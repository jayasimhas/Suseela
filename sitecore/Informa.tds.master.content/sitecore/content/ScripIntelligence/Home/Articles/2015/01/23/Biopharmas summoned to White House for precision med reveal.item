<p>President Barack Obama is expected to unveil the details of his new "precision medicine" initiative on 30 January and has invited chief scientists from several biopharmaceutical firms to be at his side at the White House during the big reveal.</p><p>Among those attending will be Dr David Altshuler, executive vice president of global research and chief scientific officer at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, whose cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor) was touted by the White House last week as an early "innovative" success in precision medicine.</p><p>CF patient Bill Elder, whose life has been prolonged because of Kalydeco, was one of First Lady Michelle Obama's guests at the 20 January State of the Union address, where the president first disclosed he was launching the initiative (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>).</p><p>"Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development," Mr Obama said during his Capitol Hill speech. "I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine &ndash; one that delivers the right treatment at the right time."</p><p>The president himself gave no real details about his initiative, but the White House said the proposal "will engage patients and healthcare providers in delivering this new era of medicine."</p><p>"Recent advances in genomics and digital data have produced powerful new discoveries about health and disease that have made it possible to design highly effective, targeted treatments for cancer and other diseases," the White House said.</p><p>Among the other biopharmaceutical executives who was invited to the White House for the 30 January event is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Scientific Officer Dr George Yancopoulos, who discovered the company's drug Eylea (aflibercept), a fully human fusion protein, which is approved for wet age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. </p><p>Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele also confirmed an executive from her company will be at the White House when Mr Obama discloses the details of his precision medicine plan &ndash; an initiative he is expected to ask Congress to fund under the president's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget.</p><p>President Obama earlier this week revealed another portion of his FY 2016 budget proposal, in which he plans to ask Congress for $1.2bn to battle antimicrobial resistance &ndash; $650m of which would go to the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for developing and testing new antibiotics, among other projects (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan) also has made precision medicine part of his draft legislative package aimed at accelerating the discovery, development and delivery of drugs &ndash; the 21st Century Cures initiative &ndash; which he unveiled on 27 January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>). </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
