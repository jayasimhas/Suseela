<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb will relocate research and development employees to new sites on the East Coast and expand its West Coast presence, but the big biopharma company does not anticipate major job losses due to its R&D reshuffling strategy even after eliminating virology drug discovery efforts.</p><p>Bristol-Myers will maintain its marketed virology product portfolio and continue its work with programs already in the clinic, but the company will lay off about 100 employees when virology discovery efforts are stopped. However, a new R&D center in Cambridge, Massachusetts and an expanded research facility will hire new scientists to support BMS's remaining discovery priorities.</p><p>"While there are opportunities for innovation in the virology space, we believe the probability for us to achieve transformative treatments is greater in other areas. Our discovery organization will continue to focus on research in immuno-oncology as well as heart failure, fibrosis, genetically defined diseases and immunoscience," the company said in a statement given to <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>BMS does not plan to eliminate R&D jobs when it moves up to 200 workers from Wallingford, Connecticut and Waltham, Massachusetts plus some people from New Jersey to a research center that will open in 2018 at 100 Binney Street in Cambridge's Kendall Square. The company will keep those jobs and recruit additional scientists from the area for a total of up to 300 employees at the Cambridge site.</p><p>The Waltham and Wallingford R&D sites will be closed in 2018, but up to 500 employees still at Wallingford facility will be relocated to a new site elsewhere in Connecticut. </p><p>In the San Francisco Bay area where Bristol-Myers researches cancer immunotherapies, the company is building a 61,000-square-foot expansion that will be occupied by 40 employees from Seattle, Washington and 65 new scientists from the area in 2016. The Lake Union Steam Plant in Seattle will continue as a BMS manufacturing operation. </p><p>"The geographic changes are not associated with job eliminations. We hope those employees who are offered relocation opportunities will choose to stay with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Employees who do not wish to relocate to a work location may be eligible for severance benefits in accordance with the terms of the Bristol-Myers Squibb company severance plan," the company said.</p><p>Most of the 100 jobs affected by the elimination of virology discovery are in Wallingford, but it appears that the company's R&D head count overall may change very little following the new hires in San Francisco and Cambridge.</p><p>BMS said the decision to stop its early-stage virology research is in line with the new R&D strategy <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-fires-researchers-exits-three-therapy-areas-in-RandD-overhaul-348026" target="_new">announced in 2013</a>. The company said in November of that year that it would discontinue diabetes, hepatitis C and neuroscience research. At that time, HIV and hepatitis B were listed as ongoing priorities, which remains true for existing programs.</p><p>Virology research will continue for assets already in development, such as the HIV attachment inhibitor BMS-663068, the HIV maturation inhibitor BMS-955176, beclabuvir and the anti-PD-L1 compound BMS-936559. Marketed virology assets also will remain in the company's portfolio, including Baraclude (entecavir) for hepatitis B; Reyataz (atazanavir)/Evotaz (atazanavir and cobicistat), Sustiva (efavirenz) and Atripla (efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for HIV; and the new hepatitis C medications Daklinza (daclatasvir) and Sunvepra (asunaprevir).</p><p><p><p><p>
