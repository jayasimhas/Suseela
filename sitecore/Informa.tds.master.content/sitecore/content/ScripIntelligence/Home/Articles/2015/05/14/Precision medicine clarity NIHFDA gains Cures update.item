<p>A third version of the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, unveiled on 13 May, brought new clarity to some of the provisions affecting the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA &ndash; most notably, the precision medicine measures, which started out in the first draft with a simple place holder. </p><p>"There's some really good provisions there," said Dr Amy Miller, executive vice president of the Personalized Medicine Coalition (PMC). </p><p>The &ldquo;Cures&rdquo; authors have made some tweaks to the NIH Innovation Fund, which was first revealed late last month and for which lawmakers are calling for a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn boost</a> to the agency's budget over the next five years.</p><p>The new language provides more insight into what areas lawmakers expect those dollars to be used &ndash; with the Cures authors declaring the funds are intended for basic, translation and clinical research in which the principal investigator has a specific project or objectives and the funding is tied to that pursuit.</p><p>It may also be used in instances when the principal investigator has shown promise in biomedical research but the funding is not tied to a specific project or objectives.</p><p>In addition, the Innovation Fund can be used to support research intended to be carried out by an early-stage investigator or a small business concern, defined under the Small Business Act.</p><p>A portion of the NIH Innovation Fund, $2.5bn, also will be used to establish and support a new program known as the Accelerating Advancement Program, under which the agency's director is charged with partnering with national research institutes and centers to accomplish "important biomedical research objectives." </p><p>The lawmakers said the new NIH dollars are intended to contribute to the goals of expanding knowledge to address and find more effective treatments for unmet medical needs, including the areas of biomarkers, precision medicine, infectious diseases and antibiotics. </p><p>PMC's Dr Miller said she was glad to see that lawmakers actually gave the NIH chief more flexibility in how the Innovation Fund will be used, versus how the language was structured in the earlier draft version of the Cures legislative package released on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">29 April</a>.</p><p>"We think the NIH sections are designed to streamline research within the agency," she told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Dr Miller said her group was particularly happy to see that in the Cures revisions, lawmakers recognized the value of public-private partnerships, data transparency and "ways to get more researchers eyes on the data we collect."</p><p>The section dubbed "Advancement of National Institutes of Health Research and Data Access&rdquo; contains a measure that would give the agency's director the authority to require investigators whose research is funded by the NIH to share their data.</p><p>Too often, Dr Miller said, researchers &ndash; NIH-funded investigators and those in industry &ndash; try to hold on to their data, declaring it "proprietary."</p><p>"But as we enter personalized medicine and we start subdividing disease into molecularly defined subtypes, that is no longer feasible," she insisted.</p><p>The Cures measures, Dr Miller said, "are getting to that challenge."</p><p>"There has to be more data sharing, there has to be a learning healthcare system, the use of big data and extremely large cohorts," she declared. "If we are going to subdivide disease by their molecular underpinnings, we have to come up with a better way to identify people with those illnesses, recruit them into research and take advantage of what we learn."</p><p>Dr Miller noted the NIH's goal to achieve a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">one million person cohort</a> for President Barack Obama&rsquo;s precision medicine initiative, which he unveiled in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">January</a>, seeks to ultimately have an open-access database, which will be available to "qualified" researchers.</p><p>The newer Cures legislative package also provides more clarity about the FDA's role in advancing precision medicine, including provisions requiring the agency to issue new guidance within 18 months of the bill&rsquo;s enactment and create a priority review program for breakthrough devices and diagnostics, Dr Miller pointed out.</p><p>It's critical, she said, that companion diagnostics for targeted medicines be reviewed at the same pace as the drugs granted the breakthrough status &ndash; something for which Dr Janet Woodcock, director at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has long advocated.</p><p><b>FDA funds?</b></p><p>While there are some proposed funding authorizations in the latest Cures language for the FDA &ndash; $5m per year for five years for studying continuing drug manufacturing and $10m per year over five years for a process to qualify drug development tools &ndash; the bill is essentially void of added dollars to help the agency carry out the many new responsibilities regulators are tasked with in the legislation.</p><p>Late last month, Dr Woodcock had pleaded with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">House</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">Senate</a> lawmakers at separate Capitol Hill hearings not to stick her agency with more unfunded mandates.</p><p>While Dr Miller said she was "impressed" with the level of attention the authors of the Cures draft had paid to "every idea" brought to them at various public forums over the past year and the "open, transparent and face-paced" path the legislation has taken, she said lawmakers must, nonetheless, recognize the additional demands they are putting on the FDA.</p><p>"The FDA needs the resources to address these provisions, if they are passed into law," Dr Miller argued. "It's critical."</p><p>Also included in the revised Cures bill are provisions that would <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-resurrects-orphan-exclusivity-Dormant-protection-dead-and-buried-358417" target="_new">extend by six months</a> the exclusivity protection for marketed drugs that seek and gain new indications aimed at preventing, diagnosing or treating rare diseases or conditions and would reauthorize the FDA's rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers incentive program.</p><p>Remaining out of the latest update, however, is a measure that would have provided 15 years of data protection for so-called "dormant therapies," or abandoned drugs that have the potential to be developed for unmet medical needs, but have been left on the shelf because of insufficient patent protection &ndash; a provision that was in the original draft <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">in January</a>, but was removed in April's version.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
