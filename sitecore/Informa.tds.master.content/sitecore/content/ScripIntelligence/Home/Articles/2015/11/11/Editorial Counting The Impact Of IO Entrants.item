<p>One question in the lead-up to the Q3 results announcements was how big an impact the much touted new PD-1 inhibitors are having in the oncology market.</p><p>The quarter to Sept. 30 saw Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc.'s Opdivo (nivolumab) go into the lead over its on-market rival, Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which was first the PD-1 inhibitor to gain US approval and which has hitherto held sway in the products' initial indication of melanoma. Opdivo was boosted by becoming the first to gain approval for non-small cell lung cancer (and it enjoys a broader label since patients don't have to be selected by biomarker testing, as they do for Keytruda in NSCLC). Opdivo can expect to drive further ahead in lung cancer given the extension of its lung cancer approval in the US in October from pre-treated squamous NSCLC to pretreated non-squamous NSCLC. </p><p>Opdivo and Keytruda are not merely locked in battle with each other, though.</p><p>BMS, in reporting Q3 sales of $305m for Opdivo, also booked a 31% decline in sales of its own earlier immuno-oncology product, Yervoy (ipilimumab), which slipped $110m to $240m. (For comparison, Keytruda's Q3 sales were $159m.) </p><p>The repercussions of the take-off of PD-1 therapies were felt further afield in the oncology drug market, too. Celgene, for instance, cut its full-year forecast for Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel) from $1-1.25bn to $950m-$1bn in recognition of stronger than expected competition from the new checkpoint inhibitors in lung cancer. </p><p>However, the longer-term silver lining for Celgene is that it could ride the immuno-oncology wave by positioning Abraxane as a taxane of choice in I-O combination therapies. And BMS argues that Yervoy's decline will be mitigated in future by the drug's emerging role in combination therapy (it was recently approved for use in combination with Opdivo for first-line melanoma).</p><p>Indeed, part of the excitement for pharma is that rather than necessarily rendering obsolete existing therapies, immuno-oncology is in many cases likely to be additive to the cancer treatment armamentarium. Credit Suisse predicts the I-O market could be worth more than $40bn. With such growth in prospect, the challenge for pharma will be to avoid payer concerns about rising cancer drug costs casting a pall over the undeniable benefit for patients.</p>
