<p>Around two thirds of patients on Genzyme's multiple sclerosis treatment Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) need no additional treatment up to four years after the two courses of infusion that make up its standard treatment schedule, according to Genzyme's Mike Panzara, therapeutic area head of MS, neurology and ophthalmology. </p><p>"It's important to understand and identify this subgroup that didn't require additional treatment," he told Scrip from the annual European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) meeting being held this week in Barcelona. "We're looking for potential biomarkers now." Genzyme, a Sanofi company, presented multiple abstracts of data from clinical trials involving its newer MS drugs Lemtrada and Aubagio (teriflunomide).</p><p>Most notably, in the extension of two Phase III pivotal studies (CARE-MS 1 and CARE-MS 2), 68% and 60% respectively of Lemtrada-treated patients needed no additional infusions in the prior four years. There were also consistent effects seen across relapse, disability, brain atrophy and MRI lesion activity.</p><p>However, Panzara would not go as far as calling Lemtrada &ndash; a CD52-targeting monoclonal antibody &ndash; "curative" in this subgroup of relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients. "All I can say is that a sizeable number of patients are in a stable state of remission for up to five years following the first infusion. We'll keep looking at that for another five, 10 and even 15 years and hope to be able to say the same."</p><p>Lemtrada's safety profile has relegated the product to at least third-line in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, but the five year data presented at ECTRIMS could change the Lemtrada story, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Daniel Chancellor told Scrip. "It's exciting because there are some patients who only need two short courses of treatment at month zero and month 12 and then nothing else. Lemtrada is essentially behaving like a chemotherapy, like its original use in leukemia. And of course there will be cost implications of only having to pay for these two courses, whereas all the other treatments for MS are required for the rest of a patient's life." Lemtrada's price tag of around $160,000 is relatively palatable if only two courses are needed, notes Chancellor.</p><p>Other data presented at ECTRIMS highlighted that both Lemtrada and Aubagio "slowed brain atrophy" in MS patients, noted Panzara. "Other MS treatments have demonstrated this," he admitted, "but not in a manner that has been consistent across studies, apart from Gilenya (fingolimod). When you put this together with the data we have in reduction in disability progression, it makes a difference."</p><p>Aubagio sales growth has been slow but steady, Panzara added. "We launched it without as much fanfare as others might have launched their new MS drugs. It was approved on the basis of one study; physicians started using it, they had good experiences &ndash; anecdotally the word we hear a lot to describe the drug is 'quiet' &ndash; and we've added to the body of data. So yes, it's doing well."</p><p>The incidences of PML that continue to blight other MS products is not something that Genzyme concerns itself with. "When we talk to physicians, we focus on our own data and our own side effect profiles. Every product has its own benefits and risks, and that is what we focus on."</p><p><b>Gilenya at ECTRIMS</b></p><p>Novartis presented its own long-term efficacy data of Gilenya at ECTRIMS, citing 'no evidence of disease activity' based on four parameters: relapses, MRI lesions, brain shrinkage and disability progression (NEDA-4)). According to Novartis, 31% to 45% of patients continuously treated with Gilenya in the FREEDOMS core and extension trials achieved NEDA-4 in each of the years three to seven after treatment initiation.</p>
