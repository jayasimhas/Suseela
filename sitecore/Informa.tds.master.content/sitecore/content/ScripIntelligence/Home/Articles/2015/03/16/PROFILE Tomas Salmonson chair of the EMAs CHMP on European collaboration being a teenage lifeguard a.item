<p> <img src="-/media/0D156A2DDBEA498CBAA78084FE91C621.ashx" border="0"> <i>The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is the body that effectively says yes or no to your new drug in Europe. Since September 2012, the committee has been chaired by senior Swedish regulator <b>Tomas Salmonson</b>. In this profile, by <b>Francesca Bruce</b>, find out what Dr Salmonson thinks of the pharmaceutical industry and what key advice he would give companies looking for regulatory approval&#8230; and also how he relaxes, what shaped him growing up and why he thinks his grandfather would be proud of him.</i> </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: You head the most important committee of one of the world's most prestigious regulatory agencies. How did you get there - what's your special magic?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: Luck is one thing, but I hope there is some skill there too! I was on the CHMP for 12 years before being elected chair, so I do have extensive experience with European collaboration. I think I have two qualities that are important: I usually identify the big issues quickly; and I also try to create a good climate for discussion. To me all individuals are important in the committee. We have to remember that we members sitting round the table represent 30 countries. You have to bring people on board, make them feel part of the decision. They have to know they can ask questions without worrying if it is stupid and without being shut down by members supported by larger agencies. In the end, the medicines will be used by patients in these 30 countries, so it's important to get as many on board with a decision as possible and make them feel that they contribute. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: You worked for industry briefly, for SmithKline Beecham. Why did you cross over?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: For a very short period. I had been a regulator for about ten years and I was really keen to see what it was like on &quot;the other&quot; side. I thought that if I was to work for a company it should be at the headquarters, not the Swedish subsidiary. So I came here to England, but it didn't work out with the family, I had small children. Then the head of the Swedish agency at that time offered me a nice position back home. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What did you learn from that small taste?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I enjoyed it. Primarily it gave me huge respect for industry and the work they do with all the requirements we place on them. It's a valuable experience for any regulator. It's so easy to underestimate the effort and work that goes into developing a drug. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: Why do you like being a regulator?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: It's a fantastic job because you have the opportunity to look at lots of applications for many new drugs. In industry you can stick with one or two projects for years and if they are suddenly terminated, bad luck! I sense there is a relationship between the success of your product and your career. We see the products and are in the lucky position where we can focus on the risks and benefits of a medicine and do not have to worry about commercial aspects like firms do, or the budgetary concerns like health technology assessment agencies have to. We can look at medicines purely from a patient perspective. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What are your long-term aspirations?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I have to be honest, I love this work! I have been a CHMP member for 12 years, I was vice-chair before becoming chair. The way things look now, I will seek re-election as chair. That would give me another three years from September. Three year planning is as far as you want to go at my age! But if I don't get re-elected, I don't know yet what I'll do. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: Does industry have any misconceptions about regulators that you want to set straight?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I think they sometimes believe there are political agendas that influence the discussions. Companies sometimes think decisions can be based on how expensive the product is and which company is involved and where it's from. It might surprise companies, but many committee members don't even know who the applicant is. That's not interesting. It's the documentation and product that are interesting. Industry probably reads more into certain decisions than it should. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: Is there anything that frustrates you about industry?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: No, people probably think I am industry-friendly. Again, I have huge respect for industry. Let's put it this way: We have a system of developing drugs that is driven by commercial aspects. Some of my colleagues get irritated when industry is too blunt about their commercial interests, but I have no problem with that. The frustration is possibly on the other side. We should work harder on putting the money where we want the industry to run. Industry invests in research if it makes sense from a commercial perspective. It is our responsibility to identify areas where we don't see as much development and then stimulate development in these areas. We have been very successful with orphan legislation &ndash; we said there are carrots if you develop something for rare diseases. We have seen lots of products being developed in the orphan medicine area. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What have been the CHMP's biggest achievements while you've been chair?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: We've had some great drugs approved, but that's to the credit of industry and academia. We should probably get credit when we can handle the more complex situations when there is a lot of uncertainty and very little data. We had a long debate about Glybera [the first gene therapy]. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What are the most common reasons for turning down an application?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: Efficacy and the lack of demonstration of a clinically significant event. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: If there was one thing you could tell companies looking for an NCE positive opinion, what would it be?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: Advice! Go for scientific advice! </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: Is there anyone in industry you particularly admire?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I really respect a guy called Peter Honig [now head of global regulatory affairs at Pfizer]. I got to know him when he was working at the [US Food and Drug Administration]. He left at the beginning of the millennium and went to MSD around the time of Vioxx and later joined AstraZeneca. He is very interesting to discuss the bigger picture with and I respect the man and find him extremely solid, probably because in his heart he is a regulator but his brain is with industry. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What was your first job?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I was a lifeguard. Being a teenager you'd think it was great, walking around in nice sunglasses getting a tan. But it was really hard work and very tiring. You had to be alert all the time. The year before someone drowned and I realised that was the worst thing that could happen. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What shaped you when you were growing up?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I can only see in one eye. When you are young and looks are very important, having eyes that go in different directions is never going to be the hottest thing on earth. That taught me that if you don't have the looks, you have to do other things to get where you want to go. It also gave me perspective on what is important. The other thing that shaped me was that I spent three months on buses travelling alone around the US. To this day I don't understand why my mother allowed me to do that when I was 18. If she had known the areas where the buses stopped in downtown LA&#8230;. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What's the best advice you've had?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: Probably the advice to come back to the Swedish agency in 1995. Staying in the UK then would probably have meant that my family would have been broken up. My kids were young, I don't think I could have maintained the relationship while my kids were in Sweden and I was in England. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: How do you relax?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I love to travel. I took my family to South Africa over Christmas. Plus I'm good at letting go of work over weekends. I focus on the things that are happening right now &ndash; if I am travelling, I am travelling and that's it. I spend a fair bit of time in the gym as well, and that is also a good way to relax. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: Tell us something surprising about you.</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I am very interested in Persian carpets. The handiwork is phenomenal, for example, the number of stitches you get in a weave and how they make that into a silk carpet. The amount of work that goes in to this is mind-blowing and the history and tradition behind the carpets is fantastic. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What gets you out of bed?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: You'll laugh, it sounds pathetic. It's the European collaboration at the CHMP. I love it. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: If you weren't chair of the CHMP, what would you be doing?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I'd be working with industry or I'd be an academic researching pharmacokinetics, which was my research area. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What has been your proudest moment?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: My parents divorced when I was a teenager so marrying my wife and having my three sons was very important to me. Professionally, being elected CHMP chair beats everything. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: What is your favourite book?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: There are two books I've read three times: The Good Soldier &Scaron;vejk, by Jaroslav Ha&scaron;ek and Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome. </p> <p> <p> <b>Q: If you could meet anyone dead or alive, who would it be?</b> </p> <p> <p> A: I thought about meeting Hitler so I could kill him, but I ended up with my grandfather. He died when I was finishing university. I want to meet him because although he was a bit of a grumpy old man, he was a big inspiration for me. He always encouraged me to do things, like go to university or travel, even though he finished school early and never travelled more than 20km. I think he would have been proud of me. </p> <p> <p> <i><b>Tomas Salmonson</b> is senior scientific adviser at Sweden's Medical Products Agency.
