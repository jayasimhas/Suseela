<p>Going back to the future has been a bit of a theme for pharma recently, and not because Oct. 21 2015, was the date that Marty McFly and Doc Brown traveled to in Back to the Future II. Recent developments picked up by the media at large include a new use for insulin (in diabetes), and a "miracle" new cure for Parkinson's disease (Novartis' leukemia drug Tasigna (nilotinib), which was first approved in 2007).</p><p>The research into insulin's use as an early therapy for type 2 diabetes, and into nilotinib for Parkinson's, excited attention because both appeared to open important new avenues for treatment in diseases that represent a serious burden for patients and society. But Back to the Future II's predictions teach us that we need to be skeptical about how we treat ideas that today seem like the way forward for tomorrow (after all, nobody is still waiting for fax machines to be installed on every street corner). </p><p>The fact that both studies were in tiny numbers of patients should counterbalance burgeoning excitement. </p><p>The insulin study only involved 23 patients, and didn't actually show a huge difference in HbA1c reduction between the two treatments.</p><p>Even if such a small pilot study is eventually validated in larger trials, the treatments in question may not actually be the best available option. Consider insulin therapy in early type 2 diabetes. Current treatment in this group consists of the older oral diabetes therapies. Even if in the controlled conditions of a clinical trial, these are found to be less effective than insulin therapy, patient compliance issues have to be borne in mind in the real world. Is the health benefit of injectable insulin worth the trade-off in convenience? Remember, if we all always did the right thing by our health, type 2 diabetes wouldn't have become a gigantic global health problem (and attractive drug market) in the first place. And there are other relative drawbacks of insulin therapy, like weight gain and price. </p><p>Meanwhile, the nilotinib study conducted at the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington was anecdotally impressive, but it only included 12 patients &ndash; although the target enrolment on clinicaltrials.gov was 36. There was no control group. Patients getting out of wheelchairs make great headlines, and the science is interesting, but much wider, rigorous testing is needed.</p><p><p>
