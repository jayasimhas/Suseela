<p>Once hailed as the model for global going local in China, a joint venture created merely three years ago between Merck and Simcere has quietly faded into history. Does the move signal that the JV model is not working in China?</p><p>The Merck & Co and Simcere Pharmaceutical joint venture was born to rounds of applause. After all, the JV Simcere MSD (SMSD) was a marriage of strengths; by leveraging each company's sales teams to provide a comprehensive commercial approach, the aim was to expand access to both partner's drugs across China.</p><p>The agreement, signed July 2011, initially focused on cardiovascular and metabolic conditions and included Merck's Zocor (simvastatin), Cozaar (losartan), Renitec (enalapril), and potential addition of blockbuster antidiabetic DPP-4 inhibitor Januvia (sitagliptin).</p><p>Simcere contributed its own hypertension treatment Xinta (levamlodipine) and Softan (rosuvastatin) to the stellar lineup of the JV, in which Merck held 51% and Simcere the remaining 49%.</p><p>The JV was led by Zhang Yehong, then president of Simcere and a veteran of Merck, where he spent years working and once served its China GM.</p><p>"This is really just the beginning. We're going to start exploring and adding a number of additional formulations on an annual basis so we can expand this platform into a true branded generic platform in China," proclaimed Zhang at the time.</p><p>Three years on, however, the JV is now a thing of past. MSD in China said the venture has gone through a transformation and become a part of Simcere.</p><p>"In order to pursue further development and better meet challenges posed by the rapidly changing external environment, SMSD will undergo a strategic transformation," said MSD China in a statement.</p><p>"It will now focus on local innovative and mature products, serving the local market. The operation will be managed by Simcere Pharmaceutical Group in this new capacity," added the company.</p><p>MSD didn't elaborate on the fate of the sales force and employees of the JV, which numbered 800 as of 2012.</p><h2>Fallout</h2><p>The JV's first sign of trouble came one year after it was officially launched in September 2012 when two top executives departed, leaving many wondering about its future.</p><p>In addition to Zhang, MSD appointed then strategic alliance general manager in China Renaud Sermondade, who became the chief operating officer of the JV.</p><p>But by the following September, both Zhang and Sermondade had left the company. Zhang took the positon of China GM for US major health insurer Aetna Inc., while Sermondade joined Sanofi China and later became the vice-president for Sanofi in the country.</p><p>In an earlier interview, Semondade had told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> that how the JV and Merck split the marketing of the products was an evolving process.</p><p>"For some products, there will be a co-promotion model. Some hospitals will be managed by the JV, and some of them will be retained by MSD. But this may change in the future, depending on how things evolve."</p><p>Partnering with a strong local player nevertheless would enable the JV to provide "a better coverage and better penetration than a multi-national could achieve in the past, hence providing better and wider access to our high quality drugs for more Chinese patients," Sermondade said.</p><p>Although MSD/Simcere quickly appointed former Bayer China marketing VP Su Zhengsheng to head the JV, many speculated that the preceding top management departures could be related to Simcere's decision to go private.</p><p>Simcere founder Ren Jinsheng and a consortium of investors proposed in March 2012 to take the US-listed drug maker private, prompting questions about whether less stringent disclosure requirements associated with a private company would make it less attractive as a partner-of-choice.</p><p>Following the announcement, more key executives left the Nanjing-based firm. Its chief scientific officer Wang Peng, for one, departed to become the president of R&D for Yabao Pharmaceutical, while executive VP Zhao Hong joined US-China hybrid SciClone Pharmaceuticals as its CEO for China operations.</p><h2>What About Pfizer/Hisun?</h2><p>A day after the official launch of MSD/Simcere, Pfizer and Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical formally kicked off their JV Hisun-Pfizer Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Now with the fading of Simcere and MSD's alliance, will the same fate affect the Pfizer-Hisun JV?</p><p>"The case with MSD/Simcere seems to be an isolated case," former Simcere CSO Wang told <i>PharmAsia News</i>. "The Pfizer JV appears to be operating well, in both new products and market share given the short period of time."</p><p>Starting from beginning, the Pfizer/Hisun, owned 51% and 49% respectively, has been focusing mostly on Hisun products. While Pfizer injected seven products, Hisun's input was roughly 70. Among these, the JV is tasked to register some 20 products.</p><p>Last May, Pfizer-Hisun established a production site in Fuyang, Zhejiang province. The JV had already launched three products in 2013, and had plans to launch two cardiovasculars and one antibiotic throughout 2014. By 2018, the JV aspires to obtain an approval for its own developed product.</p><p>"The JV model itself is good, how to execute it has many variables, in both management and concepts," Wang said.</p><p>Multinationals also have different thinking on China's overall market environment and sales, he added, noting that it is still too early to judge the success of the JV model in China.</p><h2>Evolving Thinking</h2><p>As time goes on, multinationals' thinking about partnering in China has indeed been evolving.</p><p>From learning the ropes via partnerships with locals, fostering commercial tie-ups, to establishing joint ventures and pursuing mergers and acquisitions, the journey reflects changing overall market conditions and individual companies' thinking.</p><p>If the year of 2012 marked the active period for JVs, the following years have seen M&A deals popping up in both pharma and medical device sector.</p><p>While off-patent original drugs have been performing strongly in past years, looming price pressures and a policy favoring innovative products could change that competitive landscape.</p><p>Recently, both Bristol-Myers Squibb and GlaxoSmithKline have outlined plans to downsize their presence in China, with a focus on sales force reduction. </p><p>With the rapid changes comes transformation, Merck said.</p><p>"The health care industry in China has been constantly evolving. The market place has seen significant changes, and e-channels continue to expand," said the company. "Pharmaceutical companies are seeking transformation and reform, with a focus on their priority areas."</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p>
