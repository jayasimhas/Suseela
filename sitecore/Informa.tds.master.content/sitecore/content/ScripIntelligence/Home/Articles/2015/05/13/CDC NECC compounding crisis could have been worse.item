<p>The fungal meningitis outbreak that struck the US in 2012-13 linked to tainted methylprednisolone acetate compounded by a Massachusetts pharmacy &ndash; sickening 751 people in 20 states across the US, killing 64 &ndash; could have been much worse, with the potential for many more Americans to be dead or ill had it not been for the rapid response to the crisis, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a new analysis.</p><p>The coordinated investigation by the FDA, CDC and other federal, state and local public health agencies, speedy recall of the three lots of the contaminated products, prompt notification of the more than 13,500 patients who may have been exposed to the tainted drugs and rapid dissemination of guidelines for diagnosis and treatment likely prevented up to 3,100 additional injections, which could have resulted in about 153 more people becoming ill from meningitis or stroke, with 124 more dying, the researchers said.</p><p>Had the FDA not shut down the New England Compounding Center (NECC) &ndash; whose owner Barry Cadden and supervising pharmacist Glenn Chin were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ARRESTED-Compounders-of-tainted-steroids-face-life-in-prison-355717" target="_new">arrested on 17 December 2014</a> and indicted on several criminal charges, including second-degree murder, with the potential they could face life in prison &ndash; the CDC researchers said there the pharmacy likely would have made more lots of the contaminated methylprednisolone, with each additional tainted lot resulting in 275 additional cases of fungal meningitis or stroke and 77 more deaths. </p><p>The FDA and the CDC confirmed the presence of <i>Exserohilum rostratum</i> in vials of methylprednisolone compounded by Framingham, Massachusetts-based NECC.</p><p>Regulators discovered what they called "greenish black foreign matter" and "white filamentous material" in vials of the drugs.</p><p>Also very visible to the naked eye was overgrowth of mold and bacteria in several places throughout NECC's facility, including in the so-called "clean rooms," which normally are supposed to be sterile environments, the FDA reported in 2013.</p><p>The fungal meningitis crisis led <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/After-decades-of-apathy-blunders-compoundingtrack-and-trace-bill-done-348213" target="_new">Congress to pass</a> the <i>Drug Quality and Security Act</i>, which gave the FDA more authority over compounders and tightened restrictions on those firms.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
