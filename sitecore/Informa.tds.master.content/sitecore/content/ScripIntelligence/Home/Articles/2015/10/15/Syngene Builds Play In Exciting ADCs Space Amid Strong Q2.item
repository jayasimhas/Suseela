<p>The newly listed Indian contract research organization (CRO) Syngene International Ltd reported robust second quarter growth, with the top brass also outlining the firm's intent to partake in "exciting" areas such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). </p><p>Syngene is the research services arm of India's Biocon.</p><p>Syngene reported a 28% increase in revenues to INR2.62bn ($40.3m), while net profit was up 31% to INR523m for the second quarter ended September. </p><p>For the first half of the year, revenues were up 28%, while net profit rose by 29%, backed by broad-based growth across the firm's three verticals led by development and manufacturing services. Added capacities in the development and manufacturing vertical over the past two fiscal years helped fuel this growth, Syngene said in its debut results. </p><p>At a post results investor call on Oct. 21, Syngene's CEO, Peter Bains, said that the firm had established a mid-term revenue target of $250m in 2017-18 and was "confident and committed" to achieving that.</p><p>Syngene, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Syngene-Makes-Strong-Debut-On-Indian-Bourses-359915" target="_new">listed</a> on Indian bourses in August, has previously said that it expected to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indias-Syngene-eyes-CRAMS-role-listing-by-July-358033" target="_new">evolve</a> into a contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) organization with commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>The Bengaluru-based firm has earmarked a capital expenditure plan of about $200m over the next three-four years which will support certain key initiatives such as capacity expansion for its existing platforms in discovery and development services including a new centre for research, a formulation centre and a biologics manufacturing plant. Syngene also expects to extend its platform by adding new capabilities in areas such as ADCs and oligonucleotides, among others, and forward integrate into large scale commercial manufacturing.</p><p>CEO Bains told <i>Scrip</i> that Syngene's model was "very well placed" to support ADCs, underlying that the firm has significant capabilities in both small and large molecules. </p><p>"Combining the two enables us to support ADCs development. ADCs are an exciting and dynamic area of drug discovery and development and one that we are very pleased to be able to participate in. We have a number of collaborations engaged in this arena and those will continue to advance and we hope to expand this area," Bains told <i>Scrip</i> in a late evening media call on Oct. 20.</p><p>Bains said it was too early to comment on whether Syngene would consider site acquisitions in the ADC space like some competitors.</p><p>Syngene says it is uniquely positioned in the ADCs area, given that it not only offers the development of ADCs but also has discovery capabilities.</p><p>"That's quite unique to Syngene at least in the Indian context," Syngene's COO, Manoj Nerurkar, added.</p><p>Experts in the contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) segment have previously highlighted the limited competition in the ADCs space, with very few contract manufacturing organizations that have the facilities or the experience to develop them. </p><p>Last month, Piramal Enterprises' Pharma Solutions division said that research on ADC targets indicates there will be at least 50 entering clinical work by 2020, triggering a potential wave of consolidations within the contract development and manufacturing sector to acquire technology.</p><p>Piramal, though, noted that despite the increase in development targets for ADCs, the global contract manufacturing sector still remained significantly "under resourced" with only a handful of players with experience and even fewer with the required regulatory accreditations. Piramal hopes to emerge as market leader in ADCs contract commercialization over the next five years.</p><h2>Balance</h2><p>Meanwhile, Bains also indicated that he expected the balance of Syngene's business to shift over time to reflect in "a more aligned manner "the proportion of the biologics business in the global market.</p><p>"The balance of our business is around 90% small molecules and 10% biologics. We would expect that balance to evolve over time with the biologics part of the business taking up a larger proportion but we expect growth on both sides of the business," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>In the run up to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Can-Indias-Syngene-best-WuXi-359639" target="_new">Syngene IPO</a>, some analysts cited the growing trend of global consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry and the potential impact on Syngene's business prospects as among the key concerns, in addition to the firm's high dependence on a few customers. </p><p> Bains said that he expected to see more consolidation within in the industry, but in terms of the outlook he doesn't think in the outlook "there are specific thresholds or dynamics which would suggest that it could be higher or lower than the historical average."</p>
