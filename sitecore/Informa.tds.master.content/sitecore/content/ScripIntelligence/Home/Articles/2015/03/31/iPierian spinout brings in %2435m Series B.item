<p><p>South San Francisco, CA.-based biotech True North Therapeutics has brought in $35m in a Series B round of financing to push its lead compound into early-stage clinical trials for the treatment of several rare diseases, the company announced 07 April. </p><p>The second round of cash was led by OrbiMed, and included former investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, MPM Capital, GlaxoSmithKline's venture arm SR One, and Baxter Ventures.</p><p>True North is developing treatments for autoimmune disorders, which occur when the body's defenses stop working the way they are intended. The biotech's lead compound, TNT009, works by dampening down overactivation of the classic complement pathway. TNT009 is going to be studied in rare hematologic and renal diseases. </p><p>The compound was <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/iPierian-raises-30m-to-target-tau-spin-out-complement-program-346213" target="_new">spun out</a> of thriving biotech iPierian before it was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb for $175m upfront and $550m in milestones in April 2014. iPierian was focused on developing treatments for tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disorders. True North was initially focused on the same area, but switched directions in 2013. True North raised its first round of financing in June 2014, when it <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/True-North-appoints-CMO-raises-22m-352401" target="_new">brought in $22m</a> from a slate of prominent investors. </p><p>"There's a lot of interest from pharma and investors; so, I do think there will be a lot of opportunities for the company, whether that's further financings or in partnering," said True North CEO Dr Nancy Stagliano in an interview. She added that her hope would be to see True North carry the programs through as much of clinical development on its own as possible. </p><p>Dr Stagliano, who was also CEO of iPierian, expects the recent round of financing to carry True North through the end of 2016. By that time, the biotech should have completed a Phase Ia of TNT 009 in healthy patients, as well as a Phase Ib in patients with severe rare diseases, including antibody-mediated rejection of kidney transplant and cold agglutinin disease. The trials will begin in the second quarter and take place in Vienna. </p><p>The biotech is intends to move a second complement pathway-targeted compound into development this year, but would not reveal what diseases will be treated. Dr Stagliano noted that the compound was discovered in-house and is currently in the early discovery phase. </p><p>Dr Stagliano believes the company has a strong future and is confident in the biology. "We think, in a capital efficient way, we can take these compounds far into the clinic. There is a clearly-defined regulatory pathway and a streamlined regulatory path for orphan drugs. We know this biology incredibly well and spent the last couple of years understanding what we need to read out to measure success," she added. </p><p>True North isn't the only biotech to target the complement pathway; Alexion Therapeutics paved the way with its rare blood disorder treatment Soliris (eculizumab). Dr Stagliano noted that TNT009 works differently than Soliris and targets the cascade further upstream. </p><p><p><p>
