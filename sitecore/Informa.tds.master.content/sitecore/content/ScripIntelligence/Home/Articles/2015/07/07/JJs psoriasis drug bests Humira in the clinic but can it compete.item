<p>Johnson & Johnson's anti&ndash;interleukin-23 therapy, guselkumab, has shown greater efficacy than AbbVie's Humira in a Phase II psoriasis trial &ndash; but can it compete in a saturated market place?</p><p>In the Phase II trial in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, patients treated with guselkumab achieved greater skin clearance than those receiving the current standard of care (Humira). </p><p>The primary end point of the study was the proportion of patients with a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 (indicating cleared psoriasis) or 1 (indicating minimal psoriasis) at week 16. Data from the trial were previously presented at a medical conference but were published in <i>the New England Journal of Medicine</i> this week.</p><p>At week 16, the proportion of patients with a PGA score of 0 or 1 was significantly higher in each guselkumab group than in the placebo group (which was given Humira at the standard recommended dose for psoriasis treatment of 40mg): 34% in the 5mg group, 61% in the 15mg group, 79% in the 50mg group, 86% in the 100mg group, and 83% in the 200mg group, as compared with 7% in the placebo group (P?0.002 for all comparisons). Moreover, the proportion was significantly higher in the 50mg, 100mg, and 200mg guselkumab groups than in the adalimumab group (58%; P<0.05 for="" all=""></0.05></p><p>However, despite the positive data, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Christina Vasiliou noted that guselkumab will likely be relegated to later lines of therapy, should it be approved and launched. </p><p>She also noted that Johnson & Johnson will have to push to differentiate its offering in light of the availability of highly efficacious IL inhibitors, namely the first-to-market IL-12/23 inhibitor Johnson & Johnson's own Stelara (ustekinumab) and Novartis's first-in-class IL-17A biologic Cosentyx (secukinumab).</p><p>"Product differentiation is critical for new IL inhibitors attempting to enter the psoriasis market," she said. </p><p>Meanwhile, "There are currently three late-Phase IL inhibitors in the psoriasis pipeline, ixekizumab (Lilly), brodalumab (AstraZeneca), and tildrakizumab (Merck & Co), which have all demonstrated promising efficacy to date. While these agents are expected to create more treatment options for patients with psoriasis, they will also lead to an increasingly saturated market, rendering guselkumab's prospects unfavorable," she said. </p><p>Aside from demonstrating superior efficacy and safety to existing therapies, new biologics will also have to launch at a lower cost in order to establish a place in the psoriasis treatment paradigm. "Such differentiation is more important than ever in today's environment of cost-containment where payers are heavily influencing prescribing decisions," Ms Vasilou said. </p><p>The Phase II, dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active-comparator trial compared guselkumab with Humira in a total of 293 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. </p><p>Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23. By contrast, Stelara binds to the p40 subunit of IL-23 as well as IL12. Thus, guselkumab may offer more specificity of inhibition for IL-23.</p><p>The drug is already in Phase III studies for the treatment of psoriasis and in Phase II for psoriatic arthritis. In psoriasis Sagient Research's BioMedTracker has given the drug a likelihood of approval rating of 62%, 3% above the average for such a product at this stage of development. However, an approval in the US is not anticipated until 2018. </p><p>Studies of guselkumab in rheumatoid arthritis, however, were suspended after data from a Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis failed to show significant efficacy in improving signs and symptoms of active RA based on ACR20 response.
