<p>With the US Senate voting 62-37 on 22 May, President Barack Obama took a giant leap closer to gaining the fast-track trade promotion authority (TPA) he is seeking to more quickly wrap up the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations &ndash; a pact between the US and 11 other nations, which together make up 40% of the world's gross domestic product.</p><p>The TPA would allow Mr Obama to send negotiated trade deals to Congress for an up or down vote, with lawmakers having no ability to filibuster or amend the agreement.</p><p>"Today's bipartisan Senate vote is an important step toward ensuring the United States can negotiate and enforce strong, high-standards trade agreements," Mr Obama said in a 22 May statement. </p><p>"The legislation the Senate passed today will update Congress's marching orders to the administration on trade policy and put in place unprecedented new requirements for transparency and congressional consultation," added US Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman.</p><p>While President Obama faced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-plays-hardball-on-trade-insists-Dem-opponents-wrong-357996" target="_new">opposition</a> from several members of his own party in the Senate on the TPA, who also are objecting to the TPP &ndash; notably Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nevada), who were joined by 28 other Democrats, five Republicans and two Independents in ultimately failing to stop the fast-track bill from clearing their chamber &ndash; the House is expected to be an even tougher fight.</p><p>Indeed, most of the House Democrats also have said they will oppose the TPA legislation, while several Republicans, whose party controls the chamber, have said they are uncomfortable giving President Obama any more authority than he already holds, and therefore, are inclined to vote against the fast-track bill.</p><p>President Obama said he needs the TPA in hand to seal the deal on the TPP, which has been in negotiations since 2009, starting out with nine nations and growing to 12 &ndash; Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, New Zealand and the US. </p><p>Although the TPP talks have taken place behind closed doors, various draft chapters, including the ones on intellectual property and investment, were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">leaked</a> by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization have backed the TPP, while the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GPhA-raises-objections-to-TPP-IP-text-354680" target="_new">raised concerns</a> about what it has called an "unbalanced structure," claiming the pact fails to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring expedited access to more affordable medicines.</p><p>The intellectual property provisions affecting biopharmaceuticals proposed in the TPP, including patent linkage, patent term extensions and exclusivity provisions, "would delay the launch of generic drugs to the detriment of patients, healthcare budgets and the generic industry," GPhA CEO Ralph Neas told reporters this past December.</p><p>He said the TPP also would "lock in policies covering biologic medicines that would contribute to putting these very expensive drugs and vaccines beyond the reach of patients and governments."</p><p>But PhRMA also has raised concerns, noting the conflict that exists within the Obama administration over the number of years of exclusivity that may be sought in the TPP.</p><p>On one hand, the lobbying group said, the Obama administration has "indicated" it would honor the trade framework established under the now-lapsed TPA, enacted in 2002, which would require agreements to include provisions that provide similar protections to those afforded under US law.</p><p>PhRMA pointed out that the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 </i>(BPCIA), which created the pathway for the FDA to approve biosimilars, established 12 years of exclusivity protection.</p><p>But on the other hand, some in the administration have said they want to see the 12 years cut down to seven years &ndash; with even Mr Obama's budget proposals including the lower figure.</p><p>PhRMA said it is concerned USTR chief Ambassador Froman has yet to propose a specific period of "data" protection for biologics in the TPP.</p><p>The BPCIA actually does not specifically state that it provides for "data" exclusivity.</p><p>According to the FDA, the term "exclusivity" as applied to a particular product generally refers to a statutory limitation on the US agency's ability to accept for review or to license or approve certain competing products for a specified period of time.</p><p>Specifically, approval of an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable biological product, known as a 351(k), may not be made effective until 12 years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, which under BPCIA excludes the date of licensure of supplements and certain other applications. </p><p>A 351(k) also cannot be submitted for review until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed under a 351(a) application, the FDA said in its recent <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm407844.pdf" target="_new">guidance document</a>.</p><p>Several US lawmakers have called for Ambassador Froman to ensure the TPP secures 12 years of data exclusivity protection.</p><p>"As you know, 12 years is US law and is the result of a carefully developed bipartisan compromise reflective of the amount of time economists estimate it takes to recoup the substantial investment companies make in biopharmaceutical research," Republican Senators Rob Portman (Ohio) and John Cornyn (Texas), joined by nine other senators from their party, said in a 13 May letter to the USTR. "Data protection also adds a critical safeguard for biologic treatments that at only be protected by weaker process patents, as opposed to traditional patents on a single molecule drugs that are chemically synthesized."</p><p>Not offering "adequate protections" aimed at spurring innovation and investment in the TPP, they said, would "ultimately lead to companies taking fewer risks and patients globally not receiving treatments that may have been developed under an appropriate standard," the lawmakers argued. "We strongly believe that standard should be 12 years." </p><p>Four Democratic senators &ndash; Maria Cantwell (Washington), Thomas Carper (Delaware), Robert Casey (Pennsylvania) and Robert Menendez (New Jersey) &ndash; sent a similar letter to President Obama in March.</p><p>They noted Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell told lawmakers at a Senate Finance Committee hearing earlier this year the administration backed seven years of exclusivity for biologics.</p><p>"This statement contradicts several assurances we have received that the administration&rsquo;s position is the maintenance of the 12-year standards," the four Democrats declared, calling on the president to confirm that &ldquo;you and Ambassador Froman are working to ensure that strong IP standards are included in any final agreement" for the TPP.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">FDA hugged, Medicare plans squeezed: A 'Cures' lovefest</a></p><p>Representative Bobby Rush (Democrat-Illinois) said it best: it was a "lovefest" at the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 21 May during the markup session for the 21st Century Cures Act (HR 6), with the $13bn bill easily being adopted in a unanimous vote.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">FDA: $1bn needed to cover 'Cures' costs</a></p><p>The FDA estimated it would cost about $1bn to cover its costs for implementing the provisions in the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>.
