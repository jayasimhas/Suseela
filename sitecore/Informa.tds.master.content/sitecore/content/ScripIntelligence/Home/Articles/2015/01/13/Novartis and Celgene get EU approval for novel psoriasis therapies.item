<p> The European Commission has approved two new drugs for psoriasis: Novartis's Cosentyx (secukinumab) and Celgene's Otezla (apremilast). </p> <p> Novartis's first-in-class IL17A inhibitor Cosentyx has the broader label: it was give the go-ahead by the CHMP for use as a first-line systemic treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. </p> <p> For its part, the oral PDE-4 inhibitor Otezla is approved for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who have failed to respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including cyclosporine, methotrexate or psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA). However, it has also been approved for the related indication of psoriatic arthritis, alone or in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to a prior DMARD therapy. It received a CHMP positive opinion in November (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/EU-blesses-Celgenes-oral-psoriasis-drug-355210">scripintelligence.com, 22 November 2014</a>) </p> <p> Cosentyx received its first worldwide approval, in Japan for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, at the end of 2014, and is also set for US approval this month (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-wins-world-first-Cosentyx-approval-in-Japan-355867">scripintelligence.com, 29 December 2014</a>). Further filings for Cosentyx in psoriatic arthritis are due this year. Otezla was first approved in the US for psoriatic arthritis back in March 2014, and later approved there for psoriasis. </p> <p> Cosentyx has the advantage of the biologics as being the only one approved for first-line use: currently, all biologic treatments for psoriasis, including the long-established anti-TNFs and Johnson &amp; Johnson's anti-IL12/23 product Stelara (ustekinumab) are recommended for second-line systemic therapy in the EU. </p> <p> Its arrival has been highly anticipated as it offers a novel treatment option with impressive efficacy and a low rate of side effects, says Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Jacoba Procter. Notably, in the FIXTURE psoriasis trial Cosentyx performed very well in a head-to-head trial versus Enbrel, which will help to position the product even without long-term data. More recently, it performed well against Stelara in the Phase III CLEAR study in psoriasis (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartiss-Cosentyx-adds-to-Stelaras-data-woes-355640">scripintelligence.com, 12 December 2014</a>). </p> <p> &quot;While the lack of long-term data will mean that uptake is expected to be relatively slow, as dermatologists gain experience with the drug we expect it to become a key player in the market. Notably, Cosentyx is the only biologic to gain approval in the EU for first-line therapy in the treatment of psoriasis. While it is likely that initial use will be in later lines, again with experience this label is expected to contribute to greater uptake.&quot; </p> <p> Otezla can also boast a novel mechanism of action in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and that it offers a second-line treatment option that does not require tuberculosis pre-screening or regular laboratory monitoring, but its arrival is expected to be met with less enthusiasm. With its EU label specifying approval for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who have failed to respond to systemic therapy and for PsA in adults who fail on non-biological DMARDs drugs, Otezla will need to compete with biologics for patient share at later lines, says Ms Procter. &quot;However, efficacy data has been underwhelming such that, despite the advantage of an oral formulation, it will struggle to see uptake in this patient segment.&quot; </p> <p> For a detailed breakdown of the anti-inflammatory area, see <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/world-of-inflammat_248471a.html">Scrip's World of Inflammation</a> dashboard. </p>
