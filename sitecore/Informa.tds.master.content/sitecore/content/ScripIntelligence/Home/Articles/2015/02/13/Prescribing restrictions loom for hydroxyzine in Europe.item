<p>Prescribing restrictions are likely to be imposed on the antihistamine hydroxyzine in the EU after the European Medicines Agency's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (PRAC) said that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of heart rhythm problems associated with the product.</p><p>Following a review of hydroxyzine, which is available in most EU countries for use in conditions such as anxiety, preoperative anxiolysis, pruritus and sleep disorders, the PRAC concluded that it was associated with a "small but definite" risk of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. It said that the risk did not differ among indications, and recommended that the product could continue to be prescribed as long as risk-minimization measures were taken.</p><p>The risk of QT prolongation with hydroxyzine was already known and listed in the product information, but the results of new studies suggested the side-effect could occur at lower doses than originally supposed, according to the French regulatory agency ANSM, which was rapporteur for the safety review. </p><p>In March 2014, UCB, which markets hydroxyzine as Atarax, informed the Hungarian competent authority (GYEMSZI-OGYI) that it intended to delete the product's preoperative anxiolysis and sleep disorder indications, and to reduce the highest recommended adult daily dose from 300mg to 100mg in the remaining indications. This followed a benefit-risk assessment by UCB in response to results obtained from non-clinical studies and pharmacovigilance data on the substance's suspected pro-arrythmogenic potential.</p><p>The following April, Hungary, which is the lead member state for signals relating to hydroxyzine, decided to initiate a benefit-risk review and referred the matter to the PRAC. Hungary was appointed co-rapporteur for the dossier. </p><h2>Restrictions</h2><p>The measures recommended by the PRAC include:</p><ul><li>Hydroxyzine should be used at the lowest effective dose for as short a time as possible.</li><li>The maximum dose should be no more than 100mg per day in adults and should not exceed 2mg/kg body weight per day in children weighing up to 40kg.</li><li>Its use should be avoided in the elderly because of the risks linked to anticholinergic effects; if treatment in elderly patients is deemed necessary, the maximum dose should be 50mg per day.</li><li>The product should be avoided in patients with risk factors for heart rhythm disturbances or those taking other medicines that increase the risk of QT prolongation.</li><li>Care should be taken when prescribing hydroxyzine to patients already taking drugs that slow the heart rate or reduce levels of potassium in the blood.</li></ul><p>Products containing hydroxyzine have been approved via non-centralized procedures in the EU, and are marketed under a range of brand names including Atarax. The PRAC's recommendation will therefore be forwarded to the member states' Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures &ndash; Human (CMDh), which will adopt a final position and issue guidance for patients and healthcare professionals. If the position cannot be unanimously agreed, the majority view will be sent to the European Commission for a binding opinion.</p>
