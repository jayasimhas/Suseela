<p>Merck KGaA has a new CEO and a new logo. 'German Merck' has promoted its deputy CEO Stefan Oschmann into the top job, and he will take over from Karl-Ludwig Kley in April 2016. Meanwhile, Merck is eliminating its Merck Serono and Merck Millipore brands, and will be known simply as Merck outside North America. Inside North America, where 'US Merck' owns the brand name, it will continue to use the EMD prefix for its businesses. </p><p>Concurrent with the rebranding, Merck has changed its logo. It has "deliberately rid ourselves of outdated features and will be focusing on a young and eye-catching image," incumbent CEO Kley said in a statement. The rebranding is part of Merck's 'Fit for 2018' program, "which also involves a more self-confident and at the same time clearer tone of voice, reflecting Merck's character and linking its pride in a nearly 350-year-old culture with scientific curiosity and a passion for research."</p><p>Merck, of course, is having a challenging year as it deals with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-KGaAs-Rebif-Facing-Irreversible-Decline-Avelumab-Update-Expected-Soon-359809" target="_new">declining sales</a> of its top-selling drug Rebif (interferon beta-1a), used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Sales dropped 12% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2014 owing to strong competition from oral formulations. </p><p>One of the big future hopes for Merck involves its multi-billion dollar collaboration with Pfizer Inc. on the development of immune-oncology products, including the clinical-stage PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab.</p><p>The US FDA granted avelumab fast track designation for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer, in recent days.</p><p>.</p>
