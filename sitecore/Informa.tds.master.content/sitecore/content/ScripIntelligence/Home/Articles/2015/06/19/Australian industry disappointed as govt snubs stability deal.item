<p>Medicines Australia has expressed its disappointment at the health minister's decision not to sign a strategic agreement that would have provided the Australian industry with some policy stability over the next five years in return for agreeing to support medicines access and sustainability measures including price cuts to medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</p><p>The strategic agreement met all aspects of a letter of intent signed by the minister, Sussan Ley, on 27 May, said Medicines Australia, which represents originator pharma firms. It said it had also offered to work with the government on safety concerns raised over proposals to implement biosimilar substitution in Australia.</p><p>However, Ms Ley has "closed down the negotiations and refused to sign the proposed agreement," the association said. "It is extremely disappointing that the health minister isn't listening to widespread concerns about patient safety and the need for some stability for the local medicines industry," CEO Tim James remarked.</p><p>Apparently it was the issue of biosimilar substitution at pharmacy level that caused the rupture: while industry wanted to discuss this outside of the strategic agreement, the government was not willing to do so. </p><p>Whatever the reason, with biosimilar substitution, price cuts and product delistings on the cards, not to mention a number of changes at pharmacy level, the pharmaceutical landscape In Australia is in something of a state of flux. </p><p>The PBS Access and Sustainability Package is designed to ensure patient access to PBS-subsidized drugs while maintaining the scheme's sustainability and the quality of medicines. It includes a one-off 5% cut in the price of single-brand medicines, changes to the price disclosure arrangements for multiple-brand medicines, cuts in generic drug prices, and the delisting of certain non-prescription drugs.</p><p>It also gives new powers to the health minister to declare drugs (including biosimilars) to be equivalent for the purposes of PBS listing and &ndash; controversially &ndash; pharmacy substitution.</p><p>Some of the provisions in the package &ndash; PBS pricing reform, listing of bioequivalent and biosimilar medicines, and pharmacy co-payment discounts &ndash; are also included in the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015, which completed its legislative journey with approval by the Senate on 23 June. </p><h2>"serious and sustainable package"</h2><p>The government clearly sets great store by the bill's provisions. Welcoming the Senate vote, Ms Ley described the new legislation as a "serious and sustainable package designed to underpin the delivery of new medicines and the investments in new treatments that we know we need to make in the next five years over the course of this agreement".</p><p>She said the bill offered Aus$6.6bn worth of efficiencies through the PBS supply chain and Aus$2.8bn of additional direct investment into the pharmacy sector, including Aus$1.2bn in primary care, as pharmacies move from dispensing medications to being key players in the delivery of primary care. </p><p>She also thanked all involved, including "the manufacturers of both generic and innovator medicines", for their collaboration in helping to make medicines available. She noted that at the end of May Pfizer's anticancer crizotinib was listed on the PBS. "It is an Aus$60 million investment by this government. Aus$80,000 is the real price per script. We worked with the drug manufacturer, Pfizer, through a managed entry program, to allow access to this breakthrough drug for those in the most clinical need."</p><p>Her praise for the innovator industry, though, will likely cut little ice with Medicines Australia after the collapse of the talks on the strategic agreement. </p><p>Mr James said, "Making new, innovative medicines is extremely expensive. It costs on average Aus$2.5bn to develop a new medicine for patients. It also takes 12 to 15 years to get a medicine from initial pre-clinical trials to the pharmacy shelf for patients. If we are to continue to invest and invent these treatments then the industry needs to have confidence that governments won't constantly change their budgetary decisions."</p><p>He said the fact that the government had announced "significant, unexpected cuts to medicines" on the PBS and now will not provide any guarantee that more cuts aren't coming "has sent a shiver down the spine of this industry. This puts future investment in medicines in Australia at risk. It puts Australians' access to the latest, innovative therapies at risk."</p><p>A spokesperson for Medicines Australia said it was the biosimilar substitution issue that caused the breakdown of talks on the strategic agreement: while the industry had offered to continue talks on substitution at pharmacy level outside the agreement, the government refused. The association is, however, continuing to talk with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) and the regulatory body, the TGA.</p><p>Medicines Australia is not wholly opposed to biosimilar substitution in principle, but says that at present there is not enough evidence on the "automatic, safe substitution of biosimilars without the appropriate oversight of a doctor". It said this had been a "poorly run process by the federal government, which has failed to properly consult with the medicines industry, patient groups and doctors". </p><p>The association is not alone in having doubts about substitution: just before the vote on the bill, a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Slow-down-on-biosimilar-substitution-says-Australian-Senate-committee-359106" target="_new">Senate committee said</a> that the government should hold a broad consultation with all stakeholders before going ahead with the proposal because of the safety and procedural concerns that have been raised. </p><h2>view from the generics industry</h2><p>Meanwhile, the GMiA, which represents generic manufacturers and has already signed its own strategic agreement with the health minister, said it welcomed the passage of the bill. Its CEO, Belinda Wood, pointed out that the technical amendment regarding biosimilars was "just that &ndash; a technical amendment. It does not mandate that substitution of biosimilars will occur." Even if a biosimilar is deemed substitutable for the reference drug ("a"-flagging), the doctor still has the ability to prescribe the reference product, she told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"Importantly, the PBAC has stated has stated that the decision to apply an "a"-flag will be based on data. It is not a substitution free-for-all. Where data doesn't support "a"-flagging, other initiatives to increase biosimilar use may be required," Ms Wood noted. </p><p>There are many ways to increase biosimilar uptake, some of which have been used internationally, including education and usage quotas, she said. Under its strategic agreement with the Commonwealth, she continued, the GMiA "will work with the government to identify and implement these initiatives to drive biosimilar uptake and increase patient access to affordable medicines".</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>.</p>
