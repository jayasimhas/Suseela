<p> After the legislative upheavals in France and Italy, the Avastin v Lucentis saga has reared its head again in the UK, after clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) called on the government and NHS England to support doctors wanting to prescribe Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) off label for wet AMD in place of Novartis' more costly Lucentis (ranibizumab). </p><p> Leaders from 120 CCGs, representing almost 60% of CCGs, have written to the General Medical Council, the Department of Health and NHS England asking them to remove the barriers preventing CCGs from commissioning the use of Avastin for wet AMD. Doing so, they say, could release &quot;millions of pounds&quot; that could be re-invested into other frontline patient services. </p><p> &quot;As clinicians we are seeing an increase in the incidence of this chronic eye condition due to an ageing population, and as commissioners we have a responsibility to ensure that every pound spent is done so to the best effect, and that is even more important with the current financial pressures the NHS is facing,&quot; said Amanda Doyle, co-chair of NHS Clinical Commissioners (NHSCC) and chief clinical officer at Blackpool CCG. </p><p> But the pharmaceutical industry is far from happy with this development. Paul Catchpole, director of value and access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said that &quot;seeking to bypass the regulatory system by calling for local clinical commissioning groups to prescribe an unlicensed medicine on the grounds of cost alone potentially threatens patient safety. In this case, there are a number of MHRA and NICE approved licensed medicines available to treat this condition.&quot; </p><p> For its part, the GMC said it was considering the NHSCC letter and intended to reply to it shortly. In the meantime, its chief executive, Niall Dickson, said that as its guidance made clear, the GMC supports the efficient use of NHS resources &quot;and we are sympathetic to the argument that a better solution needs to be found for the use of Avastin in the treatment of wet AMD&quot;. </p><p> For a cash-strapped health service facing ever increasing costs, the option of using of Avastin on financial grounds is certainly very tempting, but doctors wanting to do so are skating on thin ice. The General Medical Council guidelines say off-label use should only happen if there is no suitable licensed medicine available. In this case, Lucentis is already approved and widely used for wet AMD, and the only real advantage in using Avastin &ndash; which has to be split into smaller doses before it can be injected into the eye &ndash; is the potential saving on the NHS England drugs bill. </p><p> Prescribing Avastin off-label for AMD could also incur legal action. In 2012, Novartis began proceedings against a primary care trust in the south of England after it started using Avastin for wet AMD. The case was dropped after Novartis agreed to reduce the price of Lucentis, and the PCT stopped using Avastin for this indication. Doctors considering Avastin in AMD will be wary of drawing similar attention. </p><h2> Pressure growing </h2><p> Nonetheless, the pressure to do something is growing. In 2011, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists published the conclusions of an expert group that reviewed the literature on the two products in this condition. The group, the RCOphth said, &quot;concluded that both are equally effective in the treatment of AMD and have a similar safety profile&quot;. And in November last year, the college said the regulator should find a way to license Avastin for this use, or NICE should find a way to consider the issue. </p><p> Also last year, a comparative review of the safety of Avastin and Lucentis by the Cochrane Collaboration, which looked at nine non-industry sponsored clinical studies, found that the systemic safety of bevacizumab for macular degeneration appeared to be similar to that of ranibizumab, except for gastrointestinal disorders. </p><p> Dr Doyle said the Cochrane review showed that Avastin had been proven to be comparable in terms of its effectiveness and its safety, and &quot;is a significantly more cost effective treatment for wet AMD than anything which is currently available for us to use. Members of the public would be baffled if they knew the sums of money being spent on expensive drugs when there is an alternative available that is cheaper and as effective.&quot; </p><p> She also mentioned the two-year IVAN study, which was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) and ended last year. &quot;The trial included 610 people and is one of the largest ever carried out in the field of eye disease in the UK,&quot; Dr Doyle said. &quot;The study shows sight to be equally well preserved with either of the two drugs and there were no dissimilarities between the two drugs with regards to serious adverse events.&quot; IVAN also suggested the savings from using Avastin in place of Lucentis could amount to at least &pound;102m a year. </p><p> Julie Wood, the NHSCC's director, said that doctors were currently in an &quot;invidious position&quot; because on the one hand they were told that drugs should be used off-label on clinical grounds only, but on the other they had to pay due regard to the good use of public money. But Ms Wood told <i>Scrip</i> that the situation had changed in the light of the Cochrane study. &quot;Now we have the Cochrane review and comparative data, and we need to get the cost-effectiveness issue to the fore. So we have asked for a specific exemption for Avastin,&quot; she said. </p><h2> NHSCC proposals </h2><p> While calls for Avastin to be used in place of Lucentis on the NHS for financial reasons are nothing new, this is the first time that the CCGs have grouped together in this way to request government and GMC support. Dr Doyle said: &quot;This is a long standing issue within the NHS and the numbers of CCGs who have united behind this shows the strength of feeling there is to ensure that we have all the available options to be able to deliver the best possible care for our patients.&quot; </p><p> &quot;As clinicians we are seeing an increase in the incidence of this chronic eye condition due to an ageing population, and as commissioners we have a responsibility to ensure that every pound spent is done so to the best effect, and that is even more important with the current financial pressures the NHS is facing.&quot; </p><p> In its letters, the NHSCC has asked the GMC to provide a specific exception to its standard guidance in order to support doctors wishing to prescribe Avastin off label on clinical and cost-effectiveness grounds, and the secretary of state for health to authorize NICE to undertake a multiple technology appraisal of the comparative effectiveness of Avastin versus Lucentis and Eylea (Bayer's aflibercept, which is also approved for AMD in the UK). The organization also calls on the CEO of NHS England, Simon Stevens, to &quot;support the case for change&quot;. </p><p> The GMC's Mr Dickson said that if it was simply a matter of changing GMC guidance to allow doctors to prescribe a cheaper but equally safe alternative medicine, &quot;we would do it&quot;. But he pointed out that the main problem was the law. </p><p> &quot;The European Court has in effect ruled out the adoption of blanket policies that permit the off label/unlicensed prescribing of medicines on the grounds of cost and this is reflected in the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance which makes it clear that cost, convenience or operational needs cannot be taken into account,&quot; he said in emailed comments to <i>Scrip</i>. He said the GMC did consult on proposed guidance that took account of cost, &quot;but the legal advice was clearly against this, and we cannot issue guidance that encourages doctors to break the law&quot;. </p><h2> Industry attacks the move </h2><p> It was the question of contravention of EU law that led the European industry federation, EFPIA, to join up with two other industry bodies to lodge a complaint with the European Commission against a new Italian law that, like similar legislation in France, allows the use of medicines off-label for financial reasons even when alternative treatments are available. </p><p> Richard Bergstrom, EFPIA director general, told <i>Scrip</i> recently that the Italian law &quot;turns the EU system upside down&quot; and risks compromising quality, safety and efficacy standards laid down in by the EU regulatory system. </p><p> Reflecting these comments, the ABPI's Paul Catchpole said of the NHSCC's proposals that the UK's &quot;rigorous safety testing and medicines licensing requirements&quot; were there for a reason: to &quot;protect the public's interests in medicines development and monitor the safe and appropriate use of medicines&quot;. </p><p> He said the ABPI's view is that medicines should only be used outside their marketing authorisations within established GMC prescribing guidelines, in order to meet the specific needs of individual patients where no suitable licensed medicine is available. &quot;The MHRA and NICE are the proper authorities to issue guidance to the NHS on the safety, quality and clinical and cost effectiveness of medicines and commissioners are legally obliged to implement NICE guidance,&quot; he continued. </p><p> The NHSCC's call to bypass national guidance on economic grounds, he declared, was &quot;completely inappropriate, particularly so when under the terms of the current PPRS Agreement, the pharmaceutical industry has recognised the financial challenge faced by the NHS and is currently underwriting the NHS branded medicines bill, within agreed limits, until 2018&quot;. </p><p> Mr Dickson said there was one way round the problem: Roche could seek an appropriate licence to use Avastin in AMD, or European law could be changed. &quot;It might also be helpful were the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the MHRA to issue statements clarifying their respective positions,&quot; he added. </p><p> Calls have repeatedly been made for Roche to seek a licence for the AMD use, and it has repeatedly said it has no plans to do so. There is in fact little commercial incentive for it to seek such a licence, and no benefit either for Novartis. Under an agreement with the Roche subsidiary Genentech, Novartis has the rights to commercialize Lucentis outside the US, and in return Roche gets significant royalties recognized by Novartis on sales of the more expensive product. </p><p> The two companies have already had a run-in with the authorities, after the Italian competition body decided in 2014 to fine them &euro;182.5m for &quot;illicit collusion&quot; to exclude Avastin from the ophthalmology market in favour of Lucentis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Roche-Novartis-slam-Italian-cartel-fine-350396" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com</a>, 5 March 2014). Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. </p>
