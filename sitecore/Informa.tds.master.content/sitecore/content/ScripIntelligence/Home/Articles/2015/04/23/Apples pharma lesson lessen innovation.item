<p>Weaning itself off innovation for innovation's sake may be the clearest lesson that Apple can teach pharma.</p><p>Apple Inc, the most highly valued company in the world, put out its second quarter 2015 result on 27 April. You don't have to know anything about its products to conclude that Apple is not in the pharma sector: it is worth too much, makes too much money, grows too fast, and spends nothing like enough on technical innovation to be a member of the pharmasphere.</p><p>Apple has a higher market capitalization bigger than the top three pharma companies put together, sells more product than the top four pharma companies put together, but spends a lower proportion of sales on R&D than the least innovative generic pharma companies.</p><table><h2>Table 1 Apple versus pharma &ndash; key metrics</h2><th><tr><td><p>Metric*</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Apple</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pharma</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></th><tbody><tr><td><p>Market cap</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$770bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$741bn (JnJ, Novartis, and Sanofi)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Last quarter sales</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$58.03bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$58.96 (Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Merck & Co and Sanofi)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Quarterly sales growth y-o-y</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$12.34bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-$1.5bn (Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Merck & Co and Sanofi)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Employees</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>97,000</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>592,000 (Novartis, JnJ, Bayer, and Sanofi)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Quarterly Sales per Employee</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$600,000</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$89,500 (Novartis); $167,000 (Pfizer); $1.03m (Gilead)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Quarterly R&D spending</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.92bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.1bn (Roche); $2.04bn (Pfizer)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>R&D spend/Product Sales</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>3.3%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>18.4% (Merck); 7.3% (Teva); 3.0% (Valeant)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Total Assets</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$261bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$300.3bn (Pfizer and JnJ)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><p>*Data include non-pharma activities of pharma companies; Apple, Novartis and Merck & Co data from quarter ending 31 March 2015; Pfizer, Sanofi, Roche and Gilead data quarter ending 31 December 2014.</p></td></tr></table><p><p>Apple's market capitalization is around $770bn, equivalent to the aggregated market cap of Johnson& Johnson, Roche, Novartis, plus a sixth of Pfizer's market cap as a make-weight.</p><p>Apple's quarterly sales were $58.03bn, equivalent to the aggregated quarterly sales of Novartis ($11.935bn), Pfizer ($13.12bn) Sanofi ($12.058bn) Roche ($12.95bn) and most of Merck's ($9.43bn).</p><p>Apple has grown its sales 27% since the equivalent quarter last year when Apple's sales were $45.65bn. By contrast, the combined quarterly sales of Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Roche and Merck shrunk 2.5%.</p><p>Apple's sales grew by a Roche-worth: The $12.34bn that Apple added to its quarterly sales between 2014 to 2015 was almost exactly the same as Roche's entire sales for Q1 2015 ($12.42bn).</p><p>Apple's employees generated just under $600,000 in sales per employee in its second quarter 2015, four times more per employee than Merck or Roche, six times more than Novartis, but much less than Gilead whose 7000 employees generated over a $1m each in the last quarter of 2014 (Gilead's Q1 2015 results are due 30 April).</p><p>With approximately 97,000 employees worldwide, Apple has far fewer personnel than Johnson & Johnson (126,500), Novartis (133,400), Sanofi (113,500) or Bayer (118,900). Apple sitssomewhere betweenRoche (88,500) and GlaxoSmithKline (99,500).</p><p>Apple spent $1.918bn on R&D in its last quarter, less than Hoffman La Roche ($2.1bn), or Novartis ($2.067bn), or Pfizer ($2.04bn), but slightly more than Sanofi ($1.79bn) or Merck & Co ($1.8bn).</p><p>Apple only spends 3.3% of sales on R&D, much smaller than the 15-18% of sales spent by any of the five largest pharma companies, and less than half of the 7% or so spent by large generic pharma companies like Teva and Actavis. Of the top 40 North American or European pharma companies, only Stada (2.8%) and Valeant (3%) spent a smaller proportion of their sales on R&D than Apple. </p><p>Apple's low R&D spend might suggest that it making mobile phones is really a much more straightforward endeavor that developing and distributing drugs, or it might suggest that Apple is hardly a technology company at all. </p><p>For instance, a proportion of the basic technology development needed for the iPad and iPhone, Apple's two biggest products, goes on within the walls (and budgets) of major suppliers like Taiwan-based Foxconn: Foxconn spends around $1.5bn on R&D annually. Apple's pre-eminent position within established markets means that it can mobilize external R&D inputs and convert them into its own profits.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Apple's R&D spend was 6.1% of its sales. Now it is half that. Given the meteoric rise of low R&D-spenders such at Gilead (R&D spend equals 10.3% of sales), Actavis (8.3%), Teva (7.3%), and Valeant (3%), perhaps Apple is merely a decade or two ahead of pharma, recognizing that innovation for its own sake is not a sound basis for a business.</p><p>Innovation must help shift product, and if you can get others to bear some of the cost, all the better.</p><p><p>
