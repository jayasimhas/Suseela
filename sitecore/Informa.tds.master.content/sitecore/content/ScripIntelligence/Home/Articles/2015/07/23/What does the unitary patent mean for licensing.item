<p><b>In his latest column on the future EU patent system, Paul England looks at the possible implications for companies wishing to license their products, including questions such as patent disputes and compulsory licences</b>.</p><p>The protection provided by a unitary patent in the EU will be uniform across all the member states that are participating in the regulation that creates the new type of patent. What effect will this have on unitary patent licensing?</p><p>Uniformity of protection means that any change to the status of the patent must also take effect in uniformity. For example, any amendment to the patent takes effect in all the participating member states simultaneously. Another consequence is that a unitary patent must be assigned as a whole, rather than to different parties in different member states. </p><p>This is in contrast to classical European patents, where the different national designations of the same patent may be assigned to different parties. The licensing of a unitary patent works differently. The regulation creating the unitary patent says that the patent may be licensed "in respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating member states".</p><p>This means that a unitary patent owner or their licensee may grant a licence or sub-licence under the patent to different parties, for different places, within the territories covered by the participating member states. The licensor may, or may not, also reserve for itself the right to work the patent in a particular territory (if it is a sole or non-exclusive licence). </p><p>The right to license more than one party in this way also implies that other dealings that are based on licensing, such as charging a patent, will also be possible for different territories within the area of the participating member states.</p><p>A current uncertainty about the unitary patent regime is in what courts and under what law any disputes concerning unitary patent licences should be resolved. The jurisdiction and law for dealing with licences is typically dictated by the terms agreed by the parties in the licence itself. </p><p>Furthermore, any dispute about the validity of the patents licensed or the scope of protection of their claims must be decided in the Unified Patent Court (UPC) according to UPC law. However, what is not clear is whether such a licence could agree that disputes about the terms of the licence can also be ruled upon in the UPC.</p><p>Compulsory licences of unitary patents are also potentially available. However, these must be obtained for each participating member state according to the laws of that particular member state. </p><p>In other words, it may not be possible to obtain a compulsory licence in every participating member state where the product is protected by the unitary patent. The proprietor of a unitary patent may also file a statement with the European Patent Office, stating that it is prepared to grant a licence in return for appropriate consideration.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at law firm Taylor Wessing</i>.</p>
