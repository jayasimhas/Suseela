<p>Anacor Pharmaceuticals jumped 55.9% to close at $131.93 per share on 13 July on positive top-line Phase III results for the atopic dermatitis (AD) drug crisaborole, which could be safer than other topical treatments for millions of patients &ndash; mostly children &ndash; with mild-to-moderate forms of the skin disease.</p><p>Palo Alto, California-based Anacor reported that crisaborole, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor in lotion form, showed a statistically significant improvement versus placebo in two Phase III clinical trials in terms of the Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA). Roughly half of the crisaborole-treated patients in both trials had ISGA grades of 0 or 1 after four weeks of twice-daily application, which meant their skin was clear or almost clear of AD (also known as eczema).</p><p>In regard to the primary endpoint, the percentage of patients with an ISGA score of 1 or 0 with a minimum 2-grade improvement at day 29 was 32.8% for crisaborole versus 25.4% for placebo in Study AD-301 (p=0.038) and 31.4% for crisaborole versus 18% for placebo in Study AD-302 (p<0.001).></0.001).></p><p>Among all patients with ISGA grades of 0 or 1 at day 29 regardless of the magnitude of improvement, a secondary endpoint, in the crisaborole arms of the studies 51.7% and 48.5% of patients had clear or almost clear skin versus 40.6% and 29.7% in the placebo arms (p=0.005 and p<0.001, respectively).="" also,="" the="" time="" it="" took="" patients="" to="" achieve="" success,="" defined="" as="" an="" isga="" score="" of="" 0="" or="" 1,="" was="" shorter="" in="" the="" crisaborole="" group="" than="" in="" the="" placebo=""></0.001,></p><p><b>Safety advantage?</b></p><p>Anacor plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) seeking US FDA approval of crisaborole during the first half of 2016. If approved, crisaborole's biggest competition will be generic corticosteroid creams, the now-generic calcineurin inhibitor Protopic (tacrolimus) from Astellas, and the Valeant Pharmaceuticals calcineurin inhibitor Elidel (pimecrolimus), which loses US patent protection between October 2015 and December 2018. </p><p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and its partner Sanofi also are in Phase III development with an injectable interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor inhibitor called dupilumab and Celgene is in Phase II with its oral PDE4 inhibitor Otezla (apremilast) for atopic dermatitis, but both systemic therapies are being tested in patients with moderate-to-severe eczema. </p><p>Labels for the Astellas and Valeant topical treatments Protopic and Elidel warn about an increased cancer risk with prolonged use. Glucocorticoids, like Pfizer's Depo-Medrol, can have metabolic effects on patients and affect the immune system.</p><p>"We believe that the four-week response rates demonstrated in this trial could allow for strong uptake and usage given the side effect profiles of other potent AD agents, which are corticosteroids or immune-modulating agents (rapamycin derivatives)," according to Sagient Research in a 13 July BioMedTracker analysis.</p><p>Anacor lacks long-term safety data for crisaborole, but the company has initiated an outcomes study to assess the drug's safety for patients enrolled in Phase III and earlier clinical trials. The most common adverse events for patients treated with crisaborole across the two Phase III studies were application site pain (4.4% for crisaborole versus 1.2% for placebo) and upper respiratory tract infection (3% for both).</p><p>"No new safety signals apparently cropped up in the Phase III program, which tentatively supports the case for chronic crisaborole dosing," the BioMedTracker report said.</p><p><b>Large market dynamics</b></p><p>Mild-to-moderate eczema affects 80% to 90% of the 18m to 25m people with AD, according to Anacor, which noted that the skin condition is most common among children and it can persist into adulthood. The company's study enrolled patients age 2 and up.</p><p>"Following today's data release &ndash; which clearly suggests that crisaborole could become a 'best-in-class' agent &ndash; and given that the addressable market is arguably much larger (estimates vary from 15m to 25m addressable patients), we are significantly increasing our revenue forecasts," Jefferies analyst David Steinberg wrote in a 13 July research note after Anacor reported its top-line results.</p><p>Mr Steinberg more than doubled his earlier estimate of $365m in annual crisaborole sales to $754m by 2020 based on market share reaching 3.4% of 15m patients. The estimate assumes that a 60g container of Anacor's drug will be priced in line with the $450 wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) for Elidel and Protopic. He noted that potential ex-US partnerships could add even more crisaborole revenue.</p><p>Investor optimism about the drug's potential began a fairly fast rise in February 2014 when Anacor said it had the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Valeant-back-to-black-in-4Q-Forest-submits-NDA-Sunesis-Inovio-Oncolytics-raise-cash-Anacor-Phase-III-plan-350304" target="_new">FDA's blessing</a> for its Phase III clinical trial program. The stock rose from $19.44 on 27 February 2014 to $84.61 on 10 July, the last trading day before the company reported its Phase III results. Anacor rose to well above $100 per share and achieved a $5.8bn market cap on 13 July based on positive data in a large patient population with no new treatment options as well as speculation that the company could be an acquisition target.</p><p>It seems unlikely that acquisitive Valeant, with patents expiring during the next few years for its competing treatment Elidel, would be interested in buying Anacor. Such a purchase could raise antitrust concerns, since Anacor's Kerydin (tavaborole) for onychomycosis competes with Valeant's toenail fungus treatment Jublia (efinaconazole). Also, there was bad blood between the two companies in the past; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Dendreon-AnacorValeant-GlycoMimetics-Karyopharm-Cellceutix-347664" target="_new">they settled</a> a patent dispute over Kerydin in favor of Anacor in 2013.</p><p>PharmaDerm, the brand-name dermatology drug division for Novartis's Sandoz subsidiary, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Five-biotech-deals-KaloBiosSanofi-divorce-PaxVaxCrucell-GalenaMonoSol-AnacorSandoz-CelladonEnterprise-Partners-353072" target="_new">distributes Kerydin</a> in the US.</p><p><p><p><p>
