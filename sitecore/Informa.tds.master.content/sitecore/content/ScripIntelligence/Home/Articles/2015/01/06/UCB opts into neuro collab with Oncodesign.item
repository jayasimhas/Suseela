<p><p>UCB has opted into a development program with Oncodesign to use the company's Nanocyclix technology on a kinase target selected by UCB to develop drugs for neurological disorders. This opt-in gives the Belgian pharma the worldwide development and commercialization rights to the undisclosed compound. In exchange, Oncodesign gets a one-time access fee, as well as research funding and potential development, commercial and regulatory milestones. Oncodesign is also eligible for tiered royalties on any products that result. The original collaboration was signed between the pair in 2013.</p><p>"In just over a year, the progress achieved in our early research collaboration has convinced UCB to take a full license on the program and enter into an additional multi-year research program," said Oncodesign Chief Scientific Officer Dr Jan Hoflack. "Identifying inhibitors that are potent and selective - to avoid side effects for the intended chronic use - and that readily enter into the brain after oral application have been major challenges for many years in kinase research. The current license exercised by UCB further validates Nanocyclix as a next generation kinase inhibitor technology that allows to tackle kinases in notoriously difficult fields."</p><p><p>
