<p>The European Medicines Agency has confirmed that its proposed priority medicines initiative, PRIME, will be aimed at identifying at a much earlier stage new medicines that fulfil the current criteria for accelerated assessment &ndash; that is, those that could benefit patients who have no treatment options or that represent a major therapeutic advantage over existing products. </p><p>Companies opting for PRIME would be able to begin talking to the EMA about candidates suitable for accelerated review at an earlier stage of development at present, but they would have to have convincing evidence that the product fulfilled the criterion of unmet medical need. </p><p>Once they opted for the PRIME route, companies would benefit from a number of significant improvements compared with the way that the accelerated review works at the moment, such as greater support through the provision of scientific advice at key development milestones. The scheme might also be opened up to SMEs and academic applicants at an even earlier stage in order to give them the additional regulatory and scientific advice they require.</p><p>These and other details of the PRIME initiative, and how companies should go about using it, have just been published in the form of a "reflection paper" that the EMA has put out for public consultation until Dec. 23. An <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/productsector/pharmaceuticals/Faster-EU-Drug-Assessment-Pathway-Takes-Shape-Convergence-With-US-Breakthrough-Designation-On-the-Cards-361078?autnID=/contentstore/rajpharma/codex/e7a56785-73c0-11e5-91ab-c94c2ef2f9d3.xml" target="_new">outline of the proposal</a> was given by a European Commission official at the recent TOPRA meeting in Berlin. </p><p>Once the reflection paper has been finalized following the consultation, the idea is to launch the scheme during the first quarter of 2016, preceded by the publication of a number of procedural documents including a Q&A and the necessary templates. The EMA says it will report regularly on the uptake and operation of the scheme, which will be subject to review as experience is gained.</p><h2>"A Real Difference To Patients" </h2><p>Developed by the EMA, the commission and its STAMP (Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients) expert group, as well as the EU regulatory network, PRIME builds on the both the current accelerated assessment and scientific advice procedures. It will also complement the EMA's adaptive pathways pilot and the ongoing revision of the two guidelines on accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization. </p><p>According to the agency, PRIME will "encourage developers to focus their resources on those candidate medicines that are likely to make a real difference to a patient&rsquo;s life." Data available to support a request for eligibility "should support the claim that the product has the potential to bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients, through a meaningful improvement of efficacy, such as having an impact on the onset and duration of the condition, or improving the morbidity or mortality of the disease."</p><p>Offering early and intensive guidance is expected to produce better informed development plans, improve the generation of robust data and allow accelerated review so as to "ensure patients access to these promising medicines in the shortest possible timeframe."</p><p>PRIME also "aims to strengthen clinical trial design so that patients participate in trials that are likely to provide the necessary data for an application for marketing authorisation."</p><p>Moreover, the EMA is planning to talk to officials at the US Food and Drug Administration to discuss how the PRIME criteria might be aligned with those of the US "breakthrough" designation scheme. </p><h2>Novelties</h2><p>PRIME will bring a number of key novelties to bolster ongoing support for applicants from an early stage of development, as follows:</p><ul><li>Written confirmation of eligibility for PRIME, including early confirmation of potential for accelerated review.</li><li>Early appointment of a rapporteur from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The rapporteur is expected to facilitate continuity in support and knowledge-building during development with a view to producing and submitting a marketing authorization application for the product.</li><li>A kick-off meeting with a multidisciplinary group of experts from the relevant EMA scientific committees and working parties.</li><li>Scientific advice at key development milestones, with the potential involvement of multiple stakeholders including health technology assessment (HTA) and patient bodies where relevant. This aspect of the plan will be welcome to industry, which is keen to see the HTA/payer perspective brought firmly into the PRIME process.</li></ul><h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2><p>The eligibility criteria for PRIME are the same as those for the accelerated assessment procedure: preliminary evidence of the potential to bring significant benefits to patients with unmet medical needs and therefore of major interest in terms of public health and therapeutic innovation &ndash; for example by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. </p><p>However, PRIME will allow prospective candidates for accelerated review to be identified at an earlier stage than at present. A spokesperson for the agency said that companies would be encouraged to request access to PRIME at the stage of exploratory studies, before confirmatory studies began. </p><p>Applications for accelerated review are generally made some two to three months before the marketing authorisation application (MAA) is filed, a timeframe that is included in the current draft revision of the guideline on the accelerated assessment procedure.</p><p>The level of evidence available at the time of eligibility to PRIME will therefore not be the same as for a standard application for an accelerated assessment, the spokesperson said. However, the data "should already be indicative, promising and convincing as to fulfilling an unmet medical need to merit PRIME support." </p><p>"We would expect applicants to choose to take the PRIME route wherever they have data from exploratory clinical data supporting these criteria," the spokesperson continued. "The applicant would then submit a request for PRIME eligibility." If these data were not available prior to confirmatory studies, the company would still have the option to apply for accelerated assessment before the MAA was filed.</p><h2>Even Earlier For SMEs?</h2><p>The scheme may also be opened up to SMEs and applicants from the academic sector at an even earlier stage because "progressing to proof of concept stage is often a difficult step for these smaller actors with limited regulatory and medicine development experience," according to the agency. Eligibility is therefore being considered at the earlier proof of principle stage (prior to exploratory clinical studies), "provided compelling data can be presented to justify a products potential public health impact."</p><p>The EMA's scientific advice working party (SAWP) will review all eligibility requests and forward its recommendation to the CHMP for adoption, and in the case of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) the Committee for Advanced Therapies will also be involved. As the data submitted will vary depending on the product, stage of development and therapeutic area, each request will be considered on a case-by-case basis. An oversight group will be established to monitor output, ensure consistency and update guidance to reflect the experience gained, the EMA says.</p><h2>Development Support</h2><p>The support companies get from PRIME will depend on their needs at various stages of development, and will be offered right up to the marketing authorization application (MAA) submission. Early-stage support for SMEs and academic applicants will include scientific advice (with fee reductions) and the potential to involve other stakeholders &ndash; HTA and patient bodies, for example. </p><p>In the clinical stages of development, after proof of concept has been shown, the CHMP/CAT rapporteur will be appointed and the initial kick-off meeting will take place, with multidisciplinary participation from the EU network to understand the proposed development program, give preliminary guidance on requirements for the MAA, and to prepare a schedule for giving regulatory and scientific advice, including on "key decision points."</p><p>The early appointment of the rapporteur will enable continuity in a life-cycle approach and support the development of important innovative medicines based on relevant expertise in the therapeutic area and/or product type (e.g., ATMPs), the reflection paper states. </p><p>"The rapporteur will support the development by directing applicants towards the EMA scientific advice on data requirements for the future MAA as well as raising awareness on the use of early access tools where relevant (e.g., conditional marketing authorisation) or other initiatives (e.g., parallel EMA/HTA advice, adaptive pathways)." Two co-ordinators from the SAWP will be appointed to each procedure, as is current practice.</p><p>"Such early dialogue between the applicant and the EU regulatory network, through the CHMP scientific advice, will ensure generation of a robust data package designed to address MAA requirements and support a thorough benefit/risk evaluation of the new medicine," the agency adds.</p><p>If at any point during the drug's development it is no longer deemed to meet the eligibility criteria, the SAWP/CHMP will re-assess the situation and notify the applicant of its conclusions. "PRIME support may be withdrawn if emerging data were to show that the criteria are no longer met," the EMA says. "Furthermore, the agency should be informed when the applicant no longer intends to pursue the development of an eligible PRIME medicine."</p>
