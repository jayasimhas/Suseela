<p>Cipla has elevated Samina Vaziralli, part of the firm's founding family, to its board, amid a series of top level exits that have rocked the company over the recent past.</p><p>The firm also announced the carving out of its consumer healthcare business into a wholly owned arm.</p><p>Ms Vaziralli is the daughter of Cipla's vice chair M K Hamied, who is the brother of chairman Dr Yusuf Hamied, and she has been with the company since 2011. </p><p>She takes charge as executive director on Cipla's board effective 10 July. </p><p>A graduate of the London School of Economics and Political Science with an MSc in international accounting and finance, Ms Vaziralli was previously with the investment management division of Goldman Sachs. </p><p>She has been responsible for incubating and shaping Cipla's consumer healthcare business as part of Cipla New Ventures and had also recently taken on an expanded role leading global strategic alliances and enabling Cipla's people strategy and leadership development, a company statement said.</p><p>Ms Vaziralli's elevation comes close on the heels of a series of high profile personnel exits from the company. <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ciplas-scion-leaves-company-for-new-horizons-357733" target="_new">Kamil Hamied</a>, son of MK Hamied and Ms Vaziralli's brother, previously exited - a move that was apparently timed to allow the young scion to "deepen and widen his horizon." Cipla's country head (India) <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-India-head-Sameer-Goel-quits-357683" target="_new">Sameer Goel</a>, also quit, while more recently <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CFO-quits-to-turn-entrepreneur-firm-cites-bench-strength-358698" target="_new">CFO, Rajesh Garg</a>, moved on. </p><p>Ms Vaziralli's promotion is also expected to potentially calm some market anxiety over the spate of exits and how the Hamied family expects to steer things forward. </p><p>Adil Zainulbhai, a former chairman of McKinsey India and an independent director of Cipla, was quoted in the company statement as saying that Ms Vaziralli would "reinforce the commitment and continuity" of the Hamied family's involvement in Cipla. </p><h2>Consumer healthcare </h2><p>Meanwhile, Cipla's board has also cleared the "divestment" of its consumer healthcare business to a wholly owned subsidiary that is proposed to be incorporated. </p><p>Cipla said that the move gives scope to develop the division as a strong, customer focused business with "operational independence" and the ability to attract and develop expertise which is more "fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)-oriented."</p><p>The business, which will focus on opportunities arising from the shift towards wellness and self-care, recently launched its first product Nicotex, a gum which helps smokers quit the habit. </p><p>Cipla's global CEO Subhanu Saxena maintained in a 2013 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CEO-sets-sights-on-regional-presence-global-thrust-345709" target="_new">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i> that Cipla could be in pharma what giant Hindustan Unilever is to the FMCG industry. Every person in India should be within 500 meters of a Cipla product that is available at a price that's affordable to them, he then said. </p>
