<p> Pharmaceutical firms that pose minimal quality compliance risks could potentially attract a reduced frequency of inspections by the FDA under the agency's proposed new &quot;carrot and stick&quot; approach to facility audits. </p> <p> Dr Howard Sklamberg, FDA's Deputy Commissioner for global regulatory operations and policy, said that the agency was developing new tools to better assess the risk levels of firms and to target its resources to facilities around the world that pose the greatest risk to patients and consumers. </p> <p> Firms that that pose a greater risk could be inspected more often while those with a particularly high risk will attract enforcement action. </p> <p> &quot;But the flip side of that is that when we are able to assess through a firm's track record, through a series of metrics, that the firm poses less of a risk, then naturally that would be a situation where we would not need to use as many of our inspection/other resources. We are still developing that approach,&quot; Dr Sklamberg said at a media interaction in Mumbai on 26 March. </p> <p> Elaborating on the proposed carrot and stick inspection approach, Dr Sklamberg told <i>Scrip</i> that as the agency develops quality metrics, firms that are able to achieve and maintain levels of quality that are above the &quot;mere level of compliance that the law requires&quot;, will be able to say so to their customers. </p> <p> &quot;It's not just hitting the floor of what the law requires but [saying] I've achieved a higher level of quality and I'm a more reliable firm. The product that I'm selling is going to consistently do what it's supposed to do. It is less of a risk for you to purchase from me. That firm, with that message, would be able to attract more customers. We want firms to be able to compete on quality and we want to be able to develop a set of tools that are going to foster a marketplace of competition in quality in drugs,&quot; Dr Sklamberg explained. </p> <p> In a recent blog focused on the India visit, the FDA official noted how the new approach to facility inspections will not only note problems, but also allow inspectors to document where a firm's quality management system exceeds what would be required to meet regulatory compliance. </p> <p> &quot;These findings could be used to influence the frequency of our inspection of a particular facility, and possibly even support regulatory flexibility around post-approval manufacturing changes. These kinds of decisions would be anchored by data that proves that the risks of manufacturing problems in a certain facility are minimal,&quot; Dr Sklamberg and Cynthia Schnedar, Director of the Office of Compliance at FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in the blog dated 24 March. </p> <p> But Dr Sklamberg also underscored that enforcement &quot;is and will be&quot; an important tool to maintain a system of drug quality in the US. </p> <p> &quot;Enforcement is a particularly appropriate tool when we receive data from a firm that is faulty. In those situations when FDA is unable to rely on data, the FDA is really unable to do its job of accurately assessing a firm,&quot; he added. </p> <p> He maintained that the FDA would always &quot;respond aggressively&quot; when it loses confidence in the reliability of data that a firm is producing, but observed that data integrity issues were &quot;universal&quot;. A clutch of Indian firms including Ipca and Wockhardt have, over the recent past, been under a cloud over data integrity concerns, though the FDA made no specific comment on any company. </p> <h2> Top management support </h2> <p> On the importance of senior management support on quality issues, Dr Sklamberg told <i>Scrip</i> that quality was not just a &quot;check list&quot; and entailed building and maintaining a culture from &quot;shop floor to boardroom&quot;. </p> <p> Firms that have a commitment to quality at the top level, he said, have strong quality systems, incentivize workers to report problems when they arise, reward workers for reporting problems and follow through on problems that arise. They also incentivize systems that prevent problems before they occur. </p> <p> Such firms would end up posing low risk to patients and consumers, he stated. </p> <p> &quot;So from folks on the shop floor to folks in boardrooms there has to be a commitment to quality and that has to be so much a part of the culture that it's almost second nature.&quot; </p> <p> An FDA workshop in Hyderabad last year heard Dr Sklamberg underscore how visible management support for quality could help put organizations on a trajectory of sustainable quality assurance and business predictability. </p> <h2> No India agenda </h2> <p> The FDA also reiterated that it had &quot;no India agenda&quot; for food, drugs, enforcement or for approving or not approving drug applications to US. </p> <p> &quot;The agenda in FDA is pharmaceutical quality and food safety. The agenda in FDA is not country by country. For us what's important is that American consumers/patients have confidence in the food supply and have safe food supply and have confidence in the drugs supplied and their quality is what they expect and deserve,&quot; Dr Sklamberg said. </p> <p> Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg had earlier underscored that FDA's increased presence in India did not mean US regulators were scrutinizing drug makers in the country any more than the agency does elsewhere <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-We-are-not-targeting-Indian-companies-350191%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 21 February 2014)</a>. </p> <p> Dr Sklamberg, who was accompanied by colleague Michael Taylor, Deputy Commissioner of Food and Veterinary Medicines at the FDA, also noted how their India visit had been very successful in &quot;deepening&quot; the agency's collaborative relationships with the Indian government and industry. </p> <p> Last year during Commissioner Hamburg's India visit, the FDA and India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had signed a statement of intent on co-operation in medical products, though much of it appeared focused on information sharing (<a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDAs-Hamburg-in-India-tensions-from-Day-1-349967%5d" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 11 February 2014</a>). Efforts towards joint inspections, collaboration with respect to training were some of the other areas highlighted by the visiting FDA officials. </p>
