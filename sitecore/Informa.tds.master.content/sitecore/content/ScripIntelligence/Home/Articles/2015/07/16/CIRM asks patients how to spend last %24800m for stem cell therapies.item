<p>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is asking patient advocates how the agency should spend the last $800m of the $3bn that the state raised through bond sales to fund stem cell research, and the answer at a recent hearing in San Diego wasn't surprising: "Spend it on me."</p><p>Of course patients with few good treatment options and few new drugs in the development pipeline are eager for research funding into alternative therapies with the potential to greatly improve or cure their disease. But how does an agency charged with funding research in a broad field like stem cell therapies decide which diseases its public funds should back? Should it be based on the number of people with the disease, the severity of the illness or the lack of treatments? And who really wants to be in the position of making those decisions?</p><p>CIRM president and CEO Randal Mills, who previously was CEO of stem cell drug developer Osiris Therapeutics, spent his first year at the agency crafting CIRM 2.0 &ndash; a plan to make the agency work more efficiently, i.e. fund research faster to accelerate the delivery of stem cell therapies to patients. </p><p>"It's a patient-centric mission. That was the deal for me to come [to CIRM]," Mills told a gathering of patient advocates at the hearing in San Diego on 13 July. </p><p>Since the agency implemented CIRM 2.0, the time it takes to review and approve or deny a grant or loan application has dropped from about 22 months to 100 days. Also, there are more frequent opportunities to submit funding applications to the agency with an emphasis on clinical research programs testing stem cell therapies in patients. Most CIRM funding to date has gone to academic research programs, but the agency wants to back more therapies in development at biotechnology companies.</p><p>If CIRM's backing can increase a stem cell therapy's chance of success in a disease with an unmet need, the agency may approve the researchers' or company's application for funding.</p><p>"We will spend a lot of money if we think it will accelerate treatment to patients," Mr Mills said.</p><p>He and the agency are working on a strategic plan for CIRM, which is why Mr Mills hosted hearings to solicit input from patient advocates in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco on 13, 14 and 15 July.</p><p>Several people with Parkinson's disease attended a 13 July hearing at the Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine in San Diego to tell Mr Mills that the agency should increase its support for research related to Parkinson's &ndash; a disease that's received about 2.3% of grants and loans issued to date. </p><p>But while Parkinson's is a degenerative disease that affects millions of people, even if the efficacy and side effects of current therapies may not be ideal, there are treatments available to improve symptoms. Meanwhile, there are thousands of rare diseases with no available therapies, many of which are fatal.</p><p>"I'm going to do everything I can to get treatment to anyone with an unmet need," Mr Mills said.</p><p>However, he noted, the grants and loans that CIRM has awarded to date reflect the number and quality of funding applications received by the agency. If researchers submit few requests for Parkinson's disease projects or if the quality of stem cell programs for Parkinson's is not satisfactory then few grants and loans will be issued for prospective treatments for the disease. </p><p>CIRM has $800m that has not been committed to research funding and it may have up to $1bn after scientists and companies return unused money associated with stem cell research that does not turn out as hypothesized. The agency's new strategic plan will be the basis for CIRM's funding and advocacy decisions going forward.</p><p>Mr Mills said CIRM should be a "pushing" agency that pushes stem cell research into clinical trials by funding human studies. He said the agency also should pull biopharma companies with little to no interest in stem cell therapies into the regenerative medicine field. In between, he noted, is a mountain known as the US FDA, which still hasn't figured out how to regulate stem cell therapies. CIRM wants to be an advocate for stem cell therapy developers at the FDA.</p><p>"We need to push better, pull better and level the hill this thing is going over," Mr Mills said.</p><p>Among the companies that have received CIRM support so far are: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Sparks-raises-72.8m-ArrayBiogen-OncothyreonCelldex-collaborate-CIRM-grants-BioCryst-offering-352084" target="_new">Asterias Biotherapeutics</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CIRM-grants-42m-to-Sangamo-and-stem-cell-researchers-343525" target="_new">Sangamo BioSciences</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cellular-Dynamics-to-open-California-stem-cell-bank-with-16m-grant-341666" target="_new">Cellular Dynamics</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/ViaCytes-potential-diabetes-cure-gets-another-6m-to-move-into-human-trials-339988" target="_new">ViaCyte</a>, and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Only-ViaCyte-and-Bluebird-deemed-worthy-first-recipients-of-CIRM-stem-cell-grants-336580" target="_new">Bluebird Bio</a>.
