<p>With 4th of July vacations over, the trade groups representing the biopharmaceutical industry are gearing up for their next big fight in Washington &ndash; changing the path of a patent reform bill, <i>The Innovation Act </i>(HR 9), which is expected to be voted on this month by the US House.</p><p>Even after lawmakers last month amended the proposed legislation in an attempt to appease the biopharmaceutical industry, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) said they still were opposed to HR 9, which passed the House Judiciary Committee on 11 June in a 24-8 vote. </p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee passed a companion version of the bill, known as <i>The Patent Act</i> (S 1137), on 4 June in a 16-4 vote, albeit with some differences from the House legislation.</p><p>It's unclear how soon the full Senate will consider its measure, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BIO-More-work-needed-on-patent-bill-to-ensure-balance-358777" target="_new">PhRMA and BIO also are objecting</a> to in its current form.</p><p>But in a 2 July memo, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Republican-California) said HR 9 was among the dozen or so bills his chamber would take up this month before Capitol Hill takes its August recess &ndash; a list that also includes the <i>21st Century Cures Act </i>(<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">HR 6</a>).</p><p>PhRMA and BIO have raised concerns about unintended consequences that emerged from Congress' 2011 attempt to fix the US patent system &ndash; the <i>America Invents Act</i> (AIA), which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-backs-NCATS-reveals-plans-to-move-ideas-from-lab-to----market-321330" target="_new">moved the nation</a> from a first-to-invent standard to a first-inventor-to-file system.</p><p>Under the AIA, lawmakers created the <i>inter partes</i> review (IPR) process, which was intended to be a faster and more affordable way to challenge patents than going through the US court system &ndash; a process that can take from one to three years.</p><p>IPR proceedings are conducted by the US Patent & Trademark Office (US PTO) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB).</p><p>The US PTO has acknowledged the IPR filings have been much more popular than the agency ever anticipated &ndash; with many entities using the process beyond generics seeking to challenge brand-name firms. </p><p>Indeed, Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum noted that even Amgen used the IPR petition process last month in its pursuit of a biosimilar of AbbVie's blockbuster biologic Humira (adalimumab).</p><p>Amgen is hoping to launch its biosimilar of Humira in 2017, if all goes well.</p><p>In its IPR petition, the Thousand Oaks, California-based biotech giant argued AbbVie's '157 patent is obvious in light of earlier patents that claim antibody formulations identical to those claimed in the company's new formulation, and that it would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art to use adalimumab in the formulations claimed by the prior art, Dr Schoenebaum said.</p><p>As of 25 June, the PTAB had received 3,145 IPR petitions.</p><p>But PhRMA and BIO have insisted the IPRs are being used in abusive ways for which they were never intended. Specifically, they asserted financial investors and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Broken-patent-office-proceedings-killing-innovation-358248" target="_new">hedge fund managers</a> are shorting biopharmaceutical company stocks and then using the PTAB process to challenge those drug companies' patents for the sole purpose of profiting off of the resulting change in price.</p><p>The biopharma groups have pointed to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-reform-its-all-about-the-trolls-no-Bass-358182" target="_new">Kyle Bass</a>, chief investment officer at the hedge fund firm Hayman Capital Management &ndash; who has filed several IPRs targeting drugs from companies, including Acorda, Biogen, Celgene and Shire &ndash; as the poster boy for such abuses. </p><p>Mr Bass actually has filed his petitions through an organization he created, known as the Coalition for Affordable Drugs.</p><p>In an 14 April letter to Representatives Bob Goodlatte (Republican-Virginia), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and John Conyers (Democrat-Michigan), the ranking member, Mr Bass said he intended to challenge less than 1% of the existing "branded drug universe" to "police the abusive patent tactics used by the worst offending drug companies" and said that unlike many historical challenges by generic firms in the federal courts and the PTAB, "Hayman will not accept settlement payments in order to drop our challenges." </p><p>"We are filing merit-based IPRs at the US PTO with the full expectation of seeing the challenge through to a final decision by the PTAB," he told the lawmakers.</p><p>Mr Bass insisted generic companies "are not effective or reliable policemen of the patent abuses that certain branded manufacturers engage in, which cause harm to the economy, society and citizens afflicted with disease."</p><p>But Representative Goodlatte appeared to take drug makers' side and included an amendment in June to the House bill, which the lawmaker said would ensure the rules governing the IPR proceedings would be "fair and afford due process" and would stop any abuse "dead in its tracks."</p><p>"We addressed the most significant concerns raised by the biopharma industries pertaining to use of the IPR proceeding to engage in market manipulation, as well as addressing the potential for abuse by parties engaging in extortion of patent owners by seeking pay-offs to not file IPR cases," Mr Goodlatte argued.</p><p>Representative Mimi Walters (Republican-California) offered up, but then withdrew, and amendment she said would "restore the congressionally mandated patent dispute-resolution procedures," by excluding biopharmaceutical patents covering approved drug and biologics from IPR proceedings. </p><p>"This amendment merely recognizes and reestablishes Congress' goal of fostering a balanced governance system that properly reflects the unique circumstances of the biopharmaceutical industry," Ms Walters said.</p><p>There were a few other attempts to fix the IPR process through amendments to the House bill before it left the Judiciary Committee, although the measures also either were withdrawn or failed.</p><p>PhRMA and BIO said Mr Goodlatte's amendment alone didn't go far enough and argued in a joint statement with several other groups that HR 9 "needs significant work and should not be considered for floor action in the House of Representatives in its current form." </p><p>But the US PTO's PTAB may also take matters into its own hands. </p><p>Last month, it told Celgene it could file sanction motions to dismiss four IPR petitions filed by Mr Bass through his Coalition for Affordable Drugs after the drug maker argued the IPR process was not intended for IPR process was not intended to be used to affect the value of public companies." </p><p>The PTAB emphasized that its grant of authorization to file the motion for sanctions was "not a decision on the merits of patent owner's allegation of abuse of process."</p><p>The PTAB said Celgene must specifically address in its brief the elements required to establish an abuse of process; any evidence of intent that supports or undercuts the allegation of abuse of process in these cases; and the standard of proof that applies when deciding a motion for sanctions. </p><p>For companies concerned the PTAB itself may be going too far in invalidating patents, legal experts said the firms should take some comfort in a 16 June ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which for the first time ever reversed an IPR decision &ndash; showing the PTAB does not always have the final word and its determinations can be held up to scrutiny on appeal.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">NIH, pharma losers in latest 'Cures' maneuvering</a></p><p>Two changes made to legislation aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise would trim the $10bn in added funding over five years lawmakers had promised to the National Institutes of Health &ndash;

Indeed, a survey conducted by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health found that 90% of responders said the best incentive they could get for participating in the million-person cohort study under President Barack Obama's precision medicine initiative would be knowledge about their own health, versus 55% who said they'd prefer an activity tracker. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Doomsday-AMR-scenarios-lurk-Whats-FDA-others-doing-359202" target="_new">Doomsday AMR scenarios lurk: What's FDA, others doing?</a></p><p>With antimicrobial-resistance doomsday scenarios coming fast and furious in recent months &ndash; with one even projecting as many as 10 million people worldwide could be sickened by "superbug" infections by 2050 &ndash; one wonders why with all the dire warnings the problem has not yet been solved and why it's been such a tough nut to crack. The most recent warning comes from the nonprofit Consumer Reports, which has called on doctors, patients, hospitals, drug makers and government officials to work together to prevent the overuse of antibiotics.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Purdue-OxyContin-needs-more-analyses-before-FDA-panel-review-359201" target="_new">Purdue: OxyContin needs more analyses before FDA panel review</a></p><p>With Purdue Pharma withdrawing its US supplemental new drug application that was intended to update information in the labeling of the firm's reformulated version of OxyContin (oxycodone hydrochloride) extended-release tablets, a joint two-day meeting of the FDA' Drug Safety and Risk Management and Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committees will not go forward 7-8 July.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-fates-converge-for-BioMarins-drisapersen-Sareptas-eteplirsen-359173" target="_new">FDA fates converge for BioMarin's drisapersen, Sarepta's eteplirsen</a></p><p>It was always likely the fates of BioMarin Pharmaceutical's and Sarepta Therapeutics' experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy drugs were going to be bumping up against each other &ndash; although the former firm's product is a ahead of the latter in the regulatory process.
