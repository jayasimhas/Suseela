<p><i>The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (CAT) evaluates the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs. Since February 2014, the CAT has been chaired by senior Finnish regulator </i><b><i>Paula Salmikangas</i></b><i>. Here, Dr Salmikangas talks to </i><b><i>Francesca Bruce</i></b><i> about the pitfalls of rushing a product from bench to patient, the value to companies of talking to regulators &ndash; and her passion for berry-picking and the Phantom of the Opera</i>.</p><p><b>You are chair of the EMA's Committee for Advanced Therapies. How did you get there? What's your magic?</b></p><p>There is no magic, just a long-standing work history. I started working with advanced therapy regulatory issues in 2003 and I helped set up the EMA's Cell Products Working Party (CPWP) in 2005. I became chair of the CPWP and later member and vice-chair of the CAT when it was established. Maybe good relationships with CAT members also helped so they'd elect me.</p><p><b>Why did you choose a career as a regulator?</b></p><p>I did quite a few years in research and after that I worked for a small biotech company, GeneOS, where I really got interested in biological medicinal products and drug development overall. When a position in the Finnish Medicines Agency came up, I realised that I could use my expertise there. Also the international working environment was really tempting.</p><p><b>What did you learn from your time at GeneOS? </b></p><p>It was my first time working in translational medicine. I learned a lot about drug development and regulatory requirements. I also saw the difficulties that industry faces, how much work you have to do to get very simple results, and I also saw the poor funding options that industry has to fight for. It was really eye opening. </p><p><b>What are your long-term aspirations for your career?</b></p><p>I don&rsquo;t have any! I'm concentrating on my work at the CAT and looking forward to the remaining two years of my term and trying to figure out how to support the committee in its work, and drug developers.</p><p><b>Are there any misconceptions industry has about regulators that you'd like to set straight? </b></p><p>No, but I'd like to raise awareness of the experts we have in the regulatory community and how much industry could benefit from them, especially in early development. They could get a lot of support to avoid the pitfalls that we know about but that they may not know about. I would like industry to know they can approach regulators.</p><p><b>Is there anything that frustrates you about industry?</b></p><p>No. If I have to say something maybe it's the rush from ideas to clinical practice, sometimes this could be a little bit slower. It seems that especially in the cell-based area, the good ideas are quickly translated to clinical studies and sometimes the developers forget about product development and what comes with that. For example, in the first clinical studies for cardiac repair using cell-based therapies, all kinds of cell populations were used, but now if you read the most recent literature it seems that there are also harmful cells in these cell populations. Maybe it would be good to look into those before you start any clinical studies otherwise you have to go backwards and start from scratch.</p><p><b>What has been the CAT's biggest achievement since you took over as chair?</b></p><p>Well, the first stem cell therapy [Chiesi's Holoclar] won a positive opinion. We have also been through a very difficult revision of our classification guideline. Overall, I am very happy that the committee is getting more and more active and that it is very committed to its work. I am really pleased about that.</p><p><b>What is the most frustrating aspect of your role?</b></p><p>The constant lack of time and too many things to do. There are lots of meetings to go to and it's difficult to cope with all those tasks that come with this position!</p><p><b>Is there anyone in industry or the regulatory world you admire?</b></p><p>I can't name anyone in particular, but I admire people working in the industry to get new therapies and novel innovative medicinal products to patients. I know what hard work it is and I don't envy them a bit. I also admire the regulators who have the time and passion to do research in their own time in addition to their daily work. </p><p><b>What was your first ever job?</b></p><p>I planted flowers in a flower garden for commercial purposes. I was 13 and I enjoyed it very much.</p><p><b>What shaped you when you were growing up?</b></p><p>Most probably my three younger brothers, and also my interest in science and reading. I have always been very fond of reading books and scientific literature.</p><p><b>Who was your biggest influence?</b></p><p>It must have been my grandmother. She was a very wise, kind and loving person and supported us children in many ways.</p><p><b>What is the best advice you've ever had?</b></p><p>"One can choose to have friends or to be right every time in every aspect." I think I read it somewhere during some management course.</p><p><b>How do you step back and get perspective?</b></p><p>I try to listen carefully and collect different view-points. I try to see the bigger picture and to understand the reason behind divergent positions. It really helps to know the reasons behind big divergences in discussions.</p><p><b>How do you relax?</b></p><p>I walk and read good books and I do all kinds of handicrafts. I must admit I am very fond of gardening and I do all kinds of construction and renovation work on our summer cottage. </p><p><b>Can you tell me anything surprising about yourself?</b></p><p>What should I say? I'm a passionate berry and mushroom picker. In Finland we have a lot of wild berries and mushrooms in the forests and I simply cannot get enough. I cannot resist them.</p><p><b>What gets you out of bed in the morning?</b></p><p>All the possibilities and opportunities we face every day, and the joy of life.</p><p><b>If you weren't chair of the CAT, what would you be?</b></p><p>CAT member! I can't imagine myself anywhere else at the moment, or I should have made a different choice ten years ago.</p><p><b>What has your proudest moment been?</b></p><p>There are lots with my children and their graduations. But I feel very proud of my PhD work because we managed to solve one of the genetic problems of one type of inherited muscular dystrophy and we were able to create an analytical tool for the standard muscular dystrophy diagnostics that are used in pathology labs today. So it had real concrete consequences for the field. It was a really nice conclusion to my work.</p><p><b>What has been your most difficult moment?</b></p><p>I think the most difficult thing is separation from your loved ones, especially if they are passing away, those are difficult moments.</p><p><b>What was your favourite subject at school?</b></p><p>Biology, surprise!</p><p><b>What are you reading now?</b></p><p>I've just finished a book called Crossing of Four Roads by the young Finnish writer, Tommi Kinnunen.</p><p><b>What are your favourite books?</b></p><p>I cannot name any as there are so many of them! I love good detective novels but I also read historical stories, poems and a lot of stories by young writers.</p><p><b>What is your favourite piece of music?</b></p><p>I can't name that either, sorry! But I like all kinds of music from classical, like Sibelius and Bach, but I also like Queen and music from the 80s. I adore Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, especially Phantom of the Opera. I have seen it at least five times in London.</p><p><b>If you could meet anyone dead or alive, who would it be?</b></p><p>Nelson Mandela or the Dalai Lama. Both suffered a lot and were still able to cope in difficult situations. They have changed the world permanently.</p><p><b><i>Paula Salmikangas</i></b><i> is a senior researcher at the Finnish Medicines Agency (Fimea). She was CAT vice-chair for more than five years before becoming chair, and is also a former chair of the EMA's Cell Products Working Party. </i></p><p><b><i>Francesca Bruce</i></b><i> is a senior reporter on Scrip Intelligence.</i></p>
