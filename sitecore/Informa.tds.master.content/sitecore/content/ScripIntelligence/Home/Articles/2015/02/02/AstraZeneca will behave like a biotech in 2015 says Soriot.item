<p>An "eventful, remarkable year," said Pascal Soriot of 2014, as he presented AstraZeneca's fourth quarter and full year results and announced details of a $600m acquisition of Actavis's North American branded respiratory business (scripintelligence.com, 5 February 2015). </p><p>But AstraZeneca's shares slipped in morning trading with analysts disappointed by a 28% drop in core EPS for the quarter to $0.76. However, Mr Soriot said there should have been "no surprises" for anyone who had been paying attention. "This is exactly in-line with our updated guidance. This is where we said we would be at the end of the third quarter."</p><p>Full year revenue climbed 3% (at CER) to $26.1bn, while fourth quarter revenue was up 2% to $6.7bn. Core EPS fell by 8% for the full year to $4.28.</p><h2>China in the ascendance </h2><p>2014 was a great year for AstraZeneca's emerging markets business, particularly in China, where revenues were up by 22% to $2.2bn, making it AstraZeneca's second largest market behind the US, noted Mr Soriot. "We're also the second largest multinational in China," he added. Emerging markets in general contributed revenues of $5.8bn in 2014, up by 12%.</p><p>"People ask if we have benefited from GSK's misfortunes in China," Mr Soriot told <i>Scrip</i>. "I say no. We don't benefit from a weak GSK. More helpful is a strong GSK educating people about respiratory disease so that we can all sell more medicines and everyone's business is strengthened."</p><p>AstraZeneca has about 5,000 sales reps in China, and expects this number to increase in the coming months and years, Mr Soriot revealed.</p><h2>behaving like a biotech</h2><p>With sales revenue expected to decline by mid-single-digit percent (at CER), Mr Soriot intends to keep his R&D spend down in 2015 by "behaving like a biotech," he said. "You will see us do what biotech companies do." AstraZeneca will look for out-licensing and partnership opportunities for some of its promising but non-core early stage programs. "We have been very productive, but we don't have the resources to pursue everything ourselves." Core EPS in 2015 is expected to increase by low single-digit percent.</p><p>Mr Soriot said AstraZeneca was still in a transition phase, and growth should not be expected in 2015 and 2016. However, by 2017 things would start to look very different. "If you are an investor in AstraZeneca today it is because you believe in our future. And you don't have to wait all the way into 2023 [where Mr Soriot is eyeing $45bn revenues]. We have a goalpost in 2017."</p><p><b>Immuno-oncology</b></p><p>While acknowledging that AstraZeneca was not a leader in the hot area of immuno-oncology when talking into account trials of promising compounds as monotherapies, "our strategy is sound," he assured everyone. Mr Soriot believes that future success will likely come from combinations of products, "and here you could say we are at the front." Another "dimension" will come from combining immuno-oncology products with small molecules, "and again, we are working on this."</p>
