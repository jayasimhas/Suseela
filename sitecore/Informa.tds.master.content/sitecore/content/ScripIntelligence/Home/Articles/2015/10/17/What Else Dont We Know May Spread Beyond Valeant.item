<p>The day after a damning report from short-selling firm Citron Research sent shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. into tailspin, diving 40%, the stock spiraled down again, plunging 20% &ndash; this time pushed off the cliff by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. analyst Alex Arfaei, who started off the day by asking "What else is out there that we don't know?"</p><p>That's a question US federal investigators and lawmakers also may soon be, if not already, asking &ndash; not just of Valeant, but perhaps the entire specialty pharma sector, which already is being scrutinized for certain firms' pricing practices.</p><p>And the probes could look deeper &ndash; pulling in the full biopharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Now, the issue focuses on relationships with specialty pharmacies, which was the center of the Citron report.</p><p>Evercore ISI analysts did a quick survey of biopharmaceutical firms to see who among them had either ownership of or exclusive affiliations with specialty pharmacies.</p><p>Amgen Inc., Biogen Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Celgene Corp., Gilead Sciences Inc., Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. all said "no." </p><p>BMO's Arfaei said that while he and his analyst colleagues had been "strong, vocal Valeant bulls" &ndash; pointing out they've "respected" the drug company's management for adopting a "bold strategy" that many others have since followed &ndash; they now think the pharmaceutical firm's structure, while not illegal, is "aggressive and questionable."</p><p>In fact, he said they could no longer defend the specialty pharmacy structure itself.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) also climbed onto the anti-Valeant bandwagon &ndash; calling the drug firm's strategy more like a "hedge fund than an innovative biopharmaceutical company." </p><p>In an Oct. 22 blog, Robert Zirkelbach, senior vice president of communications at PhRMA, noted that, on average, the organization's members invest 20% of their total revenue in research and development, while Valeant only invests less than 3%.</p><p>Valeant already has been on the hot seat for its pricing practices, with investigations ongoing on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">Capitol Hill</a> and by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">prosecutors</a> in Massachusetts and New York.</p><p><b>Valeant's Specialty Pharmacy Troubles</b></p><p>The latest troubles for Valeant started when the company disclosed it had been having an ongoing relationship with Pennsylvania-based specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx Services &ndash; something the firm had not previously divulged to its investors</p><p>The revelation came during Valeant's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">Oct. 19 quarterly earnings call</a>, when the company disclosed not only that it had a "contractual relationship" with Philidor, but the drug company had even purchased an option late last year to acquire the specialty pharmacy.</p><p>Valeant also disclosed it's currently in a legal dispute with another specialty pharmacy, R&O Pharmacy, which is part of the pharmaceutical firm's network.</p><p>The R&O litigation and the fact there was some sort of relationship ongoing between Valeant and Philidor had actually been reported hours before the Oct. 19 call by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, which said it does investigative reporting.</p><p>Citron picked it up from there &ndash; asserting on Oct. 21 it had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">uncovered "fraud"</a> by Valeant and the two specialty pharmacies, alleging they had conspired to create "phantom accounts" under a scheme aimed at deceiving auditors and to book revenue.</p><p>Citron suggested Valeant could be the pharmaceutical version of Enron Corp. &ndash; the scandal-ridden company that became emblematic of corporate fraud and corruption and was what triggered the financial reforms under the <i>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</i>.</p><p>But BMO's Arfaei said his analysis of Valeant's cash flows "does not support Citron's Enron-like thesis." In fact, he said, "it supports the opposite conclusion." </p><p>While Arfaei said "proof of a questionable business practice is not proof of financial wrongdoing," he also said he could not refute Citron's allegations. </p><p>"So we're left with their well-timed allegations, Valeant's 'categorical' denials and audited financial statements that support, but not necessarily prove Valeant's position," he said in a research note.</p><p>Therefore, Arfaei said, "there is residual uncertainty that may not be fully resolved unless there is an investigation proof of a questionable business practice is not proof of financial wrongdoing."</p><p>Unfortunately, he said, the downside risk in Valeant's stock won't be limited to the 10% or so of the firm's US business coming from specialty pharmacies. </p><p>"We believe that the questionable nature of this specific business practice casts uncertainty over the rest of the business," Arfaei said.</p><p>"Overall, while we do not have all the pieces to this puzzle yet, we find Valeant's apparent control over Philidor, and Philidor's alleged activities with other pharmacies, such as R&O as aggressive, unusual, and questionable."</p><p><b>Transparency Demanded</b></p><p>Edison Investment Research analyst Maxim Jacobs noted that Canadian financial regulators already are expressing concern about the allegations against Valeant &ndash; declaring they are "watching very seriously."</p><p>So, Jacobs said, "it is of the upmost importance" for Valeant's management to increase the transparency of the company "as soon as possible."</p><p>Other analysts, who've done some digging of their own into invoices, legal filings and other documents to try to figure the situation out, also have called for Valeant to clear up the confusion &ndash; declaring there's still a lot of unanswered questions.</p><p>Valeant issued a statement on Oct. 22 saying it would host a conference call and a live webcast, along with a slide presentation, on Oct. 26 with 10 officials, including CEO Michael Pearson, chief financial officer Robert Rosiello and three members of the firm's audit and risk committee, among others , to "lay out the facts, including allegations made against our company regarding our relationship with Philidor and R&O, our accounting practices and channel stuffing that contain numerous errors, unsupported speculation and incorrect interpretations of facts and circumstances to the detriment of the shareholders of the company."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
