<p><p>Uh oh! Safety concerns could derail a psoriasis blockbuster now that one of the developers thinks the risks are too high and ultimately too limiting for the drug to be a success. </p><p>Amgen has pulled out of the co-development of the interleukin-17 inhibitor brodalumab at the last minute, leaving AstraZeneca to ponder whether it will continue moving forward with the psoriasis drug. </p><p>In a surprise move, the big biotech announced after the close of the market on 22 May that it is not going to participate any longer in the development or commercialization of brodalumab due to issues with suicidal ideation and behavior seen in the program. </p><p>"During our preparation process for regulatory submissions, we came to believe that labeling requirements likely would limit the appropriate patient population for brodalumab," said Dr Sean Harper, executive VP of R&D at Amgen, in a statement. </p><p>Now AstraZreneca is left to consider whether it will continue with regulatory filings for the drug. </p><p>"Data from the three AMAGINE Phase III pivotal studies highlighted that brodalumab has an effective mechanism of action that delivers clinical benefit. We will fully evaluate the data and assess all options before we make our independent decision about the future of this potential medicine," said AstraZeneca's Chief Medical Officer Briggs Morrison.</p><p>Amgen and AstraZeneca were expected to submit the drug for approval by the FDA later this year and analysts had hopes that the drug would be a blockbuster that <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-launching-into-a-strong-2015-358012" target="_new">would contribute</a> to another $10bn in revenues for the big biotech. </p><p>The partners reported <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Amgen-AstraZeneca-plan-2015-brodalumab-filings-on-third-Phase-III-success-355267" target="_new">a third Phase III success</a> for the drug in November; showing that brodalumab was twice as effective as Johnson & Johnson's Stelara (ustekinumab) in clearing plaque psoriasis. The filing for the drug was going to be based on three Phase III trials, including the AMAGINE-2 study comparing the two drugs. In the Phase III trial, the most common adverse events reported were upper respiratory tract infections, joint pain, common cold and headaches. </p><p>Sagient's BioMedTracker had placed the likelihood of approval at 72% at the time the results were announced. Analysts expected peak sales for the drug of $500m to $1.5bn. </p><p>Amgen and AstraZeneca initially <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-strikes-broad-alliance-for-Amgens-clinical-stage-inflammation-portfolio-328866" target="_new">teamed up in April 2012</a> on brodalumab and four other compounds under a joint inflammatory disease R&D program that had the British pharma paying 65% of the costs. Amgen received $50m in upfront payments under the deal and was supposed to be responsible for global product sales.</p><p>Three of the other products included in the collaboration are currently in Phase II and being developed by AstraZeneca's MedImmune for indications like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and asthma. The other compound is currently in Phase I for treatment of autoimmune diseases. </p><p><p>
