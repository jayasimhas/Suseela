<p>Allergan, whose blockbuster Restasis (cyclosporine) is the only approved prescription dry eye drug in the US, is buying the device maker Oculeve for $125m to diversify the company's position in the market.</p><p>There are several treatments in the clinic to treat dry eye disease, but candidates that win US FDA approval will enter a market dominated by Restasis, which achieved more than $1bn in annual sales for the first time in 2014. Allergan has multiple disclosed and undisclosed therapies in development, including Restasis X, but the company will go beyond topical treatments with its investment in Oculeve's lead asset OD-01 and an earlier-stage program.</p><p>Allergan will pay undisclosed commercial sales milestone fees on top of the upfront payment for Oculeve. The buyer has an aggressive late-stage development plan for OD-01 and expects to launch the device &ndash; a non-invasive neurostimulation device implanted in the nose to increase tear production &ndash; in 2017. The company will seek FDA approval in 2016 assuming OD-01 succeeds in two planned pivotal trials.</p><p>"Allergan's position and expertise in eye care will maximize the development and potential commercialization of the OD-01 technology," Oculeve president and CEO Michael Ackermann said in a joint statement from the private South San Francisco-based company and Allergan.</p><p>David Nicholson, Allergan executive vice president of global brands research and development, said Oculeve's lead product candidate "is complementary to our existing product offerings in this important treatment area."</p><p>Allergan closed down 0.3% at $306.70 per share on 6 July following the Oculeve deal announcement.</p><p><b>Restasis and beyond</b></p><p>Allergan has faced generic threats to Restasis's dominant position in dry eye disease, but whether there will be a near-term generic competitor remains somewhat uncertain and unlikely. </p><p>Ironically, Actavis was the first generic drug manufacturer to file an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with the FDA to enable manufacturing and sales of generic Restasis eye drops. The ANDA was filed before the regulator issued <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Strike-three-Allergan-slides-on-potential-Restasis-generics-344392" target="_new">draft guidance</a> in 2013 regarding the bioequivalence of Restasis copycats. </p><p>Allergan, prior to its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110" target="_new">acquisition</a> by Actavis (now using the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827" target="_new">Allergan name</a>), filed a citizens petition arguing in favor of its patents. The FDA granted a partial reprieve in November 2014, according to Allergan's pre-acquisition 2014 annual report, but the company already had new method-of-use patents in hand that extended the patent life for Restasis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Allergan-rises-as-Restasis-patents-renew-investor-faith-348965" target="_new">through 2024</a> &ndash; a decade after the treatment's drug formulation patent was set to expire.</p><p>While Restasis generics may not be available for another nine years, several companies &ndash; including Allergan &ndash; have drug candidates in development for dry eye disease. </p><p>The closest competitor to Restasis, an immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase, is the integrin inhibitor lifitegrast for which Shire expects an FDA decision by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Shires-dry-eye-drug-lifitegrast-granted-speedy-review-357751" target="_new">25 October</a>. Shire expects lifitegrast to be a significant contributor to its goal of $10bn in product sales by 2020 and Cowen sees the drug candidate as a blockbuster with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-sees-23-growth-as-it-eyes-10bn-in-sales-by-2020-356734" target="_new">more than $1bn</a> in annual sales.</p><p>Sagient Research gives both lifitegrast and MIM-D3 from Mimetogen Pharmaceuticals a 1% above average likelihood of FDA approval (LOA). </p><p>Sagient's BioMedTracker database lists MIM-D3 as the only Phase III candidate coming through the pipeline behind Restasis and lifitegrast, but Mimetogen lost its partner in 2014 when Bausch & Lomb, a division of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bausch-and-Lomb-option-for-Mimetogen-dry-eye-drug-terminated-353834" target="_new">declined to exercise</a> its option for the drug. Mimetogen has not indicated when it will conduct further testing or seek regulatory approvals.</p><p>BioMedTracker shows only one Phase II/III dry eye drug in development, but there are 17 Phase II programs, including two from Allergan, four from Novartis and one from Valeant. One of the company's two Phase II candidates is Restasis X, a reformulation of the original drug, which was approved in the US in 2003. There are three Phase I assets, including an unnamed program from Allergan, in development.</p><p><b>About Oculeve</b></p><p>Oculeve was founded by Stanford University researchers, including the CEO Mr Ackermann, to develop devices that stimulate tear production for people with dry eye disease. The company raised $700,000 in seed financing between October 2011 and August 2012, according to US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.</p><p>Since then, as noted in later SEC filings, Oculeve raised $7.6m in venture capital between October 2012 and March 2013. Another venture capital funding round in March 2014 generated $16.6m. Investors include VC firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, New Enterprise Associates and Versant Ventures.</p><p>Before any of the undisclosed milestone fees that Oculeve's investors may receive if OD-01 reaches the market, the company has generated a 5X return for its backers in five years based on the $25m raised between 2011 and 2014.</p><p><p><p><p>
