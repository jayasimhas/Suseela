<p>India's fast-emerging pharmaceutical and biosimilar maker Intas Pharmaceuticals expects to fill a significant need with its Indian launch of Razumab, the world's first biosimilar version of ranibizumab, branded Lucentis by Novartis. </p><p><p>Intas is working on a well-thought out strategy for its newly launched Razumab. The plan is to ride lower costs to beat the innovator's drug and also penetrate a market that is widely dependent on the off-label use of Avastin to treat wet age-related macular degeneration.</p><p><p>The VEGF-A-inhibiting antibody fragment is mostly used to treat neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) but is also used in a few other indications. Left untreated, AMD can cause vision loss in older age groups.</p><p><p>Intas's delight in getting into the market first with copies of the sophisticated and difficult to make product can be gauged from the company's statement on the launch. It said Razumab is a 100% "Made in India" molecule, a feat achieved by the scientists at Intas and which it claims is unparalleled to date.</p><p><p>"Our objective is to make the treatment available to a wider patient pool that is as yet denied treatment due to high cost of imported Lucentis," said Binish Chudgar, vice-chairman of the firm.</p><p><p>To be marketed in single-dose vials, the product has been widely tested in clinical trials and is being manufactured under strict guidelines for sterile use in the eye, thus reducing the risk of contamination during use, stressed the low-profile company based in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.</p><p><p>An Intas spokesperson said Razumab would be introduced in India at INR17,000 ($267) per injection and result in cost savings of about 25% compared to imported Lucentis, thereby providing a minimum cost saving of INR35,000 to the patient, depending on the number of injections used and the seriousness of the disease.</p><p><h2>bridging cost, need gap</h2><p><p>Importantly, experts suggest Intas's drug will be positioned to benefit on two counts: substitution of expensively priced Lucentis, and gains of acceptability with prescribers who are alternatively treating patients with Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab), normally used in oncology but with a similar mechanism of action to Lucentis. </p><p><p>Although audited numbers could not be immediately accessed to ascertain the AMD market size in India, experts say it could potentially be INR800m ($12.6m), of which Lucentis has a dominant share in terms of value, but the use of Avastin could be as high as 70-80% of total volume, given that it is a little more affordably priced.</p><p><p>Novartis has been bracing for a generic variant of its drug in Indian for some time. Notably, earlier this year the Swiss giant <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-curious-case-of-Luminous-ranibizumab-in-India-358596" target="_new">filed a case</a> against Intas in the Delhi High Court, pleading to the court for a restraining order against the Indian drug maker due to the use of the word Lumina or Luminous in its clinical or medical studies, as it sounded similar to its own brand name.</p><p><p>Asked about that case, Intas said, "We will not be able to comment on Novartis' claims and it is for the appropriate judicial authority to decide the matter on the merits."</p><p><h2>set For rivalry</h2><p><p>However Intas seems excited about the market prospects for its biosimilar. It said the initial response from local medical experts was encouraging and positive as they are hoping it will greatly help patients with an alternative cheaper drug.</p><p><p>Also, an industry source underlined that its availability may cut the use of Avastin, which is the subject of a drawn-out public debate internationally over its application in AMD. Most recently, the French regulator ANSM and Roche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/therapysector/Roche-v-ANSM-the-French-Avastin-stand-off-359147" target="_new">have clashed</a> over France's "temporary use recommendation" which will likely usher in broader use of Avastin in AMD.</p><p><p>After gaining a toehold in AMD treatment with Razumab, Intas hinted it may also expand the biosimilar's use into other indications.</p><p><p>A company spokesperson noted, "Its strategy shall be complemented by increasing awareness about the retinal disorders in the general population, the importance of improving access to better diagnostics and approved treatment for retinal disorders."</p><p><p>Data from India's Clinical Trial Registry shows Razumab was tested with the reference drug Lucentis in 100 patients in the 50-75 years age group in Phase III trials spread over 27 sites in the country.</p><p><h2>Intas's broader plans</h2><p><p>Intas is one of the companies at the forefront of biosimilar and oncology-related drug launches in India. The slew of about 10 products it has introduced includes rituximab, pegylated filgrastim and erythropoietin. In March <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intas-biosimilar-Enbrel-debuts-at-hefty-discount-in-India-357542" target="_new">it launched</a> a biosimilar version of Amgen's TNF inhibitor Enbrel (etanercept) there, and indicated that it was considering filing the product in the EU and certain emerging markets.</p><p><p>The company is showing some aggression for its international business in biosimilars. Earlier this year it became the first Indian firm to gain a European approval for a filgrastim product to be marketed under the brand name Accofil. </p><p><p>The company has initiated the registration process for two biosimilars in the US and expects to be able to launch its first such product there in the next nine to 12 months. Intas added its manufacturing facilities are approved by global regulatory agencies such as Europe's EMA, Brazil's ANVISA, the World Health Organization and others.</p><p><p>A version of this article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
