<p>There's finally enough of the experimental drug ZMapp to start Phase I and II trials of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail in patients with Ebola, US officials announced on 22 January, disclosing first-time human testing of the medicine is expected to soon start in Liberia and the US.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), also said a much-anticipated Phase II/III trial testing the effectiveness of two experimental Ebola vaccines will get underway in Liberia within "a couple of weeks."</p><p>During a 22 January media briefing with reporters, Dr Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), said three of six planned "campaigns" of Mapp Biopharmaceutical's ZMapp have been completed, with two of those now filled into vials.</p><p>ZMapp is composed of three humanized mAbs manufactured in tobacco-based plants, known as <i>Nicotiana</i>. </p><p>Mapp said the experimental drug is an optimized cocktail combining the "best components" of its MB-033 and another product, ZMab, which is being developed by Toronto-based Defyrus and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p><p>ZMapp entered the public spotlight this past August when it was used in humans for the first time to treat two Ebola-infected American aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were volunteering in Liberia when they came down with the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tiny-biotech-Mapps-Ebola-drug-thrust-into-spotlight-353192" target="_new">05 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Dr Brantly and Ms Writebol both recovered from Ebola, and insisted ZMapp helped (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Miracle-ZMapp-or-a-strapping-immune-system-353501" target="_new">22 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Other Ebola patients also have been treated with the drug &ndash; although not all survived the disease, which has now infected about 22,000 people in the current outbreak, killing nearly 8,700 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-modern-techniques-too-late-to-save-doctor-355108" target="_new">17 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-treated-doc-dies-Ebola-robbing-Africa-of-medical-heroes-353534" target="_new">25 August 2014</a>).</p><p>There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure how well ZMapp works, Dr Fauci said, until it&rsquo;s tested in clinical trials.</p><p>He noted this past August, researchers reported that ZMapp was effective in curing all 18 rhesus macaques infected with a lethal dose of Ebola &ndash; even after five days of exposure to the virus &ndash; demonstrating the drug works even at advanced stages of the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-drug-ZMapp-100-effective-in-monkeys-353643" target="_new">1 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Dr Robinson said those data are the basis for moving forward with the human trials of ZMapp.</p><p>He noted it takes three doses of ZMapp to make up a treatment course. Dr Robinson said he anticipates 150 courses to be used in the Phase I and II trials, with the earlier stage human testing expected to get underway within two to three weeks.</p><p>Dr Robinson said there could be thousands of doses of ZMapp available by the end of the year, but he acknowledged it's been a slow process making enough of the product just to get the trials underway. </p><p>BARDA pumped $24.9m into ZMapp late last summer to speed the development of the drug. The contract ultimately could be worth $42.3m for tiny San Diego-based Mapp (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-gambles-24.9m-to-speed-Ebola-drug-ZMapp-353682" target="_new">3 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Kentucky Bioprocessing currently is doing the work of growing ZMapp (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Last fall, Mapp also started the process of making ZMapp antibodies in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. </p><p>Dr Robinson said BARDA also has been working with other companies, like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Genentech, on the CHO cell method.</p><p>Regeneron has insisted that with its mouse engineering and cell-line development technology, the firm could identify, develop and produce mAb therapies to treat Ebola "faster than any other biopharmaceutical company working on this challenge" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Regeneron-insists-its-mAb-fastest-solution-for-Ebola-355036" target="_new">13 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Trials in West Africa of other experimental drugs against Ebola already are underway, specifically testing Chimerix's drug brincidofovir, a nucleotide analogue lipid-conjugate, and Fujifilm's investigational antiviral favipiravir (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Africa-trials-underway-testing-Chimerix-Fujifilm-Ebola-drugs-355963" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Vaccine trials</b></p><p>Dr Fauci could not give an exact timeline for the Phase II/III trial to start of the Ebola vaccines &ndash; one from NIAID and GlaxoSmithKline and another from NewLink and its partners Merck and the Canadian government &ndash; because his agency is awaiting the FDA's final go-ahead and still is working out final details with the Liberian government.</p><p>But he said NIAID plans to enroll up to 27,000 healthcare workers in Liberia and others at high risk for Ebola.</p><p>The World Health Organization had anticipated the trial testing the two vaccines to get off the ground before the end of this month (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said details were also still being finalized for a trial planned to take place in Sierra Leone.</p><p>"There are still many steps that can be taken before the trial can be launched," she told reporters. "But we will be starting as soon as possible."</p><p>Only one of the vaccines will be tested in the Sierra Leone trial, Dr Schuchat pointed out, noting her agency has not yet decided between the NIAID-GSK product or the one from NewLink and Merck.</p><p>The Sierra Leone trial also will use a different design, although that, too, has yet to be finalized. </p><p>Dr Fauci said the timeline for completing both vaccine trials will depend on several factors. He noted, however, it could potentially take up to one year.</p><p>While it would be good news if the Ebola outbreak continues to subside, it would slow down the process of testing the vaccines, he acknowledged.</p><p>Dr Fauci noted that if necessary, the vaccine trials could be completed without proving efficacy. As long as there were enough safety and immunogenicity data, the vaccines could take an "alternative" regulatory pathway under the so-called animal rule. </p><p>But whatever pathway they take, "a safe and effective vaccine will undoubtedly be a critical tool," Dr Fauci said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
