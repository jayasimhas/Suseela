<p><p>Pharmacyclics released new mid-stage data for its blockbuster cancer drug Imbruvica (ibrutinib) in the rare blood cancer Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM). The Phase II data show that Imbruvica provided continued control of the disease after two years, reported scientists from the Dana-Farber Institute in an 08 April publication of the New England Journal of Medicine. The patient's on the drug experienced sustained disease control with an overall response rate (ORR) of 91% after a median of 19.1 months of treatment and a 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 95%. Imbruvica, which is partnered with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Biotech, was <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PharmacyclicsJanssen-win-FDA-OK-for-Imbruvica-in-Waldenstroms-356455" target="_new">approved in January</a> for WM based on earlier data from the study. "The results are remarkable when you consider that patients had received an average of two prior therapies, and 40% showed no response to the previous treatments," said lead investigator Dr Steven P. Treon, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. Imbruvica is already approved in several other types of cancer, including as a first-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with a 17p deletion. The companies reported 2014 revenues of $548m of the drug and expect those <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pharmacyclics-says-Imbruvica-revenue-will-double-in-2015-356854" target="_new">sales to double</a> in 2015. </p><p><p><p>
