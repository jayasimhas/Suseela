<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is partnering with the District of Columbia Health Department to test whether Gilead Sciences&rsquo; recently approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) combination treatment Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) can successfully be used in a community-based setting.</p><p>It used to be that HCV treatment involved long-term use of oral and injectable medications, some of which had unpleasant adverse effects, including flu-like symptoms and depression. </p><p>Because of the complexity of those regimens, HCV treatment largely has been provided by specialist physicians, such as infectious disease doctors and hepatologists. </p><p>But HCV drugs have been revolutionized in the past two years, with the entrance to the US market of combination oral direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies, which have yielded high cure rates, although the long-term effects of the medicines remain uncertain, the NIH said.</p><p>Until recently, however, the use of the medications has been limited to clinical trial settings, where they have typically been administered by highly specialized care teams in tertiary care hospitals.</p><p>Therefore, the successful use of the drugs by primary care doctors, nurse practitioners or physician assistants is largely unknown, the NIH said.</p><p>So the agency and the DC health department plan to conduct the first large-scale, community-based longitudinal study of a DAA-based treatment for chronic of HCV using Harvoni.</p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the study, known as ASCEND, will help determine whether DAA medications are similarly effective when administered in an urban community-based setting. </p><p>ASCEND plans to enroll about 600 Washington clinic patients with HCV infections or HCV and HIV co-infections. </p><p>In the study, 350 participants will continue treatment with their current specialist and 250 participants will be assigned to a primary care physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner, the NIH said.</p><p>All study participants will take a daily dose of Harvoni.</p><p>The study participants will be monitored over a 10-year period for short-term and long-term treatment outcomes, including viral response to the drug and evidence of liver damage. </p><p>The researchers aim to determine whether the type of healthcare provider administering DAA therapy influences its outcome.</p><p>The ASCEND study is expected to be completed in 2025.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
