<p>Sanofi company Genzyme has entered a collaboration with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Voyager Therapeutics focused on the discovery of gene therapies for severe CNS disorders.</p><p>Voyager was launched in 2014 with $45m in Series A venture capital financing from Third Rock Ventures.</p><p>Genzyme will make an upfront commitment of $100m to Voyager, including $65m in cash, a $30m equity investment and additional in-kind contributions. Voyager could receive potential development and sales milestone payments of up to $745m, as well as tiered royalties on any product sales.</p><p>The collaboration will combines Genzyme's expertise in adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy and Voyager's AAV product engine to develop therapies for severe CNS disorders. </p><p>"Genzyme was impressed by Voyager's top notch team, strong gene therapy expertise, and the fact that the company shares our commitment to improving the lives of patients with serious diseases," Mark Barrett, VP of strategy and business development of Genzyme's rare diseases division, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Voyager will drive the R&D activities for all programs under the alliance. Genzyme will have the option to license several programs following completion of initial proof-of-concept clinical trials. However, Voyager will retain all US rights to its lead product programs in Parkinson's disease (VY-AADC01) and Friedreich's ataxia (VY-FXN01). Voyager will split US profits with Genzyme for the Huntington's disease program (VY-HTT01). In addition, Voyager's lead amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) program (VY-SOD101) is not part of the collaboration and Voyager retains worldwide rights to this program.</p><p>"The Genzyme collaboration is Voyager's first major corporate strategic partnership," Jeff Goater, VP of business development at Voyager told <i>Scrip</i>. Voyager said in December 2014 that it planned to collaborate with MassBiologics of the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) to establish scalable processes for manufacturing recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector products. MassBiologics is the only publicly owned, non-profit FDA-licensed manufacturer of vaccines and other biologic products in the US. </p><p>Mr Goater explained the advantages of Voyager's AAV product engine over other technologies. "We are working on building an industry-leading AAV product engine which is focused on areas such as vector optimization and engineering, dosing and delivery techniques, as well as process development and production. We believe the level and breadth of investment that Voyager is making in these areas differentiates Voyager relative to other AAV gene therapy companies."</p><p>Lead product candidates for the collaboration programs are anticipated to be selected over the next 12-18 months, added Mr Goater, with the first IND associated with a collaboration program anticipated next year.</p>
