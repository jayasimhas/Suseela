<p>Before they began their summer vacations, three biotechnology companies raised $62m in venture capital financing and three drug developers grossed $232m in initial public offerings.</p><p>Venture capital investment in biotech companies has been booming with large financing rounds announced this year by several therapeutics firms. However, the first week of August didn't include any triple-digit VC funding deals like the big rounds that the industry saw early in 2015. But with three IPOs between 3 and 7 August, the last official month of summer is on pace to equal or beat June of this year when 10 drug developers went public.</p><p><b>Three IPOs</b></p><p>Most of the cash raised in biotech IPOs during the past week went to Aimmune Therapeutics, which grossed $160m from the sale of 10m shares priced at $16 each, which was at the top of a previously anticipated $14 to $16 range. The food allergy-focused company closed its first day of trading at $24.10 on August 6, but ended the week at $23 per share.</p><p>Brisbane, California-based Aimmune (formerly Allergen Research Corp.) will spend its IPO proceeds on a Phase III clinical trial for AR101 for the treatment of peanut allergies and development of other drug candidates using the company's characterized oral desensitization immunotherapy (CODIT) platform. The US FDA granted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Breakthrough-status-granted-to-Aimmunes-peanut-allergy-drug-359036" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> for AR101 in June.</p><p>Zynerba Pharmaceuticals ended the first week of August above Aimmune at $24.54 as of 7 August after the company launched its IPO at $14 per share on 4 August &ndash; in the middle of a $13 to $15 preliminary price range. Devon, Pennsylvania-based Zynerba grossed $42m from the sale of 3m shares to finance Phase I and II clinical trials for its top two synthetic cannabinoid therapeutics.</p><p>ZYN002 is a topical gel in development for treatment of refractory epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome and osteoarthritis. ZYN001 is a transdermal patch that's being developed to treat fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain.</p><p>The Israeli company Intec Pharma, whose lead drug candidate will treat Parkinson's disease, grossed $30.15m from the sale of more than 5m shares at $6 each. Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem-based Intec closed as high as $6.10 per share after the company's public debut and ended its first week of trading at $6.</p><p>Intec is using its Accordion Pill platform to develop oral medicines that may be safer and more effective based on the technology's gastric retention and specific release mechanism. The IPO proceeds will fund a Phase III clinical trial for Accordion Pill carbidopa/levodopa (AP-CDLD) for Parkinson's disease and development of Accordion Pill Zalephon (AP-ZP) for insomnia.</p><p><b>Three VC rounds</b></p><p>After selling off two cancer drug startups to big pharma companies within a year of each other in 2013 and 2014, Metacrine co-founder and executive chairman Richard Heyman has raised $36m in Series A venture capital for another new San Diego-based firm. Metacrine will develop drugs targeting nuclear hormone receptors for the treatment of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</p><p>The company's technology is licensed from Ronald Evans, director of the Gene Expression Laboratory at the Salk Institute in San Diego. Evans is a Metacrine co-founder and board member, but most of the company's executive team comes from Heyman's last two companies Aragon Pharmaceuticals, which was sold to Johnson & Johnson for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJ-boosts-prostate-cancer-RandD-with-650-million-deal-Medivation-drops-344156" target="_new">$650m up front</a> in mid-2013, and Seragon Pharmaceuticals, which Roche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-in-1.7bn-deal-for-breast-cancer-innovator-Seragon-352620" target="_new">acquired for at least $725m</a> in mid-2014. The two deals are worth up to $2.7bn, including milestone fees, plus royalties.</p><p>Metacrine's CEO Neil McDonnell is the company's only outsider in the C-suite. The Takeda Pharmaceuticals veteran also has worked at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, ZymoGenetics and Immunex. Metacrine's Series A round was backed by Arch Venture Partners, EcoR1 Capital, Polaris Partners and venBio. </p><p>In Northern California, Menlo Park-based Antiva Biosciences (formerly Hera Therapeutics) raised $16m in a Series B round led by Canaan Partners and Sofinnova Ventures. The money will pay for development through Phase I for ABI-1968, a topical antiviral that could replace surgery to treat high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, which can cause cervical, head and neck, and anal cancers. </p><p>Antiva also appointed Gail Maderis as its new president and CEO. Maderis previously was president and CEO of BayBio, a Northern California biotech industry trade group. Before that, she was president and CEO of Five Prime Therapeutics and was an executive at Genzyme. </p><p>Cold Genesys in nearby Santa Ana, California recently closed a $10m Series B venture capital round led by Ally Bridge Group and WI Harper Group with participation from Whitesun Healthcare Ventures and Song Hong Fang. The Series B cash will fund an ongoing pivotal study testing the oncolytic immunotherapy CG0070 in 122 patients with high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in the second-line treatment setting. </p><p>Cold Genesys designed its immunotherapy to replicate in tumors, but not in normal tissue, to elicit an immune response against cancer cells. The company believes that its compound can increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint modulators and also plans to run Phase I/II clinical trials testing that hypothesis with its Series B funding. The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Two-new-VC-funds-and-a-financing-Venrock-Accelerator-Cold-Genesys-353162" target="_new">completed a $13.6m Series A round</a> a year ago.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Bubble-worries-heighten-after-another-big-Alzheimers-offering-359735" target="_new">IPO UPDATE: Bubble worries heighten after another big Alzheimer's offering</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-VC-deals-have-best-ever-quarter-2.3bn-359519" target="_new">Biotech VC deals have best-ever quarter: $2.3bn</a></p><p><p><p><p>
