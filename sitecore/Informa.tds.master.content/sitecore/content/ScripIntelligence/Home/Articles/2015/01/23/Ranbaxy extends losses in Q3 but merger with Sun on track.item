<p>Ahead of its proposed combination with Sun Pharma, Ranbaxy Laboratories reported disappointing numbers for the third quarter ended December 2014, with net losses widening to INR10.29bn ($168m) dented by higher finance costs and foreign exchange losses. </p><p>Ranbaxy has reviewed the carrying amount of an asset representing minimum alternate tax (MAT) credit after taking into consideration the recent FDA decisions concerning its generic Valcyte (valganciclovir hydrochloride) and Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) and the reverse transfer pricing adjustment for a first-to-file product. Accordingly, it had provided INR8.22bn for the carrying amount of the asset on ''grounds of conservatism''. Net losses for the quarter ended December 2013 were INR1.58bn.</p><p>Earlier this week, the US FDA approved the first generic version of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 27 January 2015)</a>. Ranbaxy is, however, fighting on.</p><p>During the nine months ended December 2014, Ranbaxy also settled litigation concerning its ''participation'' in the Texas Medicaid Programme and it expects to make payments to the State of Texas in tranches through August 2015. Ranbaxy has maintained that it settled the matter to avoid ''further distraction'' and ''uncertainty of continued litigation''. <i>Scrip</i> earlier reported that a 2012 joint report of the Office of the Attorney General and Texas Health and Human Services Commission had suggested that the Civil Medicaid Fraud Division was pursuing a case against Ranbaxy for falsely reporting prices to Texas Medicaid used to calculate reimbursement to pharmacies <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Texas-Medicaid-charge-key-to-Ranbaxys-unexplained-provision-353518%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 22 August 2014)</a>. </p><h2>sales hit</h2><p>Sales for the quarter declined INR25.87bn (-9.4%), impacted by global currency depreciation in some markets. US sales stood at INR8.21bn, while Indian sales (including OTC) were INR5.90bn (+2%). During the quarter Ranbaxy launched Infimab (BOW015), the first Remicade biosimilar in India, under a licensing pact with Epirus Biopharmaceuticals <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/First-biosim-infliximab-in-India-debuts-at-20-discount-355503%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 December 2014)</a>. </p><p>Sales in East Europe and the CIS region were INR3.72bn, impacted by currency depreciation in Russia and the Ukraine. Asia Pacific and Latin America sales (including Sri Lanka) were INR2.18bn, a growth of 46% at constant forex over Q3 in 2013-14. </p><p>Ranbaxy also said that it had received regulatory approval to launch Synriam (arterolane maleate 150mg and piperaquine phosphate 750mg) in seven African countries. The product had since been launched in Uganda and will be available in the other countries towards end of January. </p><h2>merger </h2><p>Ranbaxy's CEO and managing director, Arun Sawhney, noted that the merger process with Sun was ''progressing well'' and the firms were working towards the completion of the ''pre-requisites''. The hearing pertaining to the proposed merger at the High Court of Punjab and Haryana was expected on 2 February. US FTC approval for the deal is also awaited.</p><p>The Competition Commission of India had approved the Sun-Ranbaxy combination proposal on 5 December 2014 subject to certain preconditions such as the divestment of seven products. Investment banking sources had earlier indicated that significant progress had been made on the proposed divestment plans <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-Ranbaxy-near-brand-divestments-ahead-of-combination-356223" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 January 2015)</a>.</p>
