<p>Merck says its new drug for advanced melanoma, pembrolizumab, is expected to be made available in the UK very soon, after it became the first product to gain a scientific opinion under the UK's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS). </p><p>The UK regulator, the MHRA, published its scientific opinion accepting Keytruda into the EAMS on 11 March, noting that the scheme supported earlier access to unlicensed medicines in patients with seriously debilitating or life-threatening conditions where there is an unmet medical need. </p><p>"We would expect the first patient to receive pembrolizumab under the EAMS shortly, as physicians working in advanced melanoma prescribing centers across the country can apply for access to pembrolizumab for eligible patients now," a Merck spokesperson said.</p><p>Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories in the US, where the product is already commercialized as Keytruda, said the move would "enable many patients in the UK with advanced melanoma to gain earlier access to pembrolizumab, and underscores the importance of creating new mechanisms to bring promising medicines to patients for whom there are limited options".</p><p>Under the terms of the EAMS, MSD (as Merck is known in the UK) will be responsible for all costs of treatment with pembrolizumab until it receives marketing authorization. In principle, this shouldn't be too long &ndash; the company filed the product in the EU at the end of June 2014 &ndash; although the spokesperson said it had not disclosed any details about the estimated timeline for any decision on approval, or any information on whether it had taken a special regulatory route (accelerated assessment or conditional approval, for example). </p><h2>EAMS process</h2><p>When applying for access through the EAMS, a company must first obtain "promising innovative medicine" (PIM) status by meeting a number of criteria regarding the seriousness of the condition, the availability or otherwise of existing methods, whether it offers a major advantage over current methods, and the benefit-risk balance. Once the PIM is obtained, the company moves onto the MHRA scientific opinion stage.</p><p>Merck obtained a PIM on 10 October last year, although unlike two other companies that have done so &ndash; Bristol-Myers Squibb for Opdivo (nivolumab) and Northwest Biotherapeutics for its DCVax-L cell therapy for glioblastoma multiforme &ndash; it declined to make this information public at the time. Asked why, the Merck spokesperson said: "Until we knew at what point we would be able to communicate to patients that they could gain access to pembrolizumab, we didn&rsquo;t want to raise unfounded hope. We were focused on working with the government and NHS to complete the EAM process in securing a positive scientific opinion."</p><p>Under the EAMS, which was launched in March 2014, this scientific opinion is adopted based on an EAMS "dossier" submitted by the company containing documentation on quality, non-clinical and clinical data, conditions of use, pharmacovigilance requirements, risk management plan, and a patient registry. Once the opinion has been adopted it is published on the MHRA website.</p><p>The pembrolizumab decision was widely welcomed. Steve Bates, CEO of the BioIndustry Association (BIA), said it was "great to see that MSD&rsquo;s pembrolizumab for advanced melanoma has received the first scientific opinion as part of the Early Access to Medicines Scheme". While he noted that the BIA had long been an advocate of the potential of EAMS to speed up patient access to innovative drugs, he said "a year on from the launch of the scheme the challenge is how to ensure that this approval is one of many and not one of a few".</p><p>Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the announcement was is an important step in moves to get innovative and effective cancer drugs to patients more quickly and more cheaply. "We need to be much more open to fast-tracking the best drugs to patients, without the requirement for very large amounts of data from big Phase III trials," he said. But he cautioned that pharmaceutical companies using the scheme "must pass on the savings in drug development costs in the form of lower initial prices, and we must then closely monitor the performance of these new drugs as they are used on the NHS". </p><p>MRC Technology, which humanized pembrolizumab so that it would not be recognized and destroyed by the body's immune system, said it was "proud of our role in bringing this new cancer treatment to patients with highly invasive tumors". </p><h2>"Benefits greater than the risks"</h2><p>The MHRA's scientific opinion on pembrolizumab consists of a public assessment report, two treatment protocols for patients and healthcare professionals, and a treatment protocol on the pharmacovigilance system for the product. </p><p>In the public assessment report, the MHRA said it considered that the drug had been shown to slow the progression of cancer in a condition where other treatments currently have poor results, and that the most frequent side-effects were mild to moderate in severity. "Advanced melanoma is a fatal condition and currently few therapies are available with low to moderate efficacy. There is therefore an urgent need for more therapies and the MHRA therefore considered that the benefits of pembrolizumab in this condition are greater than its risks."</p><p>The condition it will be used to treat is unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progressive, persistent or recurrent disease following treatment with standard of care agents including ipilimumab (BMS's Yervoy) and, in case of a tumour with an abnormal BRAF gene, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor.</p><p>Under the scheme, information will be collected about patients before they begin receiving treatment, and healthcare professionals will be asked by MSD to report any adverse effects experienced by patients under the EAMS, which must be reported to the MHRA by the company. Patients will also be given an "alert card" by their doctor summarizing the important risks associated with pembrolizumab.</p><p>Looking at the benefits of the drug as shown by studies to date, the MHRA said that among the 173 patients who had failed previous therapies, a shrinking of their tumour was observed in 24% and the progression of the disease was halted in 47% for a durable period of time. Approximately 60% of patients survived for at least one year.</p><p>As for the risks, it noted that pembrolizumab may be associated with side-effects resulting from excessive activity of the immune system and that most will resolve following appropriate treatment or on stopping pembrolizumab. The most frequent side-effects, affecting at least 20% of patients, were fatigue, cough, nausea, rash, pruritus, decreased appetite, constipation, joint pain, and diarrhoea.</p><p>Several studies are ongoing in different groups of patients, the agency noted. One of these is comparing pembrolizumab with standard chemotherapy in patients who have progressed after ipilimumab treatment, while another is comparing it with ipilimumab in previously untreated patients.</p><p>A risk management plan has been developed to ensure that pembrolizumab is used as safely as possible. Merck must ensure that all healthcare professionals expected to use the medicine, as well as patients, are given information on the medicine including the side-effects and recommendations for minimising them.</p>
