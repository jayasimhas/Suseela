<p>Delegates at this year's annual ABPI (Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry) meeting spent 23 April attempting to solve the 'affordability conundrum'.</p><p>Recent data from Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Groups-blast-Tufts-2.6bn-drug-RandD-cost-analysis-355129" target="_new">which some have questioned</a>, showed that the out-of-pocket expenses of getting a novel drug to market are around $2.6bn, Professor Adrian Towse of the Office of Health Economics outlined. This rises to $2.9bn if you take into account the cost of commercialization. "So the cost of R&D is clearly rising significantly, and productivity appears to be falling," he said. </p><p>However, Prof Towse argued that the bar for judging productivity has risen. R&D is shifting to diseases that matter more to patients and payers, but the science that needs to be done in these areas is trickier.</p><p>"If we want to revolutionize the cost of R&D, we need to get real about our use of IT, specifically utilizing patient record data," he suggested.</p><p>Dr Stuart Dollow from Vermilion Life Sciences put the cost of R&D into perspective. "$2.6bn is not the cost of success. It is the cost of failure," he said. "Data is power. Data utilization has the potential to disrupt the cost of R&D, but only if we reframe our requirements. Patients are generating data, but this data is ending up in the hands of data analytics companies rather than drug developers."</p><p>Richard Torbett, chief economist at European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), reminded delegates that the increase in R&D expenditure that governments across the world are grappling has little to do with the cost of expensive new medicines and more to do with the greater volumes of drugs being prescribed. </p><p>"The UK spends 1% of its GDP on medicines," Lisa Anson, president of AstraZeneca UK, said. "Compare this with 1.3% in Germany and 1.4% in France. When you consider the size of their economies, you can see these are huge sums of money more than what the UK spends." </p><p>She also stated that AstraZeneca would not support another Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) deal like the current one, which saw &pound;310m returned from the pharma industry to the UK government in 2014.</p><p>She believes there should be a public debate on drug spending, citing the recent ABPI/ComRes poll which found that 52% of English adults believe that not enough of the NHS budget is being spent on medicines. The same poll found that 32% of said that a political promise to spend more on medicines would make them more likely to vote for the party in question, she noted.</p><p>Former Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) chair David Webb, professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh, presented results of another survey on the affordability conundrum. Members of the general public were asked how a limited healthcare budget should be spent on patients with terminal conditions. The results showed that 36% of the population took a utilitarian point of view, where the only point to consider was value for money, with no special cases. However, almost half 49% took an egalitarian point of view; there should be no limits &ndash; life is precious and we should value life-extension and patient choice. Only 10% took the more realistic modified egalitarian view which recognized the wider benefits and opportunities when spend was focused on quality of life.</p><p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Groups-blast-Tufts-2.6bn-drug-RandD-cost-analysis-355129" target="_new">Groups blast Tufts' $2.6bn drug R&D cost analysis</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Profile-The-ABPIs-reimbursement-director-on-Pfizer-his-TicTac-salary-and-paper-mache-355690" target="_new">Profile: The ABPI's reimbursement director on Pfizer, his TicTac salary, and paper mache</a></p><p><p>
