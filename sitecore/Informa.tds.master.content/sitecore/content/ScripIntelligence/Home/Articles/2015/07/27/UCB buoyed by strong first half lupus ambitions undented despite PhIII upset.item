<p> The mid-sized European pharma company UCB is accelerating its investment in its early-stage portfolio following the continuing sales growth of its three core marketed products, and is also advancing a second potential lupus drug into Phase II trials following disappointing Phase III results reported earlier this week for its first lupus drug epratuzumab. </p><p> &quot;We were disappointed with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/UCBs-Phase-III-lupus-failure-casts-further-shadow-over-field-359651" target="_new">Phase III results</a> with epratuzumab in lupus, but it's an area that is high risk, so the news was a disappointment but not a surprise,&quot; commented UCB CEO Jean-Christophe Tellier during an analyst's briefing on its first-half financial results on July 31. </p><p> Lupus is a difficult condition in which to conduct clinical trials, because no two patients have the same symptoms, and symptoms can flare-up at unpredictable times, noted UCB's chief medical officer Iris Loew-Friedrich. &quot;But we remain committed to the treatment of lupus, and we are making the epratuzumab Phase III data available to other lupus researchers,&quot; she added. </p><p> Dapirolizumab pegol, a CD40L antibody, partnered with Biogen, is in Phase I studies in lupus, and should enter Phase II in 2016. It has a different mechanism of action to epratuzumab that targets CD22. </p><p> The Belgian company has two other late-stage programs. A new epilepsy therapy, brivaracetam, was submitted for regulatory review in the US and Europe in January 2015 for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients aged over 16 with epilepsy. &quot;Around a third of patients with partial-onset seizures are poorly controlled on current therapies,&quot; Dr Loew-Friedrich noted. </p><p> And the first Phase III results from evaluating the anti-sclerotin antibody romosozumab in bone loss disorders in a collaboration with Amgen are expected to become available in the first half of 2016. &quot;We are in discussions with Amgen to maximize the unique potential of romosozumab,&quot; Dr Loew-Friedrich confirmed. </p><p> <b>pursuing additional indications</b> </p><p> UCB's marketed epilepsy therapy Vimpat (lacosamide) has been submitted for partial onset seizures in Japan in collaboration with Japanese partner Daiichi Sankyo, and a Phase III program of Vimpat in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures has started, with top-line results expected in 2019, Dr Loew-Friedrich continued. </p><p> An extension of Cimzia's indications to include rheumatoid arthritis patients optimized on methotrexate has been submitted to EMA in Europe, and a Phase III study of Cimzia in the treatment of psoriasis has started in collaboration with Dermira, following a deal signed in June 2014. </p><p> UCB also has six new drugs in early-stage development across seven projects, which is &quot;significant progress compared with previous years,&quot; said Dr Loew-Friedrich. The projects include the interleukin-17-AF targeting antibody bimekizumab for which Phase IIa results in psoriatic arthritis are expected in the second half of this year. The studies are designed to find out if the effects of IL-17-AF inhibitors can be differentiated from those of IL-17 inhibitors. </p><p> Phase II results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 evaluating the effects of the pre- and post-synaptic inhibitor UCB0942 in patients with highly drug resistant epilepsy. &quot;These are patients who have multiple seizures every day,&quot; according to Dr Loew-Friedrich. </p><p> Bimekizumab is also being evaluated in combination with Cimzia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, to see if two biologics with different modes of action can break the apparent cap on responder rates seen with monotherapies. Phase IIa study results are expected in the first half of 2017. </p><p> And UCB's collaboration with UK biotech Vectura has moved forward with VR942/UCB4144 entering Phase I in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. &quot;We believe we have an attractive prospect, but are aware of the highly competitive nature of the potential market for biologics in asthma,&quot; said Dr Loew-Friedrich. </p><p> <b>Cimzia, Vimpat and Neupro still growing</b> </p><p> During the first half of this year, Cimzia, Vimpat and the Parkinson's disease therapy Neupro (rotigotine), drove sales growth at the mid-sized pharma. Their sales totalled &euro;942m in the first half, up 23% at constant exchange rates (CER) compared with the 2014 first half, and accounted for 55% of the company's net sales. </p><p> Cimzia's sales grew in both the US, where they rose by 25% to &euro;321m, and in Europe, where sales rose by 27% to &euro;137m. In response to questions about competition from biosimilar TNF-inhibitors, Dr Tellier said the company was &quot;monitoring the situation closely.&quot; </p><p> &quot;The best way to respond to biosimilars is to differentiate your product, and that's why we are investing in clinical trials that will lead to new indications for our products,&quot; Dr Tellier said. New indications also facilitate access to formularies, he added. </p><p> Sales of the company's mature anti-epileptic Keppra (levetiracetam) continued to contribute to UCB's financial results despite generic competition, garnering sales of &euro;385m in the first half, up 2% at CER and still representing 22% of total sales of &euro;1.7bn in the first half; ex-Europe sales of Keppra compensated for generic erosion within Europe, the company noted. </p><p> UCB made a net profit of &euro;289m in the half and slightly raised its financial outlook. 2015 revenues should be between &euro;3.65bn and &euro;3.75bn (previously they were &euro;3.55-3.65bn), and EBITDA should be at the higher end of the range &euro;710m to &euro;740m. The sale of the US generics business Kremers Urban should be finalized by the end of the year, said CFO Detlef Thielgen. </p> <p><p><p>
