<p><p>Celladon has officially thrown in the towel on its gene therapy work, telling investors on 26 June that the biotech has stopped work on all assets and is hoping to sell off everything, or liquidate. </p><p>"Our Board of Directors has unanimously determined that seeking a merger or sale, in lieu of further development of our remaining programs and assets, gives us the best opportunity to maximize shareholder value. We are aggressively pursuing that course," said President and CEO Paul Cleveland in a statement. </p><p>The San Diego biotech started exploring a sale of the company about a month ago and is still hoping that option will work out, but is willing to sell off the assets individually. Yet, should none of these sales work out, Cleveland has assured investors that the company will liquidate and give cash back to shareholders. </p><p>Investors were not pleased with the plan &ndash; or maybe just lack confidence that the company can score a sale, pushing shares down 40.68%, or 90 cents, to trade at $1.30. The stock was trading over $13 per share earlier this year. The company debuted on the open market in January with an IPO priced at $8 per share for 5.5m shares. </p><p>In the instance of liquidation during the third quarter of 2015, Celladon estimates that it could have $25m to $30m in cash to give back to its investors, but notes that the amount is subject to change. </p><p>The remainder of the staff is expected to leave during the third quarter. </p><p><b>What went wrong</b></p><p>Celladon specializes in gene therapies. The company's lead product was a gene therapy dubbed Mydicar that is injected near the heart and uses an adeno-associated virus to insert a gene that makes the protein SERCA2a. The protein is responsible for the heart contracting and pumping the blood to the rest of the body. Heart failure patients often have a low level of this protein and therefore their heart doesn&rsquo;t pump blood efficiently. Mydicar is a one-time infusion that was hoped could improve SERCA2a levels and give patients better heart function.</p><p>The gene therapy held so much promise that it was the first of its kind to be granted <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Celladons-Mydicar-1st-gene-therapy-FDA-breakthrough-designation-351213" target="_new">FDA's Breakthrough Therapy in April 2014</a>. Gene therapy has been a space that is of particular interest to investors and has seen a resurgence since its first wave of enthusiasm early in the century.</p><p>Yet, hopes of success for Mydicare were thrown out earlier this year when the CUPID2 trial failed. The biotech announced 26 April that Mydicar failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints in the Phase IIb trial, failing to show any efficacy over placebo.</p><p>While the first wave of gene therapies disappointed in the early 2000s, investors are excited about the next-gen therapies that are starting to report out. Mydicar <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celladons-CUPID-wont-kill-gene-therapy-358080" target="_new">isn't necessarily indicative of the space</a> failing, and as many analysts point out, gene therapy could have a lot more potential in other disease areas. </p><p><p>
