<p>The last couple of decades have seen major progress in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), with a number of drug approvals. In contrast, clinical trials of drug candidates in progressive multiple sclerosis have failed to deliver the same successes. However, a small French biotech company believes it can change all this with its high-dose biotin product.</p><p>MedDay, based in Paris, reported positive results from a pivotal Phase III trial (the MS-SPI study) of high-dose biotin (MD1003) in the treatment of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis at the recent American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting. The trial enrolled 154 patients which were randomized 2:1, so 103 in the MD1003 arm and 51 in the placebo arm. </p><p>"This is biotin (vitamin H) at 10,000 times the RDA, which means regulators see the product as a pharmaceutical rather than a food supplement," CEO Frederic Sedel told <i>Scrip</i>. MD1003 has patent protection in EU and US for dose and use in multiple sclerosis. </p><p>MD1003's proof-of-concept has been obtained in a pilot, open label study in 23 subjects with primary and secondary progressive MS. Results were positive with up to 90% of subjects exhibiting some clinical improvement over time.</p><p>"The [MS-SPI] trial was very ambitious," noted Dr Segel. "The regulators asked for a strong endpoint. We had to show that patients had actually improved after 12 months, not just show a halt to progression."</p><p>And, owing to the fact that no patients in the placebo arm showed any improvement, MedDay was able to demonstrate this.</p><h2>trial results</h2><p>The primary endpoint was met (p=0.0051, Fisher&rsquo;s exact test) in the intent to treat population with 13% of patients in the MD1003 arm showing an improvement of EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) or TW25 (a timed 25-foot walk) at Month 9, confirmed at Month 12, compared to none of the patients (0%) in the placebo arm.</p><p>The primary endpoint was supported by secondary analyses showing evidence for a decrease in the risk of disease progression. The mean change of EDSS between Month 0 and Month 12 decreased in the MD1003 group (-0.03) compared to progression in the placebo group (+0.13, p=0.015). In the MD1003 arm, only 4% of patients treated with MD1003 exhibited EDSS progression at Month 9 (confirmed at Month 12) versus 13% in the placebo group (p=0.07), around a 67% decreased risk of progression in the active arm within the studied period. The study was not prospectively powered to reach significance for this secondary endpoint.</p><p>Commenting on the results, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Daniel Chancellor said, "There is considerable unmet need for drugs that are effective for progressive subtypes of multiple sclerosis. However, the potential of a new drug in this setting depends on whether it is producing a symptomatic or disease-modifying benefit. There are already drugs that can help with specific symptoms, such as spasticity, walking deficits and pain. The way this trial is set up, it is premature to be claiming that high-dose biotin has a disease-modifying effect." </p><p>Highlighting the recently failed INFORMS study of Gilenya in primary progressive multiple sclerosis, Mr Chancellor believes that MedDay "will need to show a positive and significant effect on reducing the risk of sustained disease progression in up to 1,000 patients to convince regulators."</p><h2>mechanism of action</h2><p>"Our discovery approach is unique," Dr Sedel said. "We address neurological disorders by developing drugs that interfere with brain metabolism. We have a research platform to investigate brain metabolism and we have other drugs in our pipeline."</p><p>MD1003 has a mode of action which potentially influences two targets related to progressive MS: (1) it activates acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC1 and ACC2), the rate-limiting enzymes in the synthesis of fatty acids required for myelin synthesis, and (2) it activates the Krebs cycle in demyelinated axons to increase energy production. MD1003 was well tolerated in the trial. </p><p>The trial is now in the extension phase, gathering another 12 months of data. "We also look forward to the analyses of other secondary endpoints and MRI studies which might provide additional data about the mechanism of action," said Dr Segel. "There is also a second Phase III placebo-controlled trial underway looking at the effect of MD1003 in MS patients with permanent visual loss following optic neuritis. Results from this trial are expected later this year."</p><p>If all goes well, Dr Segel expects to file for approval of MD1003 in early 2016 in Europe, and possibly also in the US, "though the FDA may want another trial," he noted. MS-SPI was conducted entirely in France. "It depends on the clarity we get from the European data," Dr Segel said. </p><p>The data currently available suggest that taking high-dose biotin at the early stages of disease onset would be beneficial. "It would make sense," Dr Segel agreed. "It could be very effective to start it soon. There have been no series adverse effects in the clinic, though some teratogenicity in animals. We would need to do all the carcinogenicity studies if we want to consider administering the drug on a long-term basis. But this is not needed to get the drug approved."</p><h2>finances</h2><p>MedDay was founded two years and has been funded to date by BPIFrance and Sofinnova Partners.</p><p>"We needed additional funds," Dr Segel confirmed. "We want to raise a series B round and are in discussions with some investors. We have discussed partnering options with big pharma. An IPO is also an option after the series B."</p><p>Dr Segel is not so keen on being acquired. "We're not for sale," he concluded. "Our asset is strong enough for us to hang on to it ourselves."</p>
