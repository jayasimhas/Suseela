<p><p>Plenty of money flowing through the biotech world of late &ndash; several biotechs conducted their initial public offerings this week, sneaking through the slowly closing IPO window while valuations are still high. Yet, biotechs are not seeing that upward trend that those that debuted last year saw; many newly public biotechs are opening flat &ndash; indicating fair value. </p><p>According to a recently released report by consulting firm PwC, the IPO window is not as wide open as it was just a year ago, but companies seem to be bringing in higher valuations. The report confirms that there were 17 healthcare companies that entered the public market in the first quarter of 2015, raising $1.19bn in funds, down from 35 IPOs in the year-prior quarter that hauled in $2.22bn. Healthcare company IPOs outpaced every other sector. </p><p>The report also noted that the life sciences sector brought in $440min financing during the quarter, going to 42 companies, and largely supported by venture capital dollars. Expect biotech to continue to take advantage of generous VCs, as well as the strong &ndash; albeit waning &ndash; IPO market. There were a number of notable entrants over the last week, including AbbVie-partner Galapagos. </p><h2>Galapagos</h2><p>Belgian biotech Galapagos prices its IPO 07 May with the expectation of debuting on 11 May under the symbol GLPG. The inflammatory disease focused company expects to raise $183m by offering 3.78m American Depositary Shares for a price of $42.43 per share, as well as another 1m shares on the European market. The stock is already listed on the Euronext Brussels and the Euronext Amsterdam. </p><p>AbbVie already has an option on the company's Phase II JAK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis filgotinib and results from recent mid-stage studies have pushed the market to believe that the bigger partner will exercise its right on the license very soon or purchase the company outright. Either way, AbbVie is expected to make a decision during the second half of 2015. </p><p>The Belgian biotech also has programs in the pipeline for cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </p><h2>Collegium</h2><p>Canton, Mass-based Collegium Pharmaceuticals announced the pricing of its IPO on 07 May, seeking nearly $70m by selling 5.8m shares at $12 apiece under the ticker symbol COLL on the NASDAQ. The stock opened flat at $12 per share that same day. </p><p>Collegium specializes in abuse-deterrent pain medications that are developed using DETERx oral drug delivery technology. The company's lead product is an abuse-deterrent, extended-release oral formulation of the widely-prescribed oxycodone. The drug is currently under review by the FDA and has a user fee action date of 15 October. </p><p>The company has said that it intends to use its 100-rep sales force to detail the drug to more than 10,000 physicians upon approval. </p><h2>Adaptimmune </h2><p>The British biotech floated 11.25m American Depositary Shares under the symbol ADAP on the NASDAQ at a price of $17 apiece in hopes of bringing in $175.7m on 06 May &ndash; the offering was at the high end of its initially proposed range of $15-17 per share. The offering came in flat and has lingered in the $17-range during its first few days on the market. </p><p>Adaptimmune Therapeutics makes cancer immunotherapies and is trying to capitalize on the buzz around the hot area. The company's lead product is in Phase I/II trials for solid tumors and hematologic cancer types. The biotech raised $104m last year in its Series A lead by New Enterprise Associates. In June 2014, it inked a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline on the product, currently dubbed NY-ESO TCR. </p><p>Adaptimmune is co-develop its NY-ESO-1 clinical program and associated manufacturing optimization work together with GSK. The Big Pharma has an option on the program through clinical proof of concept, anticipated during 2016, and, on exercise, will get full responsibility for the program. The biotech is eligible for $350min milestone payments from the deal. </p><h2>CoLucid </h2><p>The migraine drug developer from Burlington, Mass was seeking to sell 5.5m shares at $10 per share under the symbol CLCD on the NASDAQ. The stock debuted on 05 May and has fallen to about $8 per share since. </p><p>CoLucid Pharmaceuticals is developing a new mechanism of action for the treatment of migraines that is currently in Phase III. The trial, under a special protocol assessment from the FDA, is expected to read out in mid-2016. The company is expected to initiate a second pivotal Phase III trial in the first half of 2016 for lasmiditan. CoLucid is also developing an IV formulation of the drug for the hospital setting. </p><p><p>
