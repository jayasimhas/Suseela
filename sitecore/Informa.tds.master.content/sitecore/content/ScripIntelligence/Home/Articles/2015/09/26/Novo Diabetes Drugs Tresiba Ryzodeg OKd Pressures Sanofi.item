<p>Watch out Sanofi.</p><p>Danish drug maker Novo Nordisk just won the FDA's approval for two new long-acting insulins &ndash; Tresiba (insulin degludec injection) and Ryzodeg (insulin degludec/insulin aspart injection), which will be marketed as therapies to improve glycemic control in patients with types I and II diabetes.</p><p>Tresiba is a once-daily new-generation basal insulin analogue, while Ryzodeg contains insulin degludec in a soluble co-formulation with insulin aspart, which can be administered once or twice daily with any main meal. </p><p>The Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company's drugs are expected to provide more competition in the diabetes space &ndash; particularly for Sanofi's Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection 100 U/mL) and its recently approved follow-up medicine <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-wins-US-approval-for-Lantus-follow-up-Toujeo-356952" target="_new">Toujeo</a> (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 300U/mL), which is a much more concentrated once-daily long-acting basal insulin than the former drug.</p><p>Lilly had hoped to make the U.S. diabetes market even tougher for Tresiba and Ryzodeg to enter by gaining approval of its own once-daily basal insulin peglispro. </p><p>But the Indianapolis, Ind.-based company revealed in February it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Liver-concerns-hang-up-Lilly-basal-insulin-peglispro-356899" target="_new">delaying</a> the U.S. and European submissions for the experimental medicine until after 2016 because of liver concerns.</p><p>Novo said it plans a first-quarter 2016 launch for Tresiba, which will be available in the firm's FlexTouch device and offered in two concentrations of 80 units and 160 units per injection.</p><p>The company, however, has not yet scheduled Ryzodeg's timeline for entering the U.S. market.</p><p>Tresiba and Ryzodeg had been expected to be on the market much sooner &ndash; in fact, two years ago.</p><p>But in February 2013, the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-and-Lilly-boosted-by-Novos-shock-Tresiba-FDA-knockback-339910" target="_new">rejected</a> the medicines, telling Novo it needed to complete a cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) comparing insulin degludec to Lantus.</p><p>Three months earlier, in preparation of a meeting of its Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC), the FDA had said that while it determined the two Novo drugs were effective in treating types I and II diabetes, the agency said it had identified a "potentially important and credible" CV safety signal, which it said required further investigation.</p><p>In a meta-analysis, regulators said a CV safety signal of increased risk of serious cardiovascular events had been detected in the degludec development programs.</p><p>But regulators acknowledged the rates of adverse CV events were almost identical between the degludec drugs and the comparators &ndash; Lantus, Merck's Januvia (sitagliptin) or Novo's Levemir (insulin detemir) &ndash; for the first 60 weeks patients were in a trial. </p><p>But then the rates leveled off for the comparator arms, while they climbed sharply for the degludec groups. </p><p>Nonetheless, at the November 2012 meeting, the FDA's EMDAC <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-FDA-advisers-back-Novo-Nordisk-genetic-insulins-despite-worries-337038" target="_new">backed approval</a> of Tresiba and Ryzodeg, although all of the members said Novo should be required to run more studies to determine if there truly was a CV risk with the medicine &ndash; with eight of those declaring the trial could be done after approval.</p><p>The FDA, however, ignored that advice and told the firm the CVOT needed to be done pre-approval &ndash; issuing a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-and-Lilly-boosted-by-Novos-shock-Tresiba-FDA-knockback-339910" target="_new">complete response letter</a> to Novo.</p><p>Two years later, Novo had an interim analysis of the CVOT in hand &ndash; declaring this past March it was read to resubmit its new drug applications (NDAs) for Tresiba and Ryzodeg. And apparently, the FDA found the data agreeable.</p><p>Tresiba's approval in the type I indication was based on two 26-week and one 52-week active-controlled trials involving 1,102 participants. The type 2 indication was based on four 26-week and two 52-week active-controlled studies involving 2,702 participants.</p><p>The drug provided reductions in hemoglobin A1c or glycosylated hemoglobin, which were in line with those achieved with approved long-acting insulin, regulators said.</p><p>Ryzodeg's approval in the type 1 diabetes indication was based on one 26-week active controlled trial involving 362 participants, while Novo used data from four active controlled 26-week studies involving 998 patients on which to base the type II indication.</p><p>Ryzodeg provided reductions in HbA1c equivalent to reductions achieved with approved long-acting or pre-mixed insulins.</p><p>Novo plans to discuss the approvals in a Sept. 28 conference call with investors and analysts.</p><p>Meanwhile, the company also revealed on Sept. 25 it had submitted an NDA to the FDA for Xultophy, a once-daily single-injection combination of Tresiba and Novo's once-daily injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist Victoza (liraglutide), which was approved in 2010 as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, although it's not approved for type I disease.</p><p>Earlier this month, Novo reported Xultophy demonstrated greater improvements in treatment-related satisfaction and patient-reported physical health versus Lantus in the company's DUAL V phase IIIb study.</p><p>But Sanofi also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofis-LixiLan-Succeeds-In-Second-Pivotal-Trial-But-Benefit-Still-Uncertain-360468" target="_new">reported this month</a> that its combination of Lantus plus lixisenatide, known as LixiLan, met its primary endpoint in a second Phase III study &ndash; demonstrating a statistically improved reduction in A1c.</p><p>Sanofi said it plans to submit an NDA for LixiLan in the fourth quarter. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
