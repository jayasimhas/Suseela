<p>CRISPR Therapeutics, which is focused on developing drugs using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology, has added additional funds to its series A and series B rounds, which now total $89m. The "heavily oversubscribed" financings were led by GSK's venture arm SR One and Celgene, respectively, and included new investors New Enterprise Associates and Abingworth, along with founding investor Versant Ventures. The fresh cash includes $35m of new series A and $29m of new series B funds.</p><p>"We are a very attractive employer in this field, and we'll be making good use of that over the next six-to-nine months to assemble a strong R&D team in Cambridge (Massachusetts)," CRISPR's chief executive officer Dr Rodger Novak told <i>Scrip</i>. "We will keep a small footprint in Europe but the center of gravity will be in Cambridge."</p><p>Earlier this month CRISPR hired Dr Bill Lundberg as chief scientific offer to lead CRISPR's R&D operations in Cambridge. Dr Lundberg joined from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, where he was head of translational medicine. </p><p>Meanwhile, the ongoing intellectual property dispute surrounding the CRISPR technology could be the subject of a Hollywood film plot. </p><p>Co-researchers Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were initially jointly credited with the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. </p><p>Jennifer Doudna took her share of the IP rights and went on to co-found Caribou Biosciences and Editas Medicines. Emmanuelle Charpentier's IP rights eventually ended up with CRISPR Therapeutics. Dr Doudna was joined at Editas by Broad Institute scientist Feng Zhang.</p><p>In April last year, much to the surprise of the CRISPR community, the Broad Institute was granted a broad patent for use of the CRISPR technology in eukaryotes &ndash; essentially, everything other than bacteria. Editas promptly announced its license of this patent. Dr Doudna, in the meantime, had distanced herself from Editas, and through Caribou Biosciences decided to set up yet another company &ndash; Intellia Therapeutics, whose investors include pharma giant Novartis. The patent lawyers have been busy ever since.</p><p>"We fully believe that our interference proceeding [against the Broad Institute] is justified," Dr Novak told Scrip. "There is a competitive element to our relationship with Intellia but we have a common interest to protect the patent estate and we'll do that together. Time will tell where the chips fall. We feel very comfortable with our position, which has obviously been validated by this financing. We believe that we deserve the founding IP that we have. Yes, there are IP issues, but the CRISPR community is small, and this is a big space. People like to make out that there is a war going on between the founders or the companies. It is not like that," he claimed.</p><p>
