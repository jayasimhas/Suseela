<p>Clinical trials of novel antibiotics featured heavily in the late-breakers session of this week's European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting in Copenhagen with late-stage clinical data for two new products from Cempra and Tetraphase. </p><p>Tetraphase presented the full data from its Phase III IGNITE1 trial of its novel fluorocycline, eravacycline, in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) &ndash; the company revealed that the study had met its primary endpoint showing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Tetraphases-antibiotic-as-good-as-Mercks-in-Phase-III-355735" target="_new">non-inferiority to Merck & Co's ertapenem</a> in December. </p><p>In the multinational, double-blind trial, 541 patients were randomized to either eravacycline (1.0mg/kg iv every 12 hours) or ertapenem (1g iv daily), for cIAI. Under the guidance set by the FDA and the EMA, the primary endpoint of the trial is clinical response at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit in the two treatment arms. For the FDA, the primary analysis is conducted using a 10% non-inferiority margin in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population, and for the EMA, the primary analysis is conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the clinically evaluable (CE) patient population. </p><p>Secondary endpoints include the microbiologic response in the treatment arms at the end of treatment, TOC and follow-up visits in the micro-ITT and microbiologically evaluable populations. </p><p>Clinical outcomes at TOC were as follows:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Population</b> (N) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Eravacycline % Cure</b> (n) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Ertapenem % Cure</b> (n) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Difference </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>CI</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Micro-ITT<sup>1</sup> (446)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>86.8 (220) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>87.6 (226) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-0.80 </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-7.1, 5.5 (95%)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>MITT<sup>2</sup> (538) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>87.0 (270) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>88.8 (268) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-1.80 </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-9.2, 5.6 (99%)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>CE<sup>3</sup> (477) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>92.9 (239) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>94.5 (238) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-1.70 </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-7.9, 4.4 (99%)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td colspan="5"><p>Notes: <sup>1</sup>Micro-ITT: randomized patients with at least one baseline pathogen, <sup>2</sup>MITT: patients who received study drug, <sup>3</sup>CE: patients with no major protocol deviations</p></td></tr></table><p><p>The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>. Eravacycline achieved high cure rates against these pathogens, as well as in patients with <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> and in patients with suspected ESBL-producing pathogen isolates.</p><p>There were no drug-related serious adverse events, and the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events for eravacycline were gastrointestinal, including nausea (3.3%) and emesis (2.2%).</p><p>Lead researcher, Professor Joseph Solomkin, Professor Emeritus in the department of surgery at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and an advisor to Tetraphase said: "The data &#8230; show that eravacycline has the potential to be a new treatment option for complicated intra-abdominal infections, and possibly other serious bacterial infections, where new treatments remain urgently needed for infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria."</p><p>Tetraphase also presented data at ECCMID supporting eravacycline's potential in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Eravacycline has been designated by the FDA as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for both the cIAI and cUTI indications.</p><p>In the lead-in portion of IGNITE2, both IV-to-oral dosing regimens of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg IV followed by 200mg or 250mg) compared favorably with levofloxacin for the treatment of cUTI, supporting the advancement of the trial into its pivotal portion. Based on these data, Tetraphase selected the 200mg eravacycline oral dose for the pivotal portion of the Phase III study that is currently underway.</p><p>Tetraphase's president and CEO Guy Macdonald said: "We believe that eravacycline will offer physicians additional options when treating bacterial infections given its activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, including multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, and, in cUTI, its potential as an IV-to-oral transition therapy." He added that the company expects to report top-line results from the pivotal portion of IGNITE2 in mid-2015.</p><p>Brean Capital analysts said that given this timeline, they expected an NDA submission for the antibiotic for both cUTI and cIAI by the year end. And analysts at BioMedTracker increased their likelihood of approval score for eravacycline by an additional 1% given the numerical data from this study in cIAI to 64% which is 4% above average.</p><h2>Cempra's solithromycin </h2><p>Cempra announced that its fourth-generation oral macrolide solithromycin &ndash; the first fluoroketolide product &ndash; met its primary endpoint of showing non-inferiority to the fluoroquinolone moxifloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Cempra-rises-on-first-Phase-III-solithromycin-results-355944" target="_new">in a Phase III trial in January</a>. </p><p>The full data presented in Copenhagen show that solithromycin is more effective in older patients (>75 years) even with its shorter treatment regimen. In the 860-patient, double-blind SOLITAIRE-oral trial 860 patients from 16 countries with CABP were randomized to receive oral solithromycin for five days or oral moxifloxacin for seven days. The efficacy was comparable (78% in solithromycin versus 78% in moxifloxacin group), but higher with solithromycin in those 75 years or older (84% vs 70%), while side-effects were comparable in both groups (36.6% versus 35.6%), including study-drug related AEs (10.1% versus 12.5%), serious AEs (6.6% versus 6.3%; none attributed to study drug) and deaths (1.4% in both groups).</p><p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> was the most commonly diagnosed pathogen (23%), followed by <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (16%), <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> (15%), <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> (9%), <i>Moraxella catarrhalis</i> (6%), and <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(4%). </p><p>The researchers said the results indicated that a macrolide monotherapy could be a preferable alternative to using a broad-spectrum quinolone in CABP patients. "A return to macrolide monotherapy for CABP might be feasible in the future." Analysts at BioMedTracker out its likelihood of approval at 63% which is 2% above average.</p><p>Cempra is still testing solithromycin in a Phase III oral-to-intravenous clinical trial in patients with CABP and in a Phase III trial of oral solithromycin in uncomplicated gonococcal infections. </p><p>Cempra notes that solithromycin does not contain a pyridine in the side chain (as does telithromycin/Ketek) that appears to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and could be associated with serious adverse events such as visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis that have been observed with telithromycin.</p>
