<p>CytRx has shared updates for more than a year from the Phase IIb soft tissue sarcoma (STS) clinical trial for aldoxorubicin, a modified version of the chemotherapy agent doxorubicin, but the company's stock traded flat on 22 January after CytRx reported a 1.6-month overall survival benefit in the trial.</p><p>The OS results came on the heels of a 20 January announcement that a partial clinical hold on studies involving aldoxorubicin was lifted by the US FDA &ndash; news that also failed to boost the company's stock. CytRx closed at $3 per share on 22 January, a 2.3% drop from the prior day, bringing the company's market cap to $167.2m.</p><p><b>Phase IIb update</b></p><p>CytRx reported its first set of results from the 123-patient Phase IIb clinical trial for aldoxorubicin in the treatment of advanced STS in December 2013, showing that the study met its primary endpoint: an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) by two different assessments (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CytRx-soars-as-aldoxorubicin-doubles-PFS-in-sarcoma-348726" target="_new">12 December 2013</a>). </p><p>Aldoxorubicin increased PFS from 4.7 months for doxorubicin-treated patients to 8.4 months for people who received the CytRx drug, according an assessment by study investigators (p=0.0007). Radiology reviews at an independent laboratory showed a doubling of PFS from 2.8 months to 5.7 months (p=0.024).</p><p>However, the improvement in disease progression did not translate to a major impact on overall survival (OS). Median OS was 16 months for 83 patients treated with aldoxorubicin and 14.4 months for 40 patients who received doxorubicin (p=0.21). </p><p>While CytRx noted that OS was a secondary endpoint for the Phase IIb study, which was not powered to deliver a statistically significant OS result, the company said aldoxorubicin-treated patients were two times as likely to be alive two years after treatment began compared with individuals in the doxorubicin arm of the clinical trial.</p><p>Sagient Research decreased the likelihood of FDA approval (LOA) for aldoxorubicin by 2% to 39% based on the small OS gain in the Phase IIb study. The LOA remains 4% above average for oncology drugs in similar stages of development, however, because of the previously reported PFS benefit, which is significant for a cancer with unmet medical need. Sagient noted that Novartis's Votrient (pazopanib) is approved for STS despite a lack of OS benefit.</p><p>Adverse events for aldoxorubicin in the Phase IIb trial were consistent with known side effects for doxorubicin, but grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred at greater rates for aldoxorubicin-treated patients: neutropenia (40% versus 20%), mucositis (11% versus 3% and nausea/vomiting (7% versus 0%). </p><p>However, cardiac toxicity was not seen the aldoxorubicin arm of the study, but was observed in 10% of patients treated with doxorubicin. Also, there was no clinically significant reduction in cardiac function for aldoxorubicin-treated patients even though they received 3.5 times the standard dose of doxorubicin.</p><p>The CytRx drug consists of doxorubicin and a linker that binds with albumin to deliver the chemotherapy agent at higher concentrations directly to tumor cells with reduced toxicity.</p><p><b>Partial hold lifted</b></p><p>The FDA put a partial hold on aldoxorubicin clinical trials in November after a patient treated with the drug under an expanded access (AKA compassionate use) request died, but CytRx vowed to restart patient enrollment as soon as possible after revising trial protocols to exclude certain patients (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CytRxs-aldoxorubicin-on-partial-hold-after-compassionate-use-death-355127" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>). </p><p>The company said on 20 January that patient enrollment will resume now that the revised protocols have been adopted by ongoing studies' internal review boards. A Phase III clinical trial evaluating second-line treatment of STS with aldoxorubicin remains on track to complete enrollment by the end of 2015 with initial results expected in mid-2016 to support a commercial launch of the drug, assuming it wins FDA approval, in 2017.</p><p><p><p><p>
