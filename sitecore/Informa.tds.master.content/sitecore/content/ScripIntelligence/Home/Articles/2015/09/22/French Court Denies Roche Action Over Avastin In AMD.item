<p>A judge at France's top administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, has denied a request from Roche to suspend the government's decision to reimburse its anticancer, Avastin (bevacizumab), for the off-label indication of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). </p><p>The Swiss firm had asked the court to suspend the temporary use recommendation (Recommandation Temporaire d'Utilisation, or RTU) allowing Avastin's use in wet AMD, pending a full investigation into its legality. </p><p>The RTU was issued earlier this year by the French regulatory agency, the Agence Nationale de la Sécurité du Médicament et des produits de Santé (ANSM), under a new law allowing off-label uses of drugs to be reimbursed even when approved alternatives are available if this brings savings for the health insurance &ndash; which in Avastin's case it would. </p><p>At the time, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/France-Sets-Precedent-With-Off-Label-Avastin-Move-360162" target="_new">Roche said</a> that economic considerations must not undermine the EU regulatory system, "particularly when several EU approved medicines are available for intravitreal use in wAMD." Novartis's Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Bayer's Eylea (aflibercept) are already on the market for AMD, but they are very much more expensive than Avastin. The Roche drug has to be titrated into smaller vials for use in the eye, which Roche says could cause health risks.</p><p>According to the court, the judge found that an administrative act could only be suspended if there was "an emergency situation" as well as "serious doubts as to the legality of the contested administrative decision."</p><p>In this case, "none of the criticisms formulated by Roche cast any serious doubt on the legality of the decision concerning Avastin," the court said in a statement. In particular, it continued, the judge found that "the French legal provision allowing ANSM, in certain conditions, to authorize the use of a medicine beyond what was foreseen in its initial marketing authorization did not appear to be contrary to EU law."</p><p>It also said that it did not appear, at this stage, that ANSM had disregarded the procedures that should be followed under the code of public health. The judge therefore refused to suspend ANSM's decision to issue the RTU and said the situation would not change until the court had given its definitive ruling on the legality of that decision. </p><p>In a statement, Roche said it had "taken note" of the Conseil d'Etat's decision, and pointed out that the court still had to address the company's request for annulment of both the RTU and the decree authorizing the use of RTUs even when therapeutic alternatives are available. It added that it still considered this RTU to be "against the interests of patients." </p><p>Three European industry bodies have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Industry-Calls-For-EU-Action-Against-French-Off-Label-Law-360201" target="_new">filed a complaint</a> against the French law with the European Commission, saying it "circumvents the robust EU authorization process for medicinal products, which sets rigorous standards for market approval for specific medical needs based on the benefit to risk ratio."</p>
