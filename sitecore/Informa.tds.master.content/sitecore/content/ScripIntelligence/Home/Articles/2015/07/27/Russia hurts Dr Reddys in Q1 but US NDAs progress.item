<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories reported a 7% increase in revenues to INR37.6bn ($591m) for the first quarter ended June, but growth was impacted by a significant drop in sales in emerging markets and flat numbers in the pharmaceutical services and active ingredients (PSAI) business. Net profits increased by 14% to INR6.3bn.</p><p>However, Dr Reddy's appears to have made some progress with its New Drug Application (NDA) filings in the US and the firm's top brass said that it now has PDUFA dates for the three filings submitted earlier in the year.</p><p>"We expect monetization to start some time next fiscal year," Dr Reddy's chief operating officer Abhijit Mukherjee, said in a post results investor call on 30 July. </p><p>Earlier this year, Dr Reddy's announced its first bucket of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Dr-Reddys-kicks-off-derma-neurology-NDA-filings-357720" target="_new">NDA filings</a> with the US FDA for its proprietary products business: three 505(b) (2) NDAs &ndash; DFD-01 and DFD-09 in the dermatology space and DFN-11 in the neurology segment. </p><p>Revenues from emerging markets declined by 20% to INR5.8bn, with revenues from Russia down sharply to INR2.3bn (-45%) primarily owing to ongoing macro-economic uncertainties and the consequent depreciation of the Ruble. In constant currency, revenues declined by 22%. </p><p>Mr Mukherjee, referred to "pressure for volumes" of some mega brands as well as channel inventory adjustments "to some extent" in the Russian market. The volume share of the OTC portfolio, though, is growing versus a market decline there.</p><p>Overall revenues from the global generics segment were, however, up 8% to INR31bn, largely driven by North America, India, Europe and Venezuela.</p><p>US sales increased by 14% to INR18.5bn essentially on account of the sustained performance of the injectable franchise and market share gains in key molecules. It was also backed by the contribution from products launched subsequent to the quarter ended 30 June 2014 &ndash; mainly products such as valganciclovir, sirolimus and Habitrol (an over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy transdermal patch acquired from Novartis Consumer Health last year) .</p><p>Dr Reddy's made six new product filings in the US during the quarter and has 73 ANDAs pending for approval with the FDA of which 47 are Para IVs, with 16 likely having First to File (FTFs) status.</p><p>Revenues from India stood at INR4.8bn (+19%) during the quarter, while revenues from Europe jumped 43% to INR1.9bn.</p><p>Revenues from rest of world territories were up 21% to INR2.7bn, with Venezuela reporting 42% growth on the back of continuing volumes uptake.</p><p>Revenues from PSAI were flat at INR5.6bn and the company indicated that the business was undergoing "structural change" with considerable efforts being put to achieve the twin objective of sales growth and healthy margins. </p><p>The new strategic intent is to make this profit center more "value accretive" and may involve cutting down some parts of the business that are not yielding sufficient returns, the top brass said.</p><p>"We continue efforts to add newer technologies and platforms to revamp our product offering to go higher on the innovation scale," Mr Mukherjee added.</p><h2>Generic Nexium</h2><p>Dr Reddy's also said that it believes that it has "comprehensively addressed almost all observations" raised by the FDA at the firm's active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) site in Srikakulam.</p><p>"We have periodically sent detailed updates to the FDA. Going forward we are awaiting a positive response from the agency," Mr Mukherjee said.</p><p>Dr Reddy's had earlier progressed its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-Plan-B-for-Nexium-generic-in-play-appetite-for-MandA-too-358381" target="_new">Plan B</a> - essentially a site transfer - to hang on to the generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) opportunity, after an FDA inspection of the Srikakulam site raised certain compliance issues. </p><p>On generic Nexium-related queries, the firm believes that it has responded, to the best of its understanding, "satisfactorily" to the regulator.</p>
