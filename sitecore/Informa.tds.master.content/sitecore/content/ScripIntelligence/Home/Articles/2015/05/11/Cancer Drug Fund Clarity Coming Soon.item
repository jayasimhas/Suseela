<p>Companies should learn more about what is likely to come next after England's current Cancer Drugs Fund ends in April 2016. After delaying the consultation for some time, NHS England has told<i> Scrip</i> that it should finally come out the week starting 9 November.</p><p>NHS England declined to say why the consultation was late, nor if the delay would impact on whether what follows will be ready for implementation on 1 April. According to an "emerging proposal" released earlier this year, a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NICE-conditional-approvals-to-replace-Englands-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-359590" target="_new">managed access fund</a>" will finance drugs that get a conditional nod from HTA body NICE.</p><p>The delay has been criticized by the pharmaceutical industry which is still in the dark, not only about how new cancer medicines will be assessed, but also about what will happen to the drugs delisted from the fund. The ABPI said it was disappointed by the lack of progress and called on the government to publish its proposals.</p><p>The consultation's publication will come the week after another round of drugs were axed from the list following a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/UKs-Latest-Cancer-Drug-Cull-Draws-Renewed-Calls-For-Reform-360270" target="_new">review in September</a>. The fund was only meant to run from 2010 to 2014, but value-based pricing, which was supposed to ensure better access to high cost drugs, never materialized and the fund was extended to 2016. Its budget was increased from &pound;200m a year to &pound;340m and the fund subsequently ran into financial trouble.</p><p>On 4 November, the fund stopped financing several drugs. However, Roche managed to win a reprieve for Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) for advanced HER2 positive breast cancer patients by dropping its price for the drug. The company came under some pressure to cut its price and the patient group Breast Cancer Now presented a petition with 42,000 signatures to Roche. However, the firm said that by the time it received the petition, discussions were already well under way to secure access to the drug. Roche declined to comment on what discount it offered.</p><p>The firm was unable to do anything to prevent the delisting of Avastin (bevacizumab) for colorectal and triple negative breast cancer patients. According to the firm, no level of discount could have convinced the fund to finance Avastin because it changed its clinical effectiveness thresholds. This meant that Avastin did not have a high enough score on clinical effectiveness to merit a listing.</p>
