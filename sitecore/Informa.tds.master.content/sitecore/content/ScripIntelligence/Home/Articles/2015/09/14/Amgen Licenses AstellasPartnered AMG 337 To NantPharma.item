<p>NantPharma LLC, a subsidiary of Patrick Soon-Shiong's NantWorks LLC empire, licensed AMG 337 outside of Japan, Russia and other central Asian countries from Amgen Inc., which previously partnered with Astellas Pharma Inc. to develop the cancer drug and four other compounds in certain Asia territories.</p><p>AMG 337 is a small molecule inhibitor of c-Met, a cell surface enzyme, that is under evaluation for the treatment of gastric cancer in a Phase II clinical trial. NantPharma will use its tumor molecular profiling capability to identify people whose cancer has high levels of c-Met expression and enroll appropriate patients in future trials. The same strategy is being used in the development of ganitumab (AMG 479), which the NantWorks subsidiary NantCell LLC licensed from Amgen earlier this year.</p><p>AMG 337 is the earliest-stage compound in Amgen's two-year-old, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Japan-JV-boosts-Astellas-cancer-pipeline-Amgens-presence-343569" target="_new">five-asset collaboration</a> with Astellas. Amgen suspended development of rilotumumab, a later-stage c-Met inhibitor that also was part of the Astellas partnership, in November based on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-ends-rilotumumab-in-gastric-cancer-cautions-outside-investigators-355243" target="_new">safety concerns in a Phase III</a> gastric cancer study.</p><p>The other Astellas-partnered assets have been successful to date: Amgen won early US FDA approval for the anti-CD19 bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody <i>Blincyto</i> (blinatumumab) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-early-US-win-for-BiTE-antibody-Blincyto-355400" target="_new">for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in December</a>; the FDA approved the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab) to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">reduce high cholesterol in August</a>; and positive top-line results were revealed recently from the first Phase III study for the bone-building sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab, which also is partnered with UCB <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/UCB-buoyed-by-strong-first-half-lupus-ambitions-undented-despite-PhIII-upset-359731" target="_new">with more detailed data expected in 2016</a>.</p><p>NantWorks licensed ganitumab from Amgen in January and launched the immuno-oncology subsidiary NantCell to develop the monoclonal antibody that targets the insulin like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) outside of Japan. Amgen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ganitumab-failure-in-pancreatic-cancer-another-setback-for-AmgenTakeda-alliance-333790" target="_new">halted a Phase III pancreatic cancer study</a> for ganitumab in 2013 after an interim analysis showed that the IGF-1R inhibitor was unlikely to meet the clinical trial's primary endpoint.</p><p>NantWorks founder and main investor Soon-Shiong became one of the richest men in Los Angeles after selling Abraxis Biosciences &ndash; developer of <i>Abraxane</i> (nab-paclitaxel, albumin-bound) &ndash; to Celgene Corp. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-to-acquire-Abraxis-Bioscience-for-2.9-billion-up-front-298709" target="_new">for $2.9bn up front</a>. Since then, he's started several health information technology, genomics and drug development companies under the NantWorks umbrella, including the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Bubble-worries-heighten-after-another-big-Alzheimers-offering-359735" target="_new">newly public</a> NantKwest LLC and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Six-VC-financings-and-a-royalty-deal-360424" target="_new">recent venture capital fundraiser</a> NantCell.</p><p>In addition to AMG 337, NantPharma is developing <i>Cynviloq</i> (paclitaxel nanoparticle polymeric micelle), a follow-up to Abraxane that was acquired from Sorrento Therapeutics Inc. for $90m up front and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Abraxane-inventor-buys-follow-on-version-of-drug-from-Sorrento-358479" target="_new">up to $1.3bn total in May</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
