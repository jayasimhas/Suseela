<p><p>Eli Lilly & Co announced further data from its Phase III IMAGINE program for its novel basal insulin peglispro. While the data showed that the drug, dubbed BIL by the company, outperforms Sanofi's Lantus on virtually every measure of insulin control, there are still some liver issues that could scare regulators. </p><p>During multiple presentations at the American Diabetes Association annual meeting in Boston on 06 June, Lilly announced the results from IMAGINE-2, IMAGINE-4 and IMAGINE-5. All three trials compared BIL with Lantus (insulin glargine), the current standard of care, in patients with type 2 diabetes. The trials were in patients who had not previously used insulin, those using basal insulin with mealtime insulin and those currently using basal insulin, respectively. </p><p>Patients in the three trials taking BIL achieved an HbA1c level of less than 7%, which is the ADA recommended level. In IMAGINE-2, patients who had never taken insulin saw a reduction of 1.6% on BIL compared with 1.3% on Lantus at 52 weeks. In IMAGINE-4, reductions were 1.7% vs 1.5% at 26 weeks, respectively. While in the patients currently taking basal insulin, reductions were 0.82% compared with 0.29% at 26 weeks, respectively. </p><p>The patients on BIL in all three studies also showed a greater reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia. </p><p>Superiority enough?</p><p>Lilly's peglispro is the first basal insulin to be superior to Lantus on any of these measures, but in all three trials BIL increased the level of the liver enzyme ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and triglycerides. In an analysis that included data from all three trials, patients taking BIL had a mean treatment difference in liver enzymes of 7.4 IU/L and a greater proportion of BIL patients had ALT levels of greater than three times the upper limit of the normal range. Yet, no cases of severe drug-induced liver injury occurred. </p><p>- IMAGINE-2:</p><ul><li>ALT change from baseline at 52 weeks: 4.1 IU/L vs -2.0 IU/L</li><li>ALT ?3X ULN: 2.3% vs 0.6%</li></ul><p>- IMAGINE-4:</p><ul><li>ALT change from baseline at 26 weeks: 7.6 IU/L vs -0.6 IU/L</li><li>ALT ?3X ULN: 1.9% vs 0.9%</li></ul><p>- IMAGINE-5:</p><ul><li>ALT change from baseline at 52 weeks: 8.3 IU/L vs 0.4 IU/L</li><li>ALT ?3X ULN: 2.3% vs 0.0%</li></ul><p>"BIL is mechanistically different from current basal insulins. It has a hepato-preferential action, driven by its reduced effect on peripheral tissues," said Dr David Kendall, VP of Medical Affairs at Lilly Diabetes. "What we&rsquo;ve seen from the Phase III trials are unprecedented results in the basal insulin space: superior glycemic control with less nocturnal hypoglycemia and reduced weight gain, all of which are important to physicians and patients."</p><p>This data is what signaled the company to delay its regulatory filings in the US and EU. Investors had initially expected a filing by the end of this year, but now Lilly has said it won't happen until at least 2017. Some investors don't believe it will happen at all. </p><p>These results are the end of the planned Phase III IMAGINE trials and Lilly had not announced any further studies, but has said that peglispro remains a priority. The company will likely need further clinical support to overcome the liver issues to make the insulin approvable. </p><p>Dr Kendall told <i>Scrip </i>that the company has been in ongoing conversations with the FDA to figure out a path forward for the drug. </p><p><p>
