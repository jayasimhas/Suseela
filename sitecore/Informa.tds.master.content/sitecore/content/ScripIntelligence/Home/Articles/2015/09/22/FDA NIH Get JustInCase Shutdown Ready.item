<p>While House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have vowed they won't let the U.S. government shutdown come Oct. 1 &ndash; when the fiscal year 2015 funding runs out &ndash; the FDA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other parts of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are getting ready anyway.</p><p>It's just as well. Even if the so-called continuing resolution (CR) makes its way through the House and the Senate and across President Barack Obama's desk, providing at least the short-term funding to prevent the federal government from shutting down this week, there's no guarantee come Dec. 11 &ndash; the timeline for the currently proposed CR to run out &ndash; it won't be d√©j&agrave; vu all over again in Washington, with the same threats that currently are looming remaining a hangover then.</p><p>The Senate late on Sept. 28 held an initial vote on the stopgap measure &ndash; passing it 77-19, with a final vote expected on Sept. 29. The measure will then go to the House for a vote on Sept. 30.</p><p>For now, the FDA, NIH and the other HHS agencies are following the plan White House Office of Management and Budget told them to have ready just in case.</p><p>If for some reason the stopgap doesn't successfully make it through Congress in time and there's a shutdown, 40,659 HHS staff would be furloughed, of 51%, while 39,173 personnel, or 49%, would be retained as of day two of a near-term funding hiatus. </p><p>HHS noted those percentages are not consistent across the board and will vary from agency to agency.</p><p>For the FDA, 42% of its staff, or 6,929 medical reviewers and other workers, would be sent home until the government fully reopened, while the agency would keep 9,363 employees on hand.</p><p>During the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shutdown-Looms-Another-FDA-Merry-go-round-Ride-360647" target="_new">2013 shutdown</a>, which Standard & Poor's said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Research-blunted-economy-damaged-And-for-what-347447" target="_new">wiped out $24bn</a> from the U.S. economy, 6,620 of the agency's employees, or about 45% of its personnel, were told to stay home for 16 days.</p><p>The FDA would not specify the duties of those who would remain in the office during the shutdown, but those who are furloughed would not even be permitted to answer their emails.</p><p>But the HHS contingency plan said the FDA would continue limited activities related to its user fee-funded programs and other "select vital activities," including maintaining critical consumer protection to handle emergencies, high-risk recalls, civil and criminal investigations, import entry review and other critical public health issues.</p><p>HHS noted that the FDA comprises over half of the so-called "excepted" staff for the "protection of human life." </p><p>The 1,010 FDA staff that would be excepted to inspect regulated products and manufacturers, conducts sample analysis on products and review imports offered for entry into the U.S. Those personnel also include active investigators who will be needed to perform inspections, recall operations, emergency response, review import entries and make admissibility decisions, HHS said, noting those staff members would be conducting and overseeing adverse event reporting and lot release protocol reviews, as well as providing support with surveillance, product incidents, compliance, recalls, and emergencies.</p><p>The NIH is set to take a greater hit in terms of furloughing employees &ndash; with 78% of the agency's 18,530 scientists and other workers, or 14,536, will be sitting it out until Congress can resolve its differences over funding the government.</p><p>The HHS plan calls for the NIH to only keep 22%, or 3,994, of its personnel on the NIH campus.</p><p>NIH Director Francis Collins last week said the last time there was a shutdown in October 2013 for 16 days, the ghost town atmosphere was "about the most depressing thing I've been through" during his more than 20 years at the agency.</p><p>"I don't want to have to do that again," Collins <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/U.S.-Government-Shutdown-Threatens-Research-Patients-360630" target="_new">told reporters during a Sept. 22 press conference</a>.</p><p>HHS said the biomedical agency would continue patient care for current NIH Clinical Center patients, it would not be permitted to admit new patients, unless deemed medically necessary</p><p>During the last shutdown, Collins said hundreds of patients were turned away &ndash; meaning their care had to be postponed until the government reopened on Oct. 17.</p><p>If there's another shutdown, HHS said the Clinical Center would be operating at roughly 90% of normal patient load during the initial weeks of a funding hiatus.</p><p>HHS said 2,084 NIH staff would be considered "excepted" for the provision of patient care.</p><p>The NIH chief had to in fact personally tell most of those patients they could not come to the Clinical Center, unless it was a life-threatening situation &ndash; "which was a hard thing for people to hear and for many of us to have to say."</p><p>HHS' contingency plan would provide for "minimal" support for ongoing protocols at the NIH and the animal care services would be allowed to continue to ensure those creatures stay alive and healthy if there's a shutdown.</p><p><b>What's The Beef?</b></p><p>On Sept. 27, Boehner &ndash; in his first interview since announcing his resignation just two days before &ndash; was insistent on the Sunday <i>CBS</i> political program <i>Face the Nation</i> there would be no government shutdown.</p><p>Washington insiders said Boehner's decision to not only step down from his third-line-to-the-White House speaker post by Oct. 30, but also to leave Congress altogether would appease the extreme right wingers who have been pushing for the shutdown under a fight to defund the reproductive and family planning services organization Planned Parenthood, which has been accused of trying to profit from making fetal tissue available for research &ndash; a charge the group has adamantly denied.</p><p>Boehner said the move by some Republicans to hold up government operations because of the dispute over Planned Parenthood was "unrealistic."</p><p>Boehner condemned those who were behind the 2013 shutdown under an effort to kill the <i>Affordable Care Act</i>, often called Obamacare, as "false prophets." </p><p>"This whole idea that we were going to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013, this plan never had chance," Boehner said.</p><p>McConnell stripped the Planned Parenthood defunding rider from the current stopgap measure.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
