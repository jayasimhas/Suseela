<p>AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc., which suffered a major setback last year when the US FDA refused to approve its lead product Zalviso (sufentanil sublingual tablets) for the treatment of post-operative pain, has been 'reenergized' by news that the product has been approved in Europe, management told Scrip. This follows news from earlier this week that AcelRx has sold the majority of the expected royalty stream from the sales of Zalviso in the EU to PDL BioPharma. AcelRx's commercial partner in the EU is Grunenthal GmbH. </p><p>Zalviso is a system combining a drug and a device designed to deliver a sublingual tablet formulation of sufentanil via a pre-programmed, non-invasive, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device which provides 15 mcg per dose as needed. Grunenthal, AcelRx's licensee in Europe and Australia, expects the product to be available to Western European patients in the first half of 2016.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sale of the Zalviso royalty stream netted AcelRx $65m. Specifically, PDL will receive 75% of the European royalties under the Grunenthal license as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestones, subject to a capped amount. AcelRx will receive 25% of the royalties, 20% of the first four commercial milestones, 100% of the remaining commercial milestones and all development milestones, including a $15m payment for the approval of the Zalviso MAA. </p><p>Timothy Morris, chief financial officer of AcelRx, said that the transaction was "more attractive than other financing options" as it provided "significant capital in a non-dilutive manner." It will put AcelRx's estimated cash at year end to more than $100m and should provide sufficient capital to complete regulatory submissions for AcelRx's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AcelRx-Makes-Headway-With-Second-Pain-Drug-Device-Combo-360382" target="_new">second lead product ARX-04</a> in the US and Europe, and conduct "limited additional work on Zalviso, if needed," in preparation for re-submitting a new drug application to the FDA.</p><p>"We had another meeting with the FDA a couple of weeks ago and we discussed our views and their views [about Zalviso]. We're waiting for the minutes of that meeting and then we'll see what comes out &ndash; whether to continue to make our case or whether to do more clinical work," said interim CEO Howard Rosen. "The US had a 10-month head start and Europe approved our product sooner, so it's one of those cases that Europe is demonstrating again that they are more open to innovation than the US perhaps," he noted. "We have a promising second product in the pain area &ndash; ARX-04 &ndash; and the cash will help us to move that forward. We expect to file an NDA next year."</p><p>"We took the royalty stream from potential sales in Europe and essentially pulled that forward. To be able to get access to those dollars today is very valuable to AcelRx for building value in the company," added Morris.</p><p><b>Europe vs US</b></p><p>"The regulatory process was a bit different in Europe and the US," explained Rosen. "We had to get a CE mark for our device in Europe, and we got that in December last year. The EMA only looked at the drug component. It appears that the FDA has questions about the device component of the system. The commentary to date with the FDA is around some of the system failure rates that we saw with the device, and these have since been corrected. The Europeans didn't share those same concerns around the device," said Rosen.</p><p>According to the interim CEO, the EMA's processes were "very interactive; it has very definite time points for interaction, so even though overall it can take longer &ndash; it took 14 months from beginning to end to get approval in Europe &ndash; in the US, it had a target of 10 months but in our case as the FDA asked for more information it essentially ran out of time. We got sent a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Surprise-snub-by-FDA-of-AcelRxs-Zalviso-353060" target="_new">complete response letter</a> and there is no set process in the US for what you do after that. They focus on that first review and then there isn't a good process for then completing the review. I have learned to really appreciate the process in Europe."</p><p>However, Rosen doesn't believe there was anything AcelRx could have done differently to avoid the US catastrophe. "As we've said, what's been approved in Europe is the same thing we filed in the US. We have good clinical data. The discussion in the US is that the FDA wants to see more clinical data to assure themselves of the reliability of the device."</p><p>It's been a long road, and the journey is far from over for AcelRx. "There are days when you doubt what you know is true, but this European approval just reinforces that this product will benefit patients, and it has given us the energy to keep going in the US," said Rosen. "The plan was to market the product in the US ourselves, though we have had people approach us that are interested in being our marketing partner. So we are discussing that with them to see what that alternative might look like."</p>
