<p>Cipla has seen another high profile exit. This time it's the firm's global chief financial officer (CFO), evidently bitten by the entrepreneurial bug.</p><p>Cipla told <i>Scrip</i> that its global CFO, Rajesh Garg, had stepped down to pursue his "entrepreneurial ambitions" in the healthcare e-commerce area. Mr Garg could not be immediately reached for further comment.</p><p>Cipla informed Indian bourses on 29 May that a separation agreement was being entered into between Mr Garg and the firm, under which the CFO will demit office, with effect from 12 June 2015.</p><p>Mr Garg's departure comes close on the heels of the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ciplas-scion-leaves-company-for-new-horizons-357733%5d" target="_new">exit of Kamil Hamied</a>, son of vice-chair MK Hamied and nephew of chairman Dr Yusuf Hamied, in a move that could apparently help the young scion "widen his horizon." Cipla's country head (India) Sameer Goel was also reported to have <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-India-head-Sameer-Goel-quits-357683%5d" target="_new">quit</a> earlier. </p><p>Some analysts also referred to Mr Garg's name cropping up in local media reports in a case concerning alleged tax evasion on a new plant at his previous employer Cadbury India, though there is no indication of any linkage between the allegations and the exit. It is also unclear if Mr Garg has already been cleared of the charges.</p><p>Personnel exits also found mention in Cipla's Q4 post results investor call late 29 May, though the company underscored that its leadership bench was robust. </p><p>In response to an analyst's query on the exit of Kamil Hamied and Mr Garg, Cipla's global chief operating officer (COO), Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, said that these instances were "quite normal" in a dynamic organization. </p><p>"In some cases such changes are driven by changes in personal interest as well. The organization is supposed to adapt and change depending on circumstances. Cipla was always a professionally managed company and professionalization is successfully embedded in the company."</p><p>He referred to how the company went through a phase of bringing talent from the outside, but said that Cipla now has enough talent within to grow and develop the internal bench.</p><p> "If you see the sales momentum of Q4 and the guidance we have given you for the next few months and full year, the transformation is big," Mr Priyadarshi added.</p><p>Cipla's global CEO Subhanu Saxena previously told <i>Scrip</i> that a critical area of focus for the firm over the next 18-24 months was to build its leadership bench in the top 100 positions.</p><h2>sofosbuvir gains</h2><p>Meanwhile, Cipla reported a 22% increase in revenues to INR30.93bn ($484.6m) in the fourth quarter ended March 2015, though profits were flat at INR2.60bn.</p><p>Domestic sales increased by 20.7% to INR10.86bn during the quarter, led by growth in respiratory, anti-infective, cardiac and gastrointestinal therapies. </p><p>The company also appears to have made gains for its generic sofosbuvir in India. The product has notched around 250 prescribers in just 45 days, officials said at the investor call. </p><p>Cipla told <i>Scrip</i> that the total number of hepatitis C patients requiring therapy is estimated at approximately 100,000 and with the introduction of sofosbuvir in India, the number of patients expected to be enrolled may reach 30,000 each year. </p><p>"Cipla is expected to get a share of 25%. We expect our approvals to come towards the end of the year," the firm said. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> has previously reported how the Indian companies Natco Pharma and Hetero were the only <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-Sovaldi-generics-saga-2-suppliers-and-falling-prices-357593%5d" target="_new">key suppliers of sofosbuvir</a> to the entire flock of firms, including Strides Arcolab, Cipla, Zydus Cadila and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, which have launched the product, leading to a "super competitive" market. </p><p>Cipla's Hepcvir (sofosbuvir) was launched in March 2015, while Mylan, the exclusive distributor of Sovaldi in India, launched the product last month.</p><p>Cipla's formulation exports increased to INR16.90bn (+29.7%) during the quarter.</p><p>Cipla, which is scaling up in the US with its own ANDA filings and front end in addition to partnered products, also said that it had launched its first set of own label products there, namely amlodipine, meloxicam, lamotrigine, topiramate, valaciclovir and doxycycline. </p><p>A company presentation also referred to how the firm had de-risked its business via front ends in 17 select markets such as Yemen, Iran, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Morocco and Algeria.</p><p>Cipla also expects "mid-teens" top-line growth going forward, a guidance which the investor call heard factors in gains from supplies of generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium delayed release capsules) to Teva. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393%5d" target="_new">first generic version</a> of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product. </p>
