<p>After the Conservative party won the UK General Election with a clear majority on 7 May, it looks like it is full speed ahead to an "in-out" referendum on membership of the European Union. Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017, but it is looking increasingly likely that this could happen as soon as 2016. </p><p>A "Brexit" &ndash; a British exit from the EU &ndash; would have widespread repercussions for key sectors of the UK economy, particularly highly regulated industries like pharmaceuticals and financial services. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> has drawn up a non-exhaustive list of the possible implications for the pharmaceutical and life science industries areas should the UK decide to relinquish its membership of the EU. We will follow up with more in-depth analysis of these issues in the coming weeks.</p><p><h2>1) Inward investment </h2><p>Many firms invest in the UK in order to sell to the domestic and other EU markets, and for some inward investors, unrestricted access to the EU market is key. Might companies be less likely to build new or retain existing manufacturing plants or distribution facilities in the UK in the event of a Brexit? The destabilizing effects of a Brexit could also prompt US or Eastern investors to lose faith in the Union and put their money in other markets. </p><p><h2>2) EU legislation</h2><p>The life sciences sector in the UK and the rest of Europe is subject to a huge body of EU legislation, rules and guidance in the form of Directives, Regulations and scientific and procedural guidelines. These laws and regulations affect all aspects of the sector, from drug assessment and authorization, clinical trial approval, trial reporting, pharmacovigilance, and animal testing, to cross-border healthcare, joint procurement of emergency measures (including pandemic vaccines) and tackling the trade in falsified medicines. What would happen if these laws and guidelines were no longer applicable in the UK?</p><p><h2>3) Regulatory incentives </h2><p>Companies developing new drugs in the UK can take advantage of a number of services and incentives, such as scientific advice from the EMA, market exclusivity for orphan drugs, and the chance to take part in the adaptive pathways experiment. Originator companies also gain the EU's added IP protections such as supplementary protection certificates, data and market exclusivity, etc.</p><p><h2>4) Role of the MHRA </h2><p>In the event of a Brexit, the role of the UK regulator, the MHRA, would change, as would the way that new medicines are approved in the UK. The MHRA authorizes some products for marketing, but most new drugs go centrally via the European Medicines Agency. Centralized approvals would no longer be valid in the UK, and the MHRA would probably have to re-authorize them as national drugs. </p><p><h2>5) Launch priorities</h2><p>Firms think carefully about their launch sequences and an EU exit could see the UK slip way down the priority list if companies have to jump through extra hoops to win approval there (see above). The UK's fragmented market access systems and reluctance to pay high prices could compound the situation, making the UK a less attractive launch market. This might also affect the UK's attractiveness as a place to do clinical trials.</p><h2></h2><h2>6) The European Medicines Agency</h2><p>How would the EMA be affected by a UK withdrawal? Its headquarters are in London, and it has just completed its move into brand new offices in Canary Wharf. Where would it go if the UK were to leave the EU, and would happen to its permanent staff in London? What about the services that it offers to UK companies on new drug development, such as scientific advice?</p><p><h2>7) International ties </h2><p>The EMA has close ties with other major world regulators such as the US FDA, Health Canada and the Japanese PMDA. Agreements with the FDA include parallel processes for giving scientific advice to companies and assessing quality by design, as well as a common application form for orphan drug designation. The MHRA might need to rethink its relations and agreements with these and other regulators.</p><p><h2>8) Clinical trials</h2><p>The new Clinical Trials Regulation, due to take effect sometime in mid-2016, will introduce a single portal for submitting applications to begin trials in the EU, together with an EU-wide trials database and new requirements for trial data disclosure. Would an ex-EU UK have access to the portal and database?</p><p><h2>9) R&D funding</h2><p>The EU is very active in funding research and development programs. Companies (particularly SMEs) and researchers benefit from EU research programs like FP7 and Horizon 2020. The latter is a seven-year research and innovation program with almost &euro;80bn of funding that is intended to remove barriers to innovation and help public and private sectors to work together. UK-based firms would lose access to these opportunities.</p><p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is the EU's second biggest contributor to the EU budget; in 2013 its net budget contribution was around &euro;11bn.The EU would likely have to rethink its spending in light of a Brexit. It's unclear where the axe would fall, but some R&D programs may be at risk of losing some or all of their budget.</p><p><h2>10) PPPs</h2><p>There is also a wide range of EU public/private partnerships, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative, which supports collaborative research projects and helps build up networks of industry and academic experts to boost pharmaceutical innovation in the EU. Half the funding for the IMI comes from the EU &ndash; but the advantages lie not just in the money but in the ability to bring together companies and researchers from different EU countries to share knowledge and experience. </p><p><h2>11) Incentives </h2><p>Different member states offer a range of incentives for keeping business in the EU, for example tax back for using services from a company based in another member state. Some UK companies could seem less attractive in the event of an exit. </p><p><h2>12) Patents </h2><p>A new EU patent system is being established, with a Unified Patent Court and a unitary patent valid throughout the Union expected to be up and running sometime in 2017. One division of the UPC is to be based in London. As a non-member of the EU, UK would be excluded from this system, and the London branch would have to be relocated. </p><p><h2>13) Access to medicines</h2><p>The UK plays a key role in initiatives like early-access programs, adaptive pathways, international collaboration on health technology assessments and the like. A Brexit could jeopardize UK participation in pan-European projects intended to speed up patient access to innovation. </p><p><h2>14) Trade association links</h2><p>UK pharma and biotech industry bodies have strong relationships with their European counterparts: ABPI/BIA/EFPIA, BGMA/EGA, PAGB/AESGP, to name but a few. What would become of these ties, and would the UK industry see a decline in its lobbying power abroad? </p><p><h2>15) Trade treaties </h2><p>The UK is involved in the negotiation of international trade treaties as part of the EU discussions led by the European Commission. Left outside the EU, it would need to configure its own trade relations with the likes of the US, Canada and nations of Southeast Asia.</p><p><h2>16) Tax incentives</h2><p>Pulling out of the EU could give the UK greater freedom in its tax regime (its "Patent Box" incentive scheme was reined in after Germany cited EU rules for fair play.)</p><p><h2>17) Freedom of movement</h2><p>Pulling out of the EU would put an end to the free movement of goods and services between the UK and the other 27 member states. This could have implications for the movement of scientists, life science company staff and researchers across Europe, as well as on trade.</p><p><h2>18) Economic stability and viability of the EU</h2><p>On a wider scale, the departure of one of the EU's biggest and more stable economies could have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the Union. Aside from the economic impact, it could prompt other members to rethink their position in the EU.</p><p><p>There are also further implications for industry in general in areas such as merger and competition rules, taxation, employment law, data protection, healthcare systems, hospital tendering, and so on. </p><p><p><p>
