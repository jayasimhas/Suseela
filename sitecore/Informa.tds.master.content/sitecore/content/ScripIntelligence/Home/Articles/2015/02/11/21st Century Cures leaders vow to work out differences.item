<p>The two members of the House who have been leading an effort to overhaul certain functions at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health and other areas of the US biomedical research and development enterprise wit the goal of accelerating the discovery, development and delivery of medical therapies have vowed to work out their differences and move the legislative process forward. </p><p>Representatives Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan) and Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) had spent months holding numerous hearings and roundtables on Capitol Hill and "listening" sessions in other parts of the country under their 21st Century Cures initiative, which they officially launched last May 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Time-to-go-big-on-cures-innovation-lawmakers-declare-351611" target="_new">5 May 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Scrip-100-Lawmakers-seek-RandD-enterprise-overhaul-for-faster-cures-353964" target="_new">16 September 2014</a>).</p><p>But when it came time to reveal a draft legislative package, Representative Upton did so alone, with Ms DeGette declaring flatly on 27 January she did not support the direction her Republican partner on the effort had taken (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>).</p><p>At a 9 February forum at the BIO CEO & Investor Conference in New York, sponsored by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the Colorado congresswoman acknowledged she specifically disagreed with Representative Upton on provisions he had included in his draft discussion document that would add additional marketing exclusivity to certain drugs. </p><p>But Representative DeGette said she hasn't abandoned the initiative and said her staff members have been working with Mr Upton's on a daily basis to iron out the two lawmakers' differences &ndash; declaring the document was "still a work in progress."</p><p>"This document is an amalgamation of a lot of ideas," she said, adding that she and her Republican colleague recognized they have "issues of disagreement.&rdquo; </p><p>"We are going to have to sit down and work it out," Representative DeGette said. "We've committed to doing that."</p><p>"I think the first step to do that is to have that level of trust and collaboration to realize that it's a project that needs buy-in from a large range of players, including the Senate and administration, and to sit down and really negotiate this out," she said. I know it's radical, but it's the way we used to legislate in Washington. That's what we are hoping to achieve again."</p><p>Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, got the ball rolling in his chamber last week &ndash; declaring he was forming a bipartisan working group and also plans to begin a series of hearings in March. He actually had initiated his effort a few days earlier by releasing a report, which he co-authored with Senate Richard Burr (Republican-North Carolina) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">29 January 2015</a>).</p><p>At the BIO forum, Representative Upton said the document he unveiled on 27 January was just the first version &ndash; with "2.0" on its way in "a couple of weeks," or at least, before the actual legislation is introduced, which he hopes to do by the end of May, with the goal of having it to President Barack Obama before the year is out.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
