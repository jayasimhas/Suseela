<p><p>Depomed issued another official rejection to Horizon Pharma on Aug. 20 as the company continues to claim that the offer is undervalued. Horizon's most recent offer would give Depomed $33 per share in an all-stock offer or $32.50 in a mixed cash/stock offer. Depomed says that its shareholders would only own 29% of the combined company and that it would not be enough to compensate for the contributions from its pain drug Nucynta (tapentadol). </p><p>"We have consistently communicated to you that in the absence of a compelling proposal, we believe it is not in the best interests of Depomed to engage with Horizon. In addition, we believe many of your public and private assertions are completely inaccurate," wrote Depomed CEO Jim Schoeneck in a public letter to the potential acquirer. </p><p>Horizon has stuck to its guns and <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomeds-Resistance-Pushes-Horizon-Offer-Down-359947" target="_new">said that</a> is has issued a "full and fair value offer." It's unlikely the company is going to raise the price it's willing to pay and is more likely to walk away from the deal. Horizon executives have said that they are keeping their options open and are looking at a variety of other assets. </p><p>In anticipation of the rejection from Depomed, Horizon put forth a slate of seven board members that it would like to get elected to the Depomed board of directors. The list, made public on Aug. 19, included former member of the NASDAQ Stock Market Review Council Robert Daines, current Chairman of the audit committee at Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Jack Kaye and SVP of business and corporate development at Flamel Technologies Steven Lisi.</p><p><p>
