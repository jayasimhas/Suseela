<p>Bayer Healthcare's key therapy areas of focus are oncology, cardiology, ophthalmology and women's health, according to vice-president and head of early licensing Dr. Mark Wolters; but while the company is investing in programs in these areas at all stages of development, it has to keep its lasers focused and can't step into unapproved zones.</p><p>"There are a few areas where we are not active, like pain treatment for instance, also Alzheimer's disease and the whole area of CNS, these are not areas where we have early stage research. This is because we have been so successful in recent years that we have had to focus our activities," Wolters told <i>Scrip</i>, on the sidelines of BIO-Europe conference in Munich, Germany.</p><p>"The downside of success is that you have to invest a lot of money in large, late stage studies and marketing activities. So we have to be focused."</p><p>He said Bayer is working together with biotech companies "which we very often meet at conferences like BIO-Europe," but that "identifying academic partners is a little more difficult as there are just so many universities out there and so many research groups." However, recently Bayer did sign a significant academic partnership with the Wilmer Eye Institute, at Johns Hopkins.</p><p>Bayer is bulking out its ophthalmology development pipeline following the strong success of <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept). "Our entry into ophthalmology is a brilliant example of thinking across the borders and leaving the corporate mainstream," Wolters said. "We had an offer from Regeneron about 10 years ago when we were not active in ophthalmology. But we have since recognized the commercial opportunity and medical need, so we were able to realize this opportunity with Regeneron."</p><p>Eylea turned out to be a big success story: sales of the drug are expected to reach $4.1bn worldwide by 2017, according to forecasts from Sagient Research'sÂ <a href="http://#http://www.biomedtracker.com/" target="_new">BioMedTracker</a>.</p><p>"When you have such a successful front runner, it is wise to then move up the pipeline; so this is what we are doing and we have some early stage projects in this area," Wolter's said.</p><p>He added that when investing at an early stage, where clearly there are more opportunities available, the tricky part is finding the best one. Once this is identified though "we are not alone," Wolters said. "We have our competitors who identify the same opportunities as the best ones and we have to manage that situation."</p><p>Geographically, opportunities are everywhere, he added. "We are a global company and all regions are important. From a licensing perspective I do not care where the opportunity comes from. If it is the best opportunity, it doesn't matter if it comes from China, the US or Australia or somewhere else."</p><p>As for in-licensing new technology as opposed to in-house research, Wolters said, "It's complementary. We have a significant number of researchers doing high quality science, but you can never have all the innovation in-house, especially looking into recent developments in science where very often it is early days, so high risk. Everyone realizes it would not make sense to internalize every scientific finding.
