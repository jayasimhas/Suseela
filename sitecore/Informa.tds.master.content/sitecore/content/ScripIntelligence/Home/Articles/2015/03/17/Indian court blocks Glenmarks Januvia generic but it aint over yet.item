<p>An Indian court has granted an interim injunction against Glenmark in the high profile case concerning the patent infringement of Merck & Co's diabetes therapies Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride).</p><p>The order would mean that Glenmark can no longer sell, distribute or in "any manner take any steps towards placing" on the Indian market its cut-price generic versions, Zita and Zitamet, though products already available with distributors /retailers stand unaffected. </p><p>The main patent infringement suit between the two firms, though, is yet ongoing. </p><p>The Delhi High Court, on 20 March, however, held that <i>prima facie</i> infringement of Merck's patent had been established and granted an interim injunction against Glenmark.</p><p>The court, however, asked MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside of the US and Canada) to furnish an affidavit undertaking in the pending suit, that in the event of it being dismissed, the US firm would compensate Glenmark for the "damage or loss caused, including but not limited to loss of earnings". </p><p>"The affidavit shall be filed in two weeks," Judges S Ravindra Bhat and Najmi Waziri said in an 81-page order.</p><p>The court also asked Glenmark to furnish an undertaking to comply with the injunction within two weeks, while also filing a detailed account of its earnings (including gross turnover figures) from the products, from the date of the filing of the present suit. Analysts estimate that the products account for about 2.5% of the Indian firm's domestic sales.</p><p>"The account shall be accompanied by an affidavit of one of its board of directors authorized directors, which shall also undertake to pay such damages, if any, which may be decided by the court if the ultimate result of the suit is a decree in favour of the plaintiff MSD. The statement of account shall be accompanied by the certificate of a chartered accountant verifying its genuineness," the order said.</p><p>The win comes as a significant relief for MSD which has warded off several other Indian generic challengers along the way, including the relatively less known, Gujarat-based Olcare Laboratories <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/MSD-wards-off-another-Januvia-challenger-in-India-352267%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 12 June 2014)</a>. Mediation efforts between MSD and Glenmark had earlier failed to yield any positive outcome <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Merck-Glenmark-Januvia-mediation-efforts-flop-355571%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 11 December 2014</a>). </p><p><p>MSD said that it was pleased with the injunction granted by the Delhi High Court against Glenmark for "patent violation" of Januvia and Janumet. </p><p>"We believe our patents for Januvia and Janumet are valid and enforceable and will continue to defend them," MSD said.</p><p>Glenmark said that it was seeking legal advice on the next steps and will take "appropriate action".</p><p>A single judge bench of the Delhi High Court last year refused to grant an injunction against Glenmark in the case <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/MSD-takes-Glenmark-to-court-over-sitagliptin-infringement-341704%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 April 2013)</a>. MSD had moved court against Glenmark after it launched cut-price versions of Januvia and Janumet, which the Indian firm claimed were "non-infringing".</p><h2>Case details</h2><p>In a string of observations, the court said that a case for the infringement by Glenmark &ndash; through its product Zita &ndash; is "established" since it uses the sitagliptin free base as the active component in its chemical formulation. </p><p>"An argument was advanced by Glenmark during the course of oral hearings that this is not the case since Zita uses SPM [sitagliptin as a phosphate monohydrate salt], which is manufactured directly without using the sitagliptin free base. The court is unimpressed with this submission &ndash; not only was no evidence or document adduced to support this plea, but moreover, the written submission and counter-claim do not in any meaningful manner disclose such a case," the judges noted.</p><p>It further said that Zita &ndash; by account of all documents "canvassed" before the court &ndash; uses the sitagliptin free base as the active component. </p><p>"Glenmark's explanation that it uses a different process to produce the infringing article is facially unconvincing. It appears to this court that the production of sitagliptin phosphate would precede use of MSD's patented article, which entails infringement," it added.</p><h2>Opposition</h2><p>Glenmark previously opposed MSD's "suit patent" claiming, among others, that it was obvious and lacked an inventive step over previous disclosures in the prior art and also industrial applicability because the sitagliptin free base is itself unstable. </p><p>The suit patent is essentially the sitagliptin Indian Patent No 209816 and has 20 claims, of which sitagliptin is covered in 13 claims. </p><p>Glenmark argued that SPM is qualitatively different from the sitagliptin free base &ndash; it has enhanced pharmaceutical qualities, which according to it means that the manufacture of SPM does not violate a patent for the sitagliptin free base "simpliciter". </p><p>Glenmark also underscored that SPM is not covered by the suit patent, and is qualitatively different from the sitagliptin free base. It also emphasised the abandonment of a subsequent patent application in India (5948/DELNP/2005) by MSD where SPM was claimed as a novel addition to the suit patent <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/How-Glenmark-knocked-Merck-flat-in-a-3-D-world-341949%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 9 April 2013)</a>. </p><p>The Indian firm also said that the claim goes much beyond the limited disclosures in the specification, and is thus "overbroad".</p>
