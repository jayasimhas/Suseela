<p>There appears to be no respite yet, for GVK Biosciences, the Indian contract research organization in the eye of a storm over allegations of data manipulation by European regulators. </p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 22 May said that it was sticking with its previous recommendation to suspend a number of drugs for which authorization in the EU was primarily based on clinical studies conducted at GVK's Hyderabad unit. </p><p>The French medicines agency ANSM had previously raised concerns about the reliability of studies conducted at the Hyderabad site between 2008 and 2014.</p><p>The EMA's reaffirmation follows requests for re-examination by marketing authorisation (MA) holders for seven of the medicines concerned. About half a dozen such MA holders are believed to have sought a review of the EMA's initial recommendation. </p><p>The re-examination saw the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) conclude that concerns about reliability of the clinical studies remain. It therefore maintained its recommendation of January 2015 to suspend medicines for which no supporting data from other studies were available. One drug, Bivolet (nebivolol) 5mg tablets, included in the review for which concerns about studies were addressed is, however, no longer recommended for suspension, the agency said. </p><p>"As a result of the CHMP&rsquo;s January 2015 opinion and the re-examination, around 700 pharmaceutical forms and strengths of medicines studied at the Hyderabad site remain recommended for suspension," the EMA said.</p><p>The ANSM inspection had earlier suggested data manipulations of electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the conduct of some studies of generic medicines, which appeared to have taken place over a period of at least five years. </p><p>The CHMP had earlier looked at more than 1,000 pharmaceutical forms and strengths of generic medicines for which clinical studies had been done by GVK. While it cleared around 300 as having sufficient supporting data from other sources, it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hundreds-of-generics-face-European-ban-following-GVK-breaches-356345" target="_new">recommended the suspension</a> of all of the others, unless they are of critical importance for patients because alternatives will not be able to meet patients' needs. </p><p>A decision on whether a drug is critical for patients will rest with the concerned national authorities of EU member states and for such critical medicines companies are given 12 months to submit additional data. </p><p>The CHMP, though, noted that there is no evidence of "harm or lack of effectiveness" linked to the conduct of studies by GVK at Hyderabad. </p><p>The CHMP's recommendation will be sent to the European Commission for a legally binding decision, applicable to all member states irrespective of whether or not they have taken interim measures to suspend medicines. Members states such as Germany, France and Belgium had <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Germany-suspends-80-products-linked-to-Indian-CRO-problems-355527%5d" target="_new">earlier suspended</a> products. </p><h2>GVK Bio</h2><p>GVK, though, isn't giving up yet and continues to make concerted efforts to set things right.</p><p>GVK, which has all along claimed that its processes were rigorous and the actions of European agencies "unprecedented and highly disproportional", told <i>Scrip</i> that it has been independently working with the EU authorities and the Government of India and will continue to do so to "try and resolve the issue".</p><p>"The EMA was going through a procedure that was challenged by the marketing authorization holders. GVK BIO was not involved in this process," it added.</p><p>India had earlier indicated that it was ready to consider &ldquo;commercial and legal" <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/India-questions-EU-data-integrity-charge-against-GVK-Bio-357668%5d" target="_new">action against the EU</a>, the latter involving hauling the EU to the World Trade Organization, should efforts to resolve the matter fail. A senior government official was then reported as saying that the grounds of suspecting GVK's studies were &ldquo;absolutely flimsy.&rdquo; </p><p>GVK's CEO Manni Kantipudi, had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that while the firm respected the regulator&rsquo;s views, it was important to consider that the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-CRO-segment-in-throes-of-a-shakeout-356762%5d" target="_new">check-out ECGs had no bearing</a> on the study outcome or the bio-equivalence of the drugs being tested (as stated by ANSM ) and that there was &ldquo;never any question&rdquo; about the safety or efficacy of the drugs. </p>
