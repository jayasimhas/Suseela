<p>Shares in Sanofi rose by more than 2% on 5 February as it reported its full-year results showing a 2.5% increase to &euro;33.78bn in annual sales on a reported basis, and reassured analysts that its quest for a new CEO to replace the ousted Chris Viehbacher would be over this quarter. </p><p>The last three months of 2014 saw a 7.3% rise in sales to &euro;9,072 million, which includes a positive effect of 2.7 percentage points from favorable exchange rate fluctuations, mainly reflecting the dollar's strength. However, for the full year, the strength of the euro versus other currencies, particularly the yen, ruble and Brazilian real and Argentine peso, had an unfavourable effect of 2.4 percentage points on sales growth. </p><p>There was reassurance for Sanofi's diabetes division, subject of much scrutiny particularly in the US as its poor performance there was cited as a factor in Viehbacher's departure. Diabetes sales rose by 11% in the fourth quarter to &euro;2,024 million &ndash; Sanofi said this was driven by double-digit growth of Lantus including in the US, where putting up the price in early November seems to have helped revenues. Lantus fourth-quarter sales were up 11.3% to &euro;228m in Western Europe driven by Germany, France and Italy, it added.</p><p>Overall, sales in Sanofi's growth platforms increased by 10.7% (at CER) to &euro;25.8bn for the year, and accounted for 76.4% of total consolidated sales compared with 72.5% in 2013. In addition to the 11% Q4 rise in diabetes sales, vaccines were up by 16.2% to &euro;1.2bn, Genzyme sales increased by 22.2% to &euro;746m, and animal health by 11.5% to &euro;507m in the quarter. </p><p>Earnings per share for the year reached &euro;5.20 up by 3% (7.3% at CER). For the quarter they were &euro;1.39 (+1.5%), coming in ahead of analyst expectations.</p><p>For 2015, Sanofi said EPS was expected to be stable to slightly growing versus 2014 at constant average exchange rates, barring major unforeseen adverse events.</p><p>
