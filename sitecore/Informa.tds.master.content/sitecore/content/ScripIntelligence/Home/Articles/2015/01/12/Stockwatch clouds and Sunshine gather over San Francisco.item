<p>The annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco is usually associated with a wave of pre-announcements and data releases on first morning before the meeting. This year, the pre-announcements and events started to be announced in the week before the meeting.</p><p><p>Eli Lilly kicked off the cloudy pre-announcements when it released its 2015 earnings guidance, which was below analysts' consensus estimates (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-slips-on-outlook-355986" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 January 2015</a>). The sell-side analysts were generally supportive of the company and the analysts from Jefferies even upgraded the stock to a buy on the basis that at least Lilly had "clarified" its low expectations for this year. Perhaps less supportive were the analysts from JP Morgan and Cowen who pointed out that higher costs would drive down gross margins this year. However, this is only a matter of perspective since the easiest way to increase gross margins is to increase sales. Another early cloud was insulin pump company Insulet's pre-announced earnings for the fourth quarter 2014 which dragged its share price down by about 10% on a day when virtually every other stock price was moving in the opposite direction. Like Jefferies' commentary on Lilly, the analysts from JP Morgan suggested that Insulet's new CEO was "cleaning house". Other companies bringing sunshine rather than clouds to San Francisco last week included the positive fourth quarter earnings announcements from Nanostring and WuXi PharmaTech.</p><p><p>But the first real shocker of the run-up to this year's JP Morgan conference was Alexion's announcement that its lead drug Soliris (eculizumab) had failed a Phase II study in the prevention of antibody-mediated rejection of living-donor kidney transplants. The surprise was not that Alexion had failed to squeeze another indication out of Soliris, but that Alexion's share price only finished down about 2% on the day of the announcement. Indeed, the Alexion share price managed to finish the week just above where it had started despite the additional spectre raised by some analysts of the impact of the strong dollar on Alexion's earnings for 2015.</p><p><p>Alexion's share price shrug-off of a rare clinical trial failure must have spurred other companies to get their clouds out of the way before the week was over as Biogen Idec announced the results of its Phase II RENEW study of its anti-LINGO-1 monoclonal antibody (BIIB033) in acute optic neuritis patients (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Biogens-highly-anticipated-anti-LINGO-data-fall-flat-356028" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 9 January 2015</a>). Despite a rearguard by its sell-side analysts who pointed out "encouraging trends" in the data especially in a modified per protocol analysis (which the FDA will usually ignore), and the analysts from JP Morgan who described the RENEW study as a "A pretty good first step", BIIB033 failed to show a significant difference over placebo in the primary and secondary endpoints of the study. Biogen itself described the study as "positive" but at least the analysts from Piper Jaffray were starting to discern the opposite of this adjective in Biogen's announcements (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Biogens-belligerent-repetition-355489" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 December 2014</a>). Investors were also unconvinced and the Biogen share price finished down about 0.5% on a day when the NASDAQ Biotech Index finished flat.</p><p><p>By the end of last week, the totality of the manufactured hype surrounding the imminent gathering in San Francisco (and the associated fundraisings that are destined to follow it) was building in order to blow away any possible clouds in the way of the sun. That was before GW Pharmaceuticals announced the failure of its first Phase III study of Sativex (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) in cancer pain (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Surprise-Phase-III-failure-of-GWOtsukas-Sativex-in-cancer-pain-356019" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 January 2015</a>). Investors in the UK are used to this type of news from GW since it was listed here for many years before its NASDAQ IPO in 2013 and has remained in obscurity amid a string of clinical and regulatory disappointments, and tiny sales of Sativex. Whilst UK investors would be familiar with Sativex's latest, but almost certainly not last Phase III failure, as well as NICE's recent rejection of the product in multiple sclerosis patients (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Bayer-urges-rebellion-against-NICE-no-for-Sativex-354382" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 09 October 2014</a>), they would find the 11% share price rise on the day of the announcement, after the stock opened down over 7%, perplexing. However, those of us who are longer in the tooth recognise the effects of positive sell-side coverage crafted for the next secondary offering, which ignores GW's clinical and commercial failures and promotes the very risky 'jam tomorrow' proposition for GW's product Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for indications like epilepsy. The clinical data for Epidiolex to date has been derived from investigator-sponsored single-arm studies in small numbers of patients (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Tiny-sales-belie-big-valuations-353326" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 11 August 2014</a>), and are therefore only useful as supporting data in a new drug application. Nevertheless, as the cashier of the Graceland gift shop stated when interviewed this week, there are still daily visitors to 3734 Elvis Presley Boulevard who spend $2,000 or more there. By the same token there are still, in the US at least, investors in GW Pharma who act in the same way, probably quite a few of whom are born every minute.</p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include Insulet, Nanostring and Biogen Idec.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies.
