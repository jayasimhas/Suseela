<p>Industry is probably headed towards the ''golden era'' in regenerative medicine/stemcell-based therapies, with the segment achieving critical mass, and clarity emerging on regulatory pathways and pivotal data readouts anticipated, finds a report by MP Advisors, an Indian strategic business advisory firm. </p><p>And yes, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are also expected to shore up both growth and valuations. </p><p>The report notes that more than 2,500 trials involving stem cell-based therapies have begun over the past decade and over 50% of these trials are in Phase II and III. </p><p>''Even if one uses a conservative overall 1&ndash;2% success rate, the number of approved cell therapies 5&ndash;10 years from now could be well over a 100,'' author Dr Subita Srimal said. MP Advisors gave <i>Scrip</i> exclusive access to the report dated 23 January. </p><p>Juventas Therapeutics, whose investors include Takeda, recently said that its lead candidate JVS-100, a regenerative therapy for critical limb ischemia, met its Phase II primary endpoints for safety and had shown some hints of efficacy <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Juventas-regenerative-ischemia-therapy-moves-forward-355144%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 November 2014)</a>. </p><p>While stem cell technologies are expected to begin to break through by 2017, wound healing is expected to be the first off the block in terms of near-term therapeutic opportunity, the report said. </p><p>It also outlines a five to seven-year horizon for regenerative therapies for treating diabetes, cardiovascular and ischemic-related diseases with autologous and allogeneic stem cell-based technologies. Neurodegenerative diseases are predicted to be the ''greatest'' longer-term opportunity in regenerative medicine and major breakthroughs were likely within the next decade. </p><p>Licensing and M&A are expected to propel the segment and Dr Srimal told <i>Scrip</i> that while there were several players in the regenerative medicines segment, especially the small firms, almost all big pharma companies had made small investments. </p><p>Current deal sizes in the segment appear to be in the range of $320-500m and MP Advisors sees a step up in potential deal-making by large firms in 2016-18.</p><p>'' [Large firms] are likely to adopt the acquisition pathway due to the inherent risk associated with the commercial success of adopting new technology platforms and products. Teva has already partnered with Mesoblast &ndash; the only company whose valuation is in the billion range &ndash; and Gamida. Many of the technologies have originated from Israel so [Teva] may emerge as an important player,'' Dr Srimal told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Last year, Novartis invested in the stem cell therapy developer Gamida Cell in exchange for a 15% stake of the Israeli firm and an option to acquire the company <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-takes-a-15-stake-in-stem-cell-developer-and-an-option-to-buy-353463%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 19 August 2014)</a>. </p><p>In 2013, Osiris Therapeutics sealed a deal with Mesoblast which could see it receive up to $100m for stem cell technology that includes Prochymal (remestemecel-L), which is conditionally approved in some markets for the treatment of children with acute-graft-versus host disease (GvHD) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Osiris-offloads-Prochymal-to-Mesoblast-347273%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 11 October 2013)</a>. Sanofi, which inherited ex-US rights to Prochymal when it acquired Genzyme, handed the product back in 2012.</p><p>But the segment has had its share of disappointments too. Shire earlier firmed up a deal with the regenerative medicine company Organogenesis for its loss-making skin substitute product Dermagraft <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Desperate-measures-Shire-sells-Dermagraft-for-nothing-up-front-349420%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 January 2014)</a>. The product was the main reason for Shire's $750m acquisition of Advanced BioHealing in 2011. </p><p>Shire, which has been "prioritizing investments that are of the greatest strategic, clinical and commercial value'' then said that Dermagraft, approved for non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, no longer met these criteria and the divestment would allow it to focus resources on other projects.</p><p>Dr Srimal acknowledged the inherent risks in the segment. For instance, in the wound healing segment, the market for launched products or even future ones, she said, were difficult to assess as ''none had made a dent yet'' due to their high cost as well as reimbursement issues.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> has previously noted that the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced certain changes to the Outpatient Prospective Payment System for 2014 that bundled payment of the graft and the procedure together at a cost to around half of the combined cost of the graft and physician fee as previously permitted by Medicare. It was expected to hurt Dermagraft's profitability significantly, analysts said at the time of the Shire deal.</p><p>Dr Srimal also added that cheaper products and progress made with new materials in wound healing, aggressive marketing by big players in the field were typically the hurdles faced by the small innovator companies.</p><h2>regulatory pathway</h2><p>But the regulatory pathway and environment in the regenerative medicines space appear to be improving with Asia and Japan, in particular, leading the charge. </p><p>Last year, Japan formally enacted new legislation governing the development, approval and use of regenerative medicines, including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The new laws provide a legal framework designed to encourage the development of novel regenerative therapies and to speed up product approvals in the sector<i>, Scrip's</i> sister publication PharmAsia News reported last month (Japan Regenerative Medicine Laws Take Effect, Encourage Industry -PharmAsia News Dec 9, 2014).</p><p>Dr Srimal noted that Japanese, Korean and Indian firms had made investments in regenerative medicines. ''Fujifilm has a majority stake in J-TEC Japan while Medipost Korea is increasing its global footprint besides its alliance with India's Alkem for its marketed product for knee/cartilage repair, Cartistem,'' she said. In 2013, Medipost signed a licensing deal with Alkem for its cartilage regeneration stem cell treatment, Cartistem, the first stem cell treatment drug developed in Korea to progress into India.</p><p>The Australian firm Regeneus is reported to be targeting Japan for PRG, its allogeneic off-the-shelf cell therapy for knee osteoarthritis, while Mesoblast expects to seek expedited conditional approvals in Japan for its cell therapy candidates, including allogeneic cell therapy products manufactured to GMP standards outside Japan.</p>
