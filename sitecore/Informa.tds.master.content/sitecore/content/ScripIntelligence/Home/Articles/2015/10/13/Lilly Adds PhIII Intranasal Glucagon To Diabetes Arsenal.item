<p>Eli Lilly & Co has acquired the worldwide rights to Locemia Solutions' Phase III intranasal glucagon product for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia &ndash; which it hopes will be the first needle-free option to gain approval for this indication. </p><p>Locemia's drug, AMG504-1, uses a glucagon nasal powder formulation that is delivered in an emergency situation using a single-use, ready-to-use device. According to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, AMG504-1 is the only intranasal option for hypoglycemia currently in clinical development. </p><p>Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. </p><p>Lilly's newly acquired product is clinically a strong investment, with positive data thus far; however the market for intranasal glucagon isn't expected to be a highly lucrative one because the treatment is usually only used when hypoglycemia is very severe and most diabetes patients do not experience this frequently. </p><p>That being said, Lilly might have a wider audience in mind for this product. Locemia's chair Robert Oringer said in a statement that under Lilly's leadership, "a less complex approach to glucagon delivery could have a broad impact beyond just rescue treatment for insulin users".</p><p>Currently, rapid treatment of severe hypoglycemia is dependent on emergency medical services or on caregivers using a glucagon kit that involves reconstituting the medicine prior to injection. Lilly's new product, which in clinical studies has been "as effective" as traditionally injected glucagon, could provide an easier to use treatment in an area that has little advancement in the last two decades. </p><p>Locemia is a privately held, specialty pharmaceutical company located in Montreal, Canada. AMG504-1 is its only product currently in the clinic. </p><p>
