<p>Former White House policy adviser Ezekiel Emanuel, who is now the vice provost and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, famously wrote last year that he plans to stop all health care efforts to prolong his life once he reaches 75, contending the "manic desperation to endlessly extend life is misguided and potentially destructive."</p><p>Emanuel, a strong critic of high drug prices, often laments the billions the US spends on health care, especially for expensive cancer treatments that only add a few months to the life of a dying patient, while bankrupting the family savings and increasing the nation's cost burden.</p><p>Lori Reilly, executive vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), however, begs to differ &ndash; arguing that while "death is cheap," extending the life of a patient through the use of medications "still is worth it," even if it adds costs to the health care system.</p><p>Reilly insisted too much attention is being focused on the costs of drugs, without weighing the value to life those medicines bring.</p><p>"If we want to move towards a value-based health care system, then we should pay for medicines based on the value they provide," she told a group of reporters at an Oct. 30 briefing at PhRMA's headquarters in Washington.</p><p>PhRMA has stepped up its efforts to defend the costs of prescription medications in light of the heightened criticism over high drug prices, like for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-Repatha-Praluent-Deals-What-It-Means-360850" target="_new">newly approved</a> proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Its-the-volume-stupid-350860" target="_new">hepatitis C virus agents</a>, and older drugs like Turing Pharmaceuticals AG's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">Daraprim</a> (pyrimethamine) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) and Isuprel (isoprenaline)</a> &ndash; although the lobbying group has distanced itself from the latter two companies.</p><p>The topic has now become a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Prices-Now-A-Bipartisan-Campaign-Prop-361127" target="_new">bipartisan prop</a> for politicians vying for the White House &ndash; with two of those candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) declaring they were proud to count the biopharmaceutical industry among their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Clinton-Sanders-Proud-Pharmas-An-Enemy-361031" target="_new">greatest enemies</a>. </p><p>But Reilly argued that if there's going to be a debate about costs, it should include those for all health care products and services &ndash; not just biopharmaceuticals.</p><p>She asserted that drug makers are not any more secretive about how they price their products than others in the health care sector.</p><p>Reilly also contended that too much transparency about what purchasers pay for medicines can "actually raise costs."</p><p>"There's an element of having so much transparency that it ends up stifling competition, as opposed to encouraging competition, because if everyone knows you sold to someone, the likelihood is it doesn't drive prices down, it could increase prices," she said.</p><p>But Reilly insisted there are several areas where the prices for medicines are transparent &ndash; pointing to the Medicaid average sales prices and the listed costs of drugs under the Medicare Part D program.</p><p>"If the question is are we going to be transparent about how we price," Reilly said, "the price is set in a marketplace where there is negotiation, where a payer is saying, 'Prove your value to us.'"</p><p>She also argued there are several groups conducting analysis about the value of medicines, like the Boston-based nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, among others, whose information is in the public domain.</p><p>"I actually think there's a lot of discussion about how we get towards value when it comes to pharmaceuticals, in terms of what is the impact of the medicine in keeping patients out of the hospital, what's the quality of life impact, are you reducing other health care costs, are you curing disease," Reilly told reporters.</p><p>But she noted "there's a lots of different elements," and "for every medicine it's going to be slightly different."</p><p>"At large, I think our health care system, as a whole, is moving towards a place where we are really holding costs down and pushing the line on costs," Reilly said.</p><p>She noted that drug makers are increasingly being asked to justify their prices if they want their medicines to be placed on payer formularies.</p><p>"We saw that most recently with the PCSK9s," Reilly said, pointing out that Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company in the US, decided to put both newly approved drugs in the class &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab), marketed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">Repatha</a> (evolocumab), fromAmgen Inc. &ndash; on its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-Repatha-Praluent-Deals-What-It-Means-360850" target="_new">national preferred formulary</a>.</p><p>Reilly contended that consumers care more about what they will end up paying for their medicines rather than the actual prices.</p><p>She also criticized PBMs for not making transparent how they determine which drugs they place onto certain formulary "tiers" &ndash; the designation for how much the payer will cover versus the amount the patient will bear in copays or deductibles.</p><p>Reilly also condemned insurers for not making public the decision-making process of so-called clinical pathways, in which certain treatment options are preferred over others, with physicians often given a financial incentive to prescribe certain drugs.</p><p>With members of Congress demanding to know how drug companies price their medicines, Reilly said too much of that debate has been focused on what firms have spent on bringing their products to the marketplace.</p><p>"The reality is, we are a business that spends money to research and develop medicines, most of which aren't successful," she said, pointing out that a company may spend 30 years on Alzheimer's R&D without a product on the market to show for it, or they've produced two successful diabetes drugs, with 12 failures.</p><p>"We don't have a model to bring new medicines to market if you don't permit companies to recoup not just what it takes to bring a medicine to market but also the ones that don't make it," Reilly argued.</p><p>But, she said, "You learn a lot from many of those failures. It's not as if that's all bad information. There's information companies learn to move on to the next one."</p><p>So, Reilly said, there's really no clear way to calculate exactly how much it took to bring a particular product to the market when some of that development may have depended on a predecessor medicine that failed, but whose data and experience were helpful to the latter drug.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CMS-Finalizes-Controversial-Biosimilars-Payment-Rule-361325" target="_new">CMS Finalizes Controversial Biosimilars Payment Rule</a></p><p>Ignoring the objections by several lawmakers and various lobbying groups, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services late last week finalized a rule it proposed in July that would lump biosimilars referenced on the same innovator into the same Medicare Part B reimbursement rate.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-Inversion-Prickly-Politics-For-Pharma-361300" target="_new">Pfizer Inversion: Prickly Politics For Pharma</a></p><p>Certainly, Pfizer Inc. knew what it was doing when it decided to consider another possible merger under a tax inversion scheme in the midst of the high-stakes political battle ongoing in the US &ndash; bringing with such a move more condemnation of the entire biopharmaceutical industry, which already is under fire for certain firms' drug pricing practices and some shady looking relationships with specialty pharmacies.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Whats-Pharma-Need-To-Get-On-Board-With-Biodefense-361299" target="_new">What's Pharma Need To Get On Board With Biodefense?</a></p><p>While the Biomedical Advance Research and Development Authority has provided millions of dollars to biopharmaceutical firms to help speed the development of medicines and vaccines against diseases like anthrax, Ebola and other threats, there remains no consistent mechanism for incentivizing manufacturers to join, or even stay in, the biodefense space, in which companies often don't know what the end game will be &ndash; in other words, who will buy their products? Some have suggested Congress needs to create an FDA priority review voucher program for biodefense products like the ones used for neglected tropical and rare pediatric diseases.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Wins-Broader-Use-New-Market-For-Yervoy-361281" target="_new">BMS Wins Broader Use, New Adjuvant Market For Yervoy</a></p><p>Bristol Myers Squibb Co. on Oct. 28 won the FDA's approval to expand the use of Yervoy (ipilimumab) as an adjuvant treatment for patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes of more than 1mm who have undergone complete resection including total lymphadenectomy. Yervoy is the first and only FDA-approved immune checkpoint inhibitor in the adjuvant treatment for fully resected stage III melanoma.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Imlygic-1st-FDA-Approved-Oncolytic-Virus-Therapy-361265" target="_new">Amgen's Imlygic 1st FDA-Approved Oncolytic Virus Therapy</a></p><p>Amgen Inc. made history on Oct. 27 by gaining the FDA's approval for the first oncolytic virus therapy &ndash; Imlygic (talimogene laherparepvec), which is indicated as a local treatment of unresectable cutaneous, subcutaneous and nodal lesions in patients with melanoma recurrent after initial surgery.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PfizerHospira-Epogen-Biosimilar-Rejected-Relief-For-Amgen-361258" target="_new">Pfizer/Hospira Epogen Biosimilar Rejected; Relief For Amgen</a></p><p>Pfizer Inc. sneaked the news into its quarterly earnings call on Oct. 27 that its newly acquired subsidiary Hospira Inc. had received a complete response letter on Oct. 16 from the FDA for the firm's epoetin alfa biosimilar &ndash; a product Amgen Inc. has been working desperately through the US court system to keep off the market for a little while longer.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">Well-Rehearsed Valeant Call Unlikely To Stop Deeper Probes</a></p><p>After days of providing few answers to a lot of unanswered questions, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. finally explained itself on Oct. 26 in a well-rehearsed morning conference call, which had Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat gushing about how well the firm had handled itself after being slow out of the gate. But not all was clear, and likely, prosecutors and Washington lawmakers &ndash; who already are engaged in probing Valeant for its pricing practices &ndash; and state regulators and others trying to unravel the knotty tale of the company's relationships with specialty pharmacies will not be completely satisfied by the drug firm's explanations.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
