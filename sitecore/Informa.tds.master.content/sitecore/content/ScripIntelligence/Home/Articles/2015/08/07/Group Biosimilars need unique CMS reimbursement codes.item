<p>Even though there may be several biosimilars that reference the same innovator drug, they should not be lumped into the same Medicare Part B reimbursement rate, a lobbying group is contending, in opposing a new rule proposed by the Obama administration.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) said it plans to use a single average sales price (ASP) payment limit for biosimilars that are assigned to a specific healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS) code &ndash; often referred to as J codes for drugs.</p><p>"In general, this means that products that rely on a common reference product&rsquo;s biologics license application will be grouped into the same payment calculation," CMS said in a Federal Register notice, which officially publishes on 15 July, but was posted online early for public inspection.</p><p>"The biosimilars statute and its legislative history make clear that each biosimilar product &ndash; including multiple biosimilar products associated with the same originally marketed product &ndash; should be assigned a unique HCPCS code," asserted Michael Werner, policy adviser to the Biosimilars Forum, a nonprofit group representing manufacturers in that space. "This is crucial toward establishing and maintaining a vibrant biosimilars market in the US."</p><p>Mr Werner insisted lawmakers recognized that when they gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars &ndash; a power granted under the Affordable Care Act &ndash; they knew the drugs were very different from small-molecule generics, and therefore, the medicines "should not be treated that way in policy making." </p><p>"Issuing unique HCPCS codes is essential to avoid confusion among healthcare professionals, to ensure that the proper products are dispensed to patients, and to allow a fair and predictable reimbursement to purchasers of biosimilars," Mr Werner argued.</p><p>CMS' proposal, he said, "would lead to confusion in each of these areas."</p><p>In addition, Mr Werner said, such a policy could materially reduce investment in development of biosimilars, thereby reducing treatment options available to patients. </p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum noted the proposal would largely affect biosimilars of Amgen's Epogen (epoetin alfa), Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Neupogen (filgrastim) &ndash; the latter of which was the reference for the very first US approval of a biosimilar, Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), which won the FDA's blessing on 6 March.</p><p>Dr Schoenebaum emphasized that the impact of the CMS rule is unclear.</p><p>But in theory, he said, it could create an arbitrage for the first six months of a biosimilar being on the US market. </p><p>He noted that ASP lags by about six months, and between initial approval and the creation of an ASP, Medicare reimburses at 106% of wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), which is before discounts. </p><p>Therefore, Dr Schoenebaum "this could create a situation where for the first six months of a biosimilar launch, a biosimilar manufacturer can give physicians discounts from WAC to purchase the product, yet Medicare will reimburse the physician at a higher price, thus incentivizing the physician to use the biosimilar." </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
