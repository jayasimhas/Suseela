<p>Which is a bigger sign of a biotech bubble: NantKwest launching an initial public offering as the highest-value development-stage company to ever go public in the US or vTv Therapeutics raising more than $100m in an IPO to support another Alzheimer's drug candidate that was rejected by big pharma?</p><p>Bubble speculation continues in the US as biotech IPOs continue at eye-popping prices, but there still are many companies that have trouble going public at a high share value. EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, for instance, launched an offering on 30 July that grossed just $10m from the sale of 1.2m shares at $8.50 each. </p><p>Despite a recently announced partnership with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, EyeGate was unable to command a previously anticipated $15 IPO price. Waltham, Massachusetts-based <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-invests-in-EyeGate-uveitis-drug-359385" target="_new">EyeGate</a>'s stock closed at $13.80 when the company launched an IPO to move from the Over-the-Counter Board to the Nasdaq index, but shares fell 48.2% the next day to $7.15 on 31 July.</p><p><b>Big performers</b></p><p>Cardiff, California-based NantKwest (formerly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Ten-deals-and-a-breakup-GileadOno-VernalisNovartis-SorrentoNantWorks-and-more-355774" target="_new">Conkwest</a>) grossed $207.2m on 27 July from the sale of almost 8.3m shares priced at $25 each and closed as high as $34.99 on 29 July, but ended the week at $30.60. The company is developing therapies that redirect natural killer (NK) cells to attack cancer cells. </p><p>NantKwest investors are putting their faith in CEO Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire biotech entrepreneur and investor who sold APP Pharmaceuticals to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Fresenius-Kabi-to-buy-APP-1335" target="_new">Fresenius in 2008 for $5.6bn</a>, although he may be better known for the sale of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-to-acquire-Abraxis-Bioscience-for-2.9-billion-up-front-298709" target="_new">Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel) developer</a>Abraxis BioScience to Celgene for $2.9bn in 2010. His profits from the deals are now being <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CALBIO-2013-Success-Redefined-by-Abraxis-founder-biotech-innovator-Patrick-Soon-Shiong-344053" target="_new">invested in a variety of digital health and cancer-related companies</a>. </p><p>At almost half the size of NantKwest's IPO, but with a still-impressive offering, vTv Therapeutics grossed $117.2m from the sale of 7.8m shares at $15 each. The High Point, North Carolina-based company has two diabetes drugs in Phase II, but its lead drug candidate is the Phase III Alzheimer's drug azeliragon, a small molecule antagonist of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE).</p><p>Azeliragon was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Pfizer-and-Transtech-in-155-million-Alzheimers-deal-66328" target="_new">licensed to Pfizer</a> in 2006 and vTv (formerly Transtech) collected $169.2m in upfront and milestone fees from the big pharma before Pfizer returned the asset in 2011.</p><p>The vTv IPO follows a $315m offering from Axovant Sciences, which paid $5m to license its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-bubbles-as-money-pours-in-358929" target="_new">mid-stage Alzheimer's drug RVT-101 from GlaxoSmithKline</a>. Axovant's offering was the year's biggest biotech IPO in terms of money raised. NantKwest raised less money, but it has a larger post-IPO market value based on prior investments in the company.</p><p>The IPO-tracking firm Renaissance Capital suggested in a 31 July report about new offerings in July that investor interest in Alzheimer's therapies may be waning, since vTv "fell 27% on its debut, giving it the worst first-day return for a 2015 IPO. The last biotech to target Alzheimer's disease, Axovant Sciences, spiked 99% on its first day, but now trades 6% below its offer price."</p><p>Neos Therapeutics priced its IPO a week before the vTv offering and grossed $72m from its sale of 4.8m shares at $15 each. The Texas-based company is developing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Former-Sanofi-CEO-Viehbacher-joins-PureTech-board-three-venture-financings-four-deals-and-a-dropped-drug-356996" target="_new">extended-release formulations</a> of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medicines. Neos closed at $19.54 on its first day of trading and the company ended July at $20.01.</p><p><b>Preparing for launch</b></p><p>With the NantKwest, vTv, EyeGate and Neos offerings, six drug developers launched IPOs in July versus 10 in June. The total for the year is 35 after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-A-US-biotech-IPO-surge-Data-are-mixed-359219" target="_new">29 companies raised $2.8bn</a> during the first half of 2015.</p><p>Since <i>Scrip</i>'s <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Biotech-gearing-up-for-a-big-July-359517" target="_new">last IPO update</a> on 18 July, no additional therapeutics companies have filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to register for new IPOs. However, four additional companies set preliminary price ranges for forthcoming offerings:</p><p>*Sickle cell drug developer Global Blood Therapeutics in South San Francisco wants to raise up to $108m from the sale of 6m shares priced at $16 to $18 each. The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-venture-capital-off-to-a-659m-start-in-2015-355964" target="_new">raised $48m</a> in venture capital at the beginning of 2015.</p><p>*Benitec Biopharma of Balmain, Australia could raise $65.3m from the sale of 5m American Depository Shares (ADSs) at $13.06 each to fund development of its technology platform that combines <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strong-investor-interest-eases-fundraising-at-two-Australian-ventures-315854" target="_new">gene silencing and gene therapy</a> to provide cures for various disease with a single injection. The company has two programs in Phase I/IIa for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C along with several preclinical programs.</p><p>*Brisbane, California-based Aimmune Therapeutics, the second company to win a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Breakthrough-status-granted-to-Aimmunes-peanut-allergy-drug-359036" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> from the US FDA this year for a peanut allergy treatment, may gross up to $133.3m from the sale of 8.3m shares at $14 to $16 each. </p><p>*Zynerba Pharmaceuticals in Devon, Pennsylvania is looking to price 3m shares between $13 and $15, which would gross up to $45m for the development of synthetic cannabinoid therapies for transdermal delivery to treat epilepsy, Fragile X, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. The company plans to begin Phase I studies for its two lead product candidates during the second half of 2015 and by mid-2016.</p><p>But while EyeGate chose to move forward with a small offering to move it stock to the Nasdaq, BioCardia in San Carlos, California decided to postpone its IPO, which could've raised up to $53.8m from the sale of 3.85m shares at $12 to $14 each.</p><p><p><p><p>
