<p>The European Medicines Agency is going all electronic, at least as far as drug applications are concerned. From 1 July this year, all companies submitting applications to the EMA via the centralized authorization procedure (human and veterinary) must use the electronic application form (eAF). Moreover, from 1 January 2016, application forms in Word format will no longer be available and the eAF will be mandatory for all EU procedures, including national ones.</p><p>The aim of the shift to electronic-only applications is to reduce the administrative burden for both industry and regulators, while improving data quality and consistency. The ultimate aim is to integrate the new forms into a single submission portal by 2018. </p><p>The electronic application forms were first introduced in July 2012 following a successful pilot phase, and are designed to reflect and capture the same content as the outgoing paper-based forms, which are currently published by the European Commission on its website. Since their initial release, the new forms have been significantly improved and an updated version will be launched in the spring. </p><p>However, while the use of electronic submissions has been increasing, it has not taken off as quickly as the regulators would like. In their "eSubmission roadmap", adopted in October last year, the EMA and the Heads of Medicines Agencies (HMA) said that the uptake of a standard electronic format had been slow and that a non-standard electronic submission format was still largely used as an alternative. </p><p>The roadmap, described as a "high-level strategic plan for business and technology change", noted that a number of initiatives had been undertaken to boost electronic submissions within the regulatory network, including mandatory use of the eCTD for centralized applications for human-use drugs from 2010, and the Common European Submission Platform (CESP). </p><p>But it said that the increase in requirements introduced by EU legislation had put the regulatory network under strain, and that the interoperability of systems had become vital to the efficient use of data and resources. </p><p>"In the current budgetary climate it is paramount for the network to find ways to save human and financial resources to cope with the increasing regulatory workload". The electronic processes resulting from the implementation of the eSubmission roadmap "should help the network to work more efficiently", it added.</p><h2>Transition period</h2><p>Announcing the transition to electronic-only applications on 25 February, the EMA said the benefits of using eAFs included higher data quality, the possibility of importing data into databases, and built-in business validation rules to help applicants fill the forms in correctly. They would also move industry and national competent authorities (NCAs) towards a single application process. </p><p>User testing of the forms is under way until 5 March and the agency would like interested parties to take part in the exercise and send feedback on their experiences to their trade associations. </p><p>The final versions of the electronic application forms (eAFs) will then be released in April, and updated guidance documents by the end of May. After the eAFs become compulsory for centralized procedures in July, updated guidance documents for all procedures will be published in September. A further user acceptance test will be run in October, and final forms will be released in November in preparation for the January 2016 deadline for compulsory eAF use across the board.</p>
