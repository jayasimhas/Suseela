<p>"Patient advocacy groups should be in the business of advocating for patients, not advocating for specific drugs or development programs," Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), insisted last week at the Biotechnology Industry Organization's 2015 Patient and Health Advocacy Summit in Washington.</p><p>"I don't think it's that healthy to engage patients and advocates for a drug," Woodcock told <i>Scrip</i> after the meeting. "That's not a useful activity in general," she added, acknowledging she'd raised a "controversial" issue at the meeting.</p><p>Woodcock also said it would "not really be helpful" to have a patient at every meeting the FDA holds with manufacturers &ndash; something some patient advocacy groups, like FasterCures, have pushed for in recent years &ndash; mostly because those get-togethers are "filled with jargon," and it's unlikely anyone in the know is "going to be willing to stop and translate this into English."</p><p> "We are talking very technical stuff," she said in an interview. "I can guarantee you these meetings will not be understandable" to patients.</p><p>Plus, the CDER chief said, even though companies are permitted to bring a patient with them to the meetings with the FDA, "a single person does not represent all patients with a specific disease. They represent one person with that disease."</p><p>To get the authentic voice of the patient, "we need to hear a broader range of people's experiences," Woodcock declared.</p><p>And, she pointed out, the FDA holds about 2,000 meetings each year with manufacturers, so logistically, it would be "very difficult" to also have patients join in. </p><p>"I understand why people engage in extreme advocacy techniques, because people are angry and frustrated," she said. "But it doesn't advance the science."</p><p>Woodcock said the FDA should be allowed to "objectively judge" a drug, "rather than listen to what people tell you about how great it is."</p><p>The FDA most recently has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Power-to-the-people-Patients-influence-over-FDA-354799" target="_new">come under fire</a> by some patients and advocates for not moving quicker on BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s and Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.'s Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drugs drisapersen and eteplirsen.</p><p>Indeed, Duchenne advocates were even successful last year in getting the FDA to respond to a "We the People" White House petition &ndash; a platform created in 2011 by the Obama administration to allow any American over 13 years to call on the federal government to take action on requested matters &ndash; in which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-chief-cranks-it-up-with-captains-of-industry-353164" target="_new">Woodcock personally responded</a>, pledging that regulators were "willing to explore the use of all potential pathways" for therapies against DMD.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-fates-converge-for-BioMarins-drisapersen-Sareptas-eteplirsen-359173" target="_new">Drisapersen</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sarepta-Wins-Priority-Review-For-Duchenne-Drug-Eteplirsen-360112" target="_new">eteplirsen</a> now are under review at the FDA, with decisions due Dec. 27 and Feb. 26, 2016, respectively.</p><p>But rather than demand the FDA approve certain drugs, for which the agency cannot reveal the reasons why it may not be able to act more swiftly, Woodcock said it would be more useful for patients and advocates to turn their attentions to activities that will move the translational medicine research for certain diseases forward &ndash; going beyond the traditional roles of supporting and funding basic science research.</p><p>"This is more work, and the patient group has to be more organized and has to be more focused and it has to be a more of a long-term objective," she said. "But there's a higher return on investment."</p><p>If patient advocacy groups are serious about getting drugs across the finish line, Woodcock said they must first have a "pretty detailed understanding of the ecosystem and the players and the points you can intervene in" and be clear about the state of knowledge that exists for their disease &ndash; what's scientifically valid.</p><p>Woodcock explained it would be helpful to know if the disease can be phenotyped &ndash; in other words, is there a unified description in medical terms of the disease, what are the defining problems and how variable are they, and who actually has the condition?</p><p>Often for untreatable diseases, the problem is identifying who actually has the disease, she said.</p><p>"Patients groups can take a step back and take a hard look at this" and "help identify the gaps in knowledge and understanding the basic definition of whatever disease it might be," Woodcock said.</p><p>Patient advocates, especially for rare diseases, also can help define the natural history of a disease &ndash; what happens to people and how fast and which problems progress and at what rate, she said.</p><p>"That's a research contribution that patients groups are uniquely positioned to do and it will be incredibly helpful if the time comes when there are drugs or other interventions in the pipeline that need to be tested," Woodcock said.</p><p>Patients and advocates also can support scientific research on pathogenesis, she said, but she also urged to "strongly make sure there is rigor in that research" and due diligence is adequately performed, ensuring there is accountability.</p><p>In addition, Woodcock said, patient groups also should be advocating for and organizing the establishment of "centers of excellence" in the diseases for which they are interested and study-ready cohorts.</p><p>"One of the big delays is finding the patients and enrolling them in a trial," she said. "Organized patient groups who can use social media or other means to identify people out there with the disease, have them referred to a center of excellence or treatment center, understand if they are willing to enroll in a clinical trial and have those people identified and ready can cut years off development time."</p><p>Woodcock pointed to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as the "best example" of accomplishing that feat &ndash; noting that the work it did early on led to the quick development by the group and its partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">Kalydeco</a> (ivacaftor), which was the first medicine in the US, initially approved in 2012, to treat the underlying cause of CF.</p><p>Had Vertex had to do the work on its own, it would have "taken years and years," she said.</p><p>Finally, Woodcock said, patients and their advocates can help define how meaningful the benefit of a therapy is to someone with a specific disease and at the different stages of that condition.</p><p>"That is incredibly valuable information," she said, adding "The FDA always struggles with this" &ndash; noting the agency often gets caught in public battles over whether the benefits of a product that are seen are clinically meaningful.</p><p>"Patients are positioned to provide the best assessment of the risk-tolerance for people who have that disease," Woodcock said.</p><p>Patient groups also can work on getting done the measurement systems, like scales, tests or algorithms, for determining risk-benefit trade-offs, she said, pointing out that "without knowing their performance characteristics, your trial may be just completely worthless." </p><p>"FDA knows it needs to put out guidance on this," Woodcock said, adding that the agency plans to do so as part of its Patient-Focused Drug Development program.</p><p>But she said the agency is awaiting the funding to provide the resources to accomplish that task &ndash; dollars that are supposed to be coming as part of the House's <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, although it's not known whether the Senate will include such a measure in its yet-to-be unveiled companion legislation. </p><p>"Patients can make a huge difference in the development of drugs or other interventions for their disease," Woodcock said. "But we need to provide you the tools because it can be a bewildering area and you can get off course pretty easily and perhaps waste time and effort and money."</p><p>"We owe you those guidebooks, advice, guidance on how to do this," she said.</p><p>Woodcock also urged patient groups, academic researchers and industry to review and use the new <a href="http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/files/PatientGroups/PGCTrecs.pdf" target="_new">recommendations</a> released last week by the public-private partnership organization the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative for incorporating the patient perspective into the drug R&D process.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Some-TPP-Countries-Allowed-Exclusivity-Transition-Periods-360904" target="_new">Some TPP Countries Allowed Exclusivity Transition Periods</a></p><p>Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam would be permitted to have transition periods of five to 10 years in implementing the biologic marketing exclusivity rules agreed to under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, according to a document posted online on Oct. 9 by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obviously-FDA-Loves-Opdivo-Another-Quick-Nod-360905" target="_new">Obviously, FDA Loves Opdivo: Another Quick Nod</a></p><p>Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, obviously is in love with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s programmed death-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) &ndash;
