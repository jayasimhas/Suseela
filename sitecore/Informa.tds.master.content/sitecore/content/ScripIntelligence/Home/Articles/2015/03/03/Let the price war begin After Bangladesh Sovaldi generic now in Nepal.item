<p>Asia is where the buzz around the first Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) generics is happening. First Gilead firmed up licensing deals with a clutch of Indian firms putting a lid on the pricing debate on the product in the region, at least temporarily. </p><p>Then came the launch of a cut-price generic sofosbuvir from Bangladesh's Incepta at a maximum retail price (MRP) of Taka800 ($10.4) per tablet <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 February 2015)</a>. Incepta is not currently a Gilead licensee.</p><p>Now, India's Natco Pharma, Sovaldi patent challenger turned licensee, has announced the launch of the first generic version in Nepal. Natco's generic (marketed as Hepcinat) has been priced at an MRP of INR 19,900 ($320) for a bottle of 28 tablets [or around $11.4 per tablet], the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p><p>Nepal, though, doesn't seem to be on the immediate radar of competitors. Incepta's managing director, Abdul Muktadir, told <i>Scrip</i> that the company had not launched its generic in Nepal, but indicated that his company was open to considering lower price points for sofosbuvir from the original Taka800/tablet as volumes and competition increase. </p><p>''If the competition is intense then we have to go by the market dynamics and in such case price revision is possible,'' Mr Muktadir told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Incepta is also working on World Health Organization prequalification of its generic version. ''An application will be filed with WHO as soon as we can. The product is manufactured at an UK MHRA approved site so approval should not be difficult,'' Mr Muktadir added. A mechanism for WHO prequalification of HCV drugs has been recently established.</p><h2>India plans</h2><p>Meanwhile, Natco said that it hoped to launch Hepcinat in India ''soon'', subject to regulatory approval &ndash; a move that is expected to be much watched, given that eight more India-based licensees are at various stages of readying to launch Sovaldi generic versions.</p><p>Significantly, Gilead's licensee, Mylan, is expected to begin distribution of Sovaldi in India in 2Q. Sovaldi would be priced at $300 per bottle/per month in India &ndash; which Gilead expects would act as a ceiling price for other market entrants <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gileads-10.71-Sovaldi-to-set-ceiling-for-other-Indian-entrants-356937%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 25 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>Last year Gilead entered into licensing deals with the seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a>. Biocon subsequently joined the list of licensees, with Natco being the most recent addition to the list <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Patent-challenger-Natco-is-now-Gilead-licensee-for-Sovaldi-357020%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 2 March 2015)</a>. </p><h2>I-MAK challenge</h2><p>Interestingly, the US based non-profit group, Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK), expects to stay on course, at least for now, with its Sovaldi patent challenge in India, notwithstanding recent developments which saw Natco turn licensee for the product.</p><p>Tahir Amin, co-founder and director of intellectual property I-MAK, told <i>Scrip</i> last week that while Natco's turnaround may be good news for India, it did not change the situation for 50 million HCV patients in countries ''locked out'' of the license who could benefit from lower prices.</p><p>''We firmly believe that the evidence shows Gilead does not deserve patents to be granted for its applications. As such we will continue to clear the path for generics to operate outside a license,'' Mr Amin told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Natco and I-MAK had previously filed pre-grant patent oppositions against the Sovaldi patent in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/India-set-to-hear-Sovaldi-patent-objections-case-352584%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 June 2014)</a>. India had earlier rejected one of Gilead's patent applications for Sovaldi essentially on the grounds that it falls under section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act and failed to meet the conditions therein, but a high court order subsequently set aside the rejection. The court had remanded the matter for a fresh decision by the Patent Office <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-points-to-para-lifts-potential-for-bias-in-Indian-Sovaldi-case-356703%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 11 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>Mr Amin also indicated that since the French charity MÃ©decins du Monde (MdM; Doctors of the World) filed the opposition at the European patent office (EPO), 10 other oppositions had been filed at the EPO.</p><p>''Noticeably all the companies have copied the arguments I-MAK/MdM has made in its oppositions,'' he said. </p><p>I-MAK has collaborated with MdM's European patent attorney to write the dossier for the European opposition.</p><p>MdM believes that Sovaldi is unaffordable for even rich European economies and that if its patent challenge is successful, generic versions of the drug could be produced for as little as &euro;88 <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Charity-seeks-to-overturn-European-Sovaldi-patent-356676%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 10 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>Mr Amin declined to comment on whether I-MAK planned more such oppositions, given what he termed as Gilead's ''ability to lobby patent offices, including with the support of the US government''.</p><p>Mr Amin added that he hoped Incepta would remain outside the ''patent pool'' as he did not believe the pool would be able to improve on the existing licenses. ''Alternative producers that exist outside the license are needed to supply countries locked outside of the license,'' he said.</p>
