<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories appears to have progressed its Plan B - essentially a site transfer - to hang on to the generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) opportunity. </p><p>In a post-results investor call, the company's top brass indicated that a site transfer for the product had been completed, though it was unclear whether new bioequivalence studies would be required.</p><p>"We have validated and submitted our update to the FDA from a new active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) site," Dr Reddy's chief operating officer, Abhijit Mukherjee, said in response to an analyst's query.</p><p>"This is a technology transfer, like to like, same process, same raw material, similar equipment to another plant."</p><p>Dr Reddy's back up plan for generic Nexium was necessitated after an FDA inspection of the firm's active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) site in Srikakulam raised certain compliance issues.</p><p>Mr Mukherjee indicated that a "second update" on the site had been provided to the FDA, but did not share specifics.</p><p>"By and large, the commitments which had been made in our first response are on the verge of getting closed."</p><p>The FDA earlier this year approved the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393%5d" target="_new">first generic version</a> of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product. </p><p>Dr Reddy's plans for its Nexium generic comes even as the firm's sales in the US crossed the $1bn mark in the financial year ended March 2015. </p><p>The firm's consolidated revenues for FY15 increased by 12% to INR148.2bn ($2,378m), while net profits stood at INR22.2bn (+3%).</p><p>Revenues from North America for FY15 were INR64.7bn (+17%), with growth shaped by the scale-up of the injectable franchise and market share gains in select molecules. A company presentation indicated that the injectable portfolio in the US exceeded $280m for the year. Twelve new products were launched during the financial year and 13 new product filings were made. Dr Reddy's has 68 ANDAs pending for approval with the US FDA.</p><p>The company earlier this year also announced its first bucket of New Drug Application (NDA) filings with the US FDA for its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Dr-Reddys-kicks-off-derma-neurology-NDA-filings-357720%5d" target="_new">proprietary products</a> business targeting the dermatology and neurology segments. </p><p>Revenues from emerging markets for FY15 rose 13% to INR30.8bn, with revenues from Russia at INR14.9bn, up 13% in local currency terms despite macro-economic uncertainty. </p><p>Revenues from Venezuela grew by 183% during the year, with Dr Reddy's reporting the fastest growth across all companies there in both unit and value terms, as per details in the company presentation. The top brass, though, said that the company was "calibrating" growth plans in that market against the repatriation flow.</p><p> For the fourth quarter ended 31 March 2015, the company recorded INR843m as foreign exchange loss after it "re-evaluated its economic position" following the modification of the currency exchange systems by the government of Venezuela in February 2015. </p><h2>M&A outlook</h2><p>Dr Reddy's top brass also indicated that the firm retains an appetite for mergers and acquisitions, though it is probably unlikely to pursue a deal just for the sake of turnover.</p><p>Asked whether the company expects to pursue "big ticket" transactions - deals upwards of $500m - Dr Reddy's top brass said that it could not rule out such an option.</p><p>"There are multiple diligence that we do at any point of time. Everywhere we may not be successful. We have M&A as a priority thing in our agenda and have the capability to fund such M&A," Dr Reddy's president and chief financial officer Saumen Chakraborty said.</p><p>Dr Reddy's indicted that in emerging markets it would look at the acquisition of brands and in the case of one or two geographies it may consider M&A as an entry strategy.</p><p>On the generics side, it will be "opportunistic and capability driven", the firm's top-brass added. Dr Reddy's Laboratories had recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-buys-UCB-portfolio-in-S-Asia-357628" target="_new">snapped up a select portfolio</a> of UCB's established products business in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives.</p>
