<p>Celgene believes that its all cash $7.2bn acquisition of Receptos will add at least $4bn to $6bn in peak annual sales to the company's future revenue and help the biotechnology giant exceed a previous goal of $20bn in annual revenue.</p><p>Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene expects to bring in more than $21bn in revenue in 2020 if Receptos's lead drug candidate ozanimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, wins US FDA approval for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) as expected in 2018 and for ulcerative colitis (UC) in 2019. </p><p>Phase III RMS data are anticipated in the first half of 2017 and late-stage UC data may be available in 2018, but ozanimod also has potential to treat Crohn's disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and lupus &ndash; indications not included in Celgene's prediction of up to $6bn in sales for the oral drug. </p><p>San Diego-based Receptos licensed ozanimod and related intellectual property from the nearby <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INTERVIEW-Scripps-Research-dealmaker-talks-shop-343128" target="_new">Scripps Research Institute</a> (TSRI) and must pay minimal license fees and development milestone fees on a yearly basis plus low single-digit royalties on future drug sales. The drug's patents, Celgene noted, protect the S1P receptor modulator from generic competition past 2030.</p><p>In addition to the fees and royalties flowing to TSRI, San Diego-area researchers will benefit in a second way &ndash; Celgene's commitment not to immediately cut jobs at Receptos. </p><p>"We're counting on the entire team at Receptos being with us," Celgene chief financial officer Peter Kellogg said during the company's conference call to discuss the value of the deal with investors and analysts.</p><p><b>High-value transaction</b></p><p>Despite the prolific dealmaker's apparent enthusiasm for ozanimod, it does not appear that Celgene is paying a huge premium for Receptos &ndash; depending on how you look at the biotech company's stock price. The $232 per share purchase price is 12% higher than Receptos's $207.18 closing share price on 14 July before the Celgene deal was announced. Receptos rose about 10% in after-hours trading to $228.</p><p>However, Celgene is paying a premium that investors baked into the stock's value during the past year based on positive <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Receptos-radiant-on-top-line-data-for-Gilenya-rival-352215" target="_new">Phase II results</a> for ozanimod as well as anticipation that Receptos would enter into an attractive <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Whos-in-and-whos-out-of-Goldman-Sachs-10-products-that-will-change-the-industry-356450" target="_new">partnership or purchase</a> agreement. The company's stock is trading at almost six times its 16 July 2014 value of $35 per share. </p><p>Despite the year-long rise in Receptos's market cap to $6.5bn, investors also were optimistic about the value Celgene's $7.2bn purchase would add to its portfolio. The company's stock rose 5.7% in after-hours trading to a new one-year high of $129.88 based on the Receptos buy. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2015.</p><p><b>Diversification? </b></p><p>Celgene sees ozanimod as a potential best-in-class drug for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory diseases like ulcerative colitis, largely because the S1P receptor modulator appears to have a lower cardiovascular and liver risk than other therapies in the class. </p><p>"We're confident that ozanimod has the potential to be a game-changer in ulcerative colitis and MS," Celgene president of global inflammation and immunology (I&I) Scott Smith said during the company's conference call.</p><p>The only approved S1P receptor agonist is the oral Novartis drug Gilenya (fingolimod) for MS. Celgene believes that there will be a big market for ozanimod even after Gilenya goes off patent in 2019 and faces generic competition, because of the safety profile and potentially improved efficacy of the Receptos drug.</p><p>Celgene said the Receptos acquisition will enhance its growing I&I pipeline and diversify the company's product portfolio. Diversity may be in the eye of the beholder, however, given the overlapping indications of Celgene's I&I pipeline.</p><p>The lead asset is Otezla (apremilast), an oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor that is approved in the US to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Celgene is conducting Phase III clinical trials in ankylosing spondylitis and Behcet syndrome as well as Phase II trials in ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Company executives emphasized &ndash; without saying so directly &ndash; that Celgene's acquisition of Receptos does not mean that it has lost confidence in GED-0301. The oral antisense drug was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1Q-EARNINGS-Celgene-boosts-sales-bets-big-on-Crohns-drug-351453" target="_new">licensed</a> from Nogra Pharma in 2014 and is in Phase III development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.</p><p>Celgene chairman and CEO Robert Hugin said during the company's conference call that Celgene is "extremely confident" about GED-0301. Mr Hugin noted that the antisense drug and ozanimod may have the potential to be used in combination or in sequence with each other in the future.</p><p><b>Pipeline protection</b></p><p>Even with overlapping indications in Celgene's I&I pipeline, William Blair analyst John Sonnier said in a 14 July research note that ozanimod could offset risk among key I&I programs.</p><p>"The mechanism of action (a S1P receptor modulator) is different than Celgene's other assets under development in the inflammatory bowel disease area (GED-0301 and Otezla) and could be complementary and risk-mitigating to Celgene's product portfolio. We view the acquisition as a good strategic fit given the company's continued expansion into the autoimmune disease space," Mr Sonnier wrote.</p><p>Diversification is key for Celgene, which derives most of its revenue from the multiple myeloma drug Revlimid (lenalidomide) &ndash; $5bn out of $7.7bn in net product sales in 2014. By 2020, even with the addition of ozanimod revenue, the company expects $14.8bn of its $21bn in revenue to come from hematology products with $2.2bn from oncology and $4bn from I&I drugs.</p><p>With an eye on continuing to diversify its portfolio, Celgene will fund the Receptos acquisition with a combination of cash and new debt so that the company can keep capital on its balance sheet for stock repurchases and additional licensing or acquisition deals.</p><p>Celgene is a creative dealmaker in its quest for promising new therapies, but the company tends to buy drug developers with later-stage assets and usually focuses on licensing deals for earlier-stage programs, Celgene's chief dealmaker George Golumbeski to <i>Scrip</i> in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Celgenes-head-dealmaker-strikes-a-fair-balance-356314" target="_new">January</a>. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
