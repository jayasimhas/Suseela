<p>A month after 12 trade ministers declared they'd reached a deal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the full text of the agreement was finally revealed on Nov. 5.</p><p>Still lamenting the failure to get the 12 years of biologic exclusivity protection they'd been pressing for throughout the five-plus years of negotiations &ndash; with the deal calling for five to eight years instead &ndash; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Industry Organization said they would need more time to review the full text before making any final judgments.</p><p>But Washington lawyer William James, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter LLP, said other than some footnotes with a few more details and some formatting changes in the exclusivity and patent linkage provisions, he didn't see anything that wasn't already revealed when the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks posted what it claimed was the final intellectual property chapter <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Some-TPP-Countries-Allowed-Exclusivity-Transition-Periods-360904" target="_new">online last month</a>, which came only a few days after the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">agreement was struck on Oct. 5</a> by the 12 nations &ndash; Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US. </p><p>While much attention has been paid to the IP chapter and the biologics exclusivity debate, there are other provisions in the TPP agreement that affect the biopharmaceutical industry, specifically, the measures in the so-called "Annex on Transparency and Procedural Fairness for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices," which is part of the <i>Transparency and Anti-Corruption</i> chapter.</p><p>But the US consumer watchdog Public Citizen complained the transparency annex's provisions favor drug and device makers well over consumers.</p><p>The Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR), however, contended the annex's requirements, which the agency said are "best practices" that are "fully reflected" in US law and practice &ndash; including in the Medicare national coverage determination (NCD) process, which establishes what will be paid for under Parts A and B of the coverage program &ndash; are aimed at ensuring transparency and due process for listing and reimbursement procedures in "relevant" health care programs operated by national authorities. </p><p>"They require no changes to any US health care program, nor will they affect the US government's ability to pursue the best health care policy for its citizens, including future reforms or decisions on healthcare expenditures or cost containment," the USTR insisted. </p><p>The US agency emphasized the commitments in the pharmaceutical and device transparency annex are not subject to investor-state dispute settlement &ndash; a process under the TPP intended to determine if a nation's laws harmed a company's or investor's expected future profits &ndash; which was a provision that had been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-officials-pound-drum-harder-in-trade-agenda-pursuit-357755" target="_new">hotly debated</a>.</p><p><b>Annex Details</b></p><p>The transparency annex states that as part of the TPP countries' commitment to facilitating high-quality health care and continued improvements, the nations acknowledged the importance of the role pharmaceuticals and medical devices play in protecting and promoting public health.</p><p>To the extent the TPP nations' health care authorities operate or maintain procedures for listing new drugs and medical devices for reimbursement purposes or set the payment amounts, the text of the trade deal declares that national health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid in the US, must ensure that consideration of all formal and duly formulated proposals is completed within a specified period of time; procedural rules, methodologies, principles and guidelines used to assess such proposals are disclosed; and applicants and the public, where appropriate, are afforded timely opportunities to provide comments at relevant points in the decision-making process.</p><p>The 12 countries also must provide applicants with written information sufficient to comprehend the basis for recommendations or determinations about the listing of new pharmaceuticals or medical devices for reimbursement by national health care authorities, according to the TPP transparency annex.</p><p>In addition, the TPP nations must make available either an independent review process or an internal review process by the same expert or group of experts that made the recommendation or determination, provided that such a review process includes, at a minimum, a substantive reconsideration of the application, which may be invoked at the request of an affected applicant.</p><p>The agreement's annex also requires the TPP countries to provide written information to the public about those recommendations or determinations, while protecting confidential information.</p><p>But Public Citizen officials asserted that because CMS' determinations would be subject to the annex's procedural rules and principles &ndash; "the precise meaning of which are not clear and perhaps not knowable" &ndash; pharmaceutical companies could attempt to "exploit the general language" of the provision to mount challenges to Medicare and health programs in many of the TPP negotiating countries. </p><p>"The annex also may potentially constrain future policy reforms, including the ability of the US government to curb rising and unsustainable drug prices," Public Citizen charged.</p><p>The group argued the "ambiguous language" of the annex's text "leaves our domestic health care policies vulnerable to attack by drug and device manufacturers &ndash; insisting companies could use it to compel Medicare, whose reimbursement is supposed to be limited to products that are "reasonable and necessary" for treatment, to cover expensive products without a corresponding benefit to public health.</p><p>Public Citizen also contended that drug and device manufacturers might argue the TPP grants them an unconditional right to review, even though Medicare only allows appeals under a limited set of circumstances.</p><p>In addition, the group said the transparency annex's requirements open up Medicare's NCDs to lawsuits because the TPP mandates that parties provide opportunities for applicants to comment on reimbursement considerations "at relevant points in the decision-making process."</p><p>"These determinations may be vulnerable to legal challenge depending on the construction of 'relevant points,'" Public Citizen argued.</p><p><b>IP Chapter Still Contentious </b></p><p>During a press call with reporters, Public Citizen also reiterated its earlier complaints about the IP chapter &ndash; declaring it would roll back the May 10th 2007 Agreement &ndash; a deal reached by Democratic congressional leaders and the Bush administration on access to affordable medicines.</p><p>"TPP provisions require patent term extensions and marketing exclusivity for new uses and forms of old drugs that clearly exceed the bounds of May 10 and will contribute to preventable suffering and death," the group charged.</p><p>Public Citizen said by far the "most controversial" provision in the IP chapter continued to be the biologic exclusivity protection, even though the US drug lobbying groups had failed to win the 12 years, like what's mandated under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), which was the 2010 law that gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>Under the TPP agreement, the participating 12 countries have two options for providing marketing exclusivity protection for innovator biologics against biosimilars: At least eight years from the date of first marketing approval for the brand-name product or at least five years from the date of first marketing approval with "other measures" and recognizing that market circumstances also contribute to effective market protection to deliver a comparable outcome.</p><p>Goodwin Procter's James said he expected there will need to be some fleshing out of exactly what those other measures mean.</p><p>He noted that the first provision of article 18.51 of the IP chapter in the TPP is similar to the BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures &ndash; the "patent dance" &ndash; because it declares there must be a system to provide notice to a patent holder prior to marketing, with a mandate to allow adequate time and opportunity for remedies and procedures for judicial or administrative proceedings, like a preliminary injunction or equivalent measures.</p><p>But part two of article 18.51, James explained, provides for an alternative, which he said is similar to a patent linkage process.</p><p>Under that provision, TPP parties can adopt or maintain a system other than judicial proceedings that precludes, based on patent-related information submitted to the marketing approval authority by a patent holder or the applicant for marketing approval, or based on direct coordination between the marketing approval authority and the patent office, the issuance of marketing approval to any third person seeking to market a pharmaceutical product subject to a patent claiming that product, unless by consent or acquiescence of the patent holder.</p><p>While James noted that provision would be inconsistent with the BPCIA's patent dance, "you can see why some countries might like it, because it's much easier to administer."</p><p>But while it's a cleaner option, "the effect of it would be to prevent the public from earlier access to less expensive medications," he said.</p><p><b>US Adoption?</b></p><p>Now that the full text has been revealed, James said it "will be interesting to see if at all this changes the debate about whether this is pro- or anti-business in the United States."</p><p>Later in the day on Nov. 5, President Barack Obama notified Congress of his intention to enter into the free trade agreement &ndash; triggering a 90-day review process by lawmakers of the deal.</p><p>During a Nov. 5 press conference, the new Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan (R-WI), said he had not yet read the TPP text, so he didn't yet know his position on the agreement.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ryan said he was pleased with the "open, transparent" process.</p><p>"People get to see it, members of Congress get to see it, and then we will get to decide independently after consulting with our constituents and our conscience what our position on anything like a trade agreement might be," Ryan told reporters. </p><p>But Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that even though Congress gave Obama <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-gets-his-fast-track-to-seal-trade-deals-359110" target="_new">trade promotion authority</a> &ndash; often called fast-track, which would allow the president to send negotiated trade deals to Capitol Hill for an up-or-down vote, with no ability for lawmakers to amend or filibuster the agreements &ndash; the senator warned there's no guarantee the TPP will be adopted.</p><p>"Like many, I am immensely concerned that the administration may have missed a pivotal opportunity with the TPP to get the best deal possible for the American people. I hope that I am wrong," Hatch said. "We have only one chance to enact the right TPP. Congress must be convinced that this deal is it."</p><p>A vote by Congress on the TPP is expected sometime in the spring.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
