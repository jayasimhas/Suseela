<p>The FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (DODAC) on 9 March unanimously backed approval of Kythera Biopharmaceuticals' new drug application (NDA) for its experimental chin fat drug ATX-101, an injectable formulation of a purified synthetic version of deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown of dietary fat.</p><p>But the reaction from investors was mixed, with shares of Kythera rising 5.4% on 9 March, but then dropping 7.7%, before closing at $51.17, down $1.96, or 3.7%. </p><p>ATX-101 works by contouring the area under the chin by destroying fat cells, while leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected. </p><p>Kythera is seeking approval of ATX-101 as a treatment in adults to improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe convexity or fullness associated with submental fat, which commonly presents as a double chin.</p><p>The proposed dosing regimen is up to six treatment sessions at 28-day intervals, with each session involving up to 50 injections of 1% ATX-101 at 0.2mL each into submental fat.</p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision on the ATX-101 NDA by 13 May &ndash; the investigational medicine's <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kythera-chin-fat-drug-verdict-expected-May-2015-352840" target="_new">11 July 2014</a>).</p><p>Dr Frederick Beddingfield, Kythera's chief medical officer, said submental fat is of particular concern for many adults, affecting their confidence about their attractiveness to others.</p><p>Chin fat can arise from several factors other than gaining weight, including aging, lifestyle or genetic predisposition, he explained.</p><p>But, Dr Beddingfield said, chin fat often is resistant to weight loss.</p><p>Current treatment options for submental fat are limited to aesthetic surgical procedures and targeted liposuction, he said. </p><p>There currently are no pharmaceutical options approved in the US to reduce chin fat.</p><p>If the FDA clears ATX-101, it would be the first non-surgical treatment in the US for the reduction of submental fat &ndash; offering a less invasive approach than surgery or liposuction, Dr Beddingfield said.</p><p>The firm said it plans to launch ATX-101 in the second half of this year if given the FDA&rsquo;s go-ahead. Kythera has yet to disclose the drug's pricing.</p><p><b>Proper training</b></p><p>Dr Beddingfield said administration of ATX-101 is a relatively straightforward for healthcare providers familiar with other facial injectable products to administer.</p><p>But members of the DODAC were particularly concerned with ensuring prescribers were properly trained, in light of the risk of mandibular nerve injury and dysphagia.</p><p>Regulators noted there were 20 study participants in Kythera's Phase III trials treated with ATX-101 that experienced mandibular nerve injury, versus one in the placebo group.</p><p>The injuries resulted in asymmetry of the lower lip on the affected side, or paresis of lip depressors.</p><p>The duration of the paresis ranged from 1-298 days. </p><p>While dosing was interrupted for four study participants, all nerve injuries resolved completely and without treatment.</p><p>Kythera also reported that 11 study participants experienced dysphagia in the pivotal Phase III trials, with all but one in the ATX-101 group. </p><p>Two subjects discontinued treatment because of dysphagia, one of whom had not recovered at the time of trial discontinuation. </p><p>The duration of dysphagia ranged from 1-81 days, regulators said.</p><p>During the public hearing portion of the 9 March DODAC meeting, Dr Sydney Wolfe from the consumer watchdog group Public Citizen insisted Kythera had failed to demonstrate ATX-101's benefits in reducing chin fat outweighed its risks of mandibular nerve injury and dysphagia.</p><p>He also warned about the potential for off-label use of the drug.</p><p>But Dr Beddingfield emphasized that to mitigate the risks of using the drug, Kythera has proposed a "robust" education and training program for prescribers of ATX-101, which he said would be offered in various formats.</p><p>He said the firm also has developed directions for use to be included along with associated risk information in the product labeling to ensure the safe use of ATX-101 in the postmarketing setting.</p><p>Dr Beddingfield noted the injection technique is outlined in the package insert, which advises prescribers to inject perpendicular to the skin surface, midway into the subcutaneous fat, and instructs not to inject during withdrawal of the syringe to avoid superficial injections into the dermis that may lead to ulceration or inadvertent injection into salivary glands, lymph nodes or muscles. </p><p><b>Subjective endpoints</b></p><p>While Kythera's two placebo-controlled Phase III studies were successful, the DODAC raised questions about whether the primary endpoints were too subjective. </p><p>At the time of ATX-101's development, there were no known existing measures of submental fullness, regulators pointed out. </p><p>So the FDA worked with Kythera to develop parallel patient-reported and clinician-reported scales for use within the firm's drug development program for use as a composite primary endpoint measure. </p><p>Both scales include five grades ranging from 0 to 4.</p><p>Because the clinician and patient scales do not directly measure fat in the submental area, an objective measure, like imaging, of submental fat reduction was recommended to verify the purported effects of the proposed drug treatment. </p><p>Kythera provided MRI measurements of submental fat volume in a subset of study participants, in which their chin and neck areas were scanned.</p><p>The company developed the six-item "Patient-Reported Submental Fat Impact Scale" as another secondary endpoint, which asked questions based on a scale ranging from 0-10.</p><p>The FDA noted that the patient's perspective is particularly important in evaluating the success of aesthetic treatments, because that person is the ultimate consumer of the medical product and is in the best position to provide assurance that the endpoint is clinically meaningful. </p><p>"My concern is that the endpoints are very subjective," said panelist Dr John DiGiovanna, staff clinician in the Dermatology Branch at the US National Cancer Institute. "Depending on how the patient and physician grading is executed, it makes it a little bit difficult to be sure it would be reproducible."</p><p>But he praised the company and the FDA for adding in the objective measurement of the MRI scan.</p><p>"It would be wise to take an additional look at what objective measurements might be useful going forward for additional products that may have similar indications which are based on appearance to have better objective measurements," Dr DiGiovanna said. </p><p>But panelist Dr Warren Bilker, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, acknowledged it's "very difficult to find decent endpoints when you are trying to get a surgical outcome with a medical procedure."</p><p>"Anything more that could be done would be useful," added panelist Dr Erica Brittain, a mathematical statistician at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. </p><p>She said the Kythera trials "show the importance of placebo-control, because if you'd only see one arm, you might think, 'Gee, those patients got better.' It's only with a comparison to the placebo that you can interpret the results."</p><p>Panelist Dr Mural Alam, a professor of dermatology, otolaryngology and surgery, urged Kythera to publish the full validation of its scales "so everyone can see how it works."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
