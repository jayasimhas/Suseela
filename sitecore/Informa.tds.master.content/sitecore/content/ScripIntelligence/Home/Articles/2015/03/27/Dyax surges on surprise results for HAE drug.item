<p><p>Dyax surged on news that its rare genetic disease drug outpaced currently marketed drugs and pipeline leaders by a wide margin in an early study, paving the way for a fast-track approval and a potential Breakthrough Therapy designation. </p><p>Shares of the Burlington, Mass.-based biotech jumped 47% to linger near $24.50 per share on 01 April, the day after Dyax announced results from its Phase Ib study of DX-2930 in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) &ndash; a rare genetic disease that is characterized by potentially fatal swelling of the skin and organs. </p><p>"In our view, the results we are reporting today provide clear proof of concept that administration of DX-2930 to HAE patients corrects the pathobiologic abnormality that causes HAE attacks. Therefore, and not surprisingly, we observed that DX-2930 treatment notably reduced attack frequency and even allowed many subjects to be attack free during the treatment period," said Dyax Chief medical Officer Burt Adelman during a 31 March conference call.</p><p>The early-stage study of 37 patients randomized subjects to one of four doses of the drug or placebo &ndash; patients then received two doses, 14 days apart. The study was originally meant to measure the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of DX-2930, but was expanded to look at efficacy. Patients on the drug showed no signs of dose-limiting toxicity and no serious adverse events or discontinuations. </p><p>Efficacy was measured in the 300mg and 400mg dose groups, which showed profound results over placebo. The 300mg dose group showed a reduction of 100% of HAE attacks over placebo during the six weeks of peak drug level, while the 400mg group showed an 88% reduction. </p><p>The results are both early and in a small patient population &ndash; which means there is potential the drug won't show the same results in later-stage studies &ndash; but DX-2930 performed well beyond expectations. Jefferies analyst Biren Amin mentioned in a 31 March note that investors would&rsquo;ve been thrilled with a 35% to 50% reduction in the drug group &ndash; prompting him to raise his price target to $31 from $18. "DX-2930 has potential as the next standard of care in HAE," wrote Amin. </p><p>Yet, it wasn't just the outpacing of expectations that caused the stock to shoot up, but its outperformance of other drugs. Shire's Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]), which has been on the market since 2008, reduces attacks by about 50%, while BioCryst's BCX4161 has shown the ability to reduce attacks by 35% in late-stage trials. Cinryze brought in about $500m in revenues last year and is used in about 1,300 patients. </p><p>Dyax's DX-2930 could also have a dosing advantage &ndash; it is administered by subcutaneous injection twice a month, while Cinryze is given by IV three time per week and BCX4161 is an oral formulation that has to be taken three times per day. </p><p>The drug was also given Fast Track designation by the FDA, said Dyax on 01 April. Analysts expect the company will now seek Breakthrough Therapy designation as well, significantly speeding up the development process. </p><p>"We are raising our PT to $25 from $16 on an increased probability-of-success and higher '2930 price and now assume a gross market opportunity of $1.8bn," wrote Leerink Swann analyst Joseph Schwartz in a 31 March note to investors. </p><p><p><p>
