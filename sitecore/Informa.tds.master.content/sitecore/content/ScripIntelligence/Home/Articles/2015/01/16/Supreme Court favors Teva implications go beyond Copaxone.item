<p>The US Supreme Court on 20 January sided with Israeli drug maker Teva in a lawsuit involving the firm's money-maker drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate), with the justices declaring an appeals court had failed to use the proper standard when it invalidated the company's last remaining patent on the multiple sclerosis medicine.</p><p>The court ruled 7-2 in Teva's favor, and remanded the case back to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which had invalidated Teva's patent '808, which covers a manufacturing method.</p><p>Copaxone is Teva's biggest name-brand medicine &ndash; accounting for about half of its operating profit.</p><p>Patent '808 is set to expire on 1 September. But Teva wants to squeeze every dollar it can out of it before generic versions of Copaxone hit the market. Eight other patents expired last May.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling makes it highly unlikely generic firms will attempt an &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; launch of their versions of Copaxone.</p><p>The case the Supreme Court decided stems back to 2008, when Teva filed patent infringement lawsuits against generic drug makers, Sandoz, Momenta, Mylan and Natco, which all have sought to obtain approval from the FDA to market generic versions of Copaxone. </p><p>The generic firms, led by Sandoz, argued Teva's claim that Copaxone's active ingredient had a molecular weight of 5-9 kilodaltons was fatally indefinite because it did not state which of three methods of calculation &ndash; the weight of the most prevalent molecule, the weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or weight as calculated by an average in which heavier molecules count for more &ndash; was used to determine that weight. </p><p>The district court, however, rejected Sandoz's argument and held Teva's claims were valid. </p><p>The court had construed "molecular weight" to refer to the peak average molecular weight of the claimed synthetic polypeptide (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Natco-tumbles-after-US-Copaxone-ruling-Mylan-says-guidance-unchanged-332110" target="_new">26 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Momentas-MS-momentum-slowed-as-court-gives-Teva-1.5bn-Copaxone-boost-332108" target="_new">26 June 2012</a>).</p><p>But in July 2013, the Federal Circuit held that the claims' "plain language does not indicate which average molecular weight measure is intended" and nothing in the prosecution history or specification resolved the ambiguity (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Biopharma-patent-law-back-at-Supreme-Court-with-Copaxone-354301" target="_new">06 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Appeals-court-overturns-Copaxone-patents-345339" target="_new">29 July 2013</a>).</p><p>The appeals court also determined that Teva's expert testimony did not save the relevant claims from indefiniteness.</p><p>But arguing before the Supreme Court on 15 October 2014, Teva's lawyer, William Jay, a partner in and co-chair of Goodwin Procter's appellate litigation practice in Washington, contended that the Federal Circuit failed to defer to the trial court's finding about the presumed meaning of the term "average molecular weight in the relevant context (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Copaxone-decision-could-decide-balance-of-power-354512" target="_new">16 October 2014</a>).</p><p>"Facts can enter claim construction and they do so when the trial judge does what this court has instructed her to do &ndash; to find what a person of skill in the art already knows as relevant to interpreting the patent," Mr Jay declared. </p><p>Claim construction is an integral part of patent litigation, in which courts interpret what a claim means. When the court decides a patent claim lacks adequate "definiteness" to be interpreted, the claim is judged invalid.</p><p>In ruling for Teva, the Supreme Court said the Federal Circuit must only review district courts' patent case decisions when there is clear error, not <i>de novo</i> &ndash; meaning the appeals court should not rehash the lower court's factual findings in support of its construction of a patent claim term unless there was clearly a mistake made.</p><p>With the high court's ruling on 20 January, Silicon Valley lawyer Saina Shamilov, a partner in the litigation group at Fenwick & West, who reviewed the Supreme Court's decision, said she now expects more courts to offer parties opportunities to hold evidentiary hearings for claim construction purposes with live expert testimony. </p><p>"If a patentee believes that it can get a favorable construction in a particular district court, I expect that patentee to advance expert testimony and make the claim construction hearing a battle of the experts to be able to preserve the favorable claim construction on appeal," she told <i>Scrip</i>. "The accused infringer in the same forum, however, may want to avoid relying on the extrinsic evidence in order to obtain a de novo review of the district court&rsquo;s claim constructions on appeal and instead argue that the intrinsic evidence needs no interpretations and supports the accused infringer&rsquo; advanced claim constructions."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
