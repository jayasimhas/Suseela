<p>Aduro Biotech has secured a $200m upfront payment from Novartis as the latter steps up its activity in immunotherapy for cancer. The deal brings Novartis an early-stage immuno-oncology platform targeting the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway, adding to its ongoing programs using chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) technology and checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p>Novartis has also launched a new immuno-oncology research group to be headed by Professor Glenn Dranoff, who led the Dranoff Lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where he focused on cancer vaccines.</p><p>The deal will additionally see Novartis make a $25m equity investment in Aduro (representing a stake of 2.7%), and commit to a second $25m equity investment in future. It has promised up to $500m in development milestones. Aduro retains US commercial rights.</p><p>Aduro is developing novel small molecule cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) technology, and one such compound, ADU-S100, has been shown in preclinical models to generate an immune response that specifically attacks tumor cells. Activating the STING signaling pathway initiates broad innate and adaptive tumor-specific immune responses, the company noted.</p><p>"Current approaches with checkpoint inhibitors and T-cell modulation are potent but only in select tumor types. STING agonists have the potential to fully activate the immune system to attack a broader range of tumors," said Mark Fishman, President of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. "Under Glenn Dranoff's leadership our new immuno-oncology research group will aggressively drive our current programs to the clinic and explore new directions for both mono and combination therapies."</p><p>Earlier this month, Aduro announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Aduro-launching-IPO-357257" target="_new">plans to raise $86m</a> through an initial public offering. Aside from its CDN technology, the Berkeley, California-based biotech company engineers <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> bacteria into therapeutic agents that stimulate targeted immune response to specific tumor antigens, using a platform technology called LADD (live attenuated double-deleted). <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Janssen-signs-847m-lung-cancer-immunotherapy-deal-with-Aduro-354554" target="_new">Janssen Biotech has licensed</a> some of these LADD product candidates for the treatment of prostate and lung cancer. Aduro also has a third platform, GVAX, which it licensed from BioSante in 2011 and acquired in 2013. GVAX vaccines are being developed to act as immune system boosters for other cancer therapies.</p><p><p>Novartis has a CART program, CTL019, in Phase II, as well as checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1, LAG3 and TIM3 that are expected to enter the clinic in mid-2015.</p><p>Aduro will lead commercialization and book sales of any products arising from the alliance in the US, while Novartis will be responsible for the rest of the world. Profits will be shared in the US, Japan and major European countries. Novartis will pay Aduro a royalty in the mid-teens for sales in the rest of the world.</p><p>Aduro retains rights to CDN-based therapies in non-oncology indications, including for infectious disease and autoimmunity.</p>
