<p>Synta Pharmaceuticals is banking on better fortunes in ovarian, blood and breast cancers to keep hopes for its heat shock protein 90 inhibitor ganetespib alive after an ignominious futility failure for its Phase III GALAXY-2 trial in lung cancer. </p><p>Shares in the company plummeted by more than 71% to $0.58 on Oct. 21 after it announced its decision to terminate the study after a pre-planned interim analysis by its Independent Data Monitoring Committee concluded that adding ganetespib to docetaxel was unlikely to show a significant improvement in overall survival (the primary endpoint) over docetaxel alone in the second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma. GALAXY-2 was due to report data from 850 patients in March 2016. </p><p>"This disappointing outcome underscores the challenges of treating lung cancer in the second-line setting and determining the precise population for whom ganetespib may be most effective," said Chen Schor, Synta's president and CEO. He added that Synta would continue to support ongoing investigator-sponsored studies of ganetespib as its worked out the best way forward for the product. </p><p>These investigator sponsored studies are in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (AML LI-1 and AML18), breast (I-SPY 2 TRIAL) and ovarian cancer (GANNET53). Synta is also sponsoring an open label Phase II study of ganetespib in breast cancer (ENCHANT). </p><p>While NSCLC was the biggest indication ganetespib was pursuing, Datamonitor Healthcare senior analyst Dr Joseph Hedden commented that early phase data showing activity in both HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer subpopulations has been seen, although there are no data yet to judge ganetespib's progress in AML and myelodysplastic syndromes. "So there are still hopes for commercial success, especially in triple-negative breast cancer where there is more significant unmet need, and given the large numbers of patients," he said.</p><p>Ganetespib is Synta's only candidate in clinical development, and earlier this year the company shed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Adimab-InSite-Ligand-deals-layoffs-at-Synta-and-seven-public-offerings-356609" target="_new">20% of its workforce in a strategy shift</a> to focus its R&D squarely on the product. Now, management is looking to its preclinical pipeline of Hsp90 drug conjugate (HDC) candidates for back up, bolstered by its "significant cash reserves", Schor said. </p><p>Ganetespib also appeared to be the most advanced HSP90 inhibitor in development, boding ill for those in its wake. Novartis has already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Ten-deals-and-a-breakup-GileadOno-VernalisNovartis-SorrentoNantWorks-and-more-355774" target="_new">handed back to Vernalis</a> the research program for the Phase II luminespib, while biotech start-up Esanex picked up development of Pfizer's SNX-5422 which it acquired with Serenex in 2008, which is now also at Phase II. Others at Phase II include Astex Pharmaceuticals (Otsuka)'s AT-13387 and Curis's CU-305.</p><p>
