<p>A plan by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to use the same Medicare Part B reimbursement codes for all biosimilars based on the same reference could end up jeopardizing the market for the drugs by causing uncertainty, the Biosimilars Forum, a nonprofit group representing manufacturers in the space, is charging.</p><p>Essentially, said Washington lawyer Michael Werner, a partner at Holland & Knight and a policy adviser to the Biosimilars Forum, CMS is telling biosimilars makers they are entering a non-competitive market.</p><p>Mr. Werner said the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Group-Biosimilars-need-unique-CMS-reimbursement-codes-359392" target="_new">CMS proposal</a> to issue the same healthcare common procedure coding system (HCPCS) &ndash; often called J Codes &ndash; to biosimilars that rely on a common reference product's biologics license application, therefore lumping them into the same Medicare Part B reimbursement payment calculation, is problematic for several reasons, including that the agency does not address the added work firms that seek interchangeability might have to put into their products. </p><p>"But they'll all be priced the same" by CMS, Mr. Werner told <i>Scrip</i>. "Those two products shouldn't be paid the same necessarily."</p><p>So, he said, companies would lose incentive to seek interchangeability or possible added indications if the reference product gains additional FDA approval later down the road.</p><p>"What's the incentive for a more highly developed market?" Mr Werner said.</p><p>He also said CMS' proposal may end up causing confusion between the differences of biosimilars deemed interchangeable from those that have not earned that status. </p><p>In addition, Mr. Werner said, issuing distinguishable J codes to biosimilars is essential for ensuring there's accurate attribution if any adverse events arise with those products.</p><p>Losing the individual identifier, Mr. Werner said, not only makes it difficult to track the drugs and know which product may have been responsible for an adverse event, but researchers also would lose the ability to do analytics on biosimilars based on claims data.</p><p>He noted that a bipartisan group of 33 House members this week called on the head of CMS to reverse course on its biosimilars J code proposal.</p><p>The lawmakers insisted CMS was going against Congress' wishes &ndash; pointing out the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> specifically states the calculation for reimbursing biosimilars should be made separately, such that each biosimilar would have its own unique payment rate and unique HCPCS code.</p><p>"This language reflects congressional intent to encourage a vibrant biosimilars market and we urge you to enact a final payment rule that provides each biosimilar with a unique code," the lawmakers, who were led by Reps. Anna Eshoo (Democrat-California) and Joe Barton (Republican-Texas), declared in a letter to acting CMS chief Andrew Slavitt, whose confirmation is pending before Congress.</p><p>They pointed out that biosimilars are large, complex molecules grown in living systems, such as microorganisms, plants or animal cells, and are not the same as small molecule generic drugs.</p><p>There currently is only one biosimilar approved in the US, Novartis unit Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), but the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">ruled last month</a> the drug cannot enter the US market until Sept. 2 at the earliest under a dispute the companies had with Amgen, whose human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) was used as the reference.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
