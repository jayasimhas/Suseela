<p>Amid the intense debate over the growth in antibacterial resistance, its causes, and most of all what can be done about it, interest is growing in the use of bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics. </p><p>On 8 June the European Medicines Agency is to hold a workshop looking at the use of bacteriophages in bacterial infections, with the aim of discussing key issues with academic, regulatory and industry stakeholders and look at potential ways forward.</p><p>Among the topics under discussion will be a historical overview of the therapeutic use of bacteriophages, GMP and quality issues, phage cocktails, regulatory aspects, and current clinical evidence. </p><p>Bacteriophages are naturally occurring viruses that invade bacteria, often destroying them in the process. They have a narrow spectrum of activity so in theory it is possible to use them to kill bacterial pathogens while sparing the body's "good" bacteria. Moreover, their mechanism of action is very different from that of antibiotics, so they could be used to treat antibiotic-resistant infections.</p><p>Phages were widely used to treat infections in the 1920s and 1930s, but in most European countries their use died out after the introduction of antibiotics, although some countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union continued using them for certain infections such as wound infections. However, their safety and efficacy have not been systematically investigated in large randomized trials, and most of the evidence remains observational, the EMA notes.</p><p>Now, though, the therapeutic potential of this approach is being investigated more closely by research groups and companies in the EU. Among the activities under way is the Phase I/II Phagoburn clinical trial in patients with infected burn wounds, which is funded by the European Commission's seventh framework research program and will be discussed at the EMA workshop. The trial protocol has now been finalized and the synopsis published online. </p><p>The randomized, multicentre, open-label, standard-of-care controlled trial, sponsored by the French firm Pherecydes Pharma, involves seven clinical sites and in France, Belgium and Switzerland. The objective of the trial is to assess the tolerance and efficacy of local bacteriophage treatment of <i>E coli</i> and <i>P aeruginosa</i> wound infections in burns patients. </p><p>Pherecydes is also running the two-year PHOSA project, which was launched in January this year and is seeking to develop an effective bacteriophage cocktail against bone and joint infections caused by staphylococci. The project, which is expected to lead to the initiation of a Phase I/II clinical trial, also involves two French SMEs, Biofilm Control and Vivexia, as well as two public research centers. </p><p>Meanwhile, a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Micreos-offers-bacteriophage-based-alternative-to-traditional-antibiotics-354902" target="_new">bacteriophage project</a> being conducted by the Dutch biotech company Micreos has shown promise in early case studies as a treatment for skin infections. Micreos' endolysin-based product, Staphefekt, was able to kill <i>S aureus</i>, including the methicillin-resistant form MRSA, while leaving beneficial bacteria unharmed.</p>
