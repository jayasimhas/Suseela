<p>The European Commission has approved deals for both GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis, and Abbott and Mylan, but in both cases it has imposed conditions which involve divesting products.</p><h2>GSK/Novartis</h2><p>The commission said that it had concerns that the planned deal between GSK and Novartis to swap vaccines and oncology assets "would have a detrimental effect on competition in a significant number of markets." In particular, the EC was worried about meningitis, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, and consumer health products for smoking cessation, cold and flu, cold sores, and pain.</p><p>Regarding the vaccines, the EC noted that GSK and Novartis are the only suppliers in the European Economic Area (EEA) for bacterial meningitis vaccines targeting serogroups A, C, W and Y. They are also competing suppliers of diphtheria and tetanus vaccines in Germany and Italy, where the EC said "the remaining players would have been unable to sufficiently constrain the merged entity to avoid price increases for vaccines."</p><p>As such, GSK has committed to divest Mencevax, its bacterial meningitis vaccine, and grant a worldwide exclusive license for Nimenrix, also for bacterial meningitis. The company has also made commitments regarding Novartis's TD-Pur and Dif-Tet-All vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus, which GSK is gaining as part of the deal. These include an exclusive distribution agreement for Germany and Italy, and transfer marketing authorizations in other relevant countries.</p><p>Meanwhile, GSK has also agreed to divest a range of consumer health products in various markets:</p><ul><li>GSK's NiQuitin smoking cessation business in the EEA and Turkey;</li><li>Novartis's Fenivir, Pencivir, Vectatone and Vectavir cold sore management products in the EEA and Turkey, together with a temporary licence for Fenistil for cold sore management in the UK and the Netherlands;</li><li>GSK's Coldrex cold and flu products in the EEA;</li><li>GSK's Nezeril and Nasin nasal sprays/drops products for cold and flu in Sweden; and</li><li>GSK's Panodil pain management products in Sweden.</li></ul><p>The company's commitments satisfied the EC, which concluded that the deal, proposed in April last year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">22 April 2014</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-NovartisGSKLilly-swapping-extravaganza-explained-351569" target="_new">2 May 2014</a>), could go ahead without raising competition concerns. </p><p>GSK told <i>Scrip </i>it was pleased with the outcome, and that none of conditions was unexpected. "We will aim to sell the brands as quickly as possible but it&rsquo;s too early to speculate on specific timeframes," the company said, adding that it was premature to discuss potential purchasers.</p><p>In a separate statement, the commission also approved the section of the deal which covers Novartis's acquisition of GSK's oncology portfolio. Here, the conditions were that Novartis should divest LGX818, a B-Raf inhibitor, and MEK162, a MEK inhibitor. The EC was worried that the deal would reduce competition by taking the number of companies developing and marketing B-Raf and MEK inhibitors for skin cancers from three to two; and reduce innovation as a result of "the likely abandonment" of Novartis's broad clinical trial program for LGX818 and MEK16, currently being trialed in a number of other cancers.</p><p>Novartis has already fulfilled these conditions, selling the two products back to Array for a negligible amount earlier this month (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Array-paying-next-to-nothing-for-Novartis-BRAF-inhibitor-356348" target="_new">24 January 2015</a>).</p><h2>Abbott/Mylan</h2><p>Meanwhile, Abbott and Mylan have also been given the go-ahead for their planned agreement, in which Mylan will acquire Abbott's branded generics business (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Abbott-sells-branded-generics-business-to-Mylan-352872" target="_new">14 July 2014</a>). Once again, though, the EC has insisted on divestments before giving its approval.</p><p>Mylan has committed to selling off four products in certain geographic areas to satisfy the EC's competition concerns. The divestments will include: mebeverine in Germany and the UK, pygeum africanum in France, betahistine in Ireland, and delorazepam in Italy.</p><p>Mylan was not immediately available to comment on the outcome.</p>
