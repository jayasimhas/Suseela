<p>Valentine's Day, and the public market's love-in with life science companies (meaning pharma/biotech/device/diagnostics firms) is cooling down. The paramours apparently will still date, just not as often and perhaps not as lavishly. </p><p>But it's not you, pharma! It&rsquo;s the markets: they have novelty fatigue. Nasdaq, the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and OTC Bulletin Board don&rsquo;t seem to want new stocks, or not as much, at least. Not right now, anyway.</p><p>Life science US IPOs are merely a case in point: to mid-February raised $750m in 2015, 45% down on last year's equivalent total, $1,315m. </p><p>But then, money raised from all IPOs was down, down 42% on 2014 levels. The number of US IPOs was down, too, from 42 to mid-February 2014 to 25 in 2015. Not as interested in IPOs, not at the moment. Not at 2014 prices.</p><p>Hurtfully, for those inside, life sciences companies and their public finance offerings can claim no special status with most investors, despite scientific biosizzle and healing potencies. From an investor perspective, life science may even be a sideshow.</p><p>In 2014, for instance, US life science IPOs raised over $8.6bn in the US. That&rsquo;s a lot of money, but its less than 10% of the total IPO capital raised in 2014. </p><p>Yes, in pharma/biotech's " best year ever", what IPO investors really liked were energy, financial services and e-commerce companies (15.3%, 17.9% and 29.5% of the 2014 IPO haul, respectively).</p><p>Even within life sciences, markets are picky. Two of the top six 2014 IPOs were cash-generating service businesses, Catalent and VWR, and two were cash-generating clinical research organizations, PRA Health Sciences, and INC Research. Markets probably like pharma but they prefer companies that sell stuff to pharma.</p><p>There is a bit of good news, though. In 2015 so far, life science companies' share of IPO value was much bigger (17.5%) than throughout the whole of 2014 (9.7%). But then again, early 2014 was just the same.</p><p>The most becoming assets for young fund-raising biocompanies in 2015 might be modesty, and a full understanding that investors have choices.</p>
