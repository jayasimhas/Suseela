<p>An Indian Subject Expert Committee (SEC) has recommended certain changes in Biocon's package insert for trastuzumab, the firm's biosimilar version of Roche's Herceptin, seemingly bringing to the fore simmering issues raked up by Roche in court hearings in a strongly contested case between the firms.</p><p>The SEC's recommendations come at what is ostensibly a critical juncture in the ongoing case in the Delhi High Court between plaintiff Roche on one side and partners Biocon and Mylan and the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on the other. This is against the backdrop of regulatory approvals for additional indications - early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer - for the biosimilar trastuzumab version. </p><p>Roche had, in a hearing last year, alleged that the package insert of the biosimilar version was a "slavish copy" of its package own insert. </p><p>The case is expected to be listed for further hearing on 13 August and the most recent decision earlier this month involved more twists. Biocon alleged that despite a previous order, Roche had "communicated" with the DCGI, "misleading" it and asking the regulator not to grant the approval of the carton, labels and package insert. </p><p>Last year, Biocon and Mylan, launched their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-launches-biosimilar-Herceptin-in-India-3497" target="_new">trastuzumab</a> brands on the Indian market under a co-development and commercialization alliance that covers a clutch of biosimilars including trastuzumab, etanercept, bevacizumab and adalimumab. </p><h2>Expert panel</h2><p>The SEC has now made nine suggestions for "improvement" relating to Biocon's package insert for "more clarity" including one that refers to the package insert for Hertraz (Mylan's trastuzumab brand) which was examined and found to be "significantly different" from CANMAb (Biocon's brand) and could lead to the "misinterpretation" as it is the "same product" with the package insert information is presented in different format.</p><p>"Therefore it was suggested to maintain a single package insert for the same product," the SEC (Oncology and Hematology), recommended at its meeting on 21 July.</p><p>Among other suggestions the SEC recommended that references related to the use of the drug in metastatic gastric cancer should be updated.</p><p>"In the section of Pk [Pharmacokinetics] in special populations, the statement appears to be contradictory and needs to be referenced with proper studies which indicates that distribution and elimination of the drug are not affected by age and renal impairment," the SEC said in an another suggestion. </p><p>The SEC also suggested that the warning and precautions may be given in a box and should be inserted before the pharmacokinetic data paragraph so that it is "in line with" the usual package insert presentation globally.</p><p>Significantly, the committee noted that with these suggestions, as such there is "no objection" for the content of the package insert submitted by Biocon based on the sources of the information cited by it.</p><p>Biocon did not respond to specific queries from <i>Scrip</i> but said that the SEC's recommendations on the draft package insert are in response to its submission to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) seeking amendments to the insert to reflect the approval it recently received for "extrapolation of indications." </p><p>"We cannot comment on this any further in view of our on-going litigation," Biocon told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Roche could not be reached right away for comments on the SEC's recommendations.</p><p>It is not immediately clear what affect, if any, the SEC's recommendation can have on the ongoing case.</p><p>India currently follows a three tier review process for clinical trials ahead of commercialization plans, under which applications are initially evaluated by specialized SECs. The recommendations of the SECs are then vetted by a technical review committee and finally cleared by an "apex committee."</p><h2>Court order </h2><p>Significantly, the most recent Delhi High Court order dated 6 July in the trastuzumab case refers to a series of allegations and counter-allegations by both sides, including one by the Indian firm suggesting that Roche may have tried to mislead the Indian regulator.</p><p>Roche, for its part, claims that it had "merely informed" the DCGI of an interim order passed against Biocon and had no intention to mislead the regulator. </p><p>Roche indicated that it has "no objection" if Biocon's application for approval of the carton, labels and package insert for additional indications be decided "on merits" after considering the orders passed by the court from time to time. </p><p>"If the same is granted, the plaintiffs would challenge the same in accordance with law," Roche's counsel is quoted as saying. </p><p>Biocon has also objected to the amendment applications filed by Roche in the case. Biocon claims that Roche is seeking to challenge the very approval granted by the DCGI and if that is allowed, it would "change the nature of the case."</p><p>The Indian firm claims that Roche's original plaint filed on 4 February 2014, chose not to challenge the approvals granted by the DCGI and even a subsequent court order did not grant an ad-interim injunction with respect to the sale or marketing or distribution of Biocon's biosimilar. </p><p>The Delhi High Court, in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-confident-on-biosim-Herceptin-in-India-despite-Roche-tactics-349941" target="_new">interim order</a> dated 5 February 2014, restrained both Biocon and Mylan from "relying upon or otherwise referring to" Roche's Herceptin and its second brands Herclon or Biceltis, or any data relating to trastuzumab marketed as the three brands cited. </p><p>Biocon underscored that there is also no restraint on the defendants from obtaining the approvals of additional indications as required under the law and added that the reading of Roche's applications for amendment suggest that it was belatedly attempting to "extend the scope" of the plaint by changing the "nature and character" of the suit. </p><p>The pleadings in the amendment applications are yet to be completed. </p><p>Meanwhile, the court has also laid down directions should Biocon receive regulatory approval for its specimen of the carton, labels and package insert for the proposed additional indications, including that a copy be filed along with an affidavit within one week from the date of approval. The court and Roche will also need to be informed two weeks in advance if after such approval the Indian firm intends to launch the product for the additional indications.</p>
