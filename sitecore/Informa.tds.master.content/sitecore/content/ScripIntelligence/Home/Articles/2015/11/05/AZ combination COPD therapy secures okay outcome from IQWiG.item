<p> AstraZeneca's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combination therapy Duaklir Genuair (aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate) has been granted a so-so outcome by Germany's health technology appraisal body IQWiG. </p><p>In positive news for AstraZeneca, IQWiG (Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare) said the fixed-dose bronchodilator treatment had a minor added benefit over other available COPD treatments for adult patients with moderate forms of the conditions (grade II). Furthermore, in patients with grade III cases of COPD, with fewer than two exacerbations per year, IQWiG considers AstraZeneca's product to offer "considerable added benefit."</p><p>But the HTA body said no conclusions could be drawn on greater or lesser benefit for more severely ill patients from the data they were presented. AstraZeneca had submitted data from three double-blind, randomized controlled approval studies with patients with moderate to severe COPD, in which the drug combination was directly compared with formoterol. However, for patients with COPD grade IV no evaluable data were available, IQWiG said. </p><p>Duaklir Genuair is part of a portfolio of respiratory products AstraZeneca purchased via a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-hoovers-up-Almirall-respiratory-in-2.1bn-deal-353099" target="_new">2014 deal</a> with Almirall for $875m upfront and up to $1.22bn in milestones. It is a fixed dose combination of two approved long-acting bronchodilators. Aclidinium bromide (Eklira) is a novel anticholinergic or long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA).</p><p>German regulator, the G-BA, will now conduct a commenting procedure and make a final decision on the extent of the added benefit for the product &ndash; which was granted approval for use in Europe in November 2014. </p><p>AstraZeneca has been boosting its respiratory portfolio following the huge deal it made with Almirall in the summer last year; in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-buys-Actavis-North-American-respiratory-business-356567" target="_new">February 2015</a> the drug maker paid $600m+ to acquire the rights to Actavis's branded respiratory business in the US and Canada. </p>
