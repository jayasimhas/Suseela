<p><p>Valeant International investor Bill Ackman wants you to forget all about this nonsense with Philidor and put your money into Valeant stock. </p><p>Ackman says this is just a case of bad public relations and the moral of the Valeant story is that "it's business as usual" at the company. Ackman insists that all of this talk of scandal by the media and investors is just a distraction from the solid business model the company has. </p><p>Ackman is the CEO and portfolio manager at Pershing Square Capital Management &ndash; Valeant's largest shareholder and owner of more than 5% of the company. He took a position in Valeant when the company was pursuing Allergan and was previously a major shareholder in Allergan. </p><p>Pershing Square Holdings, the publicly traded security of the hedge fund, has sustained some serious losses due to the problems at Valeant. The year-to-date return of its holdings as of Oct. 27 &ndash; which are posted weekly on its website &ndash; is a decline of 15.9%. Ackman admits that Valeant is the fund's largest holding. </p><p>As you can imagine, Ackman has come to Valeant's defense in hopes of recouping some of its losses and defending the actions of the company. Unfortunately for Valeant, Ackman doth protest too much. The hedge fund manager held a call with investors on the morning of Oct. 30. Ackman and his team &ndash; including a few lawyers &ndash; laid out a slew of previous scandals by other companies, including the recent allegations of misconduct at Novartis in a call that lasted upwards of three hours. </p><p>It seems that Ackman's thinking was to point out the wrongdoings and unlawful actions of other pharma companies, including big names like Pfizer, Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline. He noted that the largest fraud settlement by a pharma over the last two decades was $3bn and that Valeant was not included on the "wall of shame."</p><p>Current wall of shame leader is GlaxoSmithKline, which paid that whopping $3bn fine in 2012 for a slew of violations including unlawful promotion, kickbacks, concealing study findings and overcharging government health programs. Pfizer and Abbott Laboratories both show up next on the list for unlawful promotion and kickbacks, paying out $2bn and $1.5bn, respectively. Other pharma heavyweights like Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly & Co all fall in the top ten violators as well. </p><p><b>Legal Ramifications?</b></p><p>The wall of shame might be in the company's near future though. Valeant has watched its stock price drop by more than $100 per share in the last two months. The stock traded at a 52 week high of $263.81 and is now lingering at $97 per share, down a further 12% on Oct. 30. The stock drop has been caused by allegations from a variety of sources including the media and short sellers that Valeant has been hiding a relationship with <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Demystifying-Valeant-And-Philidor-361239" target="_new">a small specialty pharmacy</a> named Philidor. In recent days it has come to light that Valeant made $100m investment in the company with an option to buy that it never disclosed to investors and that Philidor may have been using some possibly illegal, and definitely unethical, methods to inflate Valeant prescription sales. </p><p>Valeant caved to outside pressures and announced on Oct. 30 that it will be severing all ties with Philidor and that the specialty pharmacy will be shuttering operations. During the Pershing Square call, Ackman told investors that Valeant is currently looking into a "plan B" for this distribution channel and is trying to find another specialty pharmacy practice channel. If the allegations are correct and some form of fraud has been committed by Philidor employees, some percentage of the 6%-7% of sales from Philidor will be lost &ndash; Ackman hopes at least 50% of those sales can be maintained. </p><p>The activist investor doesn't see this as a worst case scenario for the company. "I don't want to diminish the Philidor situation but Philidor sold toe nail fungus and acne medication for a few months," he said. He noted that Valeant and Philidor have only been involved for about a year and the pharmacy was growing at the time, likely limiting the amount of damage that could be done. </p><p>Pershing and Valeant have pointed out that no charges have been proven yet and that Valeant is not legally liable. They contend that Philidor operated with the same practices as any other specialty pharmacy and that there may have been "some actions on the fringe" that could be unlawful. </p><p>"If companies had to stop selling drugs every time a subpoena was issued, there would be no one left to sell drugs," contended Ackman. </p><p><b>Why Valeant?</b></p><p>So why then has Valeant been vilified and other big pharma companies let off the hook by investors? Ackman blames Valeant's poor PR investment. "A one person PR/IR team is not appropriate for a company this size," said Ackman on the call, who joked that CEO J. Michael Pearson could be seen as cheap for not investing more in the function. All joking aside, Ackman expressed his complete faith in both Valeant as "a highly reputable company" and Pearson. </p><p>But the billionaire hedge fund manager admits the debacle with Valeant and Philidor has taught him some lessons. "We've learned the importance of public relations. Sard Verbinnen was Valeant's PR firm," he said. "They also work on Herbalife. They've done a fantastic job for Herbalife and not for Valeant. I guess they were too busy."</p><p>"I think Valeant is going to be much more conscious in the future about entering into relationships that will have headline risk," he added, noting Valeant and its oft-criticized CEO needs to be more conscious of doing business dealings that could lead to salacious headlines. </p><p><p>
