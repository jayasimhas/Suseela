<p> Brace yourselves for a potential upsurge in action &ndash; both in price and probably elsewhere - in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor segment in India. </p> <p> Following AstraZeneca's unveiling of its second brand plans for saxagliptin and a fixed-dose combination of saxagliptin with metformin through Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the domestic firm, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, has now launched teneligliptin, a cut-price version of Mitsubishi Tanabe's Tenelia, in India via a dual brand approach. </p> <p> What perhaps makes Glenmark &quot;pioneering&quot; the product into India significant is that though Mitsubishi's Tenelia (teneligliptin) was launched in Japan in September 2012 with partner Daiichi Sankyo, the product has yet to be introduced in several key developed markets. </p> <p> An 8 May update on the state of new product development by Mitsubishi suggests that MP-513 (teneligliptin) is in Phase II in Europe and Phase I in the US and has been filed in Indonesia in April 2015. Mitsubishi is also developing a fixed-dose combination of teneligliptin and canagliflozin. </p> <p> Glenmark said that it is beginning to roll out its teneligliptin brands, Ziten and Zita Plus, at INR19.90 ($0.31) per tablet across India. </p> <p> &quot;Teneligliptin promises to be a game changer as it will lower the daily cost of treatment for a diabetes patient by around 60% as compared to other gliptins which are currently priced at around INR45 for a day&rsquo;s treatment. This translates into a saving of over INR10,000 per year,&quot; Glenmark said in an e-mail response. </p> <p> A report in the local media noted that other gliptins are presently being imported, while teneligliptin is the only gliptin to be manufactured in India. </p> <p> Mitsubishi could not immediately be reached for a comment on Glenmark's launch of teneligliptin in India. </p> <p> Some analysts tracking the development told <i>Scrip</i> that both Glenmark's dual-brand approach and the brand similarity with the firm's sitagliptin version are &quot;notable&quot;, given the crowded DPP-4 inhibitor space. </p> <p> India's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-court-blocks-Glenmarks-cut-price-Januvia-expedites-patent-case-358443%5d" target="_new">Supreme Court had earlier blocked</a> any fresh manufacture by Glenmark of its cut-price version of Merck &amp; Co's diabetes therapies Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride). The Court, however, permitted existing stock of Glenmark's generic versions Zita and Zitamet, to be sold in the market which, the court order noted, &quot;can take care of the current demand in the market for five to six months ie, September-November, 2015.&quot; </p> <h2> Trials </h2> <p> Glenmark also told <i>Scrip</i> that it had received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India for teneligliptin after conducting clinical trials on the molecule for over two years as per the regulatory requirements. </p> <p> Details on India's clinical trial registry of India indicate a Phase III trial to study the effect of teneligliptin tablet in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. The study involved a sample size of 237. </p> <p> The registry also lists a Glenmark study for a fixed-dose combination of teneligliptin and metformin tablet compared with metformin monotherapy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin alone. </p> <p> While more teneligliptin versions are likely to follow suit, the Indian firm, Intas, is also known to be developing anagliptin in Type-2 diabetes mellitus. </p> <h2> Patents </h2> <p> Significantly, data in the Indian Patent Office Journal dated March 2013 indicates that Mitsubishi had in July 2012 filed an application titled &quot;Elution-stabilized preparation&quot; pertaining to teneligliptin. It essentially disclosed a solid preparation which does not undergo the delay of elution of an active ingredient thereof even after the storage for a long period. </p> <p> &quot;Specifically disclosed is a teneligliptin containing solid preparation which contains teneligliptin a salt thereof or a solvate of teneligliptin or the salt in an amount 1.5 to 10 fold larger than the content that is desired to be contained in a solid preparation and which contains a teneligliptin containing part in a separated form,&quot; details in the journal said. </p> <p> The indications are that Mitsubishi's 2012 patent application may have been rejected, though <i>Scrip</i> could not immediately verify the reasons thereof. </p> <p> &quot;There is no granted enforceable patent on teneligliptin being launched by Glenmark under the brand names - Ziten and Zita Plus in India,&quot; Glenmark underscored. </p> <p> Glenmark had in 2012 filed a patent for a &quot;process for the preparation of teneligliptin&quot; but the Indian firm indicated that the patent had yet to be granted. </p> <p> Glenmark's new process is said to be directed towards the improvement in the manufacture of teneligliptin which would be industrially feasible and facilitate simple and cost effective manufacture of teneligliptin and salts thereof having better purity and yield. </p> <p> Last year, AstraZeneca had <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-hauls-Glenmark-to-Indian-court-over-saxagliptin-351036%5d" target="_new">moved the Delhi High Court</a> against Glenmark over intellectual property rights issues concerning its DPP-4 inhibitor for diabetes, Onglyza (saxagliptin), in India. Last month AstraZeneca unveiled <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-unveils-second-brand-play-in-India-358707%5d" target="_new">a second-brand plan</a> with Dr Reddy's Laboratories for saxagliptin and its combination with metformin. </p>
