<p>Eli Lilly's revenue fell 15% to $19.6bn in 2014 from $23.1bn in 2013, largely due to patent expirations for two of its top-selling products, but the company believes that 2015 could be the year that things turn around and investors seemed to agree.</p><p>"We enter this post-patent period in a position of strength and we are very optimistic about the opportunity before us," Lilly chief financial officer Derica Rice said on 30 January during Lilly's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call, after which the company's stock traded as high as $73.47 per share &ndash; a gain of almost 2% from the prior day. Indianapolis, Indiana-based Lilly ultimately closed down 0.2% at $72, however, on a down day for stocks in general.</p><p>While revenue fell 15% in 2014, sales gains and revenue from newly approved products shaved three percentage points from Lilly's revenue decline in the last three months of the year. The company reported fourth quarter revenue of $5.1bn, which was 12% below fourth quarter 2013 revenue of $5.8bn. Similarly, non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) were $2.78 for the year, down 33% from 2013, but fourth quarter revenue increased 1% to $0.75. </p><p>Lilly's 2014 results fell within the estimates of $19.4bn to $19.8bn in revenue and $2.72 to $2.80 in EPS that the company revealed in early January when it issued guidance for 2015 revenue and earnings: $20.3bn to $20.8bn and $3.10 to $3.20, respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-slips-on-outlook-355986" target="_new">7 January 2015</a>). </p><p>However, Lilly has now revised its 2015 forecast based on updated foreign currency exchange rates, which have had a negative impact on all big pharma earnings this year due to the strengthening value of the US dollar. The company now believes that 2015 revenue will fall between $19.5bn and $20bn, but it did not adjust EPS guidance, because it lowered marketing and research spending expectations.</p><p>"Revenue guidance reduction from [foreign exchange] headwind (-$800m at midpoint) is not unexpected given 'early' timing of the company's initial 2015 guidance and large recent currency moves," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote on 30 January.</p><p><b>Product performance</b></p><p>Sales for the depression and pain drug Cymbalta (duloxetine) plunged 68% from $5.1bn in 2013 to $1.6bn in 2014 and sales of the osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene) fell 60% from $1.1bn to $419.8m following US patent expirations in December 2013 and March 2014, respectively.</p><p>Lilly's top-selling drugs in 2014 provided just over half the revenue of the 2013 bestseller Cymbalta, but the company launched three new products in 2014: Cyramza (ramucirumab) for gastric and lung cancers as well as Jardiance (empagliflozin) and Trulicity (dulaglutide) for diabetes.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2014 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2013 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Difference</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Alimta</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Lung cancer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.8bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.7bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>3%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Humalog</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Diabetes</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.8bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.6bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>7%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cialis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Erectile dysfunction</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.3bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>6%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Humulin</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Diabetes </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.4bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.3bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>6%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Forteo</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Osteoporosis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.3bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>6%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Zyprexa</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Schizophrenia</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.2bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-13%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Strattera</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ADHD</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$738.5m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$709.2m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>4%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Effient</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Acute coronary syndrome</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$522.2m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$508.7m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>3%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>Cyramza generated $34m in sales during the fourth quarter, primarily from gastric cancer since the drug wasn't approved in the US for lung cancer until December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lillys-Cyramza-OKd-for-US-lung-cancer-patients-355643" target="_new">12 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Trulicity was launched during the fourth quarter after its US FDA approval in September (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lillys-Trulicity-OKd-can-it-top-GLP-1-market-354024" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>).

However, we believe it is very possible that a significant majority will break our way and solidify our near to medium-term growth prospects," Ms Rice said during the company's conference call.</p><p>Lilly also has several Phase I and II clinical trials planned or under way on its own and with partners. Highly anticipated Phase III results for the CETP inhibitor evacetrapib aren't expected until early 2016, but the company suggested that the market undervalues its oral cholesterol-lowering drug, especially since it was reformulated for Phase III and its being tested at a different dose than in prior studies. Also, results from the third Phase III solanezumab trial in Alzheimer's disease aren't due until 2016. </p><p>"2015 will be a year of execution for Lilly as it works to successfully rollout its new products (especially in diabetes and oncology) and deliver additional data from the pipeline, while we await potentially transformative pipeline data from solanezumab and evacetrapib in the 2016 timeframe," Credit Suisse's Dr Divan wrote.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
