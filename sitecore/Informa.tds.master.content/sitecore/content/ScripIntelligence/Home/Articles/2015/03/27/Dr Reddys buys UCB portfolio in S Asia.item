<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories has snapped up a select portfolio of UCB's established products business in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives for INR8bn ($128m), bolstering its presence in the high growth dermatology, respiratory and paediatric segments.</p><p>The deal value, which represents more than five times the 2014 revenues of UCB's acquired business of INR1.5bn, drew measured responses around the premium paid, with some experts referring to a potentially "decent" profitability of the acquired products, while others claiming that DRL's marketing strength could derive much more from the products. </p><p>"It appears to be a profitable portfolio and if that's so, 5-6 times revenues for the deal is not unheard of," the head of a Mumbai-based investment banking firm told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Others like Tarun Shah, founder of MP Advisors, a strategic business advisory firm, told <i>Scrip</i> that none of UCB's brands currently features in the top 200 list in India and given DRL's field strength, the Indian firm may able to propel these brands up the order. </p><p>"DRL may succeed in making the acquired brands much larger," Mr Shah said.</p><p>However, some analysts referred to the rich valuation for a relatively unattractive portfolio. </p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i> that the UCB deal appeared expensive on the face of it, though Dr Reddy's could perhaps be aiming at "massification" of the brands acquired.</p><p>"I don't think these brands have a deep penetration currently but probably have significant profitability," Mr Mehta said.</p><p>Some of the brands covered under the transaction include Atarax (hydroxyzine), Nootropil (piracetam), Zyrtec (cetirizine) and Xyzal (levocetirizine). The deal also entails the transfer of about 350 UCB employees to Dr Reddy's. </p><p>The transaction is expected to be closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2015-16.</p><p>It is not immediately clear if UCB's 2012 deal that saw the divestment of its Vapi site in India to the local firm Exemed Pharmaceuticals could indirectly concern the transaction with Dr Reddy's as well. The Vapi site manufactured certain mature UCB products for India and was then estimated to account for around 2% of total UCB volumes. The deal then included a multi-year supply agreement between UCB and Exemed.</p><h2>UCB India</h2><p>UCB isn't moving out of India lock, stock and barrel, at least not yet: the Belgian firm said that it expected to focus on its "core" business in the country.</p><p>"UCB is in a strong position with a solid platform for continuous growth thanks to our core products and our promising pipeline. This position allows us to enhance our focus on our key neurology portfolio in India, providing innovative solutions to patients living with severe diseases," Mark McDade, UCB's chief operating officer, said.</p><p>UCB, which was reported to be scaling back in India, was earlier said to have taken a measured approach to new launches in the country, largely disillusioned by the speed of introduction of generic copies and government-mandated price cuts <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Is-UCB-scaling-back-in-India-355718" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 December 2014)</a>. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
