<p>A draft House spending bill unveiled on 16 June would boost the fiscal year 2016 funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), but would defund the <i>Affordable Care Act</i>, or Obamacare, in the process.</p><p>The House Appropriations Committee legislation would not allow any funding for existing ObamaCare programs and would prohibit any new discretionary funding from being used to further implement the 2010 law if the bill succeeds.</p><p>But the bill calls for a $1.1bn increase for the NIH &ndash; a total a$31.2bn, which is $100m above what President Barack Obama had requested. </p><p>The bill would provide $150m for President Obama's BRAIN Initiative being run by the NIH &ndash; which is actually higher than the amount he <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">requested</a> earlier this year &ndash; and $200m for his <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a>.</p><p>If another bill that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">passed last month</a> by the House Energy and Commerce Committee &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Ac</i>t &ndash; is adopted by the Congress, the NIH would gain an additional $2bn in FY 2016, with the same amount added each year to the agency's budget over the following four years, for a total of $10bn extra. </p><p>The appropriators put total FY 2016 spending for Health and Human Services at $71.3bn, which is up by $298m over last year's level, but $3.9bn under what the president had asked lawmakers to provide the agency.</p><p>It's unlikely the figures in the subcommittee's bill will be the final amounts the full Congress allots. And any bill that seeks to defund Obamacare is likely to get vetoed by President Obama. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
