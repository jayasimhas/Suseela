<p>Competition in the fast growing Indian respiratory products market looks set to intensify with key players and traditional rivals, Cipla and GlaxoSmithKline, each outlining distinct new initiatives in the segment.</p><p>Cipla has announced its intent to launch a novel breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) with a dose counter (to be marketed as Synchrobreathe), a device which the Mumbai-based firm underscored is very simple to use and eliminates coordination challenges - the biggest issue faced by patients using conventional pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs).</p><p>What perhaps makes the development interesting is that rival, GSK Pharma, does not have a breath actuated MDI inhaler in India, though the multinational told <i>Scrip</i> that its Seretide Accuhaler is a breath actuated device which works at "lowest inspiratory flow rate".</p><p>While Cipla declined to comment on other companies' devices or get drawn into any comparisons, it told <i>Scrip</i> that with the innovative BAI design, Synchrobreathe "bridges gaps" with current inhalation devices.</p><p>"The design of the Synchrobreathe inhaler incorporates the compactness, portability and ease of use of pMDIs with the 'actuation on inspiration' and not based on press-and-breathe like conventional pMDIs," Cipla explained. </p><p>Another product attribute, low inspiratory flow required to actuate the inhaler, means that it can be used across a wide range of ages and in patients with severe lung impairment, the firm added.</p><p>Details around Synchrobreathe were presented earlier this month at the South Africa Thoracic Society (SATS) conference in Cape Town, and the company said that a launch in South Africa was "imminent" before the end of the year.</p><p>"Synchrobreathe is designed to become a global product for Cipla. Nevertheless, when the product will be reaching other markets is still under discussion," Cipla told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Analysts say that the key to the Synchrobreathe's potential success will be its pricing and Cipla confirmed that it expects to introduce the product at an "affordable cost" for patients. </p><p>In India, Cipla already has a number of products on the market in its Autohaler device and SynchroBreathe can be seen as a "novel and improved version", it added.</p><p>Cipla's range of devices includes the Autohaler, the first breath-actuated metered dose inhaler in India that is imported from 3M Pharmaceuticals, UK, details on its website said. </p><h2>GSK Pricing </h2><p>That pricing is critical in the Indian market is a given and in response GSK is set to take the bull by the horns, if a recent initiative is anything to go by.</p><p>Earlier this year, GSK Pharma India was reported to have slashed prices of its Seretide Accuhaler by 46% to INR540 ($8.3), a move that was expected to significantly expand access to the product in the country. </p><p>Industry experts told <i>Scrip</i> that while Seretide Accuhaler has generally been perceived as the device of choice by a large number of physicians in key metros, affordability issues meant that its use was generally limited to those with severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). </p><p>GSK India also launched the Ventorlin Mini Spacer, an add-on device to be used with the Ventorlin inhaler, for asthma and COPD patients in 2014-15, details in its latest annual report said.</p><p>Speculation is also rife that GSK may be refocusing its respiratory play in India, including a more aggressive price strategy, along the lines of its approach in China, though the two markets are rather different. There is, however, no official word on the India plan.</p><p>Globally, GSK is the leader in the respiratory space, but the Indian market has been dominated by domestic firms like Cipla for several decades. The Indian respiratory products market grew by 15.5% and is valued at about INR71.36bn as per July moving annual total (MAT) data from AIOCD AWACS, the market research agency that tracks retail sales.</p><p>GSK recently unveiled plans to voluntarily pare <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/PharmAsia-News-business-bulletin-359820" target="_new">prices of hepatitis B virus (HBV) products</a> in China, including a newly launched innovative therapy. </p><p>Last month GSK said that in the 2015 second quarter, international sales grew 1% pro forma, held back by the performance of the China business that recorded a 14% pro forma decline. GSK's CFO, Simon Dingemans, then referred to how the company continues to "reset" the China business for the future, "including new pricing policies designed to drive volume." </p><p>"We are also disposing of a number of peripheral businesses to sharpen our focus in the country," Dingemans said at the company's second quarter earnings conference call on July. 29.</p>
