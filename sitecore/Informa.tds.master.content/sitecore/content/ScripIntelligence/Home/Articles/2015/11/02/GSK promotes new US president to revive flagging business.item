<p>GlaxoSmithKline's US president of six years, Deidre Connelly, has retired, to make way for Jack Bailey, whom the company hopes will be able to revive the fortunes of the struggling unit. </p><p>Ms Connelly made the decision to retire from her role as president of US Pharmaceuticals following significant pressure as a result of the business's poor financial performance. In particular, the company's US respiratory portfolio has been making losses over the last year, with key product Advair (fluticasone) losing patent exclusivity and other products, such as Anoro (umeclidinium/vilanterol) and Breo (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol), failing to gain the traction it was hoped they would. US sales overall fell 10% last year. </p><p>Ahead of the company's full-year results, analysts at Leerink said there was a "lack of conviction in GSK's ability to successfully accelerate its respiratory portfolio in the US". Leerink analysts were also disappointed that there were few signs of a change in strategy or performance (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-AbbVie-AZ-Gilead-GSK-Lilly-Merck-Novo-Nordisk-and-Sanofi-356426" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 28 January 2015).</p><p>GSK is hoping that Mr Bailey will be able to provide this change. Though the company thanked Ms Connelly for her service, Abbas Hussain, president of global pharmaceuticals, added: "The US marketplace has changed significantly, with an exceedingly competitive payer landscape. As a result the entire sector is facing new challenges due to pressures on price and access."</p><p>Mr Hussain said that Mr Bailey, who joined GSK in 2009 and most recently served as senior vice-president of policy, payers and vaccines, had an extensive knowledge of the US marketplace. "With Jack heading the US business, we feel confident that we have the right experience to steer us through the current environment and deliver our strategy."</p><p>GSK is currently in the process of restructuring, with 900 redundancies expected in North Carolina and Philadelphia in a bid to save $1bn (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Job-cuts-as-GSK-reveals-US-restructuring-details-355407" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 4 December 2014). The changes are all geared towards getting the company ready for its shift in focus following its mega-deal with Novartis in April 2014.</p><p>In addition to Mr Bailey's promotion, Deborah Waterhouse, currently senior vice-president and business unit head of US Vaccines has been appointed senior vice-president US Primary Care. And Patrick Desbiens, currently senior vice-president and general manager of GSK France, will join the US business as senior vice-president of the Vaccines Business Unit.</p>
