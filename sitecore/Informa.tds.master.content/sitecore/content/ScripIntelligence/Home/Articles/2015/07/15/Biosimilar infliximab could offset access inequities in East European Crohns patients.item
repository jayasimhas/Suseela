<p>Introduction of biosimilar Remicade (infliximab) to treat Crohn's disease is expected to provide substantial savings in six central and east European (CEE) countries. As Johnson & Johnson revealed the impact that the launch of Celltrion's Remsima is having on sales of Remicade, Hungarian health economists are forecasting that budget savings from use of the biosimilar, priced at just a 25% discount, could fund treatment in almost a third more patients.</p><p>The researchers' model considered three scenarios &ndash; a reference scenario where no biosimilar is available, a scenario where interchange between Remicade and the biosimilar is not allowed (BSc1) and a scenario that assumed that 80% of patients were switched to the biosimilar from six months (BSc2). </p><p>In 2013, the number of Crohn's disease patients on biologics and the biological treatment rates in the six countries was as follows: Bulgaria 46 (0.7%); the Czech Republic 990 (11.3%); Hungary 1,870 (19.1%); Poland 888 (2.8%); Romania 223 (1.5%); and Slovakia 690 (18.7%). </p><p>Estimating the potential budget impact biosimilar infliximab to treat Crohn's disease in the six countries, the health economists suggest that cost savings may enable treatment of 722 to 1,530 additional patients. The results have been published in the <a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737167.2015.1067142" target="_new">July issue</a> of <i>Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research</i>.</p><p>"Over a three year time horizon, total budget savings achieved were &euro;8m ($8.8m) and &euro;16.9m in BSc1 and BSc2, respectively. These patient numbers clearly highlight the tangible benefits of using biosimilars for patients, physicians as well as for healthcare payers," the authors noted. The researchers believe the introduction of biosimilar infliximab, even at a 25% discount to Remicade, would enhance the increasing access to biological therapy in CEE countries.</p><p><b>Related story:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/JandJs-Gorsky-stands-by-Remicade-longevity-as-biosimilar-impact-hits-Europe-359437" target="_new">J&J's Gorsky stands by Remicade longevity as biosimilar impact hits Europe</a></p><p><p>
