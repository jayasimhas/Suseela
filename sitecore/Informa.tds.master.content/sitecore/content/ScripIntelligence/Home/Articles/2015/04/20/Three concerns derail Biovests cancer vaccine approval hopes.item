<p>Biovest's investigational personalized cancer vaccine Lympreva, formerly known as BiovaxID (dasiprotimut-T), has been given a negative opinion by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The committee, which examines marketing authorization applications before handing over its opinion for the European Commission to make a final decision, said that the principal study's design and execution was "inadequate [...] to establish the medicine's benefit". </p><p>Lympreva had been filed for approval to maintain the absence of cancer symptoms when used in combination with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma whose disease signs had disappeared following an induction treatment.</p><p>The CHMP also said the effectiveness of Lympreva following induction treatment with the current standard of care (anti-CD20 therapies) had not been demonstrated. </p><p>Thirdly, it said, it had some concerns regarding some aspects of the manufacture and quality control of the medicine.</p><p>"The CHMP was of the opinion that the benefits of Lympreva did not outweigh its risks," the EMA reported. There are no ongoing clinical trials or compassionate use programs with the drug, so its future looks gloomy unless Biovest decides to appeal and succeeds.</p><p>Biovest's marketing authorization application (MAA) was accepted by the EMA in December 2013. However, the company and its autologous cancer vaccine have had a troubled history.</p><p>Biovest International (based in Minneapolis) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biovest-emerges-from-bankruptcy-with-new-CEO-344999" target="_new">emerged from its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy re-organization</a> in July 2013 with a new CEO. Before that, in August 2012, the FDA had insisted despite the company's pleadings that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-FDA-insists-on-2nd-Phase-III-trial-for-BiovaxID-Biovest-tumbles-334001" target="_new">a second Phase III trial would be needed</a> to secure US approval of BiovaxID. The new CHMP opinion was issued on the basis of just the one trial.</p><p>Lympreva is prepared individually for each patient using a sample of their own lymphoma cells. Biovest's technology links the unique protein, or idiotype, expressed by the patient's cancerous B-cells to a foreign immunogenic protein, hemocyanin, that is then administered with an immune-enhancing agent, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as an injection under the skin. The vaccine is designed to train the body's immune system to recognize the idiotype as a foreign invader to trigger an immune response that delays or prevents cancer recurrence.</p><p>One hope with BiovaxID had been that unlike other personalized cancer vaccines &ndash; notably Dendreon's Provenge in prostate cancer &ndash; its commercial prospects would not be stymied by complicated, high-cost production. The company had indicated it should be more affordable and could be manufactured in one centralized facility using processes adapted from traditional antibody production processes. </p><p>Biovest was not immediately available for comment on its next steps, including whether it would request a re-examination of the opinion.</p>
