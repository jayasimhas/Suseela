<p>Just how well is the industry doing so far this year when it comes to novel drug approvals? In January, <i>Scrip</i> decided to take a look at ten of the more interesting new products that were set for approval in the US and EU in 2015. </p><p>The story has proved by far the most popular on <i>Scrip</i>'s site this year to date, confirming (if confirmation were needed) that R&D innovation is right at our readers' hearts. </p><p>That being so, we decided to take advantage of the summer lull to check up on our hot approval prospects' progress. And their report cards, for the most part, make for encouraging reading. </p><p><b>Novartis's <i>Cosentyx</i> (secukinumab) </b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>Expected US &ndash; January 2015 (Actual &ndash; January)</p><p>Expected EU &ndash; January 2015 (Actual &ndash; January)</p><p>Already approved in Japan at the end of 2014, Novartis's anti-IL17A monoclonal antibody got the go-ahead in the US and EU in January for use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the first of a number of indications for the product (others include ankylosing spondylitis). The product is the most advanced of this new class of anti-inflammatories, with rivals including Amgen/AstraZeneca's brodalumab and Lilly's ixekizumab. </p><p>Sales have got off to a solid start, booking $30m in the second quarter from launches in the US, Switzerland, Japan, Canada and some EU countries. However, the product was dropped from Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis in February after disappointing Phase III data<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartis-concedes-defeat-with-Cosentyx-in-RA-356500" target="_new">, joining AstraZeneca's similar product brodalumab</a> on the failures list for this indication. </p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $804m in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Amgen's T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec) </b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>Expected US &ndash; June (Actual &ndash; still awaiting approval) </p><p>Expected EU &ndash; by end of February (Actual &ndash; still awaiting approval) </p><p>This first-in-class melanoma immunotherapy was filed first in the EU last September based on positive Phase III data. While riding on the current wave for immune-based treatments for oncology there has been some doubt over its commercial potential in the increasingly crowded melanoma field. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Amgens-T-Vec-with-caveats-358133" target="_new">An FDA panel on 29 April</a> endorsed T-Vec, saying it has an overall favorable benefit-risk profile to support traditional approval as an injectable treatment for regionally or distantly metastatic melanoma. But this support came with several caveats that look set to limit its approved indication greatly and the product is still stalled at the regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Its PDUFA date is now Oct. 27, 2015. Amgen is now concentrating on combining the product with other IO products, notably Merck's PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab). </p><p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $115m in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Sanofi's <i>Toujeo</i> (glargine U300) </b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>Expected US &ndash; May 2015 (Actual &ndash; approved in February, launched in March)</p><p>Expected EU &ndash; between April and October (Actual &ndash;approved in May, first launches in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark in July)</p><p>Sanofi's follow-on to Lantus (one of this year's major patent losers) is a more concentrated and longer-lasting formulation of its original glargine product. Toujeo is key in Sanofi's efforts to shift sales from Lantus and fight off competition from Novo Nordisk's similar offering Tresiba (insulin degludec), as it faces flattening sales in its diabetes franchise. Analysts have been sceptical that its advantages are enough to secure enough sales, but the product seems to have got off to a promising start. </p><p>Sanofi has been pushing US access to the product aggressively through pricing and rebates to encourage switching, and at the end of the second quarter, 73% of lives covered by commercial health care plans in the US have unrestricted access to Toujeo, including 45% of lives with preferred Tier 2 access. In Medicare Part D, 91% of lives are covered with unrestricted access to Toujeo. Total Q2 sales were &euro;13m.</p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $3.7bn in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Amgen/Astellas' <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab) and Sanofi/Regeneron's <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab)</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>Repatha Expected US &ndash; August (Actual &ndash; August 27)</p><p>Repatha Expected EU &ndash; August to February 2016 (Actual &ndash; July 21)</p><p>Praluent Expected US &ndash; July (Actual &ndash; July 24)</p><p>Praluent Expected EU &ndash; September </p><p>These two cholesterol-lowering proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor products have danced around each other on their way to major market approvals. Amgen was first to file evolocumab (Repatha) in the US, and was accepted for a standard review by the FDA, setting a PDUFA action date of Aug. 27, when it was duly approved. But Sanofi and Regeneron's Praluent (alirocumab), though filed later, leapfrogged Repatha by virtue of a priority review voucher purchased from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, meaning its application was reviewed in six rather than 10 months of acceptance &ndash; i.e., by July 24. All eyes were on that PDUFA date when Amgen blindsided with the first worldwide approval of Repatha in the EU on July 21 with a promisingly broad label. Amgen had first nosed ahead in the EU when Repatha was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Repatha-edges-ahead-in-the-EU-with-CHMP-nod-358578" target="_new">granted a positive opinion</a> by the CHMP at its May meeting, and the subsequent approval came nicely in advance of the usual three-month lag. This put it well ahead of Praluent, which was only accepted for review by the EMA in January 2015. Indeed, Praluent received its CHMP nod three days later, co-incidentally on July 24, when it, as expected, pulled off the first US PCSK9 approval. Next the two products will continue their waltz through the reimbursement processes. Expect to remain a bit dizzy. </p><p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $5.2bn for evolocumab and $5.0bn for alirocumab in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Pfizer/Amgen's <i>Ibrance</i></b> (<b>palbociclib)</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; April (Actual &ndash; approved and launched in February) </p><p>EU &ndash; not yet filed </p><p>The FDA approved Pfizer's NDA for palbociclib a few months ahead of schedule in February and it has got off to a cracking start on the market. </p><p>It was approved as a first-line therapy in combination with letrozole as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease. The FDA had previously granted a priority review to the application and given the drug Breakthrough Therapy Status. The highly specific, orally active, small-molecule inhibits CDK4/6, over-activated in many cancers, leading to loss of proliferative control. </p><p>Sales in the second quarter came in at almost twice analyst consensus at $140m. And there is more to come: in April, the product also hit its progression-free survival primary endpoint in the Phase III PALOMA-3 study in a new breast cancer population, stopping the trial early. Pfizer will seek an expanded US label in the fourth quarter, shortly after it files it application in the EU, due in the third quarter. </p><p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $1.7bn in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Eisai's <i>Lenvima</i> (lenvatinib)</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; April (Actual &ndash; approved and launched in February) </p><p>EU Expected &ndash; May to November (Actual &ndash; approved in June)</p><p>Eisai says the product is the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the kinase activities of FGFR 1-4 as well as VEGFR 1-3. It received <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Eisais-thyroid-cancer-drug-Lenvima-OKd-for-US-market-356758" target="_new">its US approval</a> earlier than expected for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EUs-CHMP-gives-accelerated-go-ahead-for-Eisais-lenvatinib-357548" target="_new">an accelerated EU approval</a> following in June, based on the SELECT study in progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. However, in the UK the firm has fallen foul of changes in the Cancer Drugs Fund, which has said it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Eisai-hit-with-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-double-Whammy-359589" target="_new">won't be assessing Lenvima</a> for thyroid cancer.</p><p>The orphan indication is the first for lenvatinib, which is seen as a successor to Halaven (eribulin), but its major sales potential lies in liver cancer, for which filings will start in east Asia this year. Here lenvatinib will have to go up against Bayer/Amgen's Nexavar (sorafenib) which dominates first-line hepatocellular carcinoma therapy, but Eisai has been confident enough to pitch it head to head in Phase III. </p><p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p><p><p><b>Roche/Exelixis's cobimetinib</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; August (now November)</p><p>EU Expected &ndash; by the end of 2015</p><p>Roche US subsidiary Genentech is seeking US approval to market cobimetinib (GDC-0973, XL518) in combination with the companies' already approved drug Zelboraf (vemurafenib) for patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma. Cobimetinib is a MEK inhibitor (discovered by Exelixis), while Zelboraf is a BRAF inhibitor: combining the two mechanisms of action is expected to change the standard of care in this indication, by providing more complete blockade of the MAP kinase pathway to delay the emergence of resistance. </p><p>The US application got off to a promising start with the FDA in February granting a priority review for the combination treatment, setting Aug. 11 as the PDUFA action date on the application, which was submitted last December.</p><p>But in late June, the FDA pushed back the action date by the standard three month extension period to Nov. 11 in order to accommodate its review of a supplemental data submission. FDA extended its review after Genentech submitted, at FDA request, additional data from coBRIM, the Phase III registrational trial of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma. An EU filing was made last September, and encouragingly the product has just received approval in Switzerland, its first market worldwide.</p><p><p>Roche's MEK/BRAF combo is set to challenge Novartis's (formerly GlaxoSmithKline's before their asset swap deal) similar combination of the BRAF inhibitor Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and the MEK inhibitor Mekinist (trametinib), which is already approved in the US, and came a step closer in the EU recently, with an approval for Mekinist monotherapy earlier in July (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Mekinist-approved-in-Europe-but-commercial-success-uncertain-352696" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 July 2014</a>). GSK had earlier been forced to pull its EU filing for the combination of the two products after the CHMP demanded more clinical data but in July, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation.</p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $140m in 2023 </p><p><p><b>GlaxoSmithKline/PDL BioPharma's <i>Bosatria</i> (mepolizumab) </b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; November </p><p>EU Expected &ndash; October to April 2016 </p><p>Approval are still awaited in the US and EU for GlaxoSmithKline's first-in-class interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody mepolizumab as a maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, but the product won the full support of an FDA advisory panel on June 11. </p><p>Asthma often is characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils in lung tissue, and eosinophil levels often correlate with severity and frequency of exacerbations of asthma. IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival, and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. If approved it will become the first biologic for asthma since Roche/Novartis's Xolair (omalizumab). </p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p><p><p><b>Novartis's <i>Entresto</i> (sacubitril/valsartan formerly LCZ696)</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; year-end (Actual &ndash; July) </p><p>EU Expected &ndash;year-end </p><p>This first-in-class dual inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor and neprilysin for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction received a priority FDA review in February and swept its way to market immediately upon <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Payers-expected-to-embrace-Novartis-heart-failure-drug-Entresto-359294" target="_new">approval on July 7</a>. It has also received an accelerated assessment at the EU's CHMP, taking 150 days, rather than 210 days to review, and a CHMP opinion is expected shortly. It is also under review in Canada and Switzerland. </p><p>Entresto's clinical data have been highly impressive, even game changing. In the PARADIGM-HF study, it led to 20% fewer cardiovascular deaths, 21% fewer hospitalizations and a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the ACE inhibitor therapy enalapril, the previous gold standard of treatment. Entresto combines the moieties of the neprilysin inhibitor prodrug AHU377 (sacubitril) and the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan (Novartis's now off-patent Diovan) in one compound. </p><p>Novartis set Entresto's wholesale acquisition cost at $12.50 per day, less discounts, which it said was in line with the current price of other new cardiovascular therapies "and well below other recently launched life-saving products for other diseases" and payers are expected to look favorably upon it. </p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: $6.0bn in 2023 </p><p><p><b>Otsuka/Lundbeck's <i>Rexulti</i> (brexpiprazole)</b></p><p>Approvals: </p><p>US Expected &ndash; July (Actual &ndash; approved July 10)</p><p>EU Expected &ndash; not yet filed </p><p>Otsuka and Lundbeck released promising Phase III data for their novel anti-psychotic brexpiprazole just as the US FDA accepted their NDA for review both as a treatment for schizophrenia and as an adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder (MDD) last September. The FDA duly approved it as expected in July and it was launched as Rexulti in early August, but it is still to be filed in the EU. Brexpiprazole acts through a common antipsychotic mode of action, similar to the companies' blockbuster brand Abilify (aripiprazole), displaying partial agonism of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. Specifically, it is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM) that acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors at similar potency, and an antagonist at 5-HT2A and noradrenaline alpha1B/2C receptors. As an atypical antipsychotic it is following a well-trodden path as augmentation therapy in MDD; indeed, Abilify and Seroquel XR (AstraZeneca's quetiapine extended release) are both approved for this indication in the US. However, the companies accelerated the process by filing for both indications simultaneously. </p><p>Datamonitor sales forecast: Not available </p><p>Read the original story from January here: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/10-drug-approvals-to-watch-for-in-2015-356016" target="_new">'10 drug approvals to watch for in 2015'</a></p>
