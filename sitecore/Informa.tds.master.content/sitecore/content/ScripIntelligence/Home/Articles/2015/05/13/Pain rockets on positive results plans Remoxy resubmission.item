<p>Pain Therapeutics, which has struggled for years trying to get its investigational extended-release oral formulation of oxycodone, known as Remoxy, to the US market is ready to try again at the FDA, which has twice before rejected the drug.</p><p>The company said it plans to re-file its new drug application (NDA) with the FDA in the first quarter of 2016.</p><p>A big help to that effort is the new top-line results from human abuse potential study, which demonstrated statistical significance, showing that intact and chewed Remoxy were less "liked" than immediate-release oxycodone on the two primary endpoints &ndash; drug liking and drug high. </p><p>Shares of Pain rocketed 88% on 12 May, before closing at $2.62, up 68 cents, or 35%.</p><p>The FDA initially rejected Remoxy, a gel capsule containing a tar-like hard liquid intended to deter abuse, which was developed using Durect's Oradur technology, in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Remoxy-receives-FDA-complete-response-letter-21827" target="_new">December 2008</a> and then again in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Pain-Therapeutics-Durect-take-a-beating-over-US-FDA-rejection-of-Remoxy-317674" target="_new">June 2011</a>.</p><p>Pain had inked a development and commercialization deal in 2005 with King Pharmaceuticals, now part of Pfizer. King then assumed full control of the development of Remoxy in March 2009.</p><p>But then this past October, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizers-surprise-Remoxy-withdrawal-slashes-Pain-Durect-prices-by-half-354711" target="_new">Pfizer bailed out</a> of its deal with Pain &ndash; declaring its internal review of top-line results of five trials it was running on the drug lead it to discontinue the relationship.</p><p>Pain's CEO, Remi Barbier, however, said "the data we've seen absolutely supports re-filing the Remoxy NDA."</p><p>Before returning Remoxy to Pain, Pfizer had completed studies examining comparative bioequivalence, dose proportionality, alcohol interaction, effect of food and human abuse potential.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
