<p>When it comes to defending its intellectual property, AstraZeneca doesn't shy away from using the American court system against firms trying to "capture and infringe on our patents," said Dr Scott Alban, vice president of global intellectual property and innovative medicines and MedImmumne R&D.</p><p>"We're a company that has a robust history of protecting our IP successfully," Dr Alban told <i>Scrip</i> at the US Commerce Department's 2015 SelectUSA Summit, which was held just outside of Washington.</p><p>But, he said, having to address patent disputes through the legal system is "incredibly expensive," and AstraZeneca would "love to be spending that dollar on R&D and not on courts."</p><p>Nonetheless, "When our IP is ignored or unnecessarily challenged, we respond appropriately to protect and defend our IP rights," Dr Alban said.</p><p>With the cost of R&D "tremendous," and shareholders expecting accountability, the company must ensure it has strong investment in its intellectual property protection, he said.</p><p>"It's so important to us to have a predictable and reliable system, so that our business model continues to work," he said.</p><p>"Frankly, the generic companies aren't going to be developing the next best medicine," Dr Alban said. "They have a role, but it's very different than our role. Our role is to push the boundaries of science to discover new medicines."</p><p>"We are so passionate about discovering new medicines," Dr Alban added. </p><p>He noted that in 2014, AstraZeneca achieved a record six new product approvals in the US &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-defies-advisers-OKs-AZs-ovarian-cancer-drug-Lynparza-355773" target="_new">Lynparza</a> (olaparib), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-AstraZenecaBMS-SGLT2-Farxiga-requires-6-postmarketing-studies-349189" target="_new">Farxiga</a> (dapaglifozin), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/FDA-nod-for-AstraZenecas-Epanova-but-prospects-look-weak-351618" target="_new">Epanova</a> (omega-3-carboxylic acids), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AZNektar-constipation-drug-Movantik-OKd-353980" target="_new">Movantik</a> (naloxegol), <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZenecas-lipodystrophy-drug-Myalept-OKd-in-US-FDA-wants-15-studies-350247" target="_new">Myalept</a> (metreleptin for injection) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-clears-AstraZenecas-SGLT2-metformin-combo-Xigduo-XR-354773" target="_new">Xigduo XR</a> (dapagliflozin and metformin).</p><p>The firm's three areas of focus are oncology, respiratory and cardiovascular-metabolic diseases. </p><p>"We have transformed our R&D organization in the last two years and are making significant progress towards achieving scientific leadership in our main therapeutic areas," Dr Alban said. "We think we've got a tremendous pipeline &ndash; one of the industry's best."</p><p>He said oncology, in particular, is a therapy area in which "we have deep-rooted heritage and will be potentially transformational for the company's future." </p><p>"Our vision is to help patients by redefining the cancer treatment paradigm and by 2020, we are aiming to bring six new cancer medicines to patients," Dr Alban said.</p><p>He emphasized that AstraZeneca is one of the very "pure-play innovator companies." </p><p>"We are all in in innovation and science," Dr Alban declared. </p><p>He noted that AstraZeneca's business model also includes external partnering or business development opportunities "to bolster our portfolio in our main therapeutic areas and to create value from the strong science that exists in our pipeline."</p><p>A big topic at this year's SelectUSA was the ongoing negotiations over trade, specifically, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), as well as giving President Barack Obama trade promotion authority, often referred to as fast track.</p><p>Dr Alban said the lack of transparency around the TPP and TTIP negotiations is "challenging" for drug makers.</p><p>"We hear scuttlebutt, but we don't have all the facts," he said.</p><p>"In my area, IP, I get concerned when I hear rumors around the data protection not being the same as US law, like 12 years for biologics, for example," Dr Alban said. "Biologics is a huge part of our business, and if that's not respected and they go for a lower threshold, that's concerning to me."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
