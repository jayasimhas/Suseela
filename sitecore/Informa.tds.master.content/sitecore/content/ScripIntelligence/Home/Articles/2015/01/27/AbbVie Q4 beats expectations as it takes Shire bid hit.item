<p>AbbVie's Q4 results exceeded analysts' expectations, with the company reporting continued strong performance for Humira, and early optimism surrounding the recent launch of its hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak.</p><p>Overall it reported a net loss of $810m, or $0.51 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $1.1bn ($0.70 a share) in the same quarter in 2013, owing to its failed bid to acquire Shire (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-drops-Shire-bid-354511" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16 October 2014</a>). </p><p>Once special items largely related to the bid to acquire Shire were excluded, the quarter looked much more healthy: adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.89, ahead of consensus expectations of around $0.85, and fourth quarter 2013 EPS of $0.70.</p><p>AbbVie noted that the impact of the Shire termination comprised the breakup fee ($0.66), mark-to-market and exit of certain foreign currency positions ($0.24) and other costs ($0.10). It added that an additional $0.08 of Shire-specific charges would be booked in the first quarter of 2015 to reflect the completed liquidation of remaining foreign currency positions. </p><p>Worldwide adjusted sales were up by 5.1% to $5.42bn in the fourth quarter, again ahead of the consensus of $5.37bn. On an operational basis, adjusted sales increased 8.9%, excluding a 3.8% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, AbbVie noted. Worldwide sales under US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) were $5.5bn, up 6.7% on a reported basis and up 10.4% operationally</p><p>The growth in fourth quarter sales was largely down to a 10.6% increase (or 14.4% on an operational basis, excluding the forex impact) in revenues from the mega-blockbuster Humira (adalimumab) to $3.4bn. Operational growth from Synagis ($298m, +4.9%), Creon ($151m, + 30.6%) and Duodopa ($56m, +25.4%) also contributed. </p><p>However, this was offset by generic competition for a number of products, including AndroGel (testosterone gel) which dropped by 20% to $230m. </p><p><b>Hello Viekira</b></p><p>Sales of Viekira were $48m for the quarter following the 19 December FDA approval of the all-oral, interferon-free treatment, for use with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of patients with chronic genotype 1 (GT1) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including those with compensated cirrhosis.</p><p>Just days later, one pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts set a precedent for new, high-priced drugs in the US when it negotiated a deal with AbbVie that gave Viekira Pak exclusive reimbursement for patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C.</p><p>The agreement excluded coverage for other expensive new hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies &ndash; the blockbusters Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) from Gilead Sciences and Olysio (simeprevir) from Johnson & Johnson's Janssen subsidiary (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 December 2014</a>). The size of the discount from the $83,319 list price for a 12-week treatment course was not disclosed by either party, but is thought to be significant.</p><p>During a conference call to discuss the results AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez acknowledged to analysts the fierce competition for such deals, and said more were expected to be finalized over the next month. He added that the company felt good about the early days of its product's performance, and expects about 40% of people with insurance coverage from a managed care company will be able to access Viekira Pak. Overall Viekira sales could reach $3bn in 2015, AbbVie expects, as it is rolled out in other markets including the EU.</p><p>For the full year, net sales in 2014 were $19.96bn compared with $18.79bn for 2013, with net earnings at $1.8bn and $4.1bn respectively. </p><p>AbbVie is confirming its adjusted diluted earnings-per-share guidance for the full-year 2015 of $4.25 to $4.45, which it says reflects industry-leading growth versus the prior year.</p><p>
