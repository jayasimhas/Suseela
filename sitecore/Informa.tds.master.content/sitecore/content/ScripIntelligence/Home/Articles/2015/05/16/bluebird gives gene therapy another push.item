<p><p>Just days after reaching an agreement with regulators regarding a path forward for its gene therapy, bluebird bio has announced topline results from its ongoing early stage trial that show the drug could have the potential to be curative. </p><p>Results from the ongoing Phase I/II HGB-205 trial of LentiGlobin BB305 in patients with beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease show that patients with both diseases remained transfusion independent as of February 2015. </p><p>The abstract, submitted to the European Hematology Association meeting in June, showed that a patients with sickle cell disease had levels of HbA-T87Q of 24% at 4.5 months after transplant, compared with levels of 9.6% at three months. At the 4.5 month mark, the patient had total anti-sickling hemoglobin of 31.6%. The patient has not needed hospitalization for any disease-related complications since the transplant. </p><p>The company noted in a statement that any patients who achieve total anti-sickling of 30% or greater have the potential to reduce or eliminate the serious and life-threatening events associated with SCD.</p><p>"As noted in the abstract, we are pleased to report that the two patients with beta-thalassemia major, on whom we first reported last year at EHA, remained transfusion independent at 14 and 11 months post-transplant. In addition, it is very encouraging that the patient with sickle cell disease is increasing production of HbA-T87Q, which has anti-sickling properties, and has not had a post-treatment hospitalization for a sickle cell disease-related event. At EHA we will present further follow up data on all three subjects," said bluebird bio Chief Medical Officer David Davidson. </p><p>Sickle cell disease occurs when the hemoglobin in the blood becomes crescent-shaped and sticky, instead of its normal disc shape, making it harder for the blood to move oxygen through the body. Patients usually undergo frequent blood transfusions, but that does not provide a cure for the disease.</p><p>"We believed that the early success observed in beta-thalassemia would be repeated in SCD, as both are diseases caused by a defective hemoglobin gene. Though this is only one SCD patient, we are encouraged by the positive data. Often for orphan indications, proof of concept comes in small patient numbers," wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy, who expects the company's gene therapy products &ndash; including LentiGlobin &ndash; to be approved in 2018. </p><p>Bluebird <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/bluebird-to-seek-early-approvals-for-blood-disorder-drug-358502" target="_new">announced 19 May</a> that it intends to seek early approvals in the US and EU for the treatment in patients with beta-thalassemia major. The company plans to seek accelerated approval from the FDA and conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency. </p><p>Based on its discussions with the regulatory agencies, bluebird bio said the data from planned trials, plus its ongoing beta-thalassemia major clinical studies &ndash; Northstar and HGB-205 &ndash; could form the basis for a biologics license application submission for LentiGlobin BB305.</p><p>Shares of bluebird rose on the news, adding 4.83%, or $8.00, to trade at $173.71. </p><p><p>
