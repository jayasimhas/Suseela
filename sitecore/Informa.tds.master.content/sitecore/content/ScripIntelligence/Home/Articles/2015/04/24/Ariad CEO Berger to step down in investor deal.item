<p>Ariad's CEO Harvey Berger is to retire from the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech firm following mounting pressure from activist investor Sarissa Capital Management. Investors welcomed news of the agreement as the firm's stock rose from $8.87 at the end of 28 April to $9.27 by 10.30 am on 29 April following the announcement.</p><p>As part of the deal with Sarissa, Dr Berger will stay on as CEO until 31 December 2015, or until a replacement is found. A search committee, formed by the board of directors and chaired by Alex Denner, Sarissa's founder and chief investment officer will seek out Dr Berger's replacement. </p><p>Also as part of the agreement, Anna Protopapas, CEO of Mersana Therapeutics, and one of Sarissa's nominees to replace Dr Berger, has been appointed to the board of directors. In addition, Sarissa will withdraw its list of proposed nominees for directors and will vote all of its shares in favor of the board's nominees.</p><p>Sarissa is Ariad's biggest investor with a 6.9% stake in the company and has been working to secure Dr Berger's retirement <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Is-activist-investor-looking-to-remove-Ariad-CEO-Berger-356759" target="_new">since February</a>. It sought to replace him, as well as an independent member of the company's board of directors, with two Sarissa-backed nominees. In an SEC filing that month it said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarissa-seeks-Ariad-CEOs-retirement-board-member-replacements-356877" target="_new">it was negotiating with certain board members</a> to bring about Dr Berger's retirement without initiating a proxy fight, but that no agreement could be reached. Investors appeared to support the move to replace Dr Berger as the company's stock price rose by 10.7%.</p><p>Ariad's stock took a hit and never really recovered after the firm's leukemia drug, Iclusig (ponatinib) was removed from the market following safety concerns in October 2013. </p><p>Dr Berger founded Ariad 23 years ago. He will continue to receive his current cash compensation and participate in the company&rsquo;s employee benefit plans until he retires. After he retires, he will receive the severance benefits detailed in his contract that he would have been entitled to if his employment had been terminated by Ariad without cause or by him for good reason.</p><p><p>
