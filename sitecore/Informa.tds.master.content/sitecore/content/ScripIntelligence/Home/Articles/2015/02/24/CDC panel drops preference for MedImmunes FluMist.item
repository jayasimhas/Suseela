<p>A panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week dropped its preference for use in children 2-8 years of MedImmune's FluMist, the only FDA-approved intranasal live-attenuated influenza vaccine, citing new data showing there was no superior effectiveness of the product over the flu shot.</p><p>The move is a reverse course by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which had recommended FluMist over the injected influenza vaccine in June 2014 after a review of data from several influenza seasons suggested the nasal spray vaccine could offer better protection in the youngsters. </p><p>But data from the 2013-14 flu season showed there was no measurable effectiveness for FluMist in children 2-8 years against the A (H1N1) influenza virus, which was the predominant strain circulating during that season, while the injected vaccine was 60% effective in that age group.</p><p>Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MedImmune, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca, blamed the poor performance of FluMist against H1N1 during 2013-14 on a mutation of the strain, which left the vaccine vulnerable to higher temperatures.</p><p>Neither the nasal spray vaccine nor the shot is working well against the predominant strain circulating in the US during the current Northern Hemisphere season, a mutated H3N2 virus, known as A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, which is different than the strain selected last year for the vaccine.</p><p>CDC officials reported last week the shot had slipped from the 26% efficacy in children reported in January to 15%, while the nasal spray demonstrated virtually no efficacy at all (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-vax-only-23-effective-12-most-adults-356168" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">19 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Profits-didnt-drive-flu-vaccine-decisions-US-officials-356531" target="_new">04 February 2015</a>).</p><p>In the overall population, the influenza vaccine was showing only 18% efficacy against the H3N2 mutated strain in the 2014-15 season &ndash; down from 23% reported in January. </p><p>"Although flu vaccine is the best way to prevent influenza infection, how well it works can vary," the CDC said, noting that since it began measuring vaccine effectiveness in 2004-05, estimates have ranged from 10% to 60%. </p><p>The ACIP's recommendation must be adopted by CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden and must then be incorporated into the 2015-16 influenza prevention and control recommendations and published in a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, at which point it would become official policy from the agency.</p><p>An advisory panel to the FDA is meeting on 4 March to select the strains for the US vaccines for the 2015-16 flu season.</p><p>A group of expert advisers to the World Health Organization last week recommended the trivalent vaccines for the 2015-2016 Northern Hemisphere influenza season contain the same strains selected this past September for the Southern Hemisphere: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus. It recommended the quadrivalent vaccines also include the B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.</p><p>The CDC's ACIP last week also voted in favor of including Merck's recently approved human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine, Gardasil 9 in the recommendations for use of HPV vaccines (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Mercks-new-Gardasil-provides-broader-protection-355558" target="_new">11 December 2014</a>).</p><p>In addition, the CDC's panel voted unanimously in favor of recommending the two recently approved meningococcal group B vaccines, Pfizer's Trumenba and Novartis' Bexsero, for vaccination in people 10 years or older at high risk of developing the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-breakthrough-meningitis-B-vaccine-OKd-beats-Novartis-354744" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-meningitis-B-vaccine-Bexsero-OKd-in-US-356346" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
