<p>The FDA has entered into a partnership with an online patient networking forum to try to glean safety information from anecdotal experiences about the drugs people take for a variety of diseases.</p><p>The goal of the FDA&rsquo;s collaboration with PatientsLikeMe &ndash; the largest nonprofit online patient forum &ndash; is to see what can be learned directly from online sharing by patients about the struggles they have with their medications, versus the more clinical type of adverse event reports the agency receives from biopharmaceutical makers and doctors. </p><p>Regulators are hoping the information can help fill in the gaps about the types of reactions patients with certain diseases have to their prescribed drugs in the postmarketing setting.</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based PatientsLikeMe said it has more than 350,000 members with over 2,500 conditions that participate in its online forum, where patients connect with others who have the same or similar diseases, allowing them to share and compare what has worked with what hasn&rsquo;t and whether others have experienced the same types of adverse events or positive outcomes.</p><p>The collaboration is an &ldquo;unprecedented stop toward enhancing postmarket surveillance and informing regulatory science,&rdquo; said Ben Heywood, president and co-founder of PatientsLikeMe.</p><p>Currently, the FDA tracks adverse events through spontaneous reports made to the agency&rsquo;s spontaneous reporting system, known as FAERS.</p><p>Drug makers are required to report adverse event information the firms receive from doctors and patients to the FDA, while the process is voluntary for healthcare practitioners, so it&rsquo;s likely the agency is not getting the complete picture of the reactions patients are having to their medicines.</p><p>&ldquo;The PatientsLikeMe data are generated in a different context by patients themselves, and provide important real-time insights into the nuances inherent in patients&rsquo; experiences over time, including drug tolerance, adherence and quality of life,&rdquo; the group said. </p><p>The nonprofit firm said it has collected more than 110,000 adverse event reports on 1,000 different medications &ndash; &ldquo;data that the FDA will now be able to access and analyze as a supplement to traditional sources, including FAERS.&rdquo; </p><p>PatientsLikeMe said its collaboration with the FDA is the first time it has formally partnered with the agency. But it emphasized the firm has worked with, provided counsel to and co-authored discussion papers with a range of government groups, including the National Academy of Medicine &ndash; formerly known as the Institute of Medicine &ndash; the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health and Human Services and the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute. </p><p>Mr Heywood co-founded PatientsLikeMe with his brother James in 2004 after their brother Stephen was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the family was desperate to find information on the best way to treat the disease. </p><p>Along with a longtime friend, Jeff Cole, The Heywoods created a health data-sharing platform. </p><p>The company said it sells the patient experience data &ndash; except for the protected identifiable information &ndash; to drug and device makers, healthcare equipment firms, insurers and medical service companies. </p><p>&ldquo;By selling this data and engaging our partners in conversations about patient needs, we're helping them better understand the real world medical value of their products so they can improve them,&rdquo; PatientsLikeMe said on its website. &ldquo;We are also helping companies accelerate the development of new solutions for patients.&rdquo;</p><p>PatientsLikeMe has partnered with biopharmaceutical firms like AstraZeneca, which is using patient-reported data to help shape its research and development programs for medicines against respiratory disease, lupus, diabetes and cancer.</p><p>It also recently has partnered with Genentech and Biogen. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
