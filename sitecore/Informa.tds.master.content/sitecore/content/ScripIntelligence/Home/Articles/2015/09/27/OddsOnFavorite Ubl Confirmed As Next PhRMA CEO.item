<p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) late on Sept. 25 confirmed what had been widely speculated about in Washington and among industry insiders that AdvaMed CEO Stephen Ubl would be taking the reins as the next chief of the drug lobbying group.</p><p>Ubl, a longtime Washington lobbyist, is expected to move into the new job at PhRMA at the first of the year &ndash; replacing outgoing CEO John Castellani, who is retiring.</p><p>AdvaMed said Ubl is leaving that organization on Oct. 15. The medical device group said it was in the process of undertaking a national search for a new CEO. </p><p>With the biopharmaceutical industry at the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Spending-User-Fees-Biomarker-Research-Drug-Device-Combos-360235" target="_new">early stages of negotiations</a> with the FDA for the six round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i>, the Senate in the midst of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senate-chance-to-improve-Cures-but-dont-expect-soon-359643" target="_new">preparing its companion bill</a> to the House's <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">pharmaceutical prices</a> caught in the political spotlight &ndash; including the 2016 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">bid for the White House</a> &ndash; the drug trade organization obviously was looking for someone who already knew the Washington lobbying game. </p><p>And Ubl has been around the block a few times over the past two decades &ndash; actually starting his Washington career on Capitol Hill as an aide to Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA).</p><p>Ubl has led AdvaMed &ndash; the world's largest medical device organization &ndash; for a decade.</p><p>He'd also spent seven years prior to that in other top jobs at AdvaMed, although he briefly left the trade organization in 2004 to open his own consulting business, only to return a year later to the device lobbying group to be its leader.</p><p>Ubl also previously worked for a time at the Federation of American Hospitals.</p><p>Over the past five years, much of Ubl's attention has been on getting a repeal of the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices, which was imposed under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Under Ubl's tenure at AdvaMed, the group enhanced its code of ethics and expanded its international reach, said Vincent Forlenza, chairman, CEO and president of BD and the chairman of the medical device organization.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Device-Lobbyist-Ubl-Rumored-To-Take-PhRMA-Helm-360651" target="_new">Rumors</a> PhRMA had settled on Ubl to replace Castellani, who announced in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Castellani-to-depart-PhRMA-group-elects-Mercks-Frazier-chairman-357923" target="_new">April he would be leaving</a> after serving as CEO for five years, began to circulate around Washington last week.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
