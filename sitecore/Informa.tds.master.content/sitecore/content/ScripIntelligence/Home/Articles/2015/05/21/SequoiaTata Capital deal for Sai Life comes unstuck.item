<p>Venture capital firm Sequoia's deal with Tata Capital, through which the former was said to be eyeing an exit from the Indian contract research organization (CRO), Sai Life Sciences, may have fallen through, if pharma industry and investment banking experts are to be believed.</p><p>Sources in the know told <i>Scrip</i> that the deal probably came unstuck after India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) rejected the duo's plans, though the specifics on the refusal could not immediately be ascertained.</p><p>There is, however, some speculation that the rejection may have had something do with the proposed repatriable/non-repatriable structure of the transaction by the acquirer and seller, though this could not be immediately verified. It's also unclear if a restructured deal was in the works.</p><p>Sequoia was said to have invested about $12.5m for about 19% in the Hyderabad-based Sai Life in 2007 &ndash; quite at the peak of such inflows. Tata Capital Healthcare Fund I, Tata Capital Growth Fund I, Beta TC Holdings Pte, Alpha TC Holdings Pte and HBM Private Equity India were earlier reported to be on course to acquiring a significant holding &ndash; estimated to be in excess of 40% &ndash; in Sai Life Sciences for around $30.9m.</p><p>Multiple e-mail requests/phone calls to Tata Capital and Sequoia elicited no response, with Sequoia only referring the issue to Sai Life. The CRO, though, declined comment.</p><p>The FIPB had rejected the proposal pertaining to Sai Life last month. Approval had been sought for the transfer of shares from an existing to new non-resident shareholders and for further allotment of shares.</p><p>Established in 1999, Sai offers a range of integrated drug discovery, development and formulation services, with its core expertise based on synthetic, medicinal and process chemistry. It also offers a suite of preclinical support services including drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), toxicology and formulation. </p><p>The firm has six R&D and manufacturing facilities in and around the Indian cities of Hyderabad and Pune. It has an FDA-approved manufacturing unit and a GMP (good manufacturing practice) intermediate facility for contract manufacturing, details on the firm's website suggested. </p><p>The apparent deal set back in Sai comes amid signs of <a href="http://.%5b%20http:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-CRO-segment-in-throes-of-a-shakeout-356762%5d" target="_new">a shakeout</a> in the Indian CRO segment, with a number of small and mid-sized units having scaled down or put themselves on the block. <i>Scrip</i> reported in February that Fortis Clinical Research was likely on the block &ndash; its assets have since been acquired by Quest Life Sciences. Recent events around GVK Biosciences, observers say, has also added to business pressures for some though others reckon it may have potentially opened up opportunities as well. </p><p>GVK is currently in the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hundreds-of-generics-face-European-ban-following-GVK-breaches-356345%5d" target="_new">eye of a storm</a> after the French medicines agency ANSM uncovered alleged data manipulation at one of its sites though the Indian CRO has claimed the actions of European agencies were overblown. On 22 May, the European Medicines Agency said that it was <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Flawed-GVK-studies-EMA-sticks-with-suspension-as-firm-fights-on-358568%5d" target="_new">sticking with its previous recommendation</a> to suspend a number of drugs for which authorization in the EU was primarily based on clinical studies conducted at GVK's Hyderabad unit. </p>
