<p> The first batch of big pharma/big biotech 1Q results has now been released, and the second wave is due in the week beginning 27 April. Among those that have reported, Biogen revealed lower than expected sales of its newest multiple sclerosis therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), whereas Novartis with its rival oral MS treatment Gilenya (fingolimod) performed somewhat better. It will be interesting to see how the third oral MS treatment, Aubagio (teriflunomide) performs when Sanofi reports its results. Meanwhile, all the financial results play out against the backdrop of the shifting currency rates and the strengthening dollar, which is having a mixed impact on pharma firms, with US firms like Lilly enjoying bolstered underlying earnings thanks to the impact of currency exchange on its costs, even as revenue performance is held back. </p> <p> <preform><script id="infogram_0__/7cSgwxigyZz2W4TPfabO" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?gr4" type="text/javascript"></script></preform></p> <h2> Bayer </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate: </b>&euro;2.03 per share, up from &euro;1.95 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> &euro;11.89bn, up from &euro;10.56bn in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement: </b>30 April </p> <p> What to watch for: Details of Bayer's plans to divest its Material Science business and reorganize itself into a pure life sciences company in the coming years almost overshadowed the first quarter's main news story: the departure of Bayer HealthCare's head Olivier Brandicourt to take up the top job at French pharma rival Sanofi. </p> <p> The German firm revealed how it plans to &quot;considerably increase sales and margins at [Bayer HealthCare], in particular, through 2017, driven mainly by the recently launched products in Pharmaceuticals and by the Consumer Care business, which was greatly strengthened last year through acquisitions.&quot; Combined sales of the anticoagulant Xarelto, the eye medicine Eylea, the cancer drugs Stivarga and Xofigo, and the pulmonary hypertension drug Adempas are projected to increase toward &euro;4bn in 2015 (2014: &euro;2.9bn), said company CEO Dr Marijn Dekkers. </p> <p> <h2> Bristol-Myers Squibb </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> $0.50 per share, up from $0.46 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> $3.81bn, in-line with last year </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement:</b> 28 April </p> <p> What to watch for: Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings will be all about its programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab), which recently gained a second-line approval in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Analysts are looking for color on the drug's launch so far, as well as how physicians are using it. </p> <p> The focus will be on the firm's immunotherapy pipeline, particularly combination data. BMS recently reported strong results for the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy in melanoma that has increased the likelihood that the combo will gain approval well before the end of the year. </p> <p> &quot;We expect spotlight on initial ramp of Opdivo after recent approval in 2nd/3rd line squamous NSCLC setting and upcoming I-O pipeline catalysts and look to see how the surprisingly rapid Opdivo approval may impact BMY's guidance for the year,&quot; wrote Credit Suisse analyst Dr Vamil Divan. </p> <p> &quot;As AACR continues and ASCO, ESMO and ASH loom in the coming months, we continue to see newsflow around the emergence of immuno-oncology in various tumor types as the most compelling new product story in major pharma,&quot; added Dr Divan. </p> <p> Morningstar analyst Damien Conover expects the drug could have peak sales of $11bn &ndash; mostly from the non-squamous lung cancer indication. He expects approval in that setting by mid-2015. </p> <p> <h2> Celgene </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> $1.06, up from $0.84 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> $2.11bn, up from $1.7bn in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement:</b> 30 April </p> <p> What to watch for: In 4Q 2014 Celgene beat consensus estimates and reported quarterly revenues up 18.7% on a year-over-year basis. As such the company will be hoping to out-perform again in 1Q 2015 following a quarter of positive news for a number of its products. In the past four months the company has received approval in Europe for Abraxane (paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound nanoparticles, or nab-paclitaxel) in combination with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer; Revlimid (lenalidomide) for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant; and for selective PDE4 inhibitor Otezla (apremilast) as a treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. </p> <p> The first quarter of the year did see Celgene <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-drops-Morphosyss-daratumumab-chasing-anti-CD38-MAb-357522">drop development</a> of one of its collaborative programs though. Its 1Q results might provide more insight on why, less than two years after paying $150m upfront for Morphosys' multiple myeloma antibody MOR202, Celgene has handed it back, and on what other plans it has for steering its development pipeline. </p> <p> <h2> GSK </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> &pound;18.20 per share, down from &pound;21.00 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> &pound;5.65bn, up from &pound;5.61bn in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement:</b> 6 May </p> <p> What to watch for: On 2 March GlaxoSmithKline completed its major three-part transaction with Novartis. In light of the timing of the close, it plans to report 1Q results and hold an investor meeting on 6 May, where it will provide earnings guidance and profile the medium and long-term shape and opportunities for the enlarged company. </p> <p> Since the close, GSK has reorganized to reflect the &quot;balance between its Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer businesses,&quot; it said. GSK will report these three businesses separately in future with corporate costs reallocated accordingly &quot;to more accurately reflect the profitability of each segment.&quot; </p> <p> The impact of foreign exchange is not expected to be as significant as in previous quarters (around -1%). </p> <p> Advair headwinds are expected to be particularly tough on prior quarter comparisons, along with Lovaza, GSK's Japan business, &quot;which saw wholesaler stocking in Q1 last year ahead of the consumption tax increase, and vaccines with Boostrix and Pediarix both benefitting in the first half last year from the absence of a competitor from the market,&quot; noted GSK in a pre-results announcement. </p> <p> <h2> Merck &amp; Co </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> $0.74 per share, down from $0.88 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> $9.01bn, a 12.2% decline from the $10.26bn the company brought in last year </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement:</b> 28 April </p> <p> What to watch for: Merck is coming off a weekend of reporting strong data at AACR for its immunotherapy Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and analysts want to see that streak continue at ASCO at the end of May. Expect the company to continue talking up the franchise, as well as partnerships in the space. Analysts will be looking for how well the drug is selling so far and if it's being used off-label &ndash; particularly lung cancer. Also expect to get some color on Merck's strategy in melanoma now that competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb has announced positive data for its immunotherapy combo. </p> <p> The diabetes franchise Januvia has long been one of the pharma's best-selling products, but further competition in the class, as well as the entrance of new classes of diabetes drugs, has put pressure on sales. Analysts are looking for commentary on lifecycle management for the DPP-4 inhibitor, in addition to any insights the company can give ahead of results for the cardiovascular outcomes study that is expected to read out in June. </p> <p> &quot;We continue to project $7 billion in annual Keytruda sales by 2020, ahead of consensus of $4 billion. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are creating first-mover advantages in immuno-oncology and creating powerful combinations that should enable both firms to strengthen their economic moats and capture the majority of a $30 billion-plus market,&quot; wrote Morningstar analyst Damien Conover in a 20 April note. </p> <p> <h2> Pfizer </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> $0.49 per share, down from $0.57 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> $10.73bn, down 5% from $11.5bn in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>Earnings announcement:</b> 28 April </p> <p> What to watch for: With the approval of the CDK 4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer at the beginning of the year, investors will be eager to hear how the launch of Pfizer's Ibrance (palbociclib) is going so far. The drug has only been on the market for about two months and carries a price tag of about $9,850 per month, but launch trajectories are often determined early. Prevnar 13 was also recently launched in adults and the firm has been doing a major DTC push for the vaccine &ndash; expect comments on that. </p> <p> Analysts are also eager to hear about Pfizer's acquisition strategy &ndash; after its failed attempt to take over AstraZeneca last year, the company made two smaller acquisitions &ndash; Opko Health and Hospira. It will be interesting to see if Pfizer's appetite for large M&amp;A has cooled and if it has decided to pursue a bolt-on strategy instead. Also watch for any talk of breaking up the company; this has been a major talking point for Pfizer the last few years, but there has been little follow through thus far. </p> <p> Like most of the companies in the bunch, analysts are also looking for color on Pfizer's immuno-oncology work. Expect to hear more about deals in the space and any ongoing clinical trials with partners. </p> <p> <h2> Sanofi </h2> <p> <b>1Q 2015 EPS estimate:</b> &euro;1.20 per share, up from &euro;1.17 in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>1Q revenue estimate:</b> &euro;8.43bn, up from &euro;7.84bn in 1Q 2014 </p> <p> <b>Earnings Announcement:</b> 30 April </p> <p> What to watch for: Having got the small matter of appointing a new CEO over with, Sanofi can now look ahead to the potential approval of one of this year's most eagerly anticipated products: the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab), a cholesterol-lowering agent. The BLA gained a US priority in January and a PDUFA date of 24 July &ndash; a full month ahead of Amgen's competitor product evolocumab, although the FDA could certainly make an earlier-than-expected decision on either drug or delay one or both. </p> <p> Payers, however, have made PCSK9s their new target for trying to force lower prices before the medicines even hit the US market. <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803">Earlier this year</a>, four executives at CVS warned the costs to the US healthcare system of using PCSK9s to treat high cholesterol could reach $200bn annually. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/DF9884B2C92046719A18D146D1D19679.ashx"> </p>
