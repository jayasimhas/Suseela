<p>An Indian government-led "task force" has mooted a range of proposals aimed at propelling the private sector in the pharmaceutical industry, but experts have flawed some key suggestions including one that appears to promote development of drugs required by countries importing Indian medicines. </p><p>The seemingly unconventional suggestion of the task force led by the secretary, department of pharmaceuticals, refers to a "scheme" for new drug development for diseases prevalent in countries importing Indian drugs. </p><p>While finer details of the proposal are not immediately clear, industry experts point to the incongruity of the suggestion, some terming it as a "pipe dream", given that the Indian home market itself has been underserved in terms of innovative new drugs.</p><p>Ajit Dangi, president and CEO of Danssen Consulting and a former director general of the Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, which represents leading multinational firms, said that while the proposal is "laudable", an ecosystem for innovation should be the "priority" before India starts developing drugs for other countries.</p><p>"Does it make any sense when we have not been able to develop drugs for diseases more prevalent in our own country? [The] Drug discovery process is lengthy, risky and requires deep pockets," Dr Dangi, also a former president and executive director of Johnson & Johnson India, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>An expert from a prominent foreign firm claimed that the Indian government has "never been serious" about promoting an R&D culture in the sector and whatever progress has been made in formulations R&D has been driven by the private sector through its "own profit" and, unlike in the West, not through the use of public money.</p><p>"The shambles that the public sector is in health care in India is ample proof. The recommendations are probably meant more to create a favourable appearance to attract private participation than in sync with reality. The reality is that a country with 60% of its residents underserved should focus first on setting its home in order. If not, the recommendations can be construed more as a pipe dream than a constructive vision of the future," the expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Others referred to dynamics around R&D. Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), which represents leading domestic firms, said that drug discovery is driven by its commercial potential because of the unique risk-reward equation in the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p>"Subsidies or grants do not promote research. As is obvious from the numerous empirical data, remunerative pricing is the biggest driver of research," Mr Shah told <i>Scrip</i>. He explained that the burden of disease in India now is no different from the developed countries &ndash; the development of drugs for diabetes, cardiovascular, oncology, mental disorders are as much in need as anti-malarial, anti-TB or anti-HIV medicines. </p><p>"The former has global markets whereas the latter is limited predominantly for the poor countries where price realization is also poor. It is to be seen how this is implemented: whether it will be for importing countries of Africa or the Americas," Mr Shah said. </p><p>The task force, which comprised representatives from India's Planning Commission, the departments of industrial policy and promotion, science and technology and biotechnology and various industry bodies, has recommended a slew of measures aimed at "enabling the private sector to lead the growth of the pharma industry". These include enhancing regulatory support, a review of the implementation of India's current Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) and even parallel processing of regulatory clearances for imported drugs. </p><p>Mr Shah points out that the suggestion on parallel processing of clearances is from a ministry that has "no control" over the drug regulator or its processes. "Time alone will show how effective this could be. If the ministry cannot implement what is within its control, how credible would be its recommendation dealing with other ministries?" he argues. India's department of pharmaceuticals falls under the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, while the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) is under the purview of the health ministry. </p><p>Last week the government said that it is "very keen" on early implementation of the recommendations of the task force and expects to come out with an action taken report on this in 100 days. </p><h2>price control</h2><p>The task force also notes the need to resolve ''genuine practical problems'' of implementation of the DPCO 2013. </p><p>"Government may implement predictable and stable price control mechanisms through consultative approach with the industry," it recommends.</p><p>Mr Shah referred to a host of problematic issues germane to the DPCO 2013 and arising from its implementation. These include retrospective pricing under Para 24; refusal to grant price approval without authorization of the Drugs Controller General of India, whereas the state drugs controllers have powers under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules to grant manufacturing licences; and notices of overcharging to the manufacturers for non-compliance by a retailer. </p><p>"It is a moot point if there is a political will to correct these anomalies to promote growth of the pharmaceutical industry," Mr Shah said.</p><p>Dr Dangi said that <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-caps-essential-drug-prices-343296%5d" target="_new">DPCO 2013</a> had "strangulated" the industry with rigid price control on around 600 "so-called essential drugs" by using an "irrational" formula. </p><p>"Over and above this there is 10% cap on price increase per year on all drugs. This has created disincentive for further investment in new product development, GMP upgradation, and major companies have started focusing more on exports than the domestic market," he said. </p><p>He underscored the need in India for a variant of the NICE [the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales], which decides drug pricing based on the principles of pharmacoeconomics. </p><p>"While the new drug policy makes a passing reference to this valuable concept, there is zero action on the ground," he said. </p><p>The expert with the foreign firm declared that the DPCO is neither a good way to make medicines affordable nor is it consumer friendly. "A better way to make health care and medicines widely available would be to lower the barriers of entry (license requirements, fees, taxes etc.). When competition increases &ndash; and there is lesser cartelization &ndash; prices fall and quality improves," he said. </p><p>A 31-member parliamentary standing committee on chemicals and fertilizers had earlier <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-unending-price-cap-tussle-essential-meds-vs-shortages-358028%5d" target="_new">recommended</a> that the scope of price control be "enlarged" to make all the drugs available, especially life-saving ones, in all parts of the country. </p><p>The task force also recommended strengthening the CDSCO &ndash; a proposal that has featured in past recommendations of other panels as well. Industry has all along pressed for judicious, time-bound and effective execution of such suggestions. The task force's report notes that there are about 600,000 retail sales outlets and 10,500 manufacturing units in India, which require over 3,200 drugs inspectors. However, India has just 846 drug inspectors against 1,349 sanctioned posts.</p>
