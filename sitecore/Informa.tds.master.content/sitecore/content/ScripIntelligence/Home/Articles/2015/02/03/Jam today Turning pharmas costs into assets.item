<p>I recently came across details of a new economic theory being developed with environmental policy in mind that may have lessons for pharma. In a nutshell, the project &ndash; led by the FWF Austrian Science Fund, the central funding organization for basic research in Austria &ndash; is aimed at finding ways of rewarding people today for investing for the benefit of future generations. </p><p>In theory society wants to preserve resources and make things better for future generations, but in practice we often don't want to spend money when we won't feel the benefit directly (and may not be able to guarantee that the benefit will transpire at all). The idea of the FWF project is to find a new way to encourage the preservation of natural resources for future generations by enabling today's society to draw the benefits of actions for which they must shoulder the costs right now. </p><p>The aim is to use the capital market to translate future gains into current assets, for example in the form of government bonds, securities or stocks, which can be used to finance policy measures. </p><p>This challenge of the sometimes lengthy time gap between the costs and benefits of environmental policy has parallels in the pharmaceutical and health sectors.</p><p>The example that springs most readily to mind is that of antibiotic resistance: we need to preserve the resource of effective antibiotics just as we need to preserve the finite resource of fossil fuels or rain forests. Losing that antibiotic resource would cost future generations greatly, putting lives at risk and incurring heavy economic consequences. We have known this for years yet have struggled to rationalize antibiotic use and incentivize antibiotic development.</p><p>In fact, one recent initiative in antibiotic development has explicitly indicated an interest in learning from the field of environmental stewardship: the EU Innovative Medicines Initiative's DRIVE-AB consortium includes experts in tropical rainforest preservation (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/New-consortium-widens-search-for-antibiotic-commercial-models-354686" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 October 2014</a>). Perhaps we will see an increasing flow of ideas between the two fields.</p><p>Meanwhile, the concept of creating assets today out of future benefits may also have relevance in other areas of interest to pharma. For instance, in hepatitis C therapy, the large up-front cost of the new generation of vastly improved products is unpalatable to many, despite the prospect of reduced future medical and societal costs both for individuals and in terms of disease transmission rates. </p><p>Valuing the therapeutic assets effectively is a key question for society and for drug companies. Could this kind of creative thinking help break through the current roadblocks?</p>
