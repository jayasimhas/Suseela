<p>Takeda is set to file for approval worldwide of its leading oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib in multiple myeloma on the basis of encouraging interim data from the Phase III TOURMALINE-MM1 study.</p><p>The top-line data just released show that the study has hit the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The 722-patient randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial is designed to compare two treatment regimens administered until progression &ndash; ixazomib plus lenalidomide (Celgene's Revlimid) and dexamethasone versus placebo plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The patients enrolled had received one to three previous therapies and those refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitor-based therapy were excluded. No details were given about its side-effect profile in the trial.</p><p>Ixazomib, a follow-on to Takeda's Velcade (bortezomib), looks set to become the first oral proteasome inhibitor to reach the market, offering a more convenient administration compared with the established proteasome inhibitors, which also include Amgen/Onyx Pharmacetuicals' Kyprolis (carfilzomib). Velcade and Kyprolis are given intravenously or subcutaneously, and experts have said ixezomib's oral delivery route might mean it is associated with fewer side-effect concerns such as peripheral neuropathy, which will be especially useful when used as a maintenance therapy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-Takedas-oral-ixazomib-succeeds-as-myeloma-maintenance-therapy-355473" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 December 2014</a>). </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analysts believe that ixazomib's oral formulation will enhance its clinical appeal in the multiple myeloma market. The drug's commercial success will be essential for Takeda to offset potential revenue losses from the loss of Velcade patent protection (expected by 2017 in the US), and they expect it to enter the market in Q2 2016. </p><p>However, it will be entering in the increasingly crowded second-line therapy space, raising some questions over how well it will ultimately perform.Other available treatments include Celgene's Pomalyst (pomalidomide), while Johnson & Johnson/Genmab's anti-CD38 MAb daratumumab, Bristol-Myers Squibb/AbbVie's anti-CS1 product elotuzumab, and Novartis's Faridak (panobinostat) are in Phase III. </p><p>Another pivotal study, TOURMALINE-MM2, is comparing ixazomib versus placebo in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, but this is not due to report until 2018, by which time generic bortezomib may be available. </p><p>A third Phase III trial, TOURMALINE-MM3, is evaluating ixazomib versus placebo as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma following induction therapy and autologous stem cell transplant.</p><p>The product is also in a Phase III study in another haematological cancer indication, AL amyloidosis (TOURMALINE-AL1), for which gained US FDA breakthrough therapy designation late last year.</p><p>Other oral proteasome inhibitors in development for multiple myeloma include Triphase Research's marizomib and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Amgen)'s oprozomib, both in Phase II. </p><p>
