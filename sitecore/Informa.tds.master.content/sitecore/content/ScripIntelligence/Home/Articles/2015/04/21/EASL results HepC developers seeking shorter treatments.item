<p><p>The competition rages on in the hepatitis C space &ndash; despite there being a functional cure &ndash; now, to reduce treatment durations and improve costs. Both Gilead and Merck & Co have released data this week for their next generation hep C combinations. </p><p>Shortened treatment durations are the new goal for companies competing in the hepatitis C space. Typically, patients are treated for 12 weeks and as many as 24 weeks for cirrhotic patients. Reducing the amount of time that patients are on treatment could mean a drastic reduction in cost &ndash; something payers are particularly keen to see. </p><p>"The sustainability of the HCV market, contracting dynamic, and pricing remain the outstanding questions once this three-player market comes to fruition - likely by YE15," wrote Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez in an 08 April note. "We view AbbVie as the most vulnerable to Merck's entry; we believe Gilead's willingness to compete on price may have been in anticipation of Merck's market entry - and may result in more sustained long-term market share depending on the competitiveness of Merck's triple regimen."</p><p>During the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) annual meeting in Vienna, Gilead released Phase I/II data for its triple combo of its blockbuster Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) with its NS5A inhibitor GS-5816 and its NS3/4A protease inhibitor GS-9857. Results from the study showed that after six weeks on the drug treatment-na&iuml;ve, non-cirrhotic patients achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR12) rate of 93%, while treatment-na&iuml;ve, cirrhotic patients had an SVR12 of 87% and among those patients that had failed therapy two or more times achieved a sustained response rate of 67%. Meanwhile, the four-week regimen achieved less-than-appealing results of 27%. </p><p>These results, while not entirely unexpected, were not exactly what Gilead was hoping for &ndash; and could mean that a four-week regimen isn't in the cards. Yet, the results for the treatment-na&iuml;ve, cirrhotic patients were encouraging, but will need further study in more patients to determine whether rates of relapse will be an issue compared to 12 weeks of therapy, according to Datamonitor senior analyst Michael Haydock. </p><p>"We are encouraged by the six-week SVR12 rates and other data presented at EASL demonstrating this regimen&rsquo;s pan-genotypic potential, and have recently initiated additional Phase 2 studies to further evaluate the appropriate treatment duration of this regimen for all patients, regardless of genotype, including those who have failed prior therapy with directly acting antivirals and those with cirrhosis," said Dr Norbert Bischofberger, executive VP of R&D and chief scientific officer. </p><h2>Merck muscles in</h2><p>Merck made its own impressive presentation in Vienna for its late-stage combination of grazoprevir/elbasvir (100mg/50mg) in patients with or without cirrhosis infected with hepatitis C genotypes 1, 4 or 6. </p><p>In the Phase III C-EDGE trials, patients in both the HCV infected, treatment-na&iuml;ve and HIV/HCV co-infected, treatment-na&iuml;ve trials achieved SVR12 rates of 95% after 12 weeks of treatment. The combination showed an even better response in patients who were co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV and had developed cirrhosis of the liver, achieving 100% response rate in those patients. </p><p>The combination received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA earlier in April. The status is given to drugs that could have a major impact on patient treatment. </p><p><p><p>
