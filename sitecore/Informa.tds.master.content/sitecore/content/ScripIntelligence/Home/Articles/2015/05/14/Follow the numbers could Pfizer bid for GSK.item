<p>If a recent poll of Biospace readers is anything to go by, Pfizer is on the verge of making a bid for GlaxoSmithKline &ndash; and it could be worth more than $120bn. </p><p>Such a move would certainly be controversial, after last year's tug of war over GSK's compatriot AstraZeneca, in which the Brits, valiantly led by AZ CEO Pascal Soriot, managed to hang onto the family silver despite the US giant laying $116bn on the table. It would also lack the tax inversion benefits linked to the AZ bid, because the US government has now moved to close that loophole.</p><p>It's not like Pfizer and GSK can't work together, though. They already run the successful HIV joint venture ViiV Healthcare. And in some respects they have a similar outlook on their business, in which developing innovative prescription pharmaceuticals is no longer the be-all and end-all for growth. </p><p>Pfizer has grouped its activities into three main divisions: innovative pharma, established pharma and vaccines/oncology/consumer healthcare, with pharma still reeling from the blow dealt by Lipitor coming off patent. GSK's recent swap deal with Novartis left it with strengthened vaccines and consumer healthcare businesses alongside its pharmaceuticals business, which CEO Sir Andrew Witty <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-GSK-will-focus-on-gigantic-pools-of-volume-says-Witty-358233" target="_new">recently said</a> is "no longer the dominating part" of GSK. </p><p>Where they differ is on their attitude to M&A. While GSK's chief has remained wary, at least as a buyer, Pfizer's Ian Read has displayed no such compunction. Pfizer has indicated it wants to bulk up in key areas to keep the option of making viable spin-outs. A tie-up with GSK could fulfil that aim and spawn multiple specialized new companies.</p><p>GSK is looking cheap, too. Just before the rumors emerged about Pfizer's swoop on AstraZeneca in April 2014, the company's stock had been out-performing AstraZeneca's on the London Stock Exchange for nearly three years. Then came the Pfizer bid, and while GSK's share price enjoyed a modest initial boost from the US giant's interest in UK pharma, it has under-performed AstraZeneca's stock ever since. </p><p>On 17 April, just before <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-rebuffs-Pfizer-approach-report-claims-351381" target="_new">news of the AZ bid</a> was leaked, GSK enjoyed a market capitalization of &pound;75.86bn, while AstraZeneca was worth less than two-thirds of that, at &pound;47.78bn. In the 13 months that have passed since then, AstraZeneca's share price has remained 8-28% above its 17 April 2014 level, while GSK's has yet to get 7% higher than it was that day, and has spent much of the intervening period below that price. </p><p>The end result is that GSK's market cap has fallen by 7% to &pound;70.58bn while AstraZeneca's has risen by 15.5% to &pound;55.19bn, bringing it up to 78% of GSK's value.</p><p>Pfizer, meanwhile, has seen its own market capitalization rise to $207.67bn (around &pound;136bn) since 17 April 2014, an increase of 11.5%. The company's money will also go further now in the UK: a dollar in April 2014 would have bought it 59.5 pence, whereas now it is worth upwards of 65.5 pence.</p><p>Speculation that GSK could be a target for Pfizer is not new, but circumstances have changed somewhat since the rumor mill kicked into motion when AZ spurned Pfizer last summer. </p>
