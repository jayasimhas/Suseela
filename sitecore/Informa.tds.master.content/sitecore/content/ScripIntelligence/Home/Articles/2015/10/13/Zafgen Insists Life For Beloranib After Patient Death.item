<p>Zafgen Inc. officials on Oct. 16 did their best to try to assure investors and analysts after the FDA slapped a partial hold on the company's Phase III bestPWS (ZAF-311) trial testing its experimental severe obesity drug beloranib following the death of one of the study participants taking the medicine &ndash; with the CEO even declaring the adverse outcome was "not an unexpected finding," given the firm anticipated one to two deaths would occur. </p><p>But panic ensued anyway &ndash; with the Boston biotech's shares plummeting 52%, before the stock closed at $10.36, a loss of $10.66, or 50.7%.</p><p>Zafgen initially had disclosed the patient death on Oct. 14.</p><p>But during an Oct. 16 conference call, Zafgen CEO Tom Hughes acknowledged the death had actually occurred about two weeks earlier, although he insisted the firm had "promptly" reported the death to the FDA &ndash; getting the information to the US agency "well within that time bracket" of seven days.</p><p>Late on Oct. 15, the FDA gave Zafgen a "verbal" notice the agency was placing a partial hold on the beloranib program, including the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III ZAF-311 study &ndash; the trial where the death occurred &ndash; and also the company's other ongoing or planned trials, including another Phase III, known as ZAF-312, which has not yet started, Hughes said.</p><p>He said the notification from regulators came "after an extremely dynamic and challenging week."</p><p>The Phase III ZAF-311 trial is studying beloranib in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disorder, which has a high rate of death &ndash; about 3% annually across the population &ndash; and only a life expectancy of about 30 years, Hughes said, noting death from the disease often is linked to obesity and its many co-morbidities.</p><p>"These patient populations are complex and are characterized by obesity-related co-morbidity issues, such as diabetes, cardiopulmonary diseases and thrombotic disease, including thromboembolism," he said.</p><p>The patient who died was 23 years old with PWS and "a number" of co-morbidities, including severe obesity, with a body mass index of 55, explained Dennis Kim, chief medical officer for Zafgen.</p><p>A cause of death has not yet been determined, but the patient was being treated with 1.8mg of beloranib in the ZAF-311 study, Kim said, noting the firm is waiting for the results of an autopsy.</p><p>Kim disclosed, however, there had been six thrombotic events in past trials of beloranib, including three cases of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.</p><p>Because of those thrombotic events and the unknown nature of the patient death, the FDA instituted the partial hold, which involves pausing the ZAF-311 study and waiting to start ZAF-312 trial while the company screens participants for existing thrombotic disease, Hughes explained.</p><p>He said Zafgen currently does not anticipate initiating ZAF-312 until after ZAF-311 is completed and a full assessment of the safety and efficacy of beloranib is performed by the FDA.</p><p>Hughes noted Zafgen also is voluntarily screening and monitoring participants in the firm's ongoing Phase IIb ZAF-203 study being conducted in Australia, which is testing beloranib in patients with severe obesity complicated by type 2 diabetes.</p><p>"The possibility that the death is related to a thromboembolic event triggered by beloranib would of course be quite concerning," analysts from Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, said in an Oct. 16 report.</p><p>While Zafgen officials noted that thrombosis has been "emerging" as a potentially important cause of death in PWS in general, the <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts observed there was "not a great deal" about thromboembolism as a major feature of disease in the literature.</p><p>But Hughes said even if there is a thrombotic causation to the death, "it would very challenging to attribute whether or not the drug had any role at all in precipitating that event."</p><p>The point, he said, is if there is a relationship "we can understand that and we can do so without disrupting our trial program."</p><p>"This is a great place we've ended up with the FDA, which is to institute new measures that will not only ensure that if these events are occurring we can stop them before they do happen," Hughes insisted, adding "There's a lot to be learned."</p><p>He said it's Zafgen's "expectation" it can get the screening done "very quickly and get patients back on drug."</p><p>But with it being unclear whether the screening measures will be sufficient, the <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts lowered the likelihood of approval for beloranib in PWS by 20% &ndash; from 58% to 38% &ndash; which is 22% below the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>They also lowered the drug's chances for approval in obesity by 5%, pending more information.</p><p>Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said he continued to believe Zafgen would not file for US approval until after the second Phase III trial is completed, which he did not anticipate until the second half of 2018 &ndash; pushing any potential for approval into 2019.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
