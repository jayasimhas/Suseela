<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is probing yet another lab mishap involving anthrax, although this time it's not its own.</p><p>Researchers working in a military laboratory in Utah accidentally shipped live <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, the bacterium that causes anthrax, to at least 18 private, academic and federal labs in nine states across the US, as well as to a US air base in the Republic of Korea, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the CDC confirmed on 27 May.</p><p>The DOD said it has identified an issue with one production lot of what was supposed to be inactivated <i>B anthracis</i> originating at the US Army's Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG) in Utah.</p><p>It's unclear what may have gone wrong with the irradiation process at DPG.</p><p>The DOD and CDC insisted there is no known risk to the general public.</p><p>Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren told <i>Scrip </i>on 27 May it's currently unknown how many people may have been exposed to the live anthrax spores, but he said so far, none of the lab workers have developed symptoms of the disease.</p><p>But at least four lab workers, based on their risk of anthrax exposure, have started on post-exposure prophylaxis therapy, the DOD said.</p><p>CDC spokesman Jason McDonald told <i>Scrip </i>the four workers taking the antibiotics are in Delaware, Texas and Wisconsin.</p><p>Osan Air Base in Korea said at least 22 there may have been exposed and as a precautionary measure, all personnel were provided with examinations, antibiotics and in some instances, vaccinations.</p><p>DOD said that "out of abundance of caution," it has issued a moratorium on the shipping of all material from DPG and two other sites pending the completion of an investigation by the CDC.</p><p>The DOD mishap comes just two months after the CDC was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-headed-to-losing-credibility-biosafety-experts-charge-357423" target="_new">blasted in a scathing report</a> from a panel of outside expert advisers that condemned the agency's laboratory safety practices &ndash; declaring it "is on the way to losing credibility" after a series of near-calamities last year involving <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-anthrax-mishap-puts-spotlight-on-biosafety-lab-vulnerabilities-352431" target="_new">anthrax</a>, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Anthrax-smallpox-and-H5N1-Bad-beyond-Walter-White-352849" target="_new">H5N1</a> influenza virus and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-reports-another-lab-mishap-this-time-Ebola-355849" target="_new">Ebola</a>.</p><p>Six vials of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Smallpox-discovery-triggers-FBI-probe-NIH-lab-search-352714" target="_new">smallpox</a> also had been discovered last year by an FDA scientist in an unsecured cold storage room on the main campus of the National Institutes of Health, which later revealed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ricin-other-unsecured-pathogens-found-at-NIH-FDA-353742" target="_new">more deadly pathogens</a>, including the highly lethal agent ricin, hidden away in their laboratories and improperly stored.</p><p>The DOD's incident also comes just one week after the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Whats-life-and-limb-worth-Gauging-antibiotics-value-352953" target="_new">expanding its investigation</a> into the US government's handling of deadly agents.</p><p><b>How it happened </b></p><p>The discovery of the live anthrax was made by a private lab working with a sample of what was supposed to be inactivated material it obtained from the US military. </p><p>The private lab notified the CDC on 22 May. </p><p>The sample identified as live anthrax originally was sent on 30 April from the DPG in Utah and routed through the military's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), located outside of Baltimore, which sent samples to six different private-sector companies in five states &ndash; Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin.</p><p>Colonel Warren said in an interview the samples were sent via a private carrier, although he could not say if the military used Fed-Ex, UPS or other carriers.</p><p>One of the Maryland firms had forwarded the potentially live material to a subcontractor in the same state.</p><p>A company in Tennessee also received a sample directly from the DPG to serve as the third-party validator for the effort.</p><p>The samples were sent under a DOD program intended to develop a new rapid field-based test to identify biological threats in the environment. </p><p>According to the DOD, the vials containing the live anthrax samples were not opened at ECBC and the personnel at that lab were not at risk of exposure to anthrax.</p><p>The lab workers in Utah prepared the material in question using standard personnel protective equipment and thus are not at risk of exposure to anthrax.</p><p>The ECBC notified eight companies in six states on 23 May the samples they received may potentially be live anthrax.</p><p>Additional labs were notified two days later &ndash; another lab in Texas, five more in Maryland and one each in New York, California and Virginia, plus the lab at the Osan Air Base in Korea.</p><p>The DOD issued an immediate recall on 25 May. It said all samples, except those at Osan Air Base, which were promptly destroyed, are being securely transferred to CDC or the US Laboratory Response Network for further testing. </p><p>DOD said samples of other agents sent to the private-sector labs will be tested to ensure they're not live. </p><p>The military said the CDC has sent officials from the Federal Select Agent Program, which oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products, to the DOD labs to conduct onsite investigations. </p><p>CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told <i>Scrip</i> updates on the situation would be provided as the investigation continues.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
