<p>Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals have edged in ahead in the race to bring the first PCSK9 inhibitor to market in the US. The US FDA has granted their drug Praluent (alirocumab) a priority review, giving it a target action date of 24 July 2015. Amgen, with its rival product evolocumab, has a target date of 27 August.</p><p>Sanofi/Regeneron's Biologic License Application (BLA) was submitted with data from 10 Phase III trials in the ODYSSEY program. The drug is to treat hypercholesterolemia, in patients who have failed to achieve target cholesterol levels on statins or who cannot tolerate statins, or in people with genetic conditions causing high cholesterol.</p><p>Sanofi/Regeneron managed to leapfrog their competitor in the PSCK9 race to market by acquiring a priority review voucher for $67.5m from Biomarin in July 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 31 July 2014</a>). This bought precious time in the US approval process, shortening the review time from 10 to six months. Amgen's BLA was accepted in November 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amgens-evolocumab-1st-PCSK9-inhibitor-under-FDA-review-354958" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Sanofi/Regeneron will need to make the most of the five weeks head start they hope to enjoy in the US, since not much separates the drugs in Phase III data on LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy, safety, or convenience of dosing. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analysts forecast sales of $5.2bn for evolocumab and $5.0bn for alirocumab in 2023.</p><p>However, the competition is also clouded by a patent dispute, with Amgen claiming its rivals have infringed three of its patents that claim monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the blood (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amgen-takes-PCSK9-contest-to-court-354567" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 21 October 2014</a>).</p><p>The third horse in the PCSK9 race is Pfizer with bococizumab. </p><p>Sanofi/Regeneron recently announced that the European Medicines Agency had accepted for review their Marketing Authorization Application for alirocumab. Amgen announced it had submitted an MAA in Europe last September.</p><p>Related stories: </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofi-and-Regeneron-get-off-the-approval-starting-blocks-with-alirocumab-356087" target="_new">Sanofi and Regeneron get off the approval starting blocks with alirocumab</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Alirocumabs-ODYSSEY-continues-into-once-monthly-dosing-territory-356060" target="_new">Alirocumab's ODYSSEY continues into once-monthly dosing territory</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-inhibitors-shine-at-AHA-but-how-to-differentiate-355132" target="_new">PCSK9 inhibitors shine at AHA, but how to differentiate?</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-PCSK9-inhibitors-alirocumab-and-evolocumab-side-by-side-355131" target="_new">INFOGRAPHIC: PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab side-by-side</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">Golden ticket?
