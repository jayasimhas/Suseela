<p> As any fule kno, a major key to success in pharmaceutical R&amp;D is completing your clinical trials successfully, and new research from Citeline shows that here in 2014 Novartis led the way. </p> <p> The research conducted by Citeline's senior vice-president of new product development and chief science officer Dr Christine Blazynski and published in a white paper reflects a snapshot of the trials reported as completed or terminated within 2014 in Citeline's clinical trials database TrialTrove on 3 March 2015. It shows that 5,100 Phase I, I/II, II, II/III, III and IV trials were either completed or terminated during 2014. Five companies finished more than 200 trials each; following Novartis were fellow big guns Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer and Merck &amp; Co. </p> <p> The research also found that the largest portion of these trials were in patients with type 2 diabetes, with studies in hepatitis C, breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) coming next. When broken down by clinical stage, type 2 diabetes also led the number of completed Phase III trials, but was further back at Phase II, trailing breast cancer, NSCLC, HCV and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. </p> <p> Unsurprisingly, given the direction of R&amp;D, two of the most active therapy areas were found to be autoimmune &amp; inflammation (A&amp;I) and oncology. </p> <h2> Autoimmune and inflammation </h2> <p> For A&amp;I, the most popular indication overall was rheumatoid arthritis with 139 completed trials, although asthma, COPD, psoriasis and allergic rhinitis all topped 50 studies each (see figure 1). </p> <p> <img src="-/media/53EDBDDC877D4C08A35B695F5C983259.ashx"> </p> <p> But for pharma company purposes, a more interesting datapoint is how many of these trials were successful, particularly at Phase III. And here it is seen that COPD had the highest success rate, at 73%, (see figure 2) although this flurry of positive activity in COPD represents the culmination of fixed-dose combination (FDC) trials involving approved monotherapies &ndash; so a high success rate is to be expected, noted Dr Blazynski. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/AB1ABC4286BC4FF280060C5E8DDE52C7.ashx"> </p> <p> European-headquartered companies dominated the leading trial sponsors in the A&amp;I area, holding the top four spots (see figure 5), and likewise for the completed Phase III studies where Novartis, GSK, Roche and Boehringer Ingelheim topped the list. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/85EA79E3B2064914AC67CC4A3EE1C16D.ashx"> </p> <p> But in terms of successful trials, Novartis led with 25 trials that attained primary endpoint, followed by GSK with 17, Pfizer with 11, Boehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca with nine each, Roche and Lilly with eight apiece, and Vertex with six successful trials. </p> <p> For Phase III trials, of most importance overall as the make or break point for most drug programs, the top five companies with the largest numbers of trials meeting primary endpoints were Novartis (16), GSK (12), BI (8), Teva (5) and Lilly (5). </p> <p> Novartis's success can be partly attributed to the stellar performance of its new anti-IL17 product Cosentyx (secukinumab), which enjoyed six Phase III trials that met primary endpoint: four in psoriasis, and two in psoriatic arthritis. Eli Lilly's rival IL-17 targeting product ixekizumab completed four trials in psoriasis that met primary endpoint. </p> <h2> Oncology </h2> <p> In cancer, across all of TrialTrove's oncology coverage, at the time of the data export, there were 1,245 trials that completed or were terminated during 2014; 982 trials completed. </p> <p> Trials investigating breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were the most frequently completed trials and the leading industry sponsors of these oncology trials were Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and AstraZeneca (see figure 10). Roche's trials were centered on NSCLC, followed by breast cancer. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/00DAB6392B124C85AE07C026AC1BB613.ashx"> </p> <p> Dr Blazynski said that at the drug level, the vast majority of later-stage trials involved drugs already on the market. &quot;Looking only at those trials hitting their primary endpoints, there was a very limited number of novel drugs in comparison to the autoimmune/inflammatory therapeutic area,&quot; she noted. Even so, novel anticancers completing Phase III last year included Lilly's ramucirumab, a fully-human MAb against VEGF receptor-2, first launched in July 2014 for GI, stomach and esophageal cancer. Merck &amp; Co's rolapitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, is being developed by Opko Health and Tesaro for radiation/chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. </p> <p> Also included was Boehringer Ingelheim's afatinib. In addition to completing two NSCLC trials with Stage III/IV squamous cell patients, the LUX-Head &amp; Neck 1 trial met its primary endpoint of progression free survival in second-line or greater, refractory or relapsed stage IV patients. </p> <p> To download the full white paper, Clinical Trial Completion &ndash; Who &amp; What Set The Mark, visit <a href="https://citeline.com/category/whitepapers/" target="_new">citeline.com</a>. </p>
