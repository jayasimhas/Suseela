<p>The Senate Finance Committee on 22 April backed giving President Barack Obama trade promotion authority (TPA) &ndash; often called fast track &ndash; which may help him more quickly seal trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and Europe.</p><p>The committee voted 20-6 to pass the TPA, which managed to garner the support of seven Democratic members of the Senate panel. Five Democrats, however, voted against the bill, which has been shunned by most members of the party, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nevada) &ndash; breaking with the president on the measure, known as the <i>Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015</i>.</p><p>With the TPA, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-bill-seeks-to-speed-Asia-Europe-trade-deals-357925" target="_new">introduced</a> last week in the House and Senate, President Obama would have the power to negotiate international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals.</p><p>Mr Obama had gone on the <i>MSNBC</i> political program <i>Hardball</i> on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-plays-hardball-on-trade-insists-Dem-opponents-wrong-357996" target="_new">21 April</a> to publicly plead with lawmakers to give him the fast-track authority.</p><p>While on the show, he condemned members of his own party for not supporting the TPA bill and the trade deals, like Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat-Massachusetts), who has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">especially critical</a> of the TPP, a pact between the US and 11 Asia-Pacific nations: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.</p><p>While the TPA has been backed by most Republicans, Senator Richard Burr (North Carolina) gave it a thumbs down on 22 April &ndash; the only member of his party on the Senate Finance panel to reject the bill.</p><p>But a handful of other Republicans &ndash; mostly conservative members of the Tea Party &ndash; also have threatened to vote against the TPA.</p><p>The fast-track bill now goes to the full Senate for a vote, although Senator Orrin Hatch (Republican-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee, said he was not sure how quickly the chamber would take up the measure.</p><p>The House Ways & Means Committee also is expected to begin considering the bill on 23 April, with the potential a vote could come the same day.</p><p>A rival fast-track bill, however, is expected to be introduced in the House by Representative Sandy Levin (Democrat-Michigan) and has gained the support of the top Democrat in the chamber, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (California).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
