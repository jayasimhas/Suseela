<p>Mind the price gap. Amid all the din over the price of Gilead's hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), the Bangladeshi firm, Incepta Pharmaceuticals, has gone ahead and launched a cut-price generic version of the product at a maximum retail price (MRP) of just Taka800 ($10.4) per tablet.</p><p>This is as opposed to Sovaldi's reported $1,000 per pill cost or $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, although some experts say it's probably an unfair comparison given the scale of regulatory data/scrutiny around the innovator product. </p><p>Yet, Incepta's feat could potentially stoke the Sovaldi pricing fire against the backdrop of ongoing patent challenges and price-related litigation. The French charity MÃ©decins du Monde (MdM; Doctors of the World), which has filed an opposition with the European Patent Office against one of Gilead's Sovaldi patents, had already claimed that generic versions of the drug could be produced for &euro;88 <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Charity-seeks-to-overturn-European-Sovaldi-patent-356676%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com10 February 2015)</a>. Last year a lawsuit from Philadelphia's public transit agency was reported to have claimed that Gilead was abusing its rights as a patent holder by charging ''discriminatory prices'' with no rational basis other than to boost its bottom line.</p><p>Incepta's managing director, Abdul Muktadir, told <i>Scrip</i> that his firm's product had been indigenously developed and is manufactured at the company's site in Zirabo, Savar. </p><p>''There has not been any technical collaboration with [any] other party. The product is available for Bangladesh and other least developed countries (LDCs) where the product can be legally marketed under the provisions of TRIPS [Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights],'' Mr Muktadir clarified. </p><p>Least-developed countries do not have to protect pharmaceutical patents and test data until 1 January 2016 under the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health.</p><p>Mr Muktadir maintained that the Zirabo site had been approved by the UK MHRA. Details on the firm's website say the MHRA inspected the Zirabo plant in February 2011 and the firm received the GMP approval for its solid dosage form facility in July that year. </p><p>It's, however, still early days still for the Incepta's generic (marketed as Hopetavir) and Mr Muktadir said sales only began on 3 February. </p><p>''The product is not yet a big seller. The sales value is quite low,'' Mr Muktadir, who is also general secretary of the Bangladesh Pharma Industry Association, added.</p><p>While it's not immediately clear how Gilead views the Bangladeshi foray into the hepatitis C segment, it's clear that Incepta is not the only one on the job. </p><p>Beximco, which is known to have supply linkages with leading generic firms in markets such as Australia <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Beximco-debuts-in-Australia-via-multi-partner-alliance-356306%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 22 January 2015)</a>, told <i>Scrip</i> that it too was working on a sofosbuvir version but had a ''different strategy''. The firm declined to share details citing confidentiality issues. </p><p>Beximco believes that though Gilead has licensing agreements in place to increase access to hepatitis C treatments in developing countries, such drugs should be made available at a much lower costs, with technology transfer being done ''without looking at commercial benefit for the poorest nations or LDCs''.</p><p>Significantly, industry sources indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that Gilead's licensing pact with a clutch of Indian firms for sofosbuvir covered Bangladesh and certain other LDCs. How things play out on the pricing front here on, may be interesting, they added.</p><p>Last year Gilead entered into licensing deals with the seven India-based firms including Cipla and Zydus Cadila to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a>. Biocon was recently added to the list of licensees.</p><p>India has previously rejected one of Gilead's patent applications for Sovaldi essentially on the grounds that it falls under section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act and failed to meet the conditions therein. The Delhi High Court had, however, subsequently set aside the rejection and also observed that the patent office may have been potentially ''influenced'' by material placed on record by pre-grant opposition applicants <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-points-to-para-lifts-potential-for-bias-in-Indian-Sovaldi-case-356703%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 11 February 2015)</a>. Natco and the US based non-profit group, Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK) had previously filed pre-grant patent oppositions against the Sovaldi patent in India.</p>
