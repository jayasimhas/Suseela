<p>Sanofi continues to celebrate a week of positive updates as its Lantus follow-on product, Toujeo (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 300U/mL), has received a preliminary green light in Europe for use in types 1 and 2 diabetes. </p><p>Earlier this week the US FDA also approved Toujeo; a product intended to be a much more concentrated follow-up to Sanofi's once-daily long-acting basal insulin Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA origin] injection, 100 U/mL), which is on the verge of losing patent protection (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-wins-US-approval-for-Lantus-follow-up-Toujeo-356952" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 26 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Unlike the FDA though, Europe's regulatory committee has included a hypoglycemia benefit over Lantus in its summary of opinion for Toujeo. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Rajan Sharma said, "This acknowledgement of benefit is hugely important as hypoglycemia (particularly nocturnal) is the only real advantage Toujeo holds over Lantus and even this is contentious."</p><p>He said pricing will be the key in the next steps for Toujeo, "but assuming the follow-on product is priced at parity to Lantus we'd expect reasonable uptake when considering it will be competing in a market which will soon include biosimilar Lantus." Â </p><p>Sanofi will be pleased with the positive news but rival Lilly won't be in a celebratory mood. Earlier this week Lilly disclosed it was delaying the US and European submissions for its basal insulin peglispro until after 2016 because of liver concerns. Lilly also has been trying to bring its own version of Lantus to the US market, but a patent infringement suit filed by Sanofi put a damper on the Indianapolis, Indiana firm's plans.</p><p>The EMA's committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) noted in its 27 February opinion that insulin glargine 100 U/ml and Toujeo are not bioequivalent and are not directly interchangeable. "Therefore, when switching from insulin glargine 100 U/ml to Toujeo, this can be done on a unit to unit basis, but a higher Toujeo dose (approx 10-18%) may be needed to achieve target ranges for plasma glucose levels," it said. </p><p>Toujeo is expected to launch in April in the US and the European Commission is expected to make a final decision on granting marketing authorization for Toujeo in the EU in the coming months. Like Lantus, Toujeo is administered as a disposable prefilled pen, called SoloSTAR.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare has predicted that in the wider scheme of things Toujeo "will be hugely important to Sanofi's commercial performance and share of the diabetes market." </p><p>The CHMP positive opinion of Toujeo is based on results from the EDITION clinical trial program, a series of Phase III studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Toujeo compared to Lantus in more than 3,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were uncontrolled on their current therapy. Insulin glargine was first authorized as a 100 U/ml formulation as Lantus and Optisulin in the EU in June 2000.</p>
