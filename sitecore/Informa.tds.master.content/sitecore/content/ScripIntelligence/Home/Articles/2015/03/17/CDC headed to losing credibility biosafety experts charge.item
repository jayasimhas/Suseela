<p>It's no surprise the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was not eager to make public a scathing report from a panel of outside expert advisers that condemned the agency's laboratory safety practices &ndash; declaring it "is on the way to losing credibility" after a series of near-calamities involving anthrax, the H5N1 influenza virus and Ebola.</p><p>An 11-member external laboratory safety workgroup (ELSW) of the advisory committee to CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden delivered the report in January, but the agency waited until now to post it &ndash; quietly sneaking it onto its lab safety website. </p><p>The panel of biosafety experts said the CDC's leadership commitment toward safety has been "inconsistent and insufficient at multiple levels." </p><p>"The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC," the panel of advisers declared. </p><p>They said safety at the CDC is viewed by many employees as something separate from and outside the primary missions of public health and research. </p><p>"Safety is not integrated into strategic planning and is not currently part of the CDC culture, enterprise-wide," the ELSW panel found. </p><p>"Disturbingly," the advisers said, the negative responses "peak" among those CDC employees, especially those with master's degrees, who work at biosafety level (BSL) 3 and 4 labs, where experiments are done using the world's most dangerous pathogens, like anthrax, smallpox, H5N1 and Ebola.</p><p><b>Series of blunders</b></p><p>The report comes after the CDC disclosed on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-anthrax-mishap-puts-spotlight-on-biosafety-lab-vulnerabilities-352431" target="_new">20 June 2014</a> that about 80 Atlanta-based employees were potentially exposed to live <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, the bacterium that causes anthrax, because proper protocols were not followed.</p><p>Then <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Anthrax-smallpox-and-H5N1-Bad-beyond-Walter-White-352849" target="_new">a few weeks later</a>, Dr Frieden admitted that a scientist at his agency had cross-contaminated a less harmful strain of animal influenza, H9N2, with the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 and shipped it to a partner laboratory at the US Department of Agriculture.</p><p>The CDC waited until Christmas Eve to reveal that on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-reports-another-lab-mishap-this-time-Ebola-355849" target="_new">22 December 2014</a>, one of its lab technicians was possibly exposed to Ebola when personnel at the agency's Atlanta, Georgia BSL-4 lab sent the wrong samples, which were thought to have possibly contained live virus, to a less secure BSL-2, whose technicians were not equipped to handle the deadly disease.</p><p>None of the CDC&rsquo;s lab accidents resulted in anyone actually contracting anthrax, H5N1 or Ebola. </p><p>But they have brought to light the lax attitudes about safety at US labs.</p><p>Indeed, the CDC has not been alone in lab mishaps this year.</p><p>On <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Smallpox-discovery-triggers-FBI-probe-NIH-lab-search-352714" target="_new">8 July 2014</a>, federal officials revealed that six vials labeled as "variola," or smallpox, had been discovered a week earlier by an FDA scientist in an unsecured cold storage room on the main campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><p>Then this past <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ricin-other-unsecured-pathogens-found-at-NIH-FDA-353742" target="_new">September</a>, the NIH and the FDA acknowledged they had discovered more deadly pathogens, including the highly lethal agent ricin, hidden away in their laboratories and improperly stored.</p><p>Those lab incidents are the result of "hubris" by scientists who have become inert about working with dangerous pathogens, Dr Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told a House subcommittee in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Whats-life-and-limb-worth-Gauging-antibiotics-value-352953" target="_new">July 2014</a>.</p><p>In late <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-orders-immediate-sweep-of-infectious-agent-labs-353593" target="_new">August 2014</a>, the White House ordered an immediate nook-and-cranny search and review of government laboratories to ensure all toxic and infectious agents were safe and secure in an attempt to minimize the potential for any future incidents.</p><p>This past October, the Obama administration imposed a pause in federal funding for so-called gain-of-function (GOF) research involving influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses.</p><p>At a two-day symposium convened in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Of-mice-and-men---and-deadly-viruses-tinkering-with-nature-355778" target="_new">December 2014</a> by the National Academy of Sciences to discuss the values and risks of GOF research, Dr Andrew Hebbeler, assistant director for biological and chemical threats at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, acknowledged it was not simply the anthrax, smallpox and H5N1 mishaps themselves, but the "clustering of three in such a short time at some of our premier research institutions that caused us to reassess the safety and security that underlies the decisions that guide some of our investment in gain of function studies."</p><p>The ELSW panel, which Dr Frieden established in July 2014 in light of the lab accidents, said safety programs at the CDC are inconsistently implemented across the agency.</p><p>"A clearly articulated CDC safety mission, vision or direction is lacking," the advisers said.</p><p>They said governance structures do not support maintaining a culture of shared responsibility and accountability across the CDC, and risk assessments of proposed research activities are either not being done in a standardized manner or are not being done at all. </p><p>The ELSW also said CDC's laboratory safety training is inadequate.</p><p>They said a significant percentage of CDC staff expressed concerns about experiencing negative repercussions, either personally or more generally to the agency, as a result of reporting incidents involving exposures to pathogenic organisms or other hazardous materials. </p><p>The biosafety expert panel said many employees neither understand the agency's response to accidents nor how that information is communicated to the larger agency community outside immediately affected labs. </p><p><b>CDC responds</b></p><p>The ELSW laid out a set of recommendations for the CDC, which spokesman Tom Skinner told Scrip the agency already has done much of the work to address."</p><p>Mr Skinner insisted the CDC has "made progress in the last several months, putting in place key actions to address the root causes of recent incidents and to provide redundant safeguards across the agency," which he said includes establishing a new position of associate director for laboratory science and safety to report to Dr Frieden.</p><p>Recruitment for the position currently is underway, Mr Skinner said.</p><p>The CDC also has been working on establishing additional safeguards as part of standard operating procedures for all material intended for inactivation and removal from high containment labs; creating and reinforcing effective and redundant systems and controls for protocols and procedures, including inactivation and transfer of biological materials and access to laboratories; and standardizing laboratory protocols to include additional safety elements, he said.</p><p>Mr Skinner said the agency also has made progress on ensuring adherence to laboratory quality and safety protocols; implementing new procedures and training of CDC laboratory staff aimed at keeping pace with advancing technologies and protocol demands; developing a standardized approach for conducting risk assessments for work with biological materials; putting in place enhanced competency-based laboratory safety training programs; and reviewing and monitoring the implementation of training policies and procedures for new and existing staff.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
