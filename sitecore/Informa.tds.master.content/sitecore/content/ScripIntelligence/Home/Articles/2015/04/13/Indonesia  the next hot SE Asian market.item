<p>Indonesia could well be the next high potential south-east Asian market that innovator and generic firms may want to keep their eyes firmly on.</p><p>The key reasons: increased government spending on healthcare; a strong OTC market but possibilities of an "explosion" of growth in prescription generics over the next three to five years as the government steps in to source medicines from the private sector; and partnering and acquisition opportunities for foreign firms.</p><p>According to a new CPhI study in collaboration with research partner Global Business Reports released at the Jakarta International Expo last week, Indonesia is expected to double its current healthcare expenditure, estimated at 3% of total GDP spend in 2013. </p><p>What is expected to potentially trigger a significant change in the Indonesian pharma landscape is the nation's universal healthcare programme, the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), that was set in motion last year and has been designed to facilitate access to drugs for a forecasted population of 257.5 million by 2019. Currently, only half of the archipelago nation's population is covered &ndash; implying that a potential sharp rise in spending on medicines over the next few years appeared imminent.</p><p>Under the five-year initiative aimed at providing universal healthcare, 19% of healthcare expenditure is predicated to be attributed to pharmaceuticals once fully implemented and 92% of medicines on the essential drugs list will be low-cost generics. </p><p>The $6.5bn Indonesian pharma market is expected to continue to grow at an annual rate of 12.5% through to 2018. The dominant OTC segment which accounted for about 40% the market in 2014 is expected rise to 50% in 2015. A burgeoning, health-conscious, middle class with an increased disposable income is seen fuelling the rise in OTC consumption trends. Each year, nearly seven million Indonesians newly achieve middle class or higher socio-economic status, the report said. </p><p>It also said that while the OTC market is thriving in the short-term, a "steadier, linear outcome" is predicted in the medium-to-long term future &ndash; the peak in OTC demand is thought to have more or less reached its tipping point. "With government plans to spend more on healthcare, coupled with a tightened regulatory environment, CPhI forecasts that prescription generics will make up an increased percentage of drug consumption in the longer term," the report underscored.</p><h2>Foreign Investment</h2><p>The report also predicts a significant influx of foreign investments and partnerships with local firms for distribution.</p><p>"The potential of standardised regulatory requirements could transition Indonesia from largely domestic sales to a regional exporter of drugs," it claimed.</p><p>An increasing number of companies in Indonesia are cGMP certified (83%), which makes them "extremely appealing" to overseas multinationals looking for a gateway into the Indonesian market, the report pointed out.</p><p>Current rules cap foreign ownership of a company in Indonesia at 75%, with local partners controlling the balance. </p><p>The entry of foreign firms, CPhI believes, will provide opportunities for local firms to progress alongside the international industry &ndash; they can partner with multinationals and move their businesses towards operating as regional contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMOs). </p><p>Actavis Indonesia, the first foreign pharmaceutical company to have manufacturing operations on the ground in Indonesia, currently acts as a CDMO and serves many large pharmaceutical companies there. In 2010, PT Genero Pharmaceuticals switched its focus to emerge as Indonesia&rsquo;s first independent CDMO.</p><p>Moving forward, Indonesian manufacturers could partner with foreign manufactures under equal or partial ownership models, where more of the risk is shared. </p><p>"If innovative partnerships prevail, a thriving, growing pharma economy will be established between multinationals and the existing manufacturing base, which should help move the country towards becoming a major international drugs exporter in the region," the study said.</p>
