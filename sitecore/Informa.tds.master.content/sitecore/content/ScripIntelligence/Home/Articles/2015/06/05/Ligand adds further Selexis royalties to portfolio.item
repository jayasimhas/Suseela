<p><p>Ligand added to its royalty-generating portfolio through a second deal with Selexis announced 11 May. </p><p>The San Diego biotech is paying $4m in cash for the rights to a portfolio of 15 biologics, including some biosimilars that are in various stages &ndash; ranging from preclinical to Phase III. The companies did not identify what the compounds are or what disease areas they will target. Ligand is eligible for future milestone payments and royalty rights. </p><p>This isn't the first deal the two companies have struck; Ligand inked a similar partnership with Switzerland-based Selexis in April 2013for 15 biologics. This deal was Ligand's first deal outside of small molecules. The deal amount was not disclosed, but Ligand says it has earned back nearly 10% of the original payment. </p><p>"This is an efficient transaction that bolts on potentially lucrative economic rights to numerous new programs and follows the positive developments and successes we have realized with our first transaction with Selexis," said Ligand CEO John Higgins.</p><p>The former biotech now acts more like a venture capital, buying small stakes in fledgling biotechs, as well as the royalty rights to certain assets. Yet, Ligand doesn&rsquo;t do any of the development or commercialization work. In 2006, Ligand sold off its portfolio of marketed oncology and pain products &ndash; which brought in nearly $200m in revenues annually &ndash; for $518m and converted itself into an R&D specialist and royalty collector. </p><p>"This deal significantly expands Ligand&rsquo;s already robust portfolio, which now exceeds 120 fully-funded assets. Importantly, it also diversifies our portfolio by increasing our number of partners to over 70 and further expands our potential biologics and biosimilars income streams," added Higgins. </p><p><p>
