<p>Spark Therapeutics is preparing to seek the first-ever US FDA approval for a gene therapy after several people who couldn't read a menu in a dimly lit restaurant or take a walk alone at dusk had their vision restored in a Phase III clinical trial testing SPK-RPE65.</p><p>Two-thirds of the 21 people with RPE65-mediated inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) who were treated with SPK-RPE65 in a 31-patient Phase III trial derived the maximum possible benefit that could be measured by the study's primary visual function test &ndash; navigation of a mobility course under lighting levels ranging from a moonless summer night (one lux) to a brightly lit office (400 lux). Spark plans to submit a biologic license application (BLA) in 2016 and CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo hopes the company will be a leader in its field when it comes time to price the gene therapy.</p><p>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Spark traded as high as $74.93 per share on Oct. 5 &ndash; a 70.6% gain over its Oct. 2 closing price &ndash; after the company revealed top-line results and noted that it will provide additional details from the pivotal trial at upcoming medical meetings. However, the stock ultimately closed 20.7% higher at $53.02 on a day when the Nasdaq gained 1.56%, but the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell 0.68%. </p><p><b>Phase III Data, BLA Submission On Schedule</b></p><p>With its Phase III data and plans for a 2016 BLA submission, Spark's SPK-RPE65 development program remains on the schedule revealed at the start of 2015 when the company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Spark-to-IPO-to-fund-first-US-gene-therapy-approval-355927" target="_new">began its campaign for an initial public offering</a>. Now, Spark's stock is trading 130% higher than <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Spark-ignites-investors-one-of-years-first-five-biotech-IPOs-356490" target="_new">its $23 IPO price</a> as the company begins to share data from its Phase III program to treat IRDs caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene, which initially leads to "night blindness" and eventually results in total loss of vision. </p><p>"This is a degenerative disease, so people are getting worse. We didn't just stop their vision from getting worse, we gave them back function," Spark Therapeutics co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Marrazzo said in an interview with Scrip.</p><p>SPK-RPE65 met the Phase III primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant improvement from baseline at one-year after treatment in terms of improvement of functional vision as measured by the change in bilateral mobility testing for 21 patients in the clinical trial's intervention group versus 10 patients in the trial's control group (p=0.001). </p><p>"Part of the data to be released in the future shows the improvements we saw at each of the time points over that year. In the second Phase I study we ran, in subjects that would've qualified for the Phase III study, we have followed them for two to four years and the benefits have been maintained in the mobility test and light sensitivity," Marrazzo said.</p><p>Spark's gene therapy achieved statistical significance for two out of three of the Phase III study's secondary endpoints: full-field light sensitivity threshold testing (p<0.001) and="" mobility="" test="" change="" score="" for="" the="" first="" injected="" eye="" (p="0.001)." spk-rpe65="" did="" not="" show="" a="" significant="" improvement="" in="" visual="" acuity="" (p="0.17)," which="" was="" expected="" based="" on="" prior="" studies="" and="" the="" effect="" that="" rpe65-mediated="" irds="" have="" on="" vision=""></0.001)></p><p>"This is a disease that is affecting light sensitivity and peripheral vision rather than central vision," Marrazzo said.</p><p>Spark picked its Phase III endpoints based on guidance from the FDA, but added visual acuity &ndash; a measure of central vision &ndash; as a secondary endpoint, because some patients in earlier studies gained letters on the standard eye exam chart. Patients in the Phase III study, who ranged in age from 4 to 44, also had improved visual acuity, but the difference between the intervention and control groups was not statistically significant or clinical meaningful.</p><p>The company reported no serious adverse events or deleterious immune responses for patients treated with SPK-RPE65, which is delivered via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The gene therapy has a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sparks-gene-therapy-granted-breakthrough-status-354909" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> from the FDA for the treatment of IRDs.</p><p><b>Approval Plans, Pricing Discussions</b></p><p>Spark is speaking with the FDA and ex-US regulators about submitting applications for marketing approval. The company will narrow its guidance regarding the timing of those filings to specific timeframes in 2016 and beyond following those discussions.</p><p>While it would be quite a feat for Spark to win the first-ever FDA approval for a gene therapy, Marrazzo noted that SPK-RPE65 also would be "the first pharmacological treatment in an inherited retinal disease. Patients don't care if it's a gene therapy, they just want to get better."</p><p>Payers are more likely to care about the mode of delivery for Spark's treatment, since the US doesn't have a model on which to base pricing for a gene therapy. Marrazzo said the company has done some market research and has been speaking with payers about pricing and payment models for SPK-RPE65, but it's too early to speculate on what the therapy's pricing will be and whether treatment will be paid for in a lump sum fee or a payment over a certain period of time.</p><p>"It may be a long-lasting or a one-time treatment. Patients gain function back and they do not have to get treatments over and over again. It has the potential to be extremely meaningful to patients and their families," he said, noting that about 3,500 people in the US and the five largest EU markets suffer from vision loss due to a mutation of the RPE65 gene. </p><p>Based on the functional improvement for people who've received SPK-RPE65 to date, Marrazzo noted that Spark will "continue work on pricing and accelerate those discussions we've had with payers, looking at how we measure the benefit and what value it brings to families."</p><p>But a larger question looms: What is the most appropriate payment model to accelerate and encourage investment in potentially curative gene therapies and incentivize their development rather than lifelong treatment with prescription drugs?</p><p>"My goal for this company is to be on the leading part of this discussion of how we create a payment model for a treatment that is one-time treatment. I think it's important that people focus on that payment model piece as much as pricing," Marrazzo said.</p><p><p><p><p>
