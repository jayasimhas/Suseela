<p>Mylan continues to prowl deal street in India, this time snapping up specified female health care businesses of the privately held Mumbai-based Famy Care for $750m in cash plus additional contingent payments of up to $50m.</p><p>The deal ends months of speculation of Mylan's interest in Famy, the world's largest producer of generic oral contraceptives, and adds to a string of buys by the US firm in India over the recent past including the acquisition of Strides Arcolab's injectables arm, Agila Specialties <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1.6bn-Agila-injects-strengths-into-Mylan-340413%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 28 February 2013)</a>. </p><p>The latest deal, while building on an existing alliance with Famy, also gives Mylan an ''enhanced and vertically integrated platform'' to accelerate growth in the global women's health care space. Low cost production and FDA-approved sites in India are another plus for Mylan. The US firm sees growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets via the acquisition. </p><p>Famy Care is expected to spin off its female health care businesses under a court approved scheme of demerger and Mylan will, post demerger, acquire the shares of the new resulting firm. Famy brings with it more than 900 employees. </p><p>Famy's financials were not immediately available but previous reports in the local media have reported the firm's turnover at INR4bn ($65m). Going by that number the deal value exceeds a 10x revenue multiple. Investment bankers had previously suggested that as a rule of thumb, businesses such as Famy could get valued at 15-18 (x) EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization).</p><p>The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to Mylan's adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth profile upon closing. It is expected to close in the second half of 2015, subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions.</p><p>Private equity investor AIF Capital and the founders of Famy had been said to be considering divesting up to 75% of the company, and Mylan, which has a long-running alliance with Famy, was seen as a potentially interested party <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-a-player-as-PE-fund-seeks-Famy-exit-350823%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 24 March 2014)</a>. Famy's founders had then fervently denied any intent to sell.</p><p>In 2008, Mylan entered into an alliance with Famy to develop and supply 22 oral contraceptive medicines in the US. The deal also provided the US firm with a right of first refusal for additional oral contraceptive products and certain additional markets, including Australia and Japan. In the US, Famy and Mylan have basket of 12 approved products, with ANDAs pending FDA approval for 30 more. </p><p>Last year, Mylan and Famy entered into a settlement and license pact with Warner Chilcott, concerning Mylan's ANDA for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol chewable tablets and ferrous fumarate chewable tablets. </p><h2>opportunities</h2><p>Among other strategic gains, Mylan expects the Famy deal to ''complement'' its pending acquisition of Abbott's non-US developed markets specialty and branded generics business, which also includes a women's health care portfolio and sales and marketing capabilities. </p><p>''We see many opportunities to tap the large women's health care market in Europe, particularly through our pending Abbott deal; the prospect of driving additional value from this business in North America; and exciting growth potential in emerging markets,'' Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said in a company statement. </p><p>Last year, Abbott sold part of its branded generics business to Mylan in exchange for a stake in the company <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Abbott-sells-branded-generics-business-to-Mylan-352872%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 14 July 2014)</a>. </p><p>Mylan also sees itself as a hormonal contraceptives leader in emerging markets with the acquisition. Lower penetration rates for oral contraceptives in emerging markets represent significant growth opportunities. The global women's health care market is estimated to be growing at a compound annual rate of about 6%, with hormonal contraceptives being the largest and fastest growing products in the segment. </p><p>Mylan has already launched a clutch of women's care products in India, expanding its range of commercial offerings beyond the initial antiretrovirals (ARVs) portfolio <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-expanding-in-India-with-move-into-womens-care-344492%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 28 June 2013)</a>. </p><h2>Famy </h2><p>Incorporated in 1990, Famy manufactures a range of reproductive health care products, including oral and emergency contraceptives, intra-uterine devices (IUDs), tubal ligation rings and hormone-replacement therapy products. More than 15% of the world's women using oral contraceptive pills are claimed to be on a Famy product. </p><p>Two of Famy's four manufacturing facilities in India have been approved by the US FDA and the EU. </p><p>Famy, which has a significant presence in the private, institutional and non-governmental organization sectors, is also the first generics firm to be prequalified by the WHO for hormonal contraceptives.</p><p>A Mylan statement said that the shareholders of Famy will evaluate and pursue other opportunities in the firm's residual business outside of women's health care, but gave no specifics.</p>
