<p>Amgen's oncolytic virus therapy <i>Imlygic</i> (talimogene laherparepvec) has been given a positive opinion in advanced melanoma by Europe's top scientific advisory panel, but significant changes in the competitive landscape mean the drug is unlikely to garner high sales.</p><p>The launch of immunotherapies, BRAF V600 inhibitors and MEK inhibitors have transformed the treatment of melanoma over the past three years. Analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare have suggested annual sales of Imlygic would be only around $100m in 2020. "The positive opinion is based on a trial initiated before drugs such as <i>Tafinlar</i> and <i>Opdivo</i> entered the market," the analysts point out. "In the light of recent advances made in the field of melanoma, using GM-CSF as a comparator is no longer as relevant."</p><p>Nevertheless, it looks like the product's relatively favorable safety profile could stand in its favor.</p><p>"There is still an important need for new treatments with acceptable safety profiles to continue to improve the outlook for patients with this serious life-threatening disease", the European Medicines Agency said. </p><p>Imlygic is the first oncolytic immunotherapy to be recommended for approval worldwide &ndash; it contains a virus derived from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) that has been designed to infect cancer cells, where it uses the cell's energy store to replicate, eventually overwhelming the cell and causing it to die. By producing the cytokine GM-CSF it also stimulates the patient's immune system to recognize and destroy tumor cells.</p><p>The EU's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended Imlygic (previously known as <i>T-Vec</i>) for the treatment of adults with unresectable melanoma that is regionally or distantly metastatic (stage IIIB, IIIC and IVM1A) without affecting the bones, brain, lung or other internal organs. The product is injected directly into melanoma lesions. The recommendation followed assessment by EMA's expert committee, the Committee for Advanced Therapies. Marketing approval by the European Commission usually follows within two to three months after a CHMP recommendation. </p><p>The drug has been shown in the 436-patient study 005/05 to increase the durable response rate compared with GM-CSF treatment, with a DRR of 25.2% compared to 1.2% respectively, the committee noted. The most common side effects are fatigue, chills, pyrexia, nausea, influenza-like illness and injection site pain, and the CHMP recommends it should not be used in severely immunocompromised patients. Initial analysis suggests Imlygic improves survival but that is not yet clear, EMA said. A DRR was defined as disappearance of tumors or at least a 50% reduction of tumors lasting at least six months until the patient's health declined or they required subsequent therapy.</p><p>The EU recommendation does not include patients with very advanced visceral metastatic disease in whom there have been suggestions it might not be as effective as in earlier-stage patients, a concern also expressed at the product's US FDA advisory panel meeting in April, where it was similarly recommended for approval. </p><p>Participants at the FDA meeting were worried about how the product would be accepted on the market, saying the product's labelling should include guidance on administration and dosing, and videos should show prescribers how to use the drug. After the European recommendation, Amgen said consideration of patient acceptance will be part of its plans when the product reaches the market.</p><p>The company's executives also said in a June investor meeting that talimogene laherparepvec may well play an important therapeutic role when combined with other immune-oncology drugs &ndash; it is in combination studies with Bristol-Myers Squibb's <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) and other such agents. The product's PDUFA data is Oct. 27. </p><p>Citeline's Pharmaprojects drug development database reports there are a number of other oncolytic virus-based products in advanced development that will receive a boost from Imlygic's approval recommendation, as follows:</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Stage</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>pelareorep</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Oncolytics Biotech</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>HSV-1716</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Virtu</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>INGN-007</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>VirRx</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>CVA-21</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ViroTarg</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>pexastimogene devacirepvec</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SillaJen</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>telomelysin</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Oncolys</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>enadenotucirev</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PsiOxus</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>GL-ONC1</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Genelux Corp</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><p>Source: Pharmaprojects.</p></table></p><p><p><i>A version of this article is also being published in </i><a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a><i>. </i>Scrip Intelligence<i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</i></p><p>
