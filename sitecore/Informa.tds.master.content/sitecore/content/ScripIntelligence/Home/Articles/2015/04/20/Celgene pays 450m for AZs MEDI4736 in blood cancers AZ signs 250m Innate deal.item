<p>Celgene is paying AstraZeneca $450m up front in order to develop the UK drug maker's anti-PD-L1 product MEDI4736 in a range of blood cancers &ndash; a partnership Celgene thinks could be a "meaningful" driver of growth past 2020. </p><p>MEDI4736, an investigational immune checkpoint inhibitor directed against programed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), was highlighted as one of AstraZeneca's key products in the company's first-quarter earnings announcement on 23 April &ndash; but in the area of non-small cell lung cancer. Now, in the field of hematological cancers, focusing first on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and multiple myeloma (MM), Celgene will take on development of the product. However, Celgene will also have the opportunity to expand research of MEDI4736 into other blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the future. Clinical studies in NHL, MM and MDS are expected to be initiated in the second half of 2015. </p><p>Analysts at JP Morgan said the deal, though "not cheap," will place Celgene well in the competitive PD-L1 market space.</p><p>PD-L1 "is increasingly looking like it will be the backbone for many combination therapies across the oncology landscape (including hematology, where promising initial data has begun to emerge)," JP Morgan analysts said. They added that as this particular arrangement is a strategic license agreement, unlike many other immune-oncology collaborations in place, so no rights are changing hands. </p><p>Under the terms of the agreement &ndash; which was announced on 24 April, the same day as AstraZeneca's 1Q earnings announcement &ndash; Celgene will make an upfront payment of $450m to AstraZeneca. Celgene will lead on development across all clinical trials within the collaboration and will take on all R&D costs until the end of 2016, after which it will take on 75% of costs. Celgene will also be responsible for global commercialization of approved treatments.</p><p>Meanwhile, AstraZeneca will continue to manufacture and book all sales of MEDI4736 and will pay a royalty to Celgene on worldwide sales in hematological indications. The royalty rate will start at 70% and will decrease to approximately half of the sales of MEDI4736 in hematological indications over a period of four years.</p><p>A spokesperson for Celgene told <i>Scrip</i>: "This strategic collaboration leverages the deep expertise of AstraZeneca/MedImmune in immune-oncology along with our existing hematology assets, rich hematology pipeline as well as our experience in the study and treatment of blood cancers. We believe this collaboration further strengthens our broad immune-oncology platform and potentially provides another meaningful driver of growth beyond 2020."</p><p>While Celgene said it is "too early to speculate" on how MEDI4736 will compete against other anti-PD-L1s in the hematological space, the company believes it has "high potential." Current studies of MEDI4736 in hematologic cancers are in Phase I stages.</p><p>Celgene's spokesperson added that the company will also be "examining the potential of MEDI4736 in combination with Celgene therapies that are already well established or an important part of our pipeline."</p><h2>Innate deal</h2><p>On the same day it announced its arrangement with Celgene, AstraZeneca also reported it was launching a co-development and commercialization deal with Innate Pharma for the latter firm's immune-oncology product, IPH2201.</p><p>The deal will focus on broadening development of Innate's anti-NKG2A antibody, including in combination with AstraZeneca's product at the center of the Celgene deal, MEDI4736. The initial development plan includes: Phase II combination clinical trials with MEDI4736 in solid tumors; multiple Phase II trials planned by Innate to study IPH2201 both as monotherapy and in combination with currently approved treatments across a range of cancers; and the development of associated biomarkers. </p><p>Under the terms of the agreements, AstraZeneca will make an initial payment to Innate of $250m. The UK drug maker will pay a further $100m to Innate prior to initiation of Phase III development, as well as additional regulatory and sales-related milestones. AstraZeneca will book all sales and will pay Innate double-digit royalties on net sales. The arrangement includes the right for Innate to co-promote in Europe for a 50% profit share in the territory.</p><p>IPH2201, which is currently in Phase II, is a potential first-in-class humanized IgG4 antibody.</p>
