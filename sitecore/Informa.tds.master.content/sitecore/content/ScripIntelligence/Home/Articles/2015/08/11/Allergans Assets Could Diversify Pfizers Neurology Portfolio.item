<p> If Pfizer Inc. were to buy Allergan plc &ndash; or vice versa &ndash; the merged companies would have a large and actually quite diverse portfolio of drugs for central nervous system (CNS) diseases and conditions. </p> <p> Both pharmaceutical firms disclosed in late October that they're in friendly negotiations about a transaction between the companies, though Allergan nor Pfizer made it clear which one would buy the other. A merger of the two would result in a lower tax rate for Pfizer's operations, because of Allergan's corporate domicile in Ireland, and a combination of the companies would create one big CNS portfolio &ndash; one of Allergan's seven therapeutic areas &ndash; ranging from pain medications to Alzheimer's drugs. </p> <p> <b>Diversity In Neurology</b> </p> <p> <i>Lyrica</i> (pregabalin) is Pfizer's second-largest revenue producer, behind the pneumococcal Prevnar vaccines, and it is the biggest asset in the big pharma's CNS portfolio, which is dominated by pain medications. And, despite double-digit increases in the US and certain other markets, Lyrica's global sales declined 7.4% to $1.2bn in the third quarter from $1.3bn during the same period in 2014. </p> <p> Allergan claims to have the number one CNS business among global pharma firms with $2.7bn in worldwide sales during the first three quarters of 2015. Its Alzheimer's franchise &ndash; the biggest component of the company's CNS product sales &ndash; is in third place globally. (For a comparison of Allergan and Pfizer portfolios in other therapeutic areas, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beyond-Tax-Benefits-Portfolio-Opportunities-In-A-Pfizer-Allergan-Deal-361510?REFID=DLYALT">click here</a>.) </p> <p> Allergan's neurology portfolio includes the <i>Namenda</i> (memantine) franchise for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, including the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merry-Christmas-Four-US-FDA-approvals-and-a-CRL-355850">recently approved</a><i>Namzaric</i> (memantine and donepezil), which combines an extended-release formulation, Namenda XR, with Eisai Co. Ltd.'s and Pfizer's dementia drug Aricept. </p> <p> Namenda IR, the original twice-daily immediate-release formulation, and Namenda XR generated $1.1bn during the first nine months of 2015, but Namzaric didn't launch in the US until the second quarter of this year. Forest Laboratories Inc. reported $1.5bn in annual sales for Namenda IR during the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2013 &ndash; the last full fiscal year of sales reported by Forest before Actavis plc (now Allergan) closed its <a target="_new" href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Analysts-play-MandA-chess-with-Actavis-Pfizer-352617">$28bn acquisition of Forest</a> in July 2014. </p> <p> However, Allergan's neurology portfolio expands beyond the disease to <i>Botox</i> (onabotulinumtoxinA) for migraines, cervical dystonia and neuromuscular spasms; <i>Fetzima</i> (levomilnacipran) for depression; <i>Vraylar</i> (cariprazine) and <i>Saphris</i> (asenapine), which both are indicated for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia; and <i>Savella</i> (milnacipran) for fibromyalgia &ndash; one of Lyrica's key indications. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/A18E94EB40DF4C5C99E1E3282A5E5E2C.ashx"> </p> <p> <b>A Blockbuster Atypical</b> </p> <p> Vraylar won US FDA approval in September &ndash; three years after Allergan and Gedeon Richter Ltd. <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Another-delay-for-GedeonAllergans-cariprazine-358977">first submitted their new drug application</a> (NDA) to the US FDA for the novel antipsychotic. While most antipsychotic drugs are dopamine D2 receptor agonists, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.'s <i>Abilify</i> (aripiprazole) and Vraylar are partial D2 agonists, but the Allergan/Gedeon Richter drug also acts as a partial D3 receptor agonist and patients experience less weight gain and fewer metabolic changes. </p> <p> Vraylar also had a significant effect on negative symptoms, such as inability to participate in conversations or activities, versus risperidone in a 26-week study with 461 schizophrenia patients. </p> <p> Allergan noted during its R&amp;D Day for investors on Nov. 4 in Irvine, California that adding language about the drug's effects on negative symptoms to its label could significantly boost sales, since about 5m of the 13m people who take atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia experience negative symptoms, translating to a $3bn market. The company expects Vraylar to generate at least $1bn and possibly more than $2bn in annual sales. </p> <p> When <i>Scrip</i> asked David Nicholson, Allergan executive vice president of brand research and development, why the company did not pursue negative symptoms as part of the initial schizophrenia and bipolar Vraylar indication, he said, &quot;because it is very difficult&quot; to show an impact in clinical trials. Now that Vraylar is approved and Gedeon Richter has produced the data on negative symptoms, &quot;we will look at how to differentiate Vraylar from other atypical antipsychotics.&quot; </p> <p> Cognitive deficits are a problem for people with schizophrenia that most antipsychotic medicines cannot address, so Vraylar could find a market niche with its effects on negative symptoms, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/COMMENT-Forest-attempts-to-squeeze-cariprazine-into-crowded-antipsychotic-market-337647">Datamonitor Healthcare noted when the NDA was first submitted</a> in November 2012. Allergan also intends to pursue major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression indications for Vraylar. </p> <p> <b>Recently Acquired CNS Assets</b> </p> <p> Allergan's other big depression pipeline programs are the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulators rapastinel (GLYX-13) and AGN-241660 (NRX-1074) purchased in the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-paying-560m-for-Naurex-stays-quiet-on-rumored-generics-sale-to-Teva-359627">recent $560m acquisition of Naurex</a>. The intravenous drug rapastinel is ready for Phase III testing and the oral formulation AGN-241660 is in Phase II for MDD. </p> <p> Patients responded to rapastinel within hours of IV infusion and the effects of a single dose lasted for a week in Phase II without psychotomimetic effects associated with the potent NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. </p> <p> With its rapid and consistent effect on depression symptoms, Allergan forecasts blockbuster sales between $1bn and $2bn or more for rapastinel at its peak, since 30% to 40% of the 24m people with MDD in the US aren't effectively treated by generic depression medications. </p> <p> Allergan's research and development pipeline also includes Phase III programs for the wrinkle-reducer Botox in multiple sclerosis and <i>Viibryd</i> (vilazodone) in generalized anxiety disorder. Phase II programs include Namenda XR for autism and ubrogepant (MK-1602) for migraine headaches. Ubrogepant is one of <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-migraine-portfolio-grows-with-Merck-CGRP-antagonists-359295">multiple oral CGRP antagonists</a> acquired from Merck &amp; Co. Inc. </p> <p> Allergan noted during its R&amp;D Day that the migraine prophylaxis market is worth about $10bn based on prescriptions for topiramate and off-label prescriptions for other oral drugs, but the company predicts that the market could double based on the future approval of CGRP antagonists, including <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-Lilly-and-Amgen-join-battle-for-new-8bn-migraine-prevention-market-359088">biologics in late-stage development</a> and the oral candidates that Allergan licensed from Merck in July. </p> <p> Ubrogepant will enter Phase III in 2016 for the treatment of episodic migraines in patients whose headaches are not well-controlled by triptans or who cannot tolerate triptans, the migraine standard of care. A Phase II dose-finding study is expected to begin soon for the follow-up CGRP antagonist AGN-241689. </p> <p> &quot;The category is large enough for multiple compounds, but we have an advantage with an oral&quot; CGRP antagonist, William Meury, Allergan's executive vice president and president of branded pharma, said during the company's R&amp;D Day. </p> <p> But before ubrogepant and AGN-241689 report their next set of clinical trial results, Allergan will resubmit an application to the FDA in mid to late 2016 for <i>Semprana</i> (dihydroergotamine), an inhaled migraine treatment, which <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Rejection-approval-and-2-moves-to-PhIII-change-Allergan-conversation-352592">previously was rejected</a> due to manufacturing issues. </p> <p> In total, Allergan expects its CNS drug portfolio to contribute significantly to four out of 10 major CNS categories by 2020 &ndash; the $3bn brand-name migraine therapy market, the $9bn schizophrenia sector, the $7bn Alzheimer category and the $7bn depression market. The other six important CNS categories are multiple sclerosis ($25bn), epilepsy ($8bn), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; $5bn), Parkinson's disease and sleep disorders ($4bn each), and Huntington's disease ($300m). </p> <p> Pfizer has &ndash; on its own or as a partner &ndash; six approved pain drugs and four pain programs in development, a smoking cessation drug and a separate R&amp;D program, one approved ADHD medication, an approved MS drug and one in development, five investigational Alzheimer's assets, two schizophrenia drug candidates, and one research program each in Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, stroke and Parkinson's disease, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database. </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00251/AGN_CNS_possibiliti_251317a.png"> <img src="-/media/FF10CE7B3A3B425C94BE194FD11E6BEE.ashx"></a> </p>
