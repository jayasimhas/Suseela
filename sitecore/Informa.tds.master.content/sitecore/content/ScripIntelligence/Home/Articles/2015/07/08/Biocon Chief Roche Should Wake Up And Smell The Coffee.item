<p>Partners Biocon and Mylan have garnered about 26% market share between them for their biosimilar versions of trastuzumab in India, despite innovator Roche's alleged efforts to "fob off" competition.</p><p>Biocon's chairperson and managing director, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, said that the market share gains come despite "all the litigation" that Roche is trying to pose against the firm and Mylan to "stop us in our tracks."</p><p>"I don't think that's working," Ms Mazumdar-Shaw, told <i>Scrip</i> in an exclusive interview.</p><p>Last year, Biocon and Mylan launched their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-launches-biosimilar-Herceptin-in-India-349752" target="_new">trastuzumab</a> brands on the Indian market under a co-development and commercialization alliance that covers a clutch of biosimilars including trastuzumab, etanercept, bevacizumab and adalimumab. </p><p>While Roche had allegedly attempted to "trash" another Indian firm's biosimilar product some years ago, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw claimed that the Swiss multinational couldn't do so in the case of Biocon-Mylan because "they know that it's a high quality product" and was hence trying "other tactics."</p><p>"Every innovator who has enjoyed a market monopoly for a long time, when they find the monopoly threatened, they are going to try all kinds of tactics to fob us off. But it's not going to work."</p><p>She also decried Roche's alleged tactics on the regulatory front, especially with respect to previous <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-makes-stealth-move-to-block-Biocon-Mylans-biosim-Herceptin-in-India-349926" target="_new">charges</a> that the protocol and design study for testing for biosimilar trastuzumab was filed with and approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) prior to the country's guidelines on similar biologics becoming effective. </p><p>Roche, she said, is "not a regulator" and was trying to act like one.</p><p>"That's a very wrong thing Roche is trying to do. I don't think they would ever dare to take on the US FDA on their regulatory pathway. They should learn to respect the countries in which they operate."</p><p>Biocon has also received Indian regulatory approval for additional indications &ndash; early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer &ndash; for its biosimilar trastuzumab version. </p><p>On certain changes recommended in the package insert for the product, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw indicated that "minor changes" had been required, which were provided and subsequently approved by the relevant Indian Subject Expert Committee (SEC).</p><p>On how Biocon views such developments coming as they were in backdrop of the ongoing case, the Biocon boss said: "These are all litigations which you have to take on and these are tactics. We are doing everything as per the law." </p><p>Roche in a hearing last year alleged that the package insert of the biosimilar version was a "slavish copy" of its package insert. </p><p>The hotly contested case is expected to be listed for further hearing on 13 August. A Delhi High Court decision last month seemingly pointed to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fresh-twists-and-turns-in-Indian-Herceptin-biosimilars-case-359680" target="_new">more twists in the case</a> with Biocon alleging that despite a previous order, Roche had "communicated" with the DCGI, "misleading" it and asked the regulator not to grant the approval of the carton, labels and package insert. Roche, on its part, had then claimed that it had "merely informed" the DCGI of an interim order passed against Biocon and had no intention to mislead the regulator.</p><p>Ms Mazumdar-Shaw suggested that Roche "better wake up and smell the coffee" and the multinational should understand that "biosimilars are here."</p><p>"There's no point trying to be in denial that biosimilars will not threaten their market share."</p><h2>Global Biosimilars Play</h2><p>Ms Mazumdar-Shaw also said that global biosimilars was becoming a "very attractive, credible and near term play" and that the Biocon-Mylan partnered programmes are "right up there" in the forefront.</p><p>The partners are on course to complete clinical trials for three of their programs &ndash; glargine, trastuzumab and pegfilgrastim. </p><p>"We believe that in the next 12 months we should be in a position to submit our dossiers in these programs for regulatory approval by the FDA and EMEA. It's a very exciting time for us. "</p><p>The Biocon boss said that Mylan-Biocon were in a very good position to be able to carve out a very "good piece" of that biosimilars opportunity and referred to their "very competitive cost base" and also how Mylan is an "aggressive commercial partner." </p><p>The partners are also closely tracking all global events in the space, including the recent US court decision ruling that the biosimilar "patent dance" is optional in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">case concerning Sandoz's Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz) &ndash; the first biosimilar ever approved in the US. </p><p>"Companies like Sandoz [and] Lilly are giving us a much better understanding of what our strategy should be. We may not be the first to enter the market but it is something worth following on because it provides you with greater clarity and greater strategic intent with which to get greater market share," she added. </p><p>A biosimilar version of Lantus from Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim was approved in Europe last year.</p><p>In the case of glargine the Biocon-Mylan alliance has "followed" the Lilly "sort-of clinical strategy" in terms of trial design, so that it becomes easier to discuss the programme with regulators. Biocon currently sells $70m worth of biosimilars, largely insulin and glargine, in rest of the world markets, ex-India.</p><p>Interestingly, Ms Mazumdar-Shaw also indicated that Mylan could possibly look at Pfizer Inc's biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co's Remicade (infliximab) which is currently under development and may be recommended for divestment by the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/EU-Demands-Pfizer-Offload-Infliximab-Biosimilar-In-Hospira-Buy-359785" target="_new">EU Commission</a> for clearing Pfizer acquisition of Hospira. Alternatively, the Commission foresaw Pfizer handing back Hospira's biosimilar product to Celltrion. </p><p>"I'm sure Mylan would look at that very positively&#8230; obviously you have to see to what level they have taken it. Anyone can takeover that trials and say give us the asset and all the data and we'll continue with the trial&#8230;so it does become interesting for companies," Ms Mazumdar-Shaw said.</p><p>She referred however to issues about tech transfer, which could make such a deal more complicated.</p><p>"Per se it's an interesting option for companies who are in the biosimilars play and it depends at what price Pfizer will sell the asset."</p><p>For a company like Biocon, though, she said it may be cheaper to develop the biosimilar rather than to buy it, alluding to Pfizer's potentially high price expectations should such an event actually occur. </p><p>She also maintained that it was probably a bit of a Catch-22 situation for Pfizer, given that it may not really want its own product in the market if it already has a biosimilar from Hospira/ Celltrion. On the other hand, a product sale will invite competition.</p><p>"It's a tough choice," the Biocon chief said.</p>
