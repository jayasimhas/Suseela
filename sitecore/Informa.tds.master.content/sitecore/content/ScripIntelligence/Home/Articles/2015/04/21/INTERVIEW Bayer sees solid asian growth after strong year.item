<p>Driven mainly by new launches and underlying economic growth, Bayer is bullish over the prospects for its Asia-Pacific pharma business, predicting continued mid-term expansion ahead of the overall market.</p><p>"In the APAC region excluding Japan and China we have had over 24 months of above market growth, and remain very optimistic in our longer-term ability to deliver this," declared Wei Jiang, regional head of  Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Asia/Pacific.</p><p>The Singapore-based executive told <i>Scrip's </i>sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> that Bayer's pharma sales in what the firm terms the greater Asia-Pacific region (which includes China and Japan) grew by 13% to &euro;3bn ($3.2bn) on a currency-adjusted basis last year, accounting for around a quarter of the German group's global pharma business.</p><p>The firm was among the three fastest growing and also the top 10 pharma multinationals in APAC, and "Emerging Asia, excluding Japan and Australia/New Zealand, was very strong last year," Jiang said in an interview.</p><p>Novel anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban) and Eylea (aflibercept) for ophthalmic disorders were the main growth products, reflecting a similar trajectory in Japan, where Bayer Yakuhin's sales were up by 12%.</p><p>The company does not break out individual product or country sales figures, but the executive identified three main factors behind the expansion: "New launches, expansion of labels and general market growth. For instance, Eylea holds the highest [category] share in many markets, and has been very strong in Australia and Singapore."</p><p>Underlying economic growth and rising health spending has been particularly important in some individual markets, where the fastest growing for Bayer's Asian pharma operations last year were Vietnam (+31%), the Philippines (+16%) and India (+12%).</p><p>The growth in India came despite the firm's ongoing tribulations over its local patent for anticancer drug Nexavar (sorafenib). An Indian court decision last year allowed local firm Natco Pharma to export a small quantity of the drug, rejecting the originator's plea in the patent-related case.</p><p>Jiang stressed that "We remain committed to India over the longer term and to delivering innovative medicines there," noting that Xarelto will be launched for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the country this year.</p><p>While not commenting on the specifics of the Nexavar case, he stressed "that there is a need for a reliable framework for intellectual property."</p><p>Looking ahead, Jiang pointed to IMS projections of compound annual growth of around 7% for the pharma markets across the region over the 2014-18 period, and to Bayer's regional pipeline.</p><h2>approvals, trials</h2><p>In Singapore, is Bayer expecting approvals in the next few months for a number of new indications, including Xarelto for pulmonary embolism, Eylea for diabetic macular edema and central retinal vein occlusion, the colorectal cancer drug Stivarga (regorafenib) for gastro-intestinal stromal tumors, and Nexavar in thyroid cancer.</p><p>Dr Chuan Kit Foo, head of medical affairs in Asia, said Bayer is continuing to invest heavily in clinical development in the region, where 66 clinical trials were underway last year (excluding Japan), versus just 21 in 2007.</p><p>"We plan to begin three new Phase III trials in oncology and three Phase III cardiology studies in eight APAC countries this year, with a total of five candidates in the two areas," he disclosed.</p><p>Phase III trials are planned for the PI3K inhibitor copanlisib for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the oral mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist finarenone for worsening chronic heart failure (wCHF) and diabetic kidney disease and vericiguat for wCHF, he noted.</p><p>Seven Phase I oncology studies are also underway in the region, the company noting that the incidence of cancer in Asia is forecast to rise to 10.6 million in 2030.</p><p>Singapore, the regional headquarters for the firm, is a major site, is running around 20 studies, and Bayer has invested around S$20m ($14.8m) in joint research with institutions in the city-state over the past seven years.</p><p>"This really reflects the impact of Asia on Bayer and the quality of the researchers and infrastructure in the region," Dr Foo said.</p><p>In fact, in common with many multinationals, Asian sites are now routinely involved in many of Bayer's global trials of late-stage molecules, including in its case for the pegylated recombinant Factor VIII for hemophilia A damoctocog alfa pegol, and the oral androgen receptor inhibitor for prostate cancer ODM-201.</p><p>In a statement on the results, Dr Foo said that "our ultimate goal is to see more Asian patients being included earlier in global drug development so that they can have earlier access to innovative medicines."</p><p>The company also runs "Asia Bayer Clinical Days" with oncologists and cardiology specialists in the region to introduce its pipeline and new findings in the sectors, and to receive feedback from practitioners.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/26/interview-bayer-sees-solid-asian-growth-after-strong-year?elsca1=pan&elsca2=newsltr" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p>
