<p> EUSA Pharma has officially re-launched following its acquisition of five approved specialty hospital products, a multi-national commercial infrastructure and the EUSA Pharma brand name from Jazz Pharmaceuticals for $34m. </p> <p> The acquisition of the original EUSA Pharma by Jazz for around $700m in 2012 was driven by its then lead product, the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapeutic Erwinaze (asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi), which had sales of around $200m last year. </p> <p> New EUSA will be run by its original founder and CEO Bryan Morton, with funding from Essex Woodlands. Dr Morton said the company has &quot;ambitious plans&quot; for growth through acquisition and in-licensing. </p> <p> Dr Morton stayed with Jazz for around eight months after it acquired EUSA, and then left and took up board seats with a number of companies. &quot;Then Essex Woodlands came to me and said, 'We've got a new fund &ndash; how about setting up another specialty pharma again?'&quot; he told Scrip. </p> <p> Toby Sykes, a partner at Essex Woodlands, said he was&quot; delighted to be supporting Bryan and his team for the second time. Essex was the founding investor in the original EUSA Pharma in 2006 and supported the company through a number of acquisitions.&quot; </p> <p> New EUSA has started with a portfolio of five approved and several named-patient specialty products, which had annual sales of around $27m in 2014. All the products were with the original EUSA business. &quot;We have kept the EUSA name for two reasons. One is that all the products are in that livery. The second is that the acquisition comes with people, and those people have been trading under the EUSA name. It just made things so much easier,&quot; explained Dr Morton. </p> <p> New EUSA is headquartered in Hemel Hempstead, UK, with operations in the US, Germany, France and the Netherlands. It has around 60 employees in total. Of these 40are from Jazz, of which about 25 were with the original company. </p> <p> Dr Morton says his immediate growth plans would ideally include a deal for a marketed product, followed by a deal for a late-stage product. &quot;Preferably both will be transatlantic, as we have the systems in place to make a success of products in both geographies,&quot; he explained. &quot;So I am envisaging one or two bigger deals rather than a series of smaller ones.&quot; </p> <p> EUSA had other cancer and cancer supportive care products in its pipeline, but Erwinaze for ALL patients who are hypersensitive to E. coli-derived asparaginase was the highlight for Dublin, Ireland-based Jazz. The plan was that Erwinaze would make Jazz less reliant on its lead product, the narcolepsy drug Xyrem. </p> <p> Jazz then hedged its bets the following year when it <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Jazz-expands-specialty-portfolio-with-1bn-Gentium-buy-348943">acquired its Italian partner Gentium</a> for $1bn, bringing in the orphan drug Defitelio (defibrotide) for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (sVOD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy and related conditions. </p> <p> New EUSA's portfolio contains: </p> <ul> <li>Caphosol is a supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse used as adjunct therapy, alongside standard care, in the treatment and prevention of oral mucositis. The product is approved in the US, Europe and a number of other territories, including Australia and Hong Kong. </li> <li>Collatamp is a lyophilized collagen surgical implant impregnated with the antibiotic gentamicin and is used in hemostasis in surgeries with high risk of infection. It is approved in Europe, South America, the Middle East and South-East Asia, and a number of other countries including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. EUSA has global rights to the product outside the US. </li> <li>Custodiol is a pre-prepared solution with a regulatory approval in France for use in the hypothermic storage and preservation of organs for transplantation (heart, kidney, liver and pancreas). </li> <li>Fomepizole is a pharmacological antidote approved in a number of European countries for the treatment of poisoning with ethylene glycol, a compound commonly used in antifreeze. </li> <li>Xenazine is approved for the treatment of movement disorders associated with Huntington's chorea and hemiballismus, and EUSA has commercial rights to the product in France. </li> </ul>
