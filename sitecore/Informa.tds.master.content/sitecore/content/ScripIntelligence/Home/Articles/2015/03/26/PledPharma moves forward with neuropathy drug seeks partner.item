<p>PledPharma is seeking a partner for its colorectal cancer therapy PledOx, on the back of mostly positive results for the drug in a Phase IIb study. </p><p>PledOx is being development as a treatment to reduce neuropathy &ndash; a side-effect associated with chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer. </p><p>PledPharma, which is discussing the design of a registrational study for PledOx with the US FDA, said data from the Phase IIb PLIANT study showed a clinically relevant relative reduction in the incidence of sensory nerve damage of 43% compared with placebo. However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. PledPharma noted that this was "not a requirement at this stage of development." In addition, the company said the anti-cancer effect of the chemotherapy was not negatively affected by the PledOx treatment.</p><p>Jacques Näsström, CEO, said PledPharma has reached an important milestone. "We now look forward to, based on the promising results of the study, intensifying discussions with potential partners," he said. </p><p>The company's stock (Stockholm Stock Exchange) rose from a close price of SEK33 on Friday 27 March, to as much as SEK52 after the top-line Phase IIb data were published on 30 March, but closed that day up by 20% at SEK39.70. The company was trading around SEK37 by midday, 31 March. </p><p>PLIANT is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled Phase IIb study with three parallel groups in which patients with advanced colorectal cancer received FOLFOX6 chemotherapy for up to eight treatment cycles and either PledOx at a dose of 2&mu;mol/kg, 5&mu;mol/kg or placebo. The study was conducted at about thirty centers in Europe and the US, and included a total of 173 patients.</p><p>Neuropathy in conjunction with chemotherapy can cause hypersensitivity to cold, disruption of fine motor skills and severe pain especially in the hands and feet. This is one of the most common serious side-effects in the treatment of colorectal cancer with Folfox combination chemotherapy, PledPharma noted. These side-effects often require reduction of the prescribed chemotherapy dose and in the most severe cases treatment must be discontinued.</p>
