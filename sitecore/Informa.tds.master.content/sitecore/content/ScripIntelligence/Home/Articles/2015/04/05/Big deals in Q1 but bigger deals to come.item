<p><p>The first quarter of 2015 outdid all of the previous year based on the value of deals closed by pharmaceutical and life sciences companies, according to a recently released report by consulting firm PwC. </p><p>The report noted that 35 deals were completed in the first quarter of this year resulting in $166.3bn in value for the sector, compared to the $150.1bn from the 161 transactions that were closed during 2014. While the quarter can boast record value, it's important to keep in mind that many of these deals were initially announced during 2014, but did not go through until the most recent quarter. Yet, PwC added that there have been another 49 deals announced during the first three months of 2015, with a value of $76bn. </p><p>"2014 had some very large transactions and a good amount of volume and overall value," said PwC's Dimitri Drone, partner and leader of the firm's life sciences deals practice. "Last year's levels were comparable to those seen in 2006 and 2008 &ndash; those were good years for deals. It was a very healthy year last year and many of those transactions closed in Q1 2015, but 2015 is going pretty quickly out of the gate as well."</p><p>Of those deals, 51% were conducted by pharmaceutical companies, with the largest being the merger of Actavis and Allergan for $68bn. Total deal value from pharma increased more than four-fold from both the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter, from $18.7 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively, to $97.4 billion in 2015. There were several high profile pharma deals that were announced during the first quarter, including AbbVie's $20.8bn bid for Pharmacyclics and Pfizer's $15.8bn bid for Hospira. </p><p>"What is becoming more and more the norm is divesting of assets," said Drone. "Years ago people would look at assets and sit on it, and then figure out what to do with it. Now people realize these assets can generate a fair amount of money; you can get a fair amount of money for assets that were otherwise not generating any value for you. Companies are now in a constant dealmaking mindset."</p><p>Meanwhile, biotech was not quite as active &ndash; increasing from four deals in the fourth quarter to six deals in the first quarter with a value of $6.4bn. This activity was largely driven by Shire's acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.1bn. Another 11 biotech deals were announced during last quarter, worth $7.6bn. </p><h2>A dealmaking mindset</h2><p>The consulting firm saw many of the same trends from 2014 carry over to the new year. Those included divestitures, generics, consolidation, globalization and asset swaps. The sector saw some major M&A in each of these areas from some high profile players. Novartis made headlines when it divested its animal health business to Eli Lilly & Co for $5.4bn and swapped its vaccines business for $5.25bn to GlaxoSmithKline for its British counterpart's oncology portfolio for $16bn &ndash; that bundle of deals closed in January and early March. PwC expects asset swaps and divestitures to continue throughout the year as the big pharmas continue to shuffle their businesses like puzzle pieces to create the ideal product mix in their core competencies.</p><p>The generics sector has seen plenty of consolidation throughout the last few years and investors can expect to see plenty more of this. Currently, there is a three-way hostile takeover war going on between Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Perrigo &ndash; expect to see one of those deals make a major impact on a later quarter this year or early next year. </p><p>Drone noted during an interview that the generics industry is ideal for consolidation because it's all about scale. He added that generics companies are branching out; during the first quarter Mylan's acquisition of Abbott's non-US specialty and branded generics business for $5.5bn closed. </p><p><p><p>
