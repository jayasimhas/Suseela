<p>The procedure for appointing a new executive director of the European Medicines Agency is well under way, and work on the pre-selection of candidates has begun, Hugo Hurts, the Dutch representative on the EMA's management board, told the board's last meeting in March. </p><p>According to the meeting minutes, which have just been published, the board was "interested to be updated on progress with the selection procedure for the executive director". The European Commission assured board members that the selection process was ongoing and "proceeding as fast as possible". </p><p>The agency's annual report, which has also just been made public, says the procedure is "expected to result in the appointment of the new executive director in the second half of 2015".</p><p>Under the pre-selection part of the appointments procedure, the European Commission sets up a special panel that invites selected candidates to interview. In this case, a total of 36 candidates have applied for the job. Those who are shortlisted by the panel will be called for a subsequent interview with the commission's Consultative Committee on Appointments. </p><p>The procedure was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Commission-advertises-post-of-EMA-executive-director-355767" target="_new">launched at the end of last year</a> after the EU civil service tribunal annulled, on procedural grounds, the decisions by the commission and the EMA that led to the appointment of Guido Rasi as executive director in 2011. Professor Rasi had to step down, although he was subsequently given a new position, principal adviser in charge of strategy. </p><p>In the annual report, the EMA says that while the ruling had no immediate effect on the EMA's day-to-day operations, "the sudden loss of its executive director had an impact on many of the agency&rsquo;s strategic initiatives. The lack of leadership to help shape the future in medicine regulation was felt by partners and stakeholders, both inside and outside the European Union." </p><h2>Appeals</h2><p>Both the EMA and the European Commission lodged appeals against the tribunal's ruling with the EU's General Court at the end of January, and these have now been published in the Official Journal of the EU.</p><p>The appeals were made on three grounds:</p><ul><li>That the Civil Service Tribunal infringed EU law by attributing to the principle of good administration a scope that it does not have; </li><li>Alternatively, that the tribunal infringed the principle of proportionality by failing to determine, before making the annulment, whether the failure to observe the principle of good administration could have affected the contents of the contested decision;</li><li>In a further alternative, that the tribunal, in any event, infringed EU law by failing to balance the respective interests and failing to limit the effects of its judgments.</li></ul><p>The EMA offered a further ground, that the tribunal infringed EU law "by holding that the unlawfulness of the commission&rsquo;s decision necessarily led to the decision adopted by the EMA being unlawful".</p>
