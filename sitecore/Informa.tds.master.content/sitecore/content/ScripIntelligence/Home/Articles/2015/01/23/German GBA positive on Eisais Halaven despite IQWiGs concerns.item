<p>Germany's G-BA, the institute in charge of the country's early benefit assessment process, has given Eisai's breast cancer drug Halaven (eribulin) a positive outcome, despite the drug's lukewarm reception by IQWiG in an earlier stage of the assessment.</p><p>The G-BA said that Halaven had considerable added benefit over specified comparator therapies, the second best outcome the institute offers. The drug is used to treat women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen. Halaven has been available in Germany since 2011, but underwent a second benefit assessment after new data became available, and after the drug won expanded approval from the European Medicines Association (EMA). </p><p>The first part of Halaven's reassessment was carried out by IQWiG, who found that the drug had little added value and a mixture of positive and negative effects including some serious side effects (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Germany-still-not-keen-on-Eisais-Halaven-after-reassessment-354847" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 4 November 2014). </p><p>Eisai said at the time that it would try to persuade the G-BA to arrive at a different conclusion. The company noted in particular that it was not happy with IQWiG's decision to break the assessment into subpopulations, stating that its data were not powered for that sort of analysis. "Eisai was and still is critical of some aspects of this approach and addressed them in its written statement to the G-BA as well as during the oral hearing with the G-BA," Eisai told <i>Scrip</i>. "During the oral hearing Eisai had the chance to discuss some of these aspects and to clarify questions of the G-BA that came up during the assessment process."</p><p>It is not the first time Eisai has managed to turn a poor outcome from IQWiG into a positive response from the G-BA. The same thing happened with Halaven's first early benefit assessment in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Germanys-G-BA-backs-Eisais-Halaven-but-reimbursement-impact-unclear-329707" target="_new">25 April 2012</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EMAs-trial-design-hinders-Eisais-Halaven-reimbursement-in-Germany-327043" target="_new">16 February 2012</a>).</p><p>Eisai said it was "delighted" with the G-BA's decision. The company will now begin renegotiating its price with Germany's statutory health insurers. </p><p>The news may be particularly welcome given that Eisai recently lost all access to the UK market. In 2012, England and Wales' NICE deemed Halaven not to be cost-effective (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-publishes-final-no-for-Eisais-Halaven-328868" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 3 April 2012). Nevertheless, the drug was still available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), until earlier this month when the CDF decided to withdraw its funding, also on cost-effectiveness grounds (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cancer-Drugs-Fund-table-12-drugs-delisted-six-refused-entry-356128" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 January 2015). Eisai was outraged by the decision (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Outrage-at-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-casualty-list-356034" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 9 January 2015).</p>
