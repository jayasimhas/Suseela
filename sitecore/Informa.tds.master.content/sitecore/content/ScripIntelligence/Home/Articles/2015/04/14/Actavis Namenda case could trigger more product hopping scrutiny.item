<p>Actavis tried to persuade a three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York on 13 April to lift an injunction imposed by a lower court preventing the company from pulling its twice-daily immediate-release version of its Alzheimer's dementia drug Namenda (memantine hydrochloride) from the US market in light of a more updated form of the medicine. </p><p>The case could have broad implications for drug makers that seek to market improved versions of their prescription medications, Washington lawyer Jeremy Cubert, a partner at VLP Law Group, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"I think branded companies should be looking at this case very carefully and try to gauge their actions accordingly," he said. "It could be a bellwether."</p><p>This past December, Judge Robert Sweet of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan ruled that Actavis had to keep making Namenda IR available to patients while an antitrust lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is being fought in the courts.</p><p>But Actavis reportedly said the injunction would result in the company losing about $200m this year if Judge Sweet's action is not overturned. </p><p>In the lawsuit, which was filed at the federal district court this past September, Mr Schneiderman accused the Ireland-based company of trying to impede competition of the $1.5bn annual profit-making Alzheimer's medicine in a scheme often referred to as "product hopping."</p><p>He insisted Actavis and its New-York based subsidiary Forest Laboratories are trying to force patients to switch to the more expensive, higher-dose extended-release version of Namenda by removing the older product, which loses patent protection in July, before generics begin to enter the US market later this year.</p><p>Mr Schneiderman has asserted Actavis' plan was to get the patients on the newer Namenda XR, knowing their doctors likely would opt to keep them on the extended-release formulation rather than switching them to the generic version of the older brand-name product once available &ndash; essentially allowing the firm to "insulate its profits from competition."</p><p>"A drug company manipulating vulnerable patients and forcing physicians to alter treatment plans unnecessarily simply to protect corporate profits is unethical and illegal," said Mr Schneiderman charged last fall. </p><p>He said product-hopping schemes are a growing trend in the US.</p><p>But, Mr Schneiderman declared, "by standing up to Actavis, we're sending a clear message to all pharmaceutical companies: prioritizing profits over patients' rights will not be tolerated."</p><p>He noted that pharmacists would not be permitted to switch the Namenda XR with a lower cost generic version of the IR product without a doctor's approval &ndash; resulting in patients likely paying for the higher-priced drug because of the difficulty involved in getting the prescription changed. </p><p>Actavis has argued it wants to remove Namenda IR because the once-daily extended-release product is a more superior drug over the older version.</p><p>Plus, said Mr Cubert, who is not involved in the case but has been observing it, it costs Actavis more to keep Namenda IR on the market while the firm continues to ramp up commercialization of its newer drug.</p><p>But the New York attorney general is insisting Actavis should be able to offer patients a choice between both products rather than forcing them to switch to Namenda XR. </p><p>But, he said, "Actavis knows that its profits will take a hit once the Namenda patent expires, and is seeking to blunt the financial impact." </p><p>Mr Schneiderman pointed out that Actavis CEO Brenton Saunders last year admitted during an earning call that generics would have a more difficult time if the company did a hard switch.</p><p>Going that route, the Actavis chief said, also would allow the company to "go into a slow decline versus a complete cliff" with Namenda IR. </p><p>But Mr Schneiderman said such tactics are nothing more than an attempt to game the system. </p><p>Much the way reverse payment settlements &ndash; often referred to as pay-for-delay deals, in which branded firms pay generic companies under agreements to keep their products off the market for a period of time &ndash; grabbed the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, Mr Cubert said he expected state governments to start questioning whether the pursuit by drug makers of newer versions of their medicines would end up costing healthcare programs and patients more.</p><p>Because of the recent focus on healthcare costs, he said companies may start seeing more pushback from other state attorneys general when the firms bring newer versions of their medicines to the marketplace.</p><p>"Other states are going to look at this case and it may influence whether they decide to pursue the same type of case," Mr Cubert said. </p><p>And if so, he said, it could have a big impact on biopharmaceutical manufacturers' product development timelines and ability to develop improved versions of their drugs.</p><p>The appeals court is expected to rule on the injunction in the coming weeks. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
