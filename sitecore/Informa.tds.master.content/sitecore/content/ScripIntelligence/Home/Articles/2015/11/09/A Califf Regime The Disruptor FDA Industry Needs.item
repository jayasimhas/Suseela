<p>If Robert Califf is confirmed as the next commissioner of the FDA &ndash; which most in the biopharmaceutical community are anticipating is all but assured &ndash; he'll be taking over an agency that's in the midst of some of the most complicated challenges it's ever faced, the resolutions of which have broad implications for drug and device makers.</p><p>Indeed, the FDA has just started down the path of approving biosimilars &ndash; a job that is bound to get more difficult as biologics get more complex, which could delay those products entry into the U.S. marketplace.</p><p>And while there's been much hoopla over the past year about the "promise of precision medicine" &ndash; spurred on by President Barack Obama's initiative <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">launched this past January</a> &ndash; regulators have already acknowledged that figuring out the regulatory path for those products is going to be anything but easy.</p><p>The FDA also is wrangling with how it will handle communications about unapproved, or off-label, uses of medical products &ndash; something that is being forced on the agency through recent court rulings.</p><p>The "erosion" of the FDA's authority to prohibit off-label promotion of prescription drugs as a result of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Want-To-Promote-Off-Label-Pick-Your-Battlefield-359838" target="_new">recent ruling</a> involving Amarin's fish-oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) &ndash; in which a New York district court judge declared that biopharmaceutical makers could share information about unapproved uses of approved medicines as long as it is "truthful and non-misleading" &ndash; is the "single greatest" challenge now facing the agency, said Michael Carome, director of health research at the consumer watchdog Public Citizen.</p><p>The Amarin decision, Carome told <i>Scrip</i>, likely will lead to a flood of similar lawsuits against the FDA, which may result in the regulatory process being undermined for ensuring prescription drugs are safe and effective for their approved uses.</p><p>The FDA also is dealing with an inability to attract and retain the best and the brightest scientists, noted Ellen Sigal, chair of the nonprofit advocacy group Friends of Cancer Research (FOCR).</p><p>"The salaries are terrible, hiring practices are convoluted and divestiture is complex," she told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Greg Daniel, managing director for evidence development and innovation at the Brookings Institution's Center for Health Policy and a fellow in economic studies at the Washington think tank, said another problem confronting the FDA is its need for consistent resources and funding to maintain and build on the advances the agency has made in developing new tools and refocusing on patients through new expedited development and review programs. </p><p>Then, of course, there's the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/User-fees-Cures-elections-FDA-bracing-for-the-crash-359689" target="_new">convergence</a> on Capitol Hill of the renewal of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> &ndash; an undertaking that has occurred every five years since the law was first put into place in 1992 &ndash; and the biomedical enterprise overhaul legislation, which could end up dropping more responsibilities in the FDA's lap without the funding to address them.</p><p>But Peter Pitts, president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a Washington think tank, and a former FDA associate commissioner during the George W. Bush administration, insisted Califf is the right leader and "precisely the right guy" to handle the knotty challenges ahead for the US regulatory agency &ndash; declaring the former Duke University professor's nomination was "the most important health care act the president has undertaken," even more so than getting the <i>Affordable Care Act </i>enacted. </p><p>President Obama's nomination of Califf, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Califf-Praised-As-Thoughtful-Choice-To-Lead-FDA-360469" target="_new">announced on Sept. 15</a>, "really is the biggest thing he's done to advance the public health," Pitts told <i>Scrip</i>. "I really believe that."</p><p>If confirmed as commissioner, Pitts said he thinks Califf, who he called an "action-oriented guy," will have an "immediate impact for many issues that need immediate attention" at the FDA &ndash; most specifically, precision medicine.</p><p>The fact that the past few times a new commissioner was being sought by Democratic and Republican presidents and Califf's name kept coming up as a potential contender demonstrates "he's highly qualified" and capable of doing the job, Pitts said, adding that it also shows that "occasionally, there is bipartisan sanity when it comes to health care issues."</p><p>What's most important, Pitts said, is that Califf is viewed as a well-respected scientist &ndash; both by regulators and industry alike.</p><p>Before <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Dukes-Califf-takes-deputy-job-at-FDA-next-chief-356386" target="_new">joining the FDA this past February</a> as deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco, Califf had worked closely with the agency on several matters, including serving on its Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee, "so his learning curve is not steep," Pitts said.</p><p>He said Califf also is well respected among regulators at agencies outside the U.S. &ndash; an asset that could aid the FDA and other regulatory bodies in harmonizing their review processes and rules, which could broadly benefit the drug and device industries.</p><p><b>Innovator</b></p><p>But one of the greatest qualities Califf possesses, Pitts said, is his ability to innovate.</p><p>"He can take a theory and make it a practical reality," Pitts said, adding that he anticipates Califf to lead the FDA to be "partners in innovation" with industry through "entrepreneurial regulation."</p><p>"What that means is that Rob Califf can put the FDA at the center of the health care innovation ecosystem," he declared. </p><p>"He's well known to be an innovator," Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, said about Califf. "He's been innovative in the design of clinical trials and has long been an advocate of finding ways to do clinical trials that are better, cheaper, faster. He's been somebody who has been outspoken about the fact that the approach we use for drug development is too costly and in some cases too long."</p><p>Nissen said the current FDA is suffering from "years of stagnation."</p><p>"The FDA has not moved forward on any important initiatives during this period of stagnation," he argued. "And it needs a new look. It needs somebody to really come in and really shake things up."</p><p>Califf, Nissen said, is "capable of doing that."</p><p>He acknowledged there's likely to be pushback from some critics of any changes Califf wants to impose at the FDA &ndash; noting there's always some naysayers when any disruptor comes along seeking to change the status quo.</p><p>But, Nissen said, "The industry and the agency are both ready for change."</p><p>Nissen acknowledged he's not always been on the same page as Califf in certain matters &ndash; noting there's been some "fireworks" between the two scientists at times &ndash; "usually because we both have strong opinions." </p><p>But, he said, "We really actually see the world pretty similarly."</p><p>"I much more often agree with him than disagree with him," Nissen said of his exchanges with Califf.</p><p><b>Industry Ties</b></p><p>But while Nissen and Pitts showered praise on Califf, Public Citizen's Carome asserted President Obama's candidate to run the FDA was "bad news for patients and public health" because of the former Duke University professor's "long history of extensive financial ties to multiple drug and medical device companies."</p><p>"Strikingly, no FDA commissioner has had such close financial relationships with industries regulated by the agency prior to being appointed," Carome said, declaring that the Senate should reject Califf's nomination.</p><p>"Califf's appointment as FDA commissioner would accelerate a decades-long trend in which agency leadership too often makes decisions that are aligned more with the interests of industry, rather than those of public health and patients," he charged.</p><p>But Pitts argued that "in my mind, the commissioner of the FDA should have an extremely up close and personal knowledge of industry to understand what's happening."</p><p>"I think anybody who knows Rob Califf knows he's not swayed by any financial interests," he said.</p><p>Nissen insisted Califf holds perspectives that are "independent" of industry influence and his integrity is solid.</p><p>FOCR's Sigal also defended Califf, noting that "Clinical trials are dependent on drug companies. We all know that. That's obvious."</p><p>But, she told <i>Scrip</i>, "I don't see any huge red flags."</p><p>Sigal said she was confident the White House had thoroughly vetted Califf and didn't foresee any holdups with his confirmation. </p><p>Pitts, Nissen and Sigal all advocated for keeping Califf in the commissioner's role long after President Obama leaves office &ndash; declaring the FDA chief's job should be a five- or six-year term.</p><p>"I've long been an advocate for this not to be a political appointment," Nissen said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
