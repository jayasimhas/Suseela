<p>England's latest Cancer Drugs Fund decisions, which follow a recent overhaul of the assessment process, have resulted in 12 previously funded drugs being withdrawn in 24 indications, and six drugs applying for the first time being refused entry to the fund in seven indications.</p><p>This means that out of the 31 drugs assessed in the December 2014 round of decisions, the Cancer Drugs Fund found that over half were not cost-effective. The cost effectiveness assessment, which has left industry outraged, was implemented in December for the first time after being announced in November (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharma-rages-at-crude-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-overhaul-355077" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 14 November 2014). Just two new drugs were granted entry to the fund, while 11 previously funded products retained their funding.</p><p>Those drugs which have been delisted will continue to be funded until March, and patients currently receiving treatment will continue to do so.</p><p>The first casualties were revealed late last week and sparked strong reaction from the companies involved (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Outrage-at-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-casualty-list-356034" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 9 January 2015). The delisted drugs prompted renewed calls for a fundamental overhaul of the UK's value assessment system from industry, physicians and charities (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Time-to-rip-off-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-Band-Aid-356096" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 12 January 2015). </p><p>Eric Low, OBE, chief executive of Myeloma UK, said, "Throwing money at fixing a complex issue does not solve the underlying reasons why these drugs are not available on the NHS in the first place." </p><p>Dr Jayson Dallas, general manager at Roche, said: "The CDF has been successful in enabling patients to receive newer cancer medicines not routinely available on the NHS. However, we are now seeing the first casualties of a failure to reform the wider system of access for established cancer medicines, such as Avastin (bevacizumab), which is being taken away from patients with some forms of cancer." Roche actually fared relatively well in the assessment process, with Perjeta (pertuzumab), Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) and Avastin retaining funding in most of their indications. However, Avastin was delisted in four indications.</p><p>In addition, companies have criticized the review process itself as slapdash. Eisai called it arbitrary, while Lilly commented: "The delisting of Alimta (pemetrexed) for continuation maintenance is based on, what Lilly believes is the incorrect application of an overly simplistic scoring tool and a flawed process."</p><p>Roche agreed, saying, "We do not agree with NHS England's assessment and feel that critical evidence was not taken into account." </p><p>This sentiment was also echoed by a number of charities. Nick Bason, head of policy & communications at Bowel Cancer UK, said: "Decisions about drugs already available via the Cancer Drugs Fund appear to have been made in haste without any proper consideration of the real-world benefits that these drugs have for patients themselves in terms of both extension and quality of life."</p><p>Meanwhile, many UK charities, including Breakthrough Breast Cancer, have also laid responsibility with pharma companies, who they say should be doing more to lower their prices. "What we've learned is that pharmaceutical companies can negotiate on price. However, it is disappointing that it has taken a drastic measure like the threat of drugs being removed from the Cancer Drugs Fund to make companies offer their products at prices that the NHS can afford," the charity said.</p><p>Most of the drugs on the list had already been assessed and rejected by NICE as too expensive. Those which hadn't were either being assessed by the Cancer Drugs Fund for off-label use, have a NICE assessment pending, or have not been scoped by the Department of Health for NICE assessment.</p><p><b>Key stats:</b></p><ul><li>31 drugs assessed in 55 indications.</li><li>18 out of 31 drugs assessed found not to be cost-effective in at least one indication.</li><li>12 drugs delisted in at least one indication.</li><li>11 previously funded drugs allowed to retain funding.</li><li>Six drugs refused entry to the fund in at least one indication.</li><li>Two new drugs allowed entry to the fund in three indications.</li></ul><p>The table below details the full list of Cancer Drugs Fund decisions for December, along with NICE's assessment of the drugs' cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) where available.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Manufacturer</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication(s) assessed</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>CDF decision</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>List price</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>NICE-assessed cost per QALY</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Abraxane (paclitaxel)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celgene</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>first line chemotherapy in metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Retained.
