<p><b>A UK departure from the EU could deprive pharmaceutical companies of the advantages offered by European harmonization in the area of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, say Jane Summerfield and Amy Merrick. </b></p><p>The pharmaceutical sector is one of the most highly regulated industry sectors in the world. The majority of the current UK legal framework governing medicines comes from EU legislation. For example, UK requirements relating to clinical trials, marketing authorizations, manufacturer and wholesale dealer licenses, parallel imports and pharmacovigilance are all set out at EU level. </p><p>If the UK were to leave the EU, this would, at least in the short term, create uncertainty as to how elements of the UK regulatory regime, such as the validity of marketing authorizations issued at EU level via the centralized procedure, would operate going forward. </p><p>The actual impact on the regulation of medicines would depend on the route that the UK decided to take post-exit. </p><p>The UK could follow the examples of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are not members of the EU but are members of the European Economic Area (EEA). One condition of EEA membership would be that the UK would be required to continue to follow the EU regulatory framework for medicines, leaving the UK in the same position as present. </p><p>Alternatively, the UK might take a similar approach to Switzerland, which has a very successful pharmaceutical industry and sits outside the EU and EEA but is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). However, Switzerland has bilateral treaties in place with the EU that mean its national medicines law largely follows EU regulation. A further option would be for the UK to remain within the EFTA but not the EEA, and negotiate a bespoke arrangement.</p><p>All of these scenarios would result in the UK continuing to following EU medicines legislation either entirely or to a substantial degree, but with significantly less influence over the content of that legislation, and therefore with less ability to directly protect the UK industry's interests than at present. </p><p>Alternatively, the UK could completely detach its regulatory regime from the EU. However, if the UK and EU regulatory requirements then began to diverge, this would likely lead to an increased regulatory compliance burden for companies that operate in both the UK and the remaining EU markets.</p><p>The impact would also depend to some extent on whether the particular area of regulation was governed at EU level by legislation in the form of a directive or a regulation. Regulations are directly effective in the UK without the need for national implementing legislation (although national legislation setting out which body has the power to enforce that legislation in the UK and to impose sanctions for non-compliance is still necessary). </p><p>Therefore leaving the EU would leave gaps in the UK regulatory regime that would need to be filled by new national legislation, which could be put in place but might take time. Directives are not directly effective in each member state and so national legislation must be passed in order for the requirements of a Directive to become part of national law. </p><p>So in these areas at least, existing UK legislation implementing current EU requirements would continue in force beyond any exit from the EU. For example, the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 cover areas such as applying for and issuing national marketing authorizations, manufacturing and distribution licensing, advertising of medicines etc. However, references back to EU law in such UK legislation could result in ncertainty as to how the UK legislation should be interpreted.</p><h2>Marketing Authorizations</h2><p>Centrally authorized medicinal products are medicines that either must be or can voluntarily be authorized at EU level. Examples include new treatments for AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder and diabetes. The application for authorization is assessed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is based in London, and the marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission based on the EMA's assessment. The authorization is then valid throughout the EU and EEA, without the national regulatory agencies issuing separate authorizations.</p><p>If the UK were to leave the EU, central authorizations would no longer be automatically valid in the UK, meaning that these medicines would not be legally authorized to be placed on the market (unless the UK remained part of the EEA or put an equivalent trade deal in place). </p><p>If the UK were to make a full exit from the EU and EEA, it is unclear how centrally authorized medicinal products would be dealt with. Given the importance of these medicines, it is likely that (at least in the short term) the government would pass legislation enabling the MHRA to issue a national authorization based on the existing EU authorization (essentially a variation on the current mutual recognition procedure for issuing a UK marketing authorization based on a national authorization in another EU member state). This might be passed on an expedited timetable in order to prevent issues such as a supply shortage or mass off-label prescribing. </p><p>A full exit from the EU and EEA would also likely mean that UK national marketing authorizations would no longer be recognized under the existing mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, unless the UK was able to negotiate agreements with the EU or individual member states to continue to participate in these procedures. Such agreement would likely be conditional on the UK marketing authorization regime not diverging from EU requirements.</p><h2>Clinical Trials</h2><p>Currently, clinical trials in the EU are governed by the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, which is implemented in the UK through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004. If the UK were to leave the EU, the regulation of clinical trials would therefore be unlikely to change, at least initially. </p><p>However, the new Clinical Trial Regulation (EU No 536/2014) entered into force last year and will take effect across the EU, including the UK, once the new EU clinical trials portal and database are fully functional (but not earlier than May 28, 2016). The Regulation will introduce a single EU portal for submitting clinical trial authorization applications and thereby streamline the process, particularly for trials conducted across multiple sites in the EU. </p><p>If the UK left both the EU and EEA, EU level clinical trial authorizations issued under the new Regulation would no longer be automatically valid in the UK. As the Regulation is directly applicable in the UK, new national clinical trials legislation would be required to fill the gap. Companies submitting applications for multicentre trials via the new EU portal would no longer be able to include UK sites in the application, meaning UK trials would lose the benefit of the new streamlined process, potentially discouraging companies from running clinical trials in the UK.</p><p>Again, the UK could seek to negotiate an agreement with the EU or individual member states for the mutual recognition of clinical trials conducted in either area, but there is no guarantee that this would be agreed.</p><h2>Competitiveness</h2><p>EU legislation regulating medicines is harmonized across all EU member states, with the aim of ensuring the safety, efficacy and quality of medicines while at the same time removing the potential barriers that can arise from different national regulatory regimes.</p><p>It is likely that the incentive of maintaining a successful and competitive UK life sciences industry would lead the UK to agree to remain part of the EU regulatory regime for medicines in some form in the event of an exit from the EU. This might be as an EEA or EFTA member, or through other trade agreements. </p><p>With ever increasing harmonization of the regulation of medicines in the EU and the competitive advantages this can bring, it is difficult to see the benefit to the UK industry of going it alone in this area. Any reduction in the UK regulatory requirements to make the UK a more attractive market and offset the burden of having to comply with a regulatory regime that differed from the EU might be counter-productive in an industry where safety is paramount and the EU is regarded as having some of the highest standards in the world. However, remaining tied in some form to the EU regulatory regime but with substantially less influence over the content of that legislation than at present could leave the UK industry in a less favourable position. </p><p>Ultimately, participating in an EU regulatory regime that is not perfect but which the UK plays a significant role in developing is likely to be key to maintaining the UK pharmaceutical industry's competitiveness in an increasingly global market.</p><p><i>Jane Summerfield is a Senior Associate, and Amy Merrick is an Associate, at law firm Hogan Lovells</i>.</p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of Scrip articles looking at the potential effects of a UK departure from the EU.
