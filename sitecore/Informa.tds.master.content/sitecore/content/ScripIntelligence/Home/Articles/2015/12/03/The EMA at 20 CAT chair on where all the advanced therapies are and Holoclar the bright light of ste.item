<p><b>Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) were never going to be easy products for regulators to deal with, which is why the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (CAT) was set up in 2009. So far, the applications have not exactly flooded in, but this is likely to change over the next few years, says Dr Paula Salmikangas, chair of the CAT. She talks to Francesca Bruce about the pitfalls of developing an ATMP and why Europe's first stem cell therapy, Holoclar, was a beacon of light for the sector.</b></p><p>The key function of the CAT is to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs submitted for marketing authorization and to formulate a draft opinion for final approval together with the CHMP. It also provides recommendations on whether a product falls within the definition of an ATMP and contributes to EMA's scientific advice.</p><p>Since the committee was created six years ago, just 13 ATMP marketing authorization applications have been received, not quite the numbers that it had hoped for. But as Dr Salmikangas explains, ATMP manufacturers face some unique challenges. For example, the first gene therapy trials had some very unfortunate results, including one death. "This impacted gene therapy for quite a long time. The community went for safer vectors and tried to improve the clinical use of gene therapy products."</p><p>Meanwhile, in the cell therapy field there is a long history of doctors treating patients with transplantation and transfusion therapies, but the problem may be that physicians do not necessarily realise that the manipulated cell products they are already using in the clinic today may actually be medicinal products, she says.</p><p>Dr Salmikangas was expecting more applications from manufacturers of products already available on national markets before the ATMP regulation came fully into effect, requiring all advanced therapies to go through the CAT. The survey reported by the European Commission showed that there were 31 products available on national markets that could have benefited from the regulation. It's not clear why more manufacturers did not come forward for centralized approval, but one possibility is that it was hard for small developers to put together the necessary structures to take their products through all the quality, non-clinical and clinical studies required for approval. </p><p>However, more advanced therapies are on the way, and as Dr Salmikangas points out, ATMPs are relatively new and other regulators in the US, Canada and Japan have not approved huge amounts of ATMPs either. Furthermore, just like the biologics market took time to develop and mature, so too will the ATMP market, she says. </p><p>Indeed, Dr Salmikangas expects a lot more applications over the next five to ten years, as more and more requests for scientific advice and classification are coming in. So far the committee has received 129 applications for classification as an ATMP. Two thirds of these are for cell based therapies and the remainder for gene therapies, says Dr Salmikangas. The committee sees more tissue engineered products than somatic cell therapies. The latter are being developed to treat various diseases, while tissue engineered products are being developed for repair or regeneration of tissue defects. Dr Salmikangas expects gene therapies to be mainly for inherited monogenic diseases and cancer.</p><p>Of the 13 product evaluations conducted by the CAT to date, there have been six positive opinions for five approved products and four withdrawals, while four evaluations are still ongoing. So what advice would Dr Salmikangas give a company wanting to get its advanced therapy on the market? "Pay close attention to the product itself, to the administration of the product, its functionality and distribution in the patient's body, and the design of clinical studies to ensure efficacy results are robust. Efficacy is really the key problem," she says.</p><p>Demonstration of efficacy is very challenging, especially if the product in question is targeted at an orphan disease and patient numbers are small, she acknowledges. In addition, a key problem for applicants with cell-based products has been product standardization, says Dr Salmikangas. Cells as starting material bear inherent variability. "Quality of the product is directly linked to its efficacy and if you have a poorly controlled product, you may dilute the efficacy signals in the clinical trials." </p><p>Nevertheless, she hopes companies have come to understand some of these problems, and if they haven't, the committee has guidance available to support developers. "The situation is better than it was ten years ago." And companies will also be pleased to learn that the CAT is working to make the path to market entry less bumpy by reviewing its experiences with marketing authorization and scientific advice. It is putting together a document detailing key points, such as problems that have scuppered marketing approval and the most common issues that have come up in scientific advice sessions.</p><h2>Changes afoot</h2><p>Dr Salmikangas also indicated that the CAT will be able to help companies by playing a bigger role in the scientific advice process. The CHMP and the scientific advice working party are largely responsible for giving such advice, but the CAT's part in the process is growing. Initially the committee commented on the advice when the reports were completed, but now it gets involved in the process at an earlier stage.</p><p>In addition, the committee is trying to tackle problematic issues that came up in the March 2014 report by the European Commission on ATMPs in Europe and the impact of the advanced therapies regulation. One issue raised in the report was the "cumbersome" evaluation process, which obliges a company to interact with up to five committees: the CAT, the CHMP, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, the Paediatric Committee and the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products. </p><p>The report recommended that the process could be streamlined and simplified. Dr Salmikangas is keen to see improvements and hopes to strengthen collaboration with other committees for the benefit of applicants. "It's tedious for companies to have to be involved with several committees, always having a different face when you are approaching different things &ndash; whether it's a paediatric investigation plan or you want to discuss orphan designation&#8230; some kind of streamlining would be beneficial."</p><p>Dr Salmikangas would also like to see some improvement in the way that incentives for ATMP developers work. The incentives, including fee reductions, are good, but the problem is that they are only targeted at SMEs, she says. They should also be made available for academia, hospitals and charities, which, according to Dr Salmikangas, are largely responsible for the early development of ATMPs, especially cell therapies. She would also like to see more EU funding go into clinical development of ATMPs. Unfortunately, not much is likely to change in the near future, if changes to the current legislation are not driven by the European Commission, she says. </p><h2>Rough with the smooth: Glybera and Holoclar</h2><p>One important success story for ATMPs and the CAT has been Chiesi/Holostem's Holoclar for severe limbal stem cell deficiency. It was the EU's first stem cell medicinal product to be evaluated, and received marketing authorization in February 2015. The product began as "a purely academic exercise" at the University of Modena in Italy and after promising results the company got on board, bringing with it the financial resources and regulatory knowhow required to get the product through late-stage development and the regulatory process. </p><p>For Dr Salmikangas, Holoclar was "a really assuring case" that helped ease the safety concerns that have dogged stem cell therapies. "I was particularly happy to see that the risks and fears often associated with stem cell therapies could be lifted by the data and shown to be controllable."</p><p>A more challenging product for the CAT was Chiesi/UniQure's Glybera, an orphan drug and the first gene therapy in the EU. The CAT, along with the CHMP, initially said no to the product in 2011. UniQure then requested a re-evaluation of the application and after careful consideration and review of all new analyses of the clinical data, the product got a positive opinion from both committees. "The product really tested the boundaries for marketing authorization," says Dr Salmikangas. "It was a clash between standard expectations for marketing authorization and the challenges of these very ultra-rare diseases and very novel products." </p><p><i>Dr Paula Salmikangas is chair of the EMA's Committee for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (CAT).</i></p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
