<p>Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, a company recently acquired by Allergan PLC which is repositioning itself as a specialty pharma focused on branded products, has filed its chin fat therapy in the EU. </p><p>Kythera has submitted a market authorization application to the European Medicines Agency for ATX-101 (deoxycholic acid; known as <i>Kybella</i> in the US) as treatment for submental fullness, also called double chin. </p><p>The MAA is supported by results from four pivotal Phase III trials conducted in Europe and North America. More than 1,500 patients participated in the trials with 757 patients treated with ATX-101. In the pivotal Phase III trials conducted in Europe, more ATX-101-treated patients (63.%) showed at least a 1-grade improvement on the clinician's submental fullness rating scale than placebo-treated patients (28.6%). Kythera said many patients experienced visible results in two to four treatments and once the aesthetic response is achieved, retreatment is not expected.</p><p>Before ATX-101, treatment options for submental fat were limited to aesthetic surgical procedures and targeted liposuction.</p><p>Keith Leonard, president and CEO of Kythera, said the submission in Europe "marks a key milestone for the global development program."</p><p>In addition to the regulatory filing for ATX-101 in the European Union, KYTHERA has submitted regulatory filings in Switzerland and Australia. </p><p>ATX-101 is administered by injections into the fat under the chin and causes the destruction of fat cells. The drug, already approved in the US and Canada, has been forecast to have US sales of around $400m by 2020.</p><p>Approval in Europe is expected following success in other regions. And back in March, the FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Adviosry Committee unanimously backed approval of Kythera's product in the US. </p><p>However, regulators at the time warned that ATX-101 can cause serious adverse effects, including nerve injury in the jaw, which can cause an uneven smile or facial muscle weakness and trouble swallowing.</p><p>Allergan, previously known as Actavis, developer of blockbuster wrinkle reducer Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), acquired Kythera in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-buys-chin-fat-firm-Kythera-for-2.1bn-358996" target="_new">June this year</a> to boost its facial aging portfolio.</p>
