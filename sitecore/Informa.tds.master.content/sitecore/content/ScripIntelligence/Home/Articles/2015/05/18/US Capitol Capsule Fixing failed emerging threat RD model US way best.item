<p>The lack of immediate vaccines and drugs to address the Ebola crisis in West Africa starkly illuminated not only the fact the world was unprepared for yet another emerging disease threat, but the failed biopharmaceutical research and development model, which relies on profit prospects rather than health needs, the authors of a paper published earlier this month in <i>The Lancet</i> charged.</p><p>The current medical R&D system is "de facto ill-suited to address the world's health priorities, unless these coincide with major market opportunities," said Dr Piero Olliaro, of the University of Oxford in the UK, and his two co-authors, Drs Peter Horby, also of Oxford, and Els Torreele, of the Open Society Foundations in New York.</p><p>They insisted it was too simplistic to call the Ebola situation a "market failure" &ndash; like what Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general at World Health Organization, had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-A-market-failure-353355" target="_new">deemed last summer as the reason</a> for there being no approved vaccines and therapeutics against the virus, which has infected nearly 27,000 people and killed over 11,000 in the current outbreak in West Africa.</p><p>In their <i>Lancet</i> article, which was part of a series published ahead of this month's 2015 World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, Dr Olliaro and his colleagues called for a major shift in the current biopharma R&D system &ndash; declaring the world needs to move away from the practice of regarding essential health products as profitable commodities, with their development left to the private sector to decide, to a system in which medicines are deemed public goods, with the public defining the priorities for healthcare.</p><p>While Stanley Erck, president and CEO of Rockville, Maryland-based Novavax, agreed that there needs to be changes in the way the current R&D enterprise addresses emerging threats, he defended the industry's Ebola response &ndash; pointing out that his firm jumped in to pursue a vaccine on its own dime, without any backup from government or other groups.</p><p>Novavax has carried its glycoprotein recombinant nanoparticle Ebola vaccine candidate through to a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novavax-starts-human-testing-of-Ebola-vaccine-356735" target="_new">Phase I human safety trial</a>.</p><p>And while the company is well behind GlaxoSmithKline and its partner the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NewLink Genetics and its collaborator Merck and Johnson and Johnson and its partner Bavarian Nordic in developing an Ebola vaccine, Mr Erck insisted Novavax&rsquo;s platform has the capability to more quickly be scaled up to produce "millions of doses in a month instead of hundreds of thousands of doses in a year."</p><p>"And we can store our vaccine at refrigerated temperature as opposed to frozen," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>But, Mr Erck said, while his firm took the first steps on its Ebola vaccine because of its "moral obligation," he can't put the company's key R&D pipeline, led by its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, at risk to continue that pursuit without some sort of a guarantee the product will have a buyer in the end.</p><p>"Unless there's some commercial prospect for our vaccine, there's no incentive for us to divert efforts from other important projects," Mr Erck declared.</p><p>He noted that so far, only GAVI, the independent, public-private vaccine alliance partnership, which is supported with multilateral funding, has said it would procure the Ebola vaccines &ndash; declaring in December 2014 it would commit up to $300m to secure doses for the affected countries.</p><p>But Mr Erck said he doubted that would be enough to prompt industry to actually finish the manufacturing and other work necessary for the Ebola vaccines.</p><p>The US government is required to buy Ebola vaccines and therapeutics once they are mature enough for stockpiling under Project BioShield because the virus has been declared a threat by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under its material threat assessment processes, said Dr Robin Robinson, director Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). </p><p>But that threat determination was as a potential bioterrorism agent that could be weaponized, he said.</p><p>If an epidemic of Ebola were to erupt in the US, a new appropriation would need to be granted by Congress to purchase drugs and vaccines for that use, Dr Robinson told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>There's already been medical countermeasures (MCMs) procured to address 12 of the 13 threats identified by DHS for stockpiling by the US government under Project BioShield, he said, noting that hemorrhagic fever viruses, like Ebola, is the one for which products have not yet been secured.</p><p>The products procured under Project BioShield &ndash; created by Congress in 2004 to accelerate R&D of medical countermeasures, with lawmakers setting up a special reserve fund &ndash; or through separate pandemic influenza funding authorizations either reside in the US Strategic National Stockpile or at the manufacturers' facilities under a process known as vendor-managed inventory, which is necessary for some types of vaccines, like for the H7N9 avian influenza, because those products are in a bulk form, and therefore, must be formulated and undergo stability testing to ensure the potency, Dr Robinson explained.</p><p>He noted that BARDA &ndash; an agency created by Congress in 2006 for the purpose of accelerating the development of MCMs against biological threats, such Ebola and pandemic flu &ndash; is backing 12 other products in development, with expectations they will be ready for the government to buy for stockpiling in the next few years.</p><p>Since 2006, BARDA has funded and managed the advanced development of more than 160 MCMs for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats and pandemic influenza, with 21 of those products approved by the FDA.</p><p>But while Novavax's Mr Erck praised BARDA and its processes, he said there's also a gap in getting products to the point where the agency will pick them up for funding.</p><p>"BARDA is there to take us through the valley of death, but we have to get to that valley first," he said. "It's not seamless from the start of a platform until you get to BARDA funding. We would have spent tens of millions of dollars by then."</p><p>"This process that could be seamless isn't," he argued.</p><p>Mr Erck also insisted the procurement systems currently in place by the US government and the global community are flawed.</p><p>No company should be expected to make their products for free with no guarantee there will be someone to purchase them in the end, Mr Erck said. </p><p>"You don't get innovation. You don't get products that way," he said.</p><p>Mr Erck said there must be "pull" funding mechanisms in place with the carrot of procurement waiting to keep industry interested.</p><p>Otherwise, he said, "there won't be products available when these outbreaks occur." </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-backed-IMEDS-pilot-tests-big-data-safety-queries-358456" target="_new">Pfizer-backed 'IMEDS' pilot tests big data safety queries</a></p><p>A pilot program being run by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA (RUF) and backed with funding from Pfizer is getting close to being able to let biopharmaceutical makers query "big data" to evaluate whether there is a safety problem with their products &ndash;
