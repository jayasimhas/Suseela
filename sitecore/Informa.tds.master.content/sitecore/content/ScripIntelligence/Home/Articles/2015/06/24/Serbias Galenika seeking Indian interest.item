<p>It looks like plans to potentially privatize the state-owned Serbian firm, Galenika Pharmaceuticals, are beginning to gather some pace with efforts apparently underway to elicit Indian interest. </p><p>Galenika, which was reported to be a target of Valeant Pharmaceuticals some years ago, is looking for a foreign investor that can pump in "fresh capital, know-how and development possibilities", details in a recent bulletin of the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association (IDMA) said.</p><p>The bulletin cites an e-mail from Rajesh Parihar, Under Secretary, ministry of external affairs, Government of India, which refers to the Indian Ambassador in Serbia drawing attention to an announcement by the Serbian finance minister seeking a strategic partner for Galenika.</p><p>"We are informed by the Under Secretary that they are eager to collaborate with Indian companies," the bulletin for 15-21 June said.</p><p>Galenika could not immediately be reached for a comment and it is unclear if an official process aimed at privatizing the firm is already underway. </p><p>The Serbian firm has a portfolio of more than 250 products &ndash; medicines, dietary supplements, medical devices, dental and common use products &ndash; and exports are primarily made to about 20 markets in Europe, Africa and Asia. The firm's distribution and licensing activities are focused on regaining market share in Russia and entering the markets of North Africa, Gulf Cooperation Council and central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan), details in a presentation on the website of the Privatization Agency Republic of Serbia, suggested.</p><p>Some investment bankers contacted by <i>Scrip</i>, however, appeared less optimistic about the prospects of a frontline Indian firm vying for Galenika, though an industry veteran said that nothing is out of bounds especially if the Serbian firm has a reasonable product registration basket and potential access to untapped markets. He also referred to how Indian firms have in the past been adept at turning around distressed assets. </p><p>In 2013, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, agency reports said, pulled out of a potential bid for Galenika, citing, among other issues, union opposition, while an Arab firm has also been reported to be interested in the Serbian company. There have also been recent reports of billionaire investor George Soros apparently abandoning plans to participate in the privatization of Galenika.</p><p>The Serbian government has in the past too attempted to privatize Galenika. In 2010, such plans were <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Galenika-opens-new-plant-in-Serbia-299843%5d" target="_new">abandoned</a> apparently after no bidder could meet its requirements. </p><h2>FTA </h2><p>The IDMA bulletin refers to how Serbia in addition to providing a local market of about 7.2 million people also enjoys "preferred trade status" in view of certain free trade agreements with the EU, Russia, Turkey and Belarus, among others.</p><p>"By investing in a Serbian manufacturing facility, Indian pharmaceutical companies would gain preferential access to these markets. Serbia is the only country outside the CIS that enjoys preferential trade access to Russia," the bulletin noted.</p><p>Serbia is also an EU candidate country and the investment climate is improving, it added.</p><p>Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a three-year &euro;1.2bn new stand-by arrangement (SBA) for Serbia. The IMF statement then referred to the how wide-ranging reform of state-owned enterprises, especially large ones, would be critical for reducing state aid and limiting the drag on the budget. </p><p>"The business climate needs to be improved to attract new investment, foster job creation, and support growth over the medium term," an IMF statement dated 23 February said.</p>
