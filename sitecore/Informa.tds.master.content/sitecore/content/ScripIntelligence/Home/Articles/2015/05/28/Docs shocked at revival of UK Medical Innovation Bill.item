<p>A controversial private member's bill intended to encourage innovation in medical treatment by offering doctors protection against possible medical negligence litigation is to be discussed again in the House of Lords, even though it had been assumed that the bill was dead in the water after being blocked in the last parliamentary session.</p><p>Lord Saatchi, who first launched the Medical Innovation Bill in 2014 following the death of his wife from cancer in 2011, says that the law as it stands discourages doctors from trying out unapproved innovative treatments because of the fear of being sued for negligence by patients who might suffer injury from the treatment. His supporters say the measures in the bill would help people who have exhausted other treatment options while offering doctors more legal protection.</p><p>But critics counter that the law already gives doctors sufficient guarantees against litigation, and claim that the bill will muddy the legal waters, undermine clinical trials, and put patients at risk from untested "quack" remedies. Campaigner Ben Goldacre was characteristically forthright, tweeting: "Oh good grief, Saatchi is reviving his undead 'medical innovation' quackery bill. This will kill patients." </p><p>The pharmaceutical industry, which on the face of it could stand to derive some benefit from the use of unapproved drugs or indications, is unimpressed by the bill, saying it could have "unintended consequences" and that it is not the best way to encourage innovation, particularly with the government's Innovative Medicines and Medical Technology Review just getting under way. </p><h2>Risen from the ashes</h2><p>The "Saatchi bill" passed the House of Lords last year and went to the House of Commons for its first reading on 26 January, but further progress was blocked when the Liberal Democrats, then part of the government coalition, refused to support the bill. Lord Saatchi was quoted in the Daily Telegraph as saying: "They have killed the Medical Innovation Bill. It is dead. By killing the bill they have killed the hopes of thousands of cancer patients."</p><p>But, in the immortal words of Monty Python, it's not dead. Following the May general election in which the Conservatives gained a parliamentary majority, the bill has been resurrected and placed on the Lords' schedule of business for discussion on 8 June. </p><p>News that the bill is still alive and kicking will dismay many in the medical community. It had been heavily criticised by a range of high-profile bodies including the British Medical Association, the Academy of Royal Colleges, the General Medical Council, Cancer Research UK, and the Medical Defence Union. </p><p>In March this year a coalition of medical research charities, non-commercial organizations and patient groups, including the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, said the legislation was "unnecessary". Far from protecting doctors from litigation, they said, "it could actually increase the risk of litigation faced by doctors by introducing greater complexity into the legal framework". There could be "unintended consequences" for patients who might be at risk when receiving "treatments for which the evidence base is not fully established, including treatments which could prove ineffective or harmful". While some amendments had been made, they said "we feel that the bill still risks introducing a degree of ambiguity to the law governing clinical negligence, potentially placing doctors at risk of further litigation".</p><p>On hearing of the bill's revival in the Lords, Ian Ritchie, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said he hoped Lord Saatchi had listened to "the overwhelming majority of medical opinion" and amended the bill to ensure that patient safeguards are maintained. Otherwise, Mr Ritchie continued, "concerns remain that the provisions outlined will mean that patients are open to experimentation without any guaranteed benefits. We also call on Lord Saatchi to outline how this bill will complement, and not undermine, NHS England&rsquo;s Five Year Forward View and the government&rsquo;s accelerated access review." </p><h2>Industry concern </h2><p>The biopharmaceutical industry remains unimpressed too. The BioIndustry Association (BIA) said that evidence gathered during the consultation on the bill last year "did not, we think, reveal that a fear of being sued for negligence is braking innovative treatment by doctors", and pointed out that doctors can already do this under GMC guidance. </p><p>Pamela Learmonth, the BIA's director of public affairs and communication, told <i>Scrip</i> that while an amendment made to the bill in the last parliament, ensuring that outcomes of innovative treatment were logged and shared, had improved the original bill, "the BIA still retains concerns regarding the impact of this proposed legislation". </p><p>At best, the bill could proceed and not change much in the way of clinical practice if the hypothesis that doctors are not really deterred by fear of negligence is correct, Ms Learmonth continued. At worst, she said, the bill could undermine the medical research and clinical trial regimes as practitioners seek solely to use existing drugs for unlicensed conditions, "which could have knock-on effects on investment, research and clinical trial efficacy". </p><p>"As such we question the need for this legislation, though a wider look at medical innovation, perhaps as a result of the current accelerated access review [the Innovative Medicines and Medical Technology Review], might be welcome and a more appropriate legislative exercise". </p><p>The review, details of which were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/A-step-in-the-right-direction-UK-reviews-innovation-access-357240" target="_new">announced in March</a>, is being conducted by Sir Hugh Taylor, chair of Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; NHS Foundation Trust, and Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University. It will be looking at ways of speeding up patient access to medical innovation by acting on regulation, reimbursement and uptake. </p><p>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) declined to comment further on the bill at this stage, saying its position remained as stated in November 2014: that this was "a very complex and deservedly emotional issue and the patient must be at the heart of our shared approach". It said the research-based industry was "committed to meeting unmet patient needs and operates within a very tight regulatory framework that serves to protect and further the interests of the patient".</p><p>In a brief also published last November, the association said that the primary intention of the bill was to remove the threat of litigation if clinicians departed from the accepted standard of care, "although most commentators disagree that this is an issue or that this bill will resolve it". It said it was "debatable" how much effect the bill would have, and that "most medical stakeholders are highly sceptical that it will have an impact on clinical practice". The association noted that it had met the Department of Health Bill team earlier in 2014 to "brief them on the importance of the licensing system and the risk of unintended consequences".</p>
