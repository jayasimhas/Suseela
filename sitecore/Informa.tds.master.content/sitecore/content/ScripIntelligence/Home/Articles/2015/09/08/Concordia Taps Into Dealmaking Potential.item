<p><p>Niche Canadian company Concordia Healthcare is looking to play with the big biotechs and has added to its firepower with the acquisition of privately-held European company Amdipharm Mercury Limited. </p><p>Concordia, which currently has a market capitalization of $2.8bn, is hoping to be an M&A powerhouse like its much larger Canadian peer Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Valeant was once a small, niche dermatology company and has grown into a multi-national conglomerate with a market cap over $76bn with the majority of its growth through acquisition. </p><p>Check out Valeant's acquisition history <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet/77/30/Valeant-Backs-Strategy-With-Solid-Deal-Record" target="_new">here</a>. </p><p>Concordia is adding Amdipharm, referred to as AMCo, with the intention of adding an international presence, as well as adding to its ability to make acquisitions. Yet, the pricey deal will likely take some time to deleverage and will add to the company's debt &ndash; anticipate the company to issue shares after the deal has been completed. This is likely why the stock is off after the announcement of the deal; shares on the NASDAQ traded down about 8%. </p><p>Concordia is buying AMCo from European private equity firm Cinven for $3.5bn. The Canadian company will pay $1.2bn in cash, about $700m in Concordia stock and will assume $1.4bn in AMCo debt. Upon the closing of the deal in the fourth quarter, Concordia will own AMCo completely, but Cinven will then own a 19.9% stake in Concordia. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, RBC Capital Markets and Jefferies have agreed to provide $4.3bn in financing and bridge loans to cover the acquisition. </p><p>AMCo will give Concordia a presence in over 100 countries and will add 190 niche pharmaceutical products to its portfolio that includes more than 1,000 product SKUs. One major selling point of the acquisition is that none of AMCo's products account for more than 8% of sales. </p><p>Concordia is expected to have $870m to $920m in revenues for 2015, with $530m to $560m in revenues coming from AMCo. Currently, about 66% of AMCo's revenues come from the UK, while 20% come from Europe and the rest from elsewhere in the world. </p><p>Concordia said during a presentation to investors on Sept. 8 that the acquisition gives the company an increased ability to compete for global assets. </p><p>Analysts agree; "This acquisition should give Concordia a global platform to better position the company for future divestiture of product by big pharma companies. Hence Concordia could be a one-stop shop in the divestment process for big pharma companies, potentially giving Concordia an edge over competitors," wrote GMP analyst Martin Landry in a Sept. 8 note. </p><p>Prior to this deal, Concordia's most recent purchase was the $1.2bn acquisition of all the assets of Swiss generics company Covis pharma in March 2015, which gave it a portfolio of 18 marketed generics across three business lines--branded, injectables and authorized.</p><p><p>
