<p>Israeli stem cell company Macrocure's lead wound-healing product CureXcell has stumbled in a US Phase III study in venous leg ulcers (VLU) &ndash; with a futility analysis revealing that it is not expected to meet its primary endpoint. Shares in the firm dropped by 72% to &pound;3.33 in early trading on Nasdaq on Aug. 20, from a previous day's close of $12.05. </p><p>The cell-based product, which is already on the Israeli market for wound healing, consists of human activated white blood cells which are supposed to help the healing process to stimulate wound closure.</p><p>The 265-patient placebo-controlled trial's primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with better time to 100% closure at 12 weeks and sustained complete closure for four additional weeks. Secondary endpoints included complete closure of target ulcer within the treatment phase, and percentage change from baseline in target ulcer surface area at the end of treatment, and ulcer recurrence at 12 weeks' follow-up. </p><p>The setback does not seem to have dented Macrocure's confidence in its product too much. President and Chief Executive Officer Nissim Mashiach said: "While we are disappointed with the results of the VLU futility analysis, given the positive clinical outcomes seen in our experience with more than 5,000 patients in Israel, we continue to believe that the technology has clinical merit for patients with chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds."</p><p>Macrocure plans to evaluate the data derived so far to determine its next steps, which include the "potential initiation of a third Phase III study in patients with chronic wounds below the knee". It remains on track to report top-line results from its second Phase III trial, in diabetic foot ulcers, in October.</p><p>Before the setback, analysts at Jefferies had expected the full data set from both indications in the first half of 2016 with FDA filing later that year with approval in 2017. They had expected revenues of $250m within three years of launch in the US and EU. </p><p>A venous skin ulcer is a shallow wound caused by venous insufficiency &ndash; blood pools in the veins and fluid leaks into the surrounding tissue breaking it down. These ulcers usually form on the sides of the lower leg, above the ankle and below the calf; they are slow to heal and often recur.</p><p>
