<p>India's Alembic Pharmaceuticals has put in place its core leadership team in the US, which includes two ex-Sandoz officials, as it moves towards setting up its own front-end there.</p><p>Alembic, which has recently been in the limelight following the day one launch of its generic version of Otsuka's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder drug Abilify (aripiprazole) in the US via a partner, said that plans for its own front-end were "well on track."</p><p>Alembic's top brass told <i>Scrip</i> that Craig Salmon, who has had stints with Fera Pharmaceuticals, Sandoz and Eon Labs, among others, had been appointed as president (US operations), while Armando Kellum will take charge as vice president (sales) in the US.</p><p>Mr Kellum was with Sandoz in "contracting, pricing and business analytics" prior to moving over to Alembic.</p><p>Alembic has also roped in Cecilia Carfora as chief financial officer of the US operations; Ms Carfora has had stints with Fera Pharmaceuticals and Arthur Young and Company, among others.</p><p>At a post results investor call on July 31, Alembic's joint managing director, Pranav Amin, said while the US leadership team was in place, more personnel would be added. </p><p>"We had said we will start commercial sales by next year &#8230; we should be on track for that," Mr Amin said. </p><p>Alembic currently uses a partnered model to commercialize its products in the US. It expects to use its own front end for products that haven't been tied up with partners and in the case of the existing range, when the partner agreements for these expire.</p><p><b>Abilify</b></p><p>Mr Amin also said that the first quarter numbers do not reflect any of the profit share of aripiprazole and this would "show up" only in the second quarter in line with the firm's policy with partnered products.</p><p>"We are happy that we could successfully supply and our partner launched the product on day one itself," Mr Amin said. </p><p>Some analysts had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alembic-rides-generic-Abilify-wave-amid-compliance-wins-358118" target="_new">earlier said</a> that they expect generic Abilify to be a $60-70m product for Alembic in 2015-16, with higher margins initially and a decline thereafter, though still lucrative, as competition heats up. </p><p>Alembic's international generics business grew by 47% to INR1.68bn for the first quarter ended June, with the firm receiving eight ANDA approvals during the period. Alembic expects to launch 7-9 products each year for the next three years in the US, it said in an investor presentation.</p><p>Mr Amin also referred to plans to scale up oral dosage filings and enter new areas like injectables and dermatology. On the firm's plans for a 505(b)(2) filing for warfarin, Alembic said that it had given data to its partner, who is "liaising" with the FDA regarding the product.</p><p>Alembic reported net sales of INR5.90bn (+19%) and net profits of INR700m (+8%) for the quarter ended June 2015. </p><p>The Indian branded formulations business increased by 18% to INR2.63bn, even as the company continued its conscious <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alembic-rejigs-domestic-thrust-and-readies-for-global-generics-expansion-326850" target="_new">shift towards specialty therapies</a> from the acute segment. The specialty segment grew by 22%, while the acute segment grew by 12%. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
