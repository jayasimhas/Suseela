<p>Cipla's chairman and anti-monopoly champion, Yusuf Hamied, has re-emphasized concerns around any potential dilution of India's patent regulations, given its possible ripple effects across the developing world.</p><p>"What happens in India with regard to its patent laws, the use of TRIPS [Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] flexibilities and developments in the drug industry and access to medicines in India, has tremendous implications for all developing countries and the world as India is a major producer and supplier of affordable drugs worldwide," Hamied told shareholders at the firm's 79th annual general meeting (AGM) in Mumbai on Aug. 27.</p><p>India is said to be close to finalizing its National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indias-National-IPR-policy-whats-cooking-359573" target="_new">policy</a> and Hamied's views reinforce concerns of some other top industry experts that concessions around "patent linkage" and "data exclusivity" may find their way into the final framework. </p><p>The outspoken, "national minded" chief of Cipla noted how India is a potential leader among developing nations and "what we do today is eagerly watched worldwide."</p><p>He referred to how the world relies on medicines from India and cautioned that the government must not, "under any circumstances", dilute the country's patent-related laws, but instead work towards a situation where there is no monopoly in healthcare.</p><p>Hamied has long advocated a pragmatic system of in-licensing with an automatic license of right for all essential life-saving monopoly and patented drugs and reimbursement to the inventor with a "suitable" royalty.</p><p>Most industry experts, though, don't reckon that India could steer towards an complete automatic license of right approach and Cipla itself, they point out, has over the recent past unveiled a new plank in its access strategy &ndash;allying with innovator firms such as Gilead (for sofosbuvir) and Merck & Co (for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Unlikely-allies-MSD-Cipla-link-to-co-market-Isentress-in-India-350165" target="_new">raltegravir</a>). Cipla has, however, emphasized that while the company has constantly "struggled and fought" for access, pro-access does not mean anti-patent. </p><p>Cipla's managing director and global CEO Subhanu Saxena, at the time of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">deal with Gilead</a>, told <i>Scrip</i> that where avenues are available for companies to collaborate ''we should do so'' and where such collaborations break down then governments should retain measures such as compulsory licensing to ensure access to life saving medicines. ''But it behoves the industry to first speak to each other in the common interest of patients,'' he then underscored. </p><h2>Respiratory Business</h2><p>At a press interaction following the AGM, Saxena told <i>Scrip</i> that Cipla expected half of its respiratory growth to come from markets where it already operates today, with Europe probably contributing just around 15% of potential growth.</p><p>Even in India, where the firm has a penetration of around 30% of patients on its therapies, "that number should be 60-70%," he said.</p><p>"We see immense growth opportunities in markets where we are already present including the front ends we have established over the last 15-18 months. We continue to invest in our pipeline," Saxena said. </p><p>He also referred to the plans for imminent roll-out in a number of markets for Cipla's novel breath-actuated inhaler (BAI) with a dose counter (to be marketed as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Watch-The-Indian-Respiratory-Space-Cipla-GSK-At-Work-359945" target="_new">Synchrobreathe</a>). </p><p>At the time of its first-quarter results Cipla forecast a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Generic-Nexium-Lifts-Cipla-In-Q1-Amid-Respiratory-Build-Up-359964" target="_new">tripling of its respiratory business</a> over the next five years from around $350m in 2014-15, with about 50% of the growth coming from India, South Africa and emerging markets. Of the remaining 50% growth, about two thirds is likely to be from North America, with Europe accounting for the remaining one third. </p><p>Saxena also maintained that more than 70% of Cipla's growth would be via the organic route and that the firm was not compelled to do any mega deals. "When we look at investments, we ask ourselves: Are we the better owner of an asset and can we add value? And if it meets our stringent criteria, only then we will consider investment," he added. Cipla has, over the recent past, been speculated to be in the fray for UCB's Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals.</p>
