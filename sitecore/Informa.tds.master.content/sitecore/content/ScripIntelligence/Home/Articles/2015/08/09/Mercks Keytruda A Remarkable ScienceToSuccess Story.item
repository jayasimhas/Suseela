<p>With the probability of a drug making it from discovery to FDA approval extremely low &ndash; with some estimates putting the success rate at only one in every 5,000 &ndash; the story of how Merck's checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) came to the marketplace is nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Indeed, said Eric Rubin, vice president of early oncology clinical research at Merck, Keytruda went from its first in-human study to being approved by the FDA in less than four years &ndash; an outcome unheard of in drug research and development. </p><p>"I'm quite happy to be involved with a drug like this," said Rubin, who along with his Keytruda R&D team members at Merck &ndash; Scot Ebbinghaus, Gregory Michael Lubiniecki, Kevin Gergich, Kenneth Emancipator and Gargi Maheshwari &ndash; were recognized on Sept. 9 among this year's recipients of the Research & Hope Awards, bestowed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to honor researchers and patient advocates for their roles in advancing innovative biopharmaceutical research and improving patient care. </p><p>The 2015 R&H awardees were recognized for their work in the fight against cancer &ndash; diseases that claim the lives of more than seven million people worldwide every year.</p><p><b>An Extraordinary R&D Journey</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">Keytruda</a>, a human monoclonal antibody, was in fact the first-ever checkpoint inhibitor to win US approval &ndash; beating out competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab) by a few months.</p><p>Keytruda was approved in September 2014 as a treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression in patients previously treated with BMS' Yervoy (ipilimumab), and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor &ndash; with that win coming nearly two months early.</p><p>The drug initially was developed by Dutch biopharmaceutical firm Organon, which was acquired in March 2007 by Schering-Plough &ndash; a company bought by Merck in November 2009.</p><p>Keytruda works by targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway, a checkpoint normally involved in preventing tissue damage during chronic inflammation, according to Merck. </p><p>By blocking PD-1, Keytruda enables activation of the immune system's T-cells that target cancer by essentially releasing a brake on the immune system.</p><p>Merck's medicine "came from very basic science studies trying to understand the immune system," Rubin explained.</p><p>"Over the past few years, the discoveries by Merck and externally led to the knowledge that cancer cells have a variety of mechanisms to evade immune detection," he said. "As we understood these mechanisms, one of them was identified as PD-1."</p><p>Keytruda's promise as an effective treatment was recognized early on, Rubin told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"It was clear even in the first patients from the first study the drug was very active," he said, noting that investigators were eager to tell Merck about the extraordinary tumor remissions after only a few doses of Keytruda.</p><p>So Rubin said he and his colleagues sped up their work and "did everything we could to accelerate development and get the drug to patients as quickly as possible."</p><p>Merck made an unusual move and expanded its first Phase I human study and enrolled thousands of more patients with various tumor types &ndash; making it a registration study, which Rubin said was the key to getting Keytruda approved in the melanoma indication under four years, "which is extremely fast."</p><p>"We are all very proud to have accomplished that," Rubin said, adding that such an outcome was why he got into the drug industry.</p><p>"It's a dream come true for me," Rubin declared. </p><p>As a medical oncologist, he said it's been "quite heartwarming" to hear from investigators about the patients who would have otherwise died had they not been in Merck's trials of Keytruda, "and they are going strong years later."</p><p>Rubin noted that Keytruda currently is under review as a treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer &ndash; with the FDA expected to act by Oct. 2.</p><p>Merck also has submitted <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Keytruda-Wins-Expanded-Melanoma-Priority-Review-Also-A-Delay-360014" target="_new">other applications</a> to expand the drug's use to broader populations with melanoma, with decisions anticipated in December, he said.</p><p><b>Other R&H Awardees</b></p><p>Others who also were honored with PhRMA 2015 R&H Awards on Sept. 9 were J. Silvio Gutkind, chief of the Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, who received the R&H Award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research; Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation, who was the winner of the R&H Community Champion Award; Vicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate, who was given the R&H Award for Excellence in Advocacy & Activism; and Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand, who were the recipients of the R&H Visibility & Progress Award. </p><p>At the Sept. 9 ceremony in Washington, Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is serving as PhRMA's new chairman, said there currently are 836 medicines and vaccines in development around the world to treat or prevent cancer &ndash; "some of which represent entirely new approaches."</p><p>The "wily" complexity of cancer &ndash; which actually is a collection of hundreds of diseases &ndash; makes it challenging to treat, Frazier said. </p><p>"But scientists thrive on challenges," he declared. "They know that innovation does not move in a straight line, so they are not discouraged by false-starts, set-backs and failures &ndash; they eagerly learn from them, and build upon what others have done before them, as they seek better treatments and the cures of tomorrow."</p><p>The crowd at the R&H Awards also heard from former <i>NBC News</i> anchor Tom Brokaw, who described his own journey in battling multiple myeloma, which he was diagnosed with in 2013 and is now in remission.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
