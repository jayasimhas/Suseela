<p>With their first collaboration producing the potential blockbuster Praluent and other near-market medicines, Sanofi and Regeneron are likely hoping they can repeat the trick with a new $2bn-deal covering immune-oncology.</p><p>The agreement is the largest closed by the French multinational since Olivier Brandicourt became CEO in April this year.</p><p>The deal fixes one of the yawning gaps in Sanofi's R&D pipeline, with virtually all other big pharma companies surging ahead with immuno-oncology research programs. It also comes a day after Sanofi's subsidiary Genzyme <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-divests-troublesome-thyroid-cancer-drug-359640" target="_new">acquired</a> the medullary thyroid carcinoma therapy Caprelsa (vandetanib) from AstraZeneca for up to $300m. </p><p>The new Regeneron collaboration, if all goes well, might also return Sanofi to a leadership position in cancer that it last held with the taxane anticancer Taxotere (docetaxel). </p><p>A programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that is in Phase I will lead-off their collaborative efforts, and clinical trials will start in 2016 with new therapeutic candidates, Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement. "With more than eight years of successful collaboration between us, I am confident in our ability to advance these novel programs," said Sanofi's R&D chief Elias Zerhouni.</p><p>Other big pharma companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are already marketing immune-oncology products, but "the field is still in its very early days," claimed George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's chief scientific officer. </p><p>The current research collaboration between Sanofi and Regeneron has been highly productive - it is responsible for the development of the lipid lowering agent Praluent (alirocumab) that was approved for marketing in the U.S. just days ago. The product has also been given the green light by Europe's CHMP for marketing in Europe.</p><p>Other products developed by the two companies and in late stage development include: the potential rheumatoid arthritis therapy sarilumab, a fully human IL-6 receptor blocking antibody that is in Phase III studies; and dupilumab, an antibody that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signalling and has shown promise in a pivotal Phase IIb study in patients with asthma uncontrolled by inhaled steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. </p><p><b>$640 million upfront</b></p><p>Under the new deal, Regeneron will receive an upfront payment of $640m from Sanofi, and the two companies will commit $1bn ($250m from Regeneron, $750m from Sanofi) to move immune-oncology antibody monotherapies and novel combinations to proof of concept, usually a Phase IIa study. </p><p>The companies will also provide $350m each to develop the PD-1 inhibitor, REGN2810, and Sanofi will pay Regeneron a one-time milestone of $375 million if sales of a PD-1 product or other antibody developed in the collaboration exceeds $2 billion over 12 months. </p><p>Finally, the two companies will re-allocate $75m over three years for immune-oncology antibodies from Sanofi's $160m annual contribution to their existing antibody collaboration.</p><p>In the new arrangement, Sanofi is opting into development of an immune-oncologic monoclonal or bispecific antibody at a later stage than in its first collaboration with Regeneron, at the proof-of-concept stage rather than at the IND filing stage, thereby shouldering less development risk. </p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron will alternate serving as the lead development and commercialization organization, with the two companies sharing equally the worldwide profits.</p><p><b>comparable to other I-O deals</b></p><p>The size of the deal is similar to that paid by Pfizer back in November 2014 to gain traction in the immune-oncology field: the U.S. company paid Germany's Merck KGaA an upfront of $850m and likely milestone payments of up to $2bn to collaborate on the development of the Phase I/II anti-PD-L1 antibody MSB0010718C .</p><p>Earlier this year, AstraZeneca entered into a deal with Celgene to collaborate on the development of AstraZeneca's anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor MED14736, with the British company receiving an upfront of $450m.</p><p>Dr Brandicourt has already stamped his mark on Sanofi's commercial activities by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brandicourt-reorganizes-Sanofi-359442" target="_new">re-organizing</a> into five global business units, and he is expected to outline the company's strategic business priorities later this year. </p><p>Sanofi expects to launch six new medicines this year and one new medicine every six months between 2016 and 2018.</p>
