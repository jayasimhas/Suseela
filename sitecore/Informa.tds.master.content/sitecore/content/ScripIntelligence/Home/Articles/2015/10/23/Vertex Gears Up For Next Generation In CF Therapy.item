<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s newest cystic fibrosis drug <i>Orkambi</i> (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) has exceeded Wall Street projections for prescriptions and patient starts, the company reported during its third quarter earnings call Oct. 28.</p><p>Orkambi, which combines the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene potentiator <i>Kalydeco</i> (ivacaftor) with the CFTR corrector lumicaftor, obtained FDA approval on July 2 and posted sales of $131m in its first three months on the market. But analysts were more impressed by the drug's early market penetration, as Orkambi therapy already has been started in more than 3,000 patients, roughly 35% of the 8,500 US patients with CF who are eligible for treatment under the drug's label: patients 12 and older with two copies of the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene.</p><p>"Since the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orkambi-OKd-Vertex-prices-new-CF-drug-at-259k-359235" target="_new">FDA approval of Orkambi</a> &#8230; we have been focused on educating health care providers on the medicine and working with payers to secure reimbursement for the approximately 8,500 eligible patients in the US," Vertex Chief Commercial Officer Stuart Arbuckle said during the call. "More than 3,000 patients have started treatment in the US, underscoring the important advance this medicine represents in the treatment of CF and the strong interest from both patients and their doctors. Our field teams around the country have visited all of the 275 CF centers in the US since approval, and virtually every center has initiated patients in Orkambi."</p><p>"As we anticipated, interest in the medicine is very high, which has put a significant administrative burden on centers as they work to initiate patients on treatment," he continued. "As expected, we are seeing broad coverage of and access to Orkambi, which reflects payer understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the disease and the significant value of a medicine that treats the underlying cause of CF. The majority of commercial and government payers with eligible patients are reimbursing for Orkambi. In those plans with published policies and/or defined prior authorization criteria, almost all are reimbursing to label."</p><p>UBS Investment Research analyst Matthew Roden praised the launch in an Oct. 28 note, saying the early sales and market penetration indicate both underlying demand and the company's ability to execute. </p><p>"We're encouraged by the momentum Orkambi has achieved in the first quarter of sales and are more confident that there remains runway into 2016 for the majority of eligible patients to begin treatment," he wrote.</p><p>Roden noted that about 20% of the initial prescriptions are from government channels; Vertex expects government insurance ultimately to comprise about 30% to 35% of the payer mix for Orkambi. Roden and BTIG Equity Research analyst Hartaj Singh, who may be even more bullish on Vertex and the Orkambi launch, both said the first quarter sales total was well ahead of their projections, $94m in the case of UBS and $90m in the case of BTIG.</p><p><b>Solid EU Launch Anticipated</b></p><p>Singh predicts that Vertex will achieve better than 70% penetration of the F508del homozygous patient base in the US before the end of 2016, compared to a 46% consensus estimate. Vertex anticipates an EU approval of Orkambi before the end of 2015, with a German launch in early 2016. Singh expects a majority of eligible European patients to be on Orkambi therapy by the end of 2017.</p><p>This is the second straight rocket-blast launch of a CF drug for Vertex, although Orkambi's uptake hasn't been as impressive as that for Kalydeco, which was introduced in February 2012 as the first drug to treat the underlying genetic mutations behind CF. Kalydeco achieved 60% penetration of patients eligible under its original label (roughly 600 patients) by the end of its first quarter on the market. </p><p>Singh said the two successful launches imply that Orkambi could achieve better than 90% market penetration domestically by the end of 2018.</p><p>Far less optimistic about Orkambi's prospects is H.C. Wainwright & Co. analyst Andrew Fein, who argued in a July 30 note that while a strong launch seemed a certainty, an erosion of sales could be likely. He has criticized the drug in the past because of questionable efficacy, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fretting-over-Vertex-CF-drug-Orkambi-Nah-358274" target="_new">called into question</a> during FDA's review of the drug. Fein said it is important to keep an eye on patient and physician opinions after reaching disease maintenance, and on how payers handle patients that do not show clinical improvement. </p><p>Kalydeco also posted a strong quarter, bringing in $166m worldwide, up 31% year-over-year from $127m. Vertex attributes this growth to both label and geographic expansion.</p><p>"We have seen strong uptake in patients with the R117H mutation, following approval in the US in late 2014, and in children ages two to five with eligible mutations, following US approval at the end of March 2015," Arbuckle said. "Internationally, there has also been rapid uptake of Kalydeco by eligible patients in Australia, and in patients with non-G551D gating mutations in several European countries where these mutations are prevalent. We've made significant progress in securing reimbursement in Europe this year. As a result, the vast majority of eligible gating patients in Europe now have access to Kalydeco."</p><p>Between Kalydeco label expansions and the approval of Orkambi, Vertex CF therapies have seen an increase in worldwide patient base from 2,600 people a year ago to roughly 25,000 today, CEO Jeff Leiden said.</p><p>Vertex currently has a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) under review at FDA to expand use of Kalydeco to patients two and older with one of 23 residual functions that result in CF. The company also is conducting two Phase III studies to make Orkambi available to F508del homozygous patients ages six to 11, with an FDA filing slated for the first half of 2015. Approval for the six to 11 population in the US and Europe would add about 5,500 patients to the Orkambi label.</p><p><b>Moving Ahead With New CFTR Correctors</b></p><p>Meanwhile, the company is also advancing two next-generation CFTR correctors, VX-152 and VX-440, into the clinic, with initial dosing of '440 in healthy volunteers expected this week, Leiden said. The plan is to test those for safety as solo agents and advance them into Phase II testing in the second half of next year in combination therapy with Kalydeco and VX-661, another CFTR corrector that Vertex has advanced to Phase III.</p><p>"Our goal in CF is to reach the vast majority of people with this serious disease and to continue to enhance the benefit for the patients who we treat," the exec explained.</p><p>"We believe [VX-152 and VX-440] hold tremendous promise as part of a triple combination regimen for the 80% to 90% of CF patients with at least one F5808del allele, thereby possibly allowing us to treat patients we are not yet treating and also to enhance the benefit for those we already treat," Leiden later added. "The strength of the Orkambi launch to date and the continued expansion in the number of people eligible for Kalydeco are further evidence that we continue to execute against our key goal to become a company that can reinvest to create future medicines and deliver returns to shareholders."</p><p>At the start of the week, Vertex announced <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gene-Editing-Deal-Broadens-Vertexs-CF-Base-Doubles-CRISPRs-Cash-361238" target="_new">a collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics</a> to use that company's gene-editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology platform to discover therapies that treat the underlying causes of genetic diseases, including CF and sickle cell disease. It is paying the biotech $75m in upfront cash and making a $30m equity investment under the Oct. 26 deal, while funding R&D costs of the collaborative work.</p><p>"Gene editing represents a new and powerful technology platform that could represent a future paradigm shift in the treatment of CF, as well as other genetic diseases," Leiden said on the investor call. "And we're excited to be working with CRISPR, the company at the forefront of using gene editing to create new treatments."</p><p><p><p>This story has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
