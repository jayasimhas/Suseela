<p><b><i>Scrip</i> caught up with Dr. Bahija Jallal,</b> AstraZeneca<b>'s executive vice president and head of subsidiary MedImmune, at BIO Europe 2015, in Munich, Germany, to discuss challenges ahead for pharma and biotech firms, how business models are evolving to focus on culture not just size and why collaboration is the gateway to innovation.</b></p><p><b>1. What is your opinion on in-house innovation versus acquisitions for new technologies?</b></p><p><b>Bahiji Jallal:</b> We manage not to have this 'not invented here' syndrome at MedImmune and this is really important. At the heart of what we do is definitely science, and science is always about looking to the outside, it's about peer reviewing, sharing and everything else. So for me it's about collaboration; innovative development is about looking outside of our four walls. This is extremely important not just for the company but for the scientists to be able to continue being the best at what they do.</p><p><p><b>2. Are biotech companies under as much pressure to constantly invest and seek new technologies/programs?</b></p><p><b>Bahiji Jallal:</b> It depends on the company. The essence behind that is you have to know your strength and you have to focus on what you do best, but at the same time you have to leave space for science that is going to be important 10 years from now. If you have the luxury to be able to invest in both current programs and science for the future, then you have the best of best worlds. You can focus on what you can do now and reinvent the future too.</p><p><p><b>3: What are the biggest challenges 2016 might present for MedImmune and how it will combat these disruptions?</b></p><p><b>Bahiji Jallal</b>: I like to look at all challenges as opportunities. Being in drug development is not for the faint of heart. You have to be resilient and entrepreneurial and the most important thing is to learn from any setbacks. This is drug development &ndash; you are always going to have ups and downs but the most important thing is how you come up again from the down times. I don't see next year as being any different in these terms.</p><p><p><b>4. Looking at the wider industry, what new developments might disrupt the way biotech and pharma firms do business?</b></p><p><b>Bahiji Jallal:</b> The industry is in an interesting spot right now. I see more innovation coming and more collaboration &ndash; which needs to be applauded. Last year there were a record number of new drugs approved by the US FDA and a lot of these were the product of strong collaborations. At the same time we have several challenges we need to embrace and deal with. One is how we can even faster embrace technology, it is moving at such a speed. For example e-health, we need to look at how this is developing and how we can change the way we currently do things. I'm a very impatient person and R&D still takes too long for me. I hope new technological developments will help speed up areas of research and drug development.</p><p><p>We also need to look at telling our story differently. Right now it is all about cost and not developments. Really the industry needs to start showing that we are part of the solution not part of the problem. Along with this, we know that healthcare systems all over the world are under a lot of pressure and so we need to be sitting at the table helping to figure those issues out. We are just one part of that equation though, not the whole thing.</p><p><p><b>5. You are on a panel at BIO-Europe discussing how big pharma is operating more like biotech firms do. Can you say a bit about this for people not in attendance? What do you mean?</b></p><p><b>Bahiji Jallal:</b> When we think about the business we are in at the heart of it is science and science thrives when you have what I call a specific formula: it starts with people, you have to have excellent scientists; there is no compromise there. But then it is also the environment you create for these scientists and the research to flourish. I don't think this side, the working environment, was paid attention to in the old business model where it was more about how to increase, how to be bigger. But the business culture has to be right for the scientists to be able to collaborate, to be open to the outside and for their creativity to evolve. It's not about size, if you focus on why we are here it's about science and it's about patients, so you have to create an environment to fit that. Whether you are big or small it has to be an environment conducive to creativity.</p><p>This story was first published on <i>Scrip</i>'s BIO-Europe Blog: <a href="http://www.bioeuropecoverage.tumblr.com" target="_new">www.bioeuropecoverage.tumblr.com</a></p>
