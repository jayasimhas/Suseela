<p>When President Barack Obama during his 20 January State of the Union called on lawmakers from both sides of the aisle to stop hesitating and give him trade promotion authority (TPA) &ndash; declaring it would be "the right thing to do" &ndash; he was greeted by cheers, most of which came from Republicans, some of whom jumped to their feet.</p><p>But the president's words were not as warmly embraced by some members of his own party.</p><p>Indeed, Mr Obama has continued to face pushback from several Democrats on Capitol Hill not only on TPA, but also two pending trade deals &ndash; the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TTP) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-Cameron-declare-trade-Ebola-among-priorities-356204" target="_new">19 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Break-logjam-on-Asia-Pacific-trade-pact-354960" target="_new">11 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-US-seeks-to-get-TPP-Asia-pivot-back-on-track-354941" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Trade-officials-TTIP-aims-to-lift-smallmid-sized-firm-barriers-350660" target="_new">17 March 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Biopharma-weighs-in-on-US-EU-trade-pact-343084" target="_new">13 May 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/USEU-trade-investment-big-deal-pact-could-serve-biopharma-well-339997" target="_new">14 February 2013</a>).</p><p>TPA, often referred to as fast track, would give the president the authority to negotiate international trade agreements, which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Bumpy-road-expected-for-fast-track-trade-bill-349279" target="_new">13 January 2014</a>).</p><p>Some of the opposition is coming from the top Democrat in the Senate, Senator Harry Reid (Nevada), who last week flat-out said he does not support giving the president fast-track authority &ndash; declaring he's "always been suspect over my entire career in Congress of these trade agreements."</p><p>"Until it's shown to me that the trade agreements help the middle class, I'm not going to be jumping on the bandwagon," Mr Reid told reporters. </p><p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest acknowledged "It's no secret that there are Democrats in Congress who are, on principle, skeptical of trade agreements."</p><p>But he insisted the support and opposition for the TPA and the pending trade deals were bipartisan.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr Earnest said the president has vowed not to sign any trade deal that was not in the best interests of Americans and US businesses and farmers. </p><p>But, Mr Earnest told reporters last week, "from the president's point of view, there is no choice but to engage" with other nations in trade, and if the US fails to, there would be "significant geopolitical consequences,&rdquo; particularly if it does not sign on to the TPP. </p><p>"If the United States doesn't robustly engage other countries in Asia, it will allow China to step into that vacuum and start writing the rules of engagement," Mr Earnest argued. "That clearly would not be in the interest of the US economy and clearly not in the interests of American workers." </p><p>He said the White House remains committed to having conversations with any members of Congress who have questions about the ongoing negotiations for the TPP and the TTIP. </p><p>The TPP, US Trade Representative Michael Froman told US mayors last week, is expected to grow US exports by more than $123bn every year and "support hundreds of thousands of additional well-paying jobs." </p><p>"We can knock down barriers to American exports and create more good paying jobs, or we can allow other countries to capture the growth from global markets," Ambassador Froman said during a speech before the US Conference of Mayors in Washington.</p><p>Giving the president TPA would make clear to US trading partners the administration and Congress "are on the same page in negotiating high standards in our trade agreements,&rdquo; he said</p><p>Ambassador Froman noted that the term "fast track" is somewhat misleading because there's nothing fast about trade agreements &ndash; most of which take many years to negotiate, "during which time there is an enormous amount of consultation with the public, stakeholders and members of Congress."</p><p>Earlier this month, Senator Orrin Hatch (Republican-Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he has been working with the Democratic ranking member Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon) to "quickly" introduce a "bipartisan" TPA bill &ndash; something he said is his top priority. </p><p>"Absent the passage of TPA legislation, there is no other way for Congress to effectively assert itself and its priorities into ongoing trade negotiations," Senator Hatch said during a 16 January speech at the US Chamber of Commerce. </p><p>Representative Paul Ryan (Republican-Wisconsin), chairman of the House Ways & Means Committee, said he also is pushing to get a TPA bill quickly moved through his chamber.</p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
