<p>Aurobindo Pharma and the Plethico group have reached a settlement over alleged inconsistencies by the latter in their deal concerning the US nutritional supplements provider Natrol.</p><p>On 9 April, Aurobindo informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that based on discussions, a settlement pact had been reached and the Plethico group would now assign $23.3m in cash in "milestone payments, certain global intellectual property rights and other assets".</p><p>Last year Aurobindo's US arm emerged as the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Aurobindo-sets-base-for-US-OTC-flurry-via-Natrol-deal-355009%5d" target="_new">top bidder</a> for the Chatsworth, California-headquartered Natrol, a subsidiary of India's Plethico Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of neutraceuticals, herbal and allopathic products. Natrol and certain subsidiaries had in June last year filed under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. </p><p>But on 6 April this year, Natrol approached the Delaware Bankruptcy Court over "certain discrepancies and non-performance of obligations" by Plethico. Subsequently, discussions were held between the two groups and a resolution reached. </p><p>Some analysts, however, told <i>Scrip</i> that they were now concerned that the asset [Natrol] is "not clean". "The asset's perceived value no longer remains the same. We are not sure that if these are the only loopholes," an analyst said.</p><p>A news agency report citing court documents said that Aurobindo had alleged a $25m bogus contract with a fictitious construction firm involving "phony email and bank accounts, forged documents and people masquerading as contractors allowed to fool lenders before the bankruptcy proceeding and fool the court after the chapter 11 case began."</p><p>The extent of unresolved residual issues, if any, is, however, not immediately clear.</p>
