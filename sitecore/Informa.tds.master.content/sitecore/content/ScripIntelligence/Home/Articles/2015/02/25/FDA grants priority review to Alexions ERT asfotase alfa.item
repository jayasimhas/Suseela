<p>The FDA has granted a priority review to Alexion's enzyme replacement therapy asfotase alfa as a treatment for patients with infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia (HPP), a chronic and progressive ultra-rare genetic metabolic disease characterized by defective bone mineralization, which can lead to destruction and deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, respiratory failure and premature death.</p><p>HPP is caused by mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme known as tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase.</p><p>Asfotase alfa is designed to address the underlying cause of HPP by aiming to restore the genetically defective metabolic process, thereby preventing or reversing the severe and potentially life-threatening complications of life-long dysregulated mineral metabolism, Alexion said.</p><p>If approved, asfotase alfa would be the first treatment for patients with HPP, noted Dr Leonard Bell, chairman and CEO of Alexion. </p><p>The BLA is supported by data from 71 treated patients with HPP enrolled in three prospective studies and their extensions, as well as two retrospective natural history studies.</p><p>In May 2013, the FDA designated asfotase alfa a breakthrough therapy &ndash; a status aimed at expediting the regulatory process of medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Unsurprising-FDA-breakthrough-designation-for-Alexions-hypophosphatasia-drug-343564" target="_new">29 May 2013</a>).</p><p>Shares of Alexion closed at $184.62 on 2 March, up $4.25, or 2.36%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
