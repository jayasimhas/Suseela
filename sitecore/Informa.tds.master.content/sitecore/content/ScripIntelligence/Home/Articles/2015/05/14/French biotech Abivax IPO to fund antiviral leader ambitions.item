<p>Private French biotech company Abivax is planning an IPO on the Paris Euronext market to raise funds for the clinical development programs for its two lead compounds, ABX203 and ABX464, for hepatitis B and HIV respectively.</p><p>In particular they will be used to further the development of ABX464 for AIDS (currently in Phase IIa) with two Phase IIb studies.</p><p>The company's Document de Base (Registration Document) was registered with the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) on 19 May, marking the first phase of the planned IPO, subject to market conditions and the issuing of the AMF visa. The amount of funding sought will be disclosed when the visa is issued.</p><p>Abivax's aim is to become a leader in antivirals and human vaccines. It has already built relationships with two Cuban vaccine institutes - the CIGB (Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology) and the Finlay Institute - securing access to Cuban R&D and product manufacturing. This has resulted in deals for the licensing of ABX203, and a novel antiviral compound against Dengue, and the acquisition of the distribution rights for three commercial vaccines against typhoid, meningococcus B and C and leptospirosis. Abivax says these three vaccines should be marketed as soon as 2015, subject to the signing of distribution agreements with local partners, and added that it was also in advanced discussions to acquire other products. </p><h2>reservoirs</h2><p>With ABX464, developed using its proprietary antiviral platform, Abivax is hoping to tackle the problem of HIV reservoirs. The product, which entered a Phase IIa study in Mauritius earlier this year, is a novel small molecule that inhibits HIV replication through an entirely new mechanism, details of which were published in April in the journal <i>Retrovirology. </i></p><p>ABX464 works to block viral replication by preventing the export of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, through the inhibition of the Rev protein that mediates this process. Rev has been postulated to be of potential interest for HIV treatment for some time, but ABX464 is the first molecule under development aimed at inhibiting it, Abivax says.</p><p>Researchers are optimistic that the product might have several benefits over current treatments: its durable suppression of viral load could reduce dosing frequency, and it may be possible to use it as a monotherapy, they say. </p><p>"ABX464 represents a novel class of anti-HIV molecules with unique properties. ABX464 has a long lasting effect in humanized mice and neutralizes the expression of HIV-1 proviral genome of infected immune cells including reservoirs and it is therefore a promising drug toward a functional cure of HIV," the researchers concluded in <i>Retrovirology</i>.</p><p>A functional cure for HIV-positive patients would not only bring important advantages to patients but could also bring huge cost benefits to payers.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock said the main potential advantage of this drug could be that it had an enduring suppressive effect after withdrawal of therapy so it might be suitable for less frequent dosing. "In practice though this would only really be an advantage if it was capable of stimulating competitive rates of virologic suppression as a monotherapy, because if it was part of a combination therapy you would have to take the other components every day anyway." </p><p>He added that if ABX464 cannot produce competitive virologic suppression as a monotherapy, in the long term, it might make sense to attempt to pair this compound with other longer-acting agents in development such as GSK's early-phase integrase inhibitor (GSK1265744).</p><h2>hepatitis</h2><p>Abivax's other lead agent, the therapeutic hepatitis B vaccine ABX203, was licensed from the CIGB in 2013 following successful Phase I, I/IIa and II/III clinical trials run by CIGB in Cuba and Bangladesh, and a pivotal Phase IIb/III study is now recruiting in Asia Pacific. Studies to date suggest that the vaccine might be able to control viral load for longer periods of time than current hepatitis B treatments.</p><p>Abivax has an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ABX203 in more than 80 markets in Asia, Europe and Africa.</p><p>CEO Professor Hartmut Ehrlich said: "With our advanced clinical development pipeline, and other preclinical compounds with differentiated profiles, we believe Abivax is in a unique position to significantly improve the treatment of a number of major infections such as HIV or hepatitis B in a way that delivers important benefits to both patients and payers."</p><p>
