<p>Ruling in favor of the Obama administration in upholding the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) on 25 June, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took Congress to task for its poor language in writing the law &ndash; calling it "inartful."</p><p>"Several features of the act's passage contributed to that unfortunate reality," he said in writing the majority opinion in the 6-3 ruling, which declared the ACA's subsidies can be granted to eligible Americans enrolled in private health insurance plans offered under the law's exchanges &ndash; whether the coverage was bought at state-run marketplaces or those operated by the federal government.</p><p>Chief Justice Roberts pointed to the fact that Congress wrote key parts of the act behind closed doors, rather than through the "traditional legislative process."</p><p>And, he said, lawmakers passed much of the ACA using a "complicated budgetary procedure," known as "reconciliation," which he said limited opportunities for debate and amendment and bypassed the Senate's normal 60-vote filibuster requirement.</p><p>"As a result, the act does not reflect the type of care and deliberation that one might expect of such significant legislation," Chief Justice Roberts admonished. </p><p>He even made reference to the often repeated remark from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Democrat-California), who was the Speaker at the time the law was enacted, who said "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it away from the fog of the controversy."</p><p>But the chief justice also got a scolding from Justice Antonin Scalia, who seemed particularly perturbed that his conservative colleague would jump ship and save Obamacare &ndash; for a second time. </p><p>Indeed, it was Chief Justice Roberts who had been credited for saving the ACA from a perilous end in June 2012 when opponents argued the so-called individual mandate requiring Americans that meet certain criteria to carry healthcare insurance was unconstitutional &ndash; an idea the court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Affordable-Care-Act-constitutional-under-Congress-taxing-powers-332248" target="_new">rejected</a> in a 5-4 ruling. </p><p>Also joining the more liberal members of the court &ndash; Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonya Sotomayor and Elena Kagan &ndash; in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supremes-statutory-focused-ACA-ruling-a-win-for-biopharma-359126" target="_new">25 June</a><i>King v Burwell</i> ruling was Justice Anthony Kennedy, who had sided with Justices Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Constitutionality-declared-Surgery-or-hammer-time-next-for-health-reform-332278" target="_new">objecting</a> to the ACA in 2012. </p><p>"We should start calling this law SCOTUScare," Justice Scalia declared in his 25 June dissenting opinion &ndash; playing off of the ACA's nickname, "Obamacare," and the court's acronym, "SCOTUS."</p><p>Justice Scalia said he "wholeheartedly" agreed with the majority that "sound interpretation requires paying attention to the whole law, not homing in on isolated words or even isolated sections." </p><p>"Context always matters," he said. </p><p>But, Justice Scalia said, "Let us not forget, however, why context matters: It is a tool for understanding the terms of the law, not an excuse for rewriting them. Any effort to understand rather than to rewrite a law must accept and apply the presumption that lawmakers use words in &ldquo;their natural and ordinary signification."</p><p>Ordinary connotation does not always prevail, but the more unnatural the proposed interpretation of a law, the more compelling the contextual evidence must be to show that it is correct, he said.</p><p>But, Justice Scalia argued, "Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard of."</p><p>"Who would ever have dreamt that 'exchange established by the state' means 'exchange established by the state or the federal government," he said, calling such an interpretation of the ACA "absurd."</p><p>At one point in his dissent, Justice Scalia calls the majority opinion's argument a "bit of interpretive jiggery-pokery," and later refers to it as "pure applesauce."</p><p>"Words no longer have meaning if an exchange that is not established by a state is 'established by the state,'" Justice Scalia insisted. </p><p>"Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the government should lose this case," he said.</p><p>But, Justice Scalia said, "normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present court: The <i>Affordable Care Act</i> must be saved."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
