<p>Something strange is happening in the stock market. What ended up as the best week of the year for the broad S&P 500 index was a down-week and month to date for the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NBI). This is not supposed to happen since the biotech sector is higher beta, meaning that if the broad equity index finishes the week up, the NBI should finish the week up more. </p><p><p>The underperformance of biotech last week and month against a positive broad market could be further evidence of the rotation of generalist investors away from the sector and while there was some positive news from pharmaceutical companies last week, negative news from biotechnology companies could be coloring the perspective of those investors with a decreasing tolerance to risk.</p><p><p>Shares of the world's biggest gene sequencing company Illumina, Inc. were in the red for most of last week after its surprisingly negative third- and fourth-quarter sales pre-announcement. The analysts at Mizuho were quick to downgrade the stock while the analysts from Leerink Partners were basking in the glow of the previous week's pre-emptive downgrade, albeit for reasons unrelated to the weaker desktop instrument sales that caused the preannouncement. At the time of the Leerink downgrade, the analysts from Mizuho were quick to reiterate their 'Buy' recommendation, citing Illumina's 'robust demand' and its 'dominant position in a high growth market'. By contrast, the analysts from JP Morgan were both consistent and accurate in response to Illumina's pre-announcement. Only bench-top placements in Europe and Asia Pacific were weak, whereas sales in the US and consumables across Illumina's client base were as strong as expected. These red quarters may be something investors have to get used to over the rest of the year with the US dollar having remained strong over the quarter and sales of any drugs or devices in Europe, Japan or China by companies reporting in US dollars are likely to show a similar weakness. As the analysts from JP Morgan pointed out, 'the long-term outlook remains unchanged' since (in my view too) the best positioned company in personalized medicine and diagnostic-guided therapy is not a diagnostics company, but the biggest sequencing company.</p><p><p>By contrast, more traditional business models based on selling premium priced diagnostic laboratory and point-of-care tests seem even more likely to leave their investors in the red. Exact Sciences Corp.'s <i>Cologuard</i> test to predict bowel cancer was deemed a second-tier or alternative test in last week's draft US Preventive Services Task Force colorectal screening guidelines. While the analysts at Jefferies were keen to point out the negative commercial implications of this event, back in the summer they cited Exact Sciences as their 'top idea in diagnostics' after its R&D day, pre-announced revenues of only $8.3m and Jefferies' underwriting of the $200m fundraising at $25.50 per share. The share price of Exact Sciences closed last week at $8.51.</p><p><p>One color that often accompanies the bursting of a biotech bubble is pink &ndash; as in the pink slips of workforce reductions. These have emerged in the last few weeks with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Verastem-Slashes-Staff-After-Mesothelioma-Failure-360902" target="_new">half the workforce</a> (but not the CEO) going at Verastem, Inc. after its Phase II failure, 25 job losses plus the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/XenoPort-Puts-A-Brave-Face-On-Failure-360802" target="_new">CEO's retirement</a> after the mixed phase II results at Xenoport, Inc., and most recently the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-Firing-Leif-Save-Arena-360830" target="_new">retirement at the request of the directors</a> (which should in future be known as an 'Arexit') of the CEO of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. after the continued dismal commercial performance of its treatment for obesity, <i>Belviq</i> (lorcaserin). Workforce reductions in biotech normally come after a bubble has burst, rather than during the process, as it probably takes a year or so for the board to start to worry about the number of years' cash remaining on the company's balance sheet. But if the departures due to dismal commercial performances can occur at any time, then there are some prime candidates who have long presided over the development of products for which, as is now becoming obvious, there is no commercially viable market. An example could be the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Makin-the-honors-list-BTGs-dame-in-the-limelight-352361" target="_new">recently honored CEO of BTG Plc</a>, who has presided over much of the cost and the 19 years it has taken to get its product <i>Varithena</i> (polydocanol injectable foam) to the market. BTG's CEO, who had previously predicted $500m in annual <i>Varithena</i> sales, had to drastically back-pedal in last week's disappointing pre-close announcement with expectations of flat annual <i>Varithena</i> sales of about &pound;1m. At this point, BTG's analysts from Jefferies were probably trying to erase from everyone's memories their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-vein-hopes-and-a-spinning-Puma-355097" target="_new">delusional $1.3bn "blue sky" estimates</a> for <i>Varithena</i>. Indeed, blood and plasma supplies company Haemonetics Corp. and prenatal testing company Sequenom, Inc. both re-affirmed the link between poor financial performance and pink-slipping their CEOs after significant sales and earnings guidance revisions.</p><p><p>At the very least, it appears that generalist investors who do not have a deep understanding of the sector are taking profits after a bull run in biotech that has lasted nearly three years. There must however still be many investors left in the sector who believe that every small biotech company they invest in has a billion dollar product, will be acquired by big pharma and is immune from product failure. Once the realization permeates that none of these assumptions is true, some investors are going to be left feeling very blue.</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Illumina.</p><p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest is the investment adviser for the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies. He has been lead fund manager for four life science</i>&ndash;<i>specific funds, including International Biotechnology Trust and the AXA Framlington Biotech Fund, and was awarded the Technology Fund Manager of the year for 2007.</i></p><p><p>
