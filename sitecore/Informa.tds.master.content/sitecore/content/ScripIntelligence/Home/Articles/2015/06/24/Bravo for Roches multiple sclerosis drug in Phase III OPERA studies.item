<p> Hopes for Roche's novel multiple sclerosis treatment, ocrelizumab, are rising after it outperformed Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in two Phase III trials in the most common relapsing-remitting form of the disease. </p> <p> Top-line data from the OPERA I and II studies showed that ocrelizumab significantly reduced the annualised relapse rate (ARR) over two years compared with Rebif, the trials' primary endpoint. The drug also significantly reduced the progression of clinical disability compared with interferon beta-1a, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Added to this was a significant reduction in the number of brain lesions with ocrelizumab treatment compared with interferon beta-1a, as measured by MRI. </p> <p> The data are due to be included in filings with the US and EU regulators in the first quarter next year, Roche says. </p> <p> Like Roche's blockbuster cancer drug Rituxan (rituximab), ocrelizumab specifically targets CD20+ B cells, thus depleting lymphocytes that produce the autoimmune response. However, as a humanized monoclonal antibody it is expected to induce less immunogenicity than rituximab. </p> <p> CD20+ B cells are thought to be a key contributor to myelin and axonal damage, which can result in disability in people with MS. Roche says ocrelizumab binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, and therefore the ability to make new B cells is preserved. </p> <p> Genmab and Novartis (previously GlaxoSmithKline) are developing their antiCD20 product Arzerra (ofatumumab) in MS, with a Phase III trial in relapsing remitting disease due to begin this year. Other competition could come from Biogen/AbbVie's Zinbryta (daclizumab) which is already awaiting approval for RRMS following promising data from the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BiogenAbbVie-DECIDE-to-file-MS-drug-daclizumab-after-positive-PhIII-352382">Phase III DECIDE study reported last year</a>. </p> <h2> expectations </h2> <p> The OPERA data had been expected to be promising, said Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Daniel Chancellor, as the drug had already demonstrated really good efficacy versus placebo at Phase II. However, he is keen to see the full data to determine whether the new drug might be the best product in terms of reducing relapses. &quot;We'll have to wait a bit longer to find out,&quot; he said. </p> <p> But, he added, safety could be another issue as there was a patient death due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome in Phase II. &quot;Having the best efficacy may not end up defining the drug's commercial future, but rather its risk/benefit profile in relation to Tysabri (Biogen's natalizumab) and Lemtrada (Genzyme's alemtuzumab).&quot; </p> <p> Roche said that overall, the incidence of adverse events associated with ocrelizumab was similar to interferon beta-1a in both of the trials. The most common adverse events were mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions, it said, adding that the incidence of serious adverse events associated with ocrelizumab, including serious infections, was also similar to Rebif. The drug's development in rheumatoid arthritis was discontinued in 2010 after a safety signal in relation to serious infections was seen. </p> <h2> primary opportunity </h2> <p> Ultimately the drug could be defined by its results in primary progressive MS, where it could become the first drug to gain approval for this notoriously difficult-to-treat population that comprises nearly 10% of patients. Novartis's oral sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator Gilenya (fingolimod<a target="_new" href="http://##http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartiss-Gilenya-fails-in-multiple-sclerosis-subgroup-355333">) failed at Phase III in PPMS</a> only in December, leaving ocrelizumab the leading product in this indication. Results from ocrelizumab's placebo-controlled Phase III ORATORIO study in PPMS are expected later this year, Roche says. </p> <p> Overall, Datamonitor Healthcare forecasts sales of ocrelizumab to reach $777m in 2023. </p>
