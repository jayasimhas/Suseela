<p>An Indian court has blocked what appears to be an attempt to market fake versions of a clutch of Merck KGaA products on the domestic and export markets.</p><p>In a recent ex parte ruling, the Delhi High Court issued an ad interim injunction restraining the alleged counterfeiters from manufacturing, selling or dealing with drugs with the trademarks Merck, Concor (bisoprolol) and Glucovance (glibenclamide and metformin) or any other trademark "identical or deceptively similar" to Merck KGaA's trademarks until further orders.</p><p>The defendants, referred to as Dinesh Sharma and others in court documents, are believed to be part of Stevels Pharma, based in northern India, though a comment from either the individual or the firm could not be obtained. </p><p>A Merck spokesperson confirmed to <i>Scrip</i> that the company has obtained a "restraint order" from the Delhi High Court against the parties. "The legal proceedings are going on. Since the matter is sub-justice we are not in a position to share further details on this," the company said.</p><p>Merck has alleged that the accused had, with the intent to infringe its trademarks, been selling drugs with identical trademarks. "Hence the defendants are selling counterfeit products. It is further stated that a consignment is ready to be sent to Iraq and Saudi Arabia," the court order dated 3 March referred to Merck as saying.</p><p>While the term "counterfeit" drugs has not been specifically defined under India's Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, the Indian government has been keen to emphasize that unsubstantiated reports on the extent of "spurious/adulterated" drugs in the country are exaggerated. </p><p>A government statement in February this year reiterated that based on the samples taken by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization during 2011-12 to 2014-15 (up to September 2014), 0.03% samples were found to be spurious or adulterated and that 3.33% samples were found to be not of standard quality.</p><h2>Commissioner</h2><p>In the current case, Merck had further sought the appointment of "local commissioners" to visit the premises of the accused firm in Mohali, Punjab, with the court acceding to the request. </p><p>The court had authorized these "commissioners" to visit the premises of the alleged offenders without prior notice and seize "all infringing counterfeit products, packaging materials, labels, printing dyes, press, plates, catalogues, brochures, cartons and any other material whatsoever bearing plaintiff's aforesaid trademarks which are deceptively or confusingly similar to the said trademarks." </p><p>They were further empowered to gain access by breaking open the locks and seals on the premises, in addition to other actions. These commissioners were also required to file their report after the execution of the task, though it's not immediately clear if such report has already been provided. The next date of listing for the case has been set for July.</p><p>Merck India, which operates across two main segments, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, reported a turnover of around INR8.32bn ($132m) for the year ended December 2014.</p><p>In the pharmaceutical segment, products such as Concor are among the key growth drivers in the firm's Merck Serono division. In fact Concor which had been growing at 21% till July 2014 saw a sharp slowdown by the year-end following price control measures in India.</p>
