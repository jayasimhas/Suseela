<p>Canada's Tekmira Pharmaceuticals has agreed to merge with US company OnCore Biopharma, bringing together the two companies' hepatitis B virus (HBV) candidates with hopes to find a curative combination therapy. </p><p>OnCore will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tekmira, and upon the closing of the deal will own 50% of Tekmira's outstanding stock, valued at around $750m. The merged company will be led by Tekmira's CEO Dr Mark Murray, while OnCore's CEO Patrick Higgins will become president and chief operating officer.</p><p>Both companies have early stage HBV pipelines. Tekmira has an RNAi candidate, TKM-HBV, which is expected to progress into the clinic in the first quarter of 2015, while OnCore's OCB-030 is scheduled to start human trials in the second half of the year. These are the most advanced HBV compounds, but the companies noted that they anticipate progressing other programs towards the clinic, and emphasized their keenness to evaluate combination regimens with the joint pipeline. Together, the companies have eight preclinical candidates for HBV.</p><p>TKM-HBV may be an early stage candidate, but analysts think it is scientifically interesting. The drug is designed to eliminate HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) expression &ndash; an endpoint which is considered equivalent to cure. As Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock points out, current treatments such as Gilead's Viread (tenofovir disoproxil) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Baraclude (entecavir) are effective at suppressing viral replication, but are not able to clear the virus from the body. HBsAg elimination is achieved by only a small percentage of patients on these products, leaving a high unmet need.</p><p>"I think Tekmira's approach is very promising," said Mr Haydock. "HBsAg is itself thought to suppress effective immune responses against HBV, so its removal could allow restoration of an effective immune response and hopefully lead to full clearance of the virus (particularly if combined with Oncore's compound or with current treatments)." OnCore's OCB-030 is a second-generation cyclophilin inhibitor focused on the suppression of viral replication, as well as stimulation of the body's immune response.</p><p>Mr Haydock added: "It's still very early days but these sorts of approaches have the potential to transform HBV from a lifelong chronic disease to a curable disease, as we are now seeing with hepatitis C virus."</p><p>Tekmira CEO Dr Murray said: "We believe that the merger between Tekmira and OnCore has the potential to transform the HBV treatment landscape by bringing together the technologies and science needed to eradicate the virus and develop a cure for this debilitating and deadly disease."</p><p>Other companies looking at similar approaches include Alnylam, which is looking to use siRNAs to prevent production of all HBV proteins including HBsAg. Alnylam's program is also preclinical. And Arrowhead is developing ARC-520 with the hope of reducing HBsAg expression, though early Phase I dosing data showed a negligible decrease.</p><p>While focusing on HBV, the merged company will not be neglecting Tekmira's other pipeline assets. These include TKM-PLK1, a Phase II cancer product, and TKM-Ebola, which is expected to enter Phase II early this year. In a statement, the companies said, "The management teams and Boards of Directors of Tekmira and OnCore believe that there is significant value in Tekmira's non-HBV assets and collaborations. The combined management team and Board of Directors plans to continue to move forward with these programs with the goal of maximizing their value."</p>
