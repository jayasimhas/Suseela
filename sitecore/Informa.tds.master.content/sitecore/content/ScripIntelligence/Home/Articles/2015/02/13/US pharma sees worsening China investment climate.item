<p>One third of correspondents from R&D-intensive industries including pharma see the investment environment worsening in China, citing labor costs and inconsistent regulation. Addressing the challenges, more than 70% are proactively hiring local Chinese for key executive positions, says a just released China business climate survey.</p><p>More than half of the respondents - 57% - believed that foreign firms are being targeted in China's recent pricing investigations, anti-monopoly and anti-corruption campaigns.</p><p>That has led to foreign companies feeling less welcome in China, notes the annual Business Climate Survey for 2015, released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham China) on 11 February in Beijing.</p><p>Nearly half of all surveyed said they believe multinationals are less welcome than before, increasing from 44% last year. Along with resource industries, R&D-intensive sectors including pharmaceuticals and IT feel the least welcome, with 53% reporting the colder shoulders.</p><p>In 2014, Chinese authorities handed over a CNY3bn ($485m) fine to UK drug maker GlaxoSmithKline in a compliance probe.</p><p>On 10 February, the China National Development and Reform Commission also fined US chipmaker Qualcomm CNY6bn.</p><p>"We don't know if it's going to slow down, or who is going to be targeted next," said AmCham China president James Zimmerman in a press conference the same day the report was released, as quoted by AFP.</p><p>"All we can do is set an example and do the right thing - exercise zero tolerance when it comes to these issues, put in place compliance programs and cooperate with the government when these things come up."</p><p>As a result, nearly 30% in the survey say the quality of China's investment environment is deteriorating, and the figure is highest among R&D-intensive sectors, with 33% expressing the pessimistic views.</p><p>52% of the businesses believe the worsening will negatively impact their intent to invest in China.</p><p>Conducted with Bain &Co., the survey received 52% responses from the group's 1,012 members in China, with R&D-intensive industries accounting for over 20%. Two-thirds of respondents hold senior-level county management positions.</p><h2>increasing labor cost pains</h2><p>Among the top business challenges, labor costs and regulatory issues rose significantly in the latest pulse-taking survey.</p><p>Although labor costs have been ranked the top challenge since the 2013 business survey, the factor has again topped the list for 2015 with a double-digit increase in respondents. Compared to 44% and 45% in 2013 and 2014, 61% of those surveyed cited labor costs as their top concern.</p><p>Recruiting and retaining talent poses the primary pain to executives across industry sectors. Too high expectations of salary and related packages cause headaches for these businesses in both attracting and retaining human resources. Other noteworthy concerns are lack of career development and opportunities.</p><p>In effect, the labor costs issue has motivated some companies to consider, or implement, a move outside China. 15% of the correspondents say they would contemplate doing so, and among these, the resources sectors and R&D-intensive industries are more likely to do so.</p><p>In addition to labor costs, shortages of qualified employees and management continue to dominate the challenge chart. 42% and 32% respectively listed the lack of qualified workers and managers as their major concerns.</p><p>Poor air quality in China doesn't help the matter either. Worsening pollution poses difficulties in attracting foreign talent to China, the survey finds. And for the first time since 2009, when the issue was raised, a majority of correspondents, 53%, attributed air quality to difficulties in recruiting senior executives to work in China.</p><h2>inconsistent regulatory, access restrictions</h2><p>Following on from labor issues are regulatory obstacles embodied by inconsistent interpretation and unclear laws.</p><p>Compared to less than 40% reporting the issue in the past three years, nearly half in the 2015 survey listed regulatory issue as one of their top five challenges.</p><p>The medical device sector, for one, has seen the intense release of a dozen or so regulations in 2014, with companies struggling to comply due to a lack of time to send in comments and prepare for major changes.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's slowing economic growth compounded with lingering market access obstacles and uncertain policies further cause concerns, prompting decisions to reduce investment.</p><p>Although market access restrictions impact companies across industries, American pharma and IT companies are more impacted by targeted enforcement for foreign companies, and government funding that is being made available only for domestic firms, the survey finds.</p><p>The finding echoes a June survey by the European Chamber of Commerce, in which European companies listed discretionary enforcement of regulations as their largest challenge.</p><p>Non-transparent rule making processes, and in particular, toughening procedures to obtain registration and licenses poses challenges to the resource sector and R&D-intensive industries.</p><p>Pharma, for one, has seen further new drug delays due to a review of multi-regional clinical trials (MRCT), and executives from Johnson & Johnson have publicly complained about a lengthy regulatory process for innovative drugs in China.</p><h2>IPR remains primary concern</h2><p>Despite reporting improvement in intellectual property rights (IPR) law and enforcement, the AmCham survey finds that IPR enforcement still has a way to go in China.</p><p>While 45% of the correspondents considered actual IPR laws and regulations in China ineffective or very ineffective, 78% reported the enforcement of said laws and regulations ineffective or very ineffective.</p><p>Nevertheless, this "illustrating the incremental progress in the IP environment," noted the report.</p><p>Concerning multinational drug makers in China, the recent surfacing of a policy study on compulsory licensing has raised eyebrows. In a Jan. 29 memo, China's National Health Commission listed the use of compulsory licensing as the top issue for a concentrated examination.</p><p>Although China has provided a clearer pathway for granting such licences in 2012 regulations, no generic makers have made use of it.</p><h2>domestic market bright spot</h2><p>Despite the challenges, "AmCham China member companies retain some optimism about domestic market growth, in line with the increasing investment they are making in innovations for the China market," said the report.</p><p>Multinational drug makers in particular have stepped up their investment in R&D in China. For instance, throughout 2014, J&J has anchored its Asia Innovation Center in Shanghai, and Roche invested $142 million in an infectious center in the same city. Sanofi and Amgen also opened their new Asia Pacific research centers.</p><p>"Members pointed to tailoring products or services to local market needs as the primary goal for doing so [establishing a R&D presence in China]. Improving R&D cost competitiveness and tapping into local talent were the second and third goals, respectively," noted the trade group.</p><p>To that end, pharma and other R&D-intensive industries have the highest rate of local talent among top country management, with native mainland Chinese accounting for 76% of top managers.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p><p>
