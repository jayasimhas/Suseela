<p>Nimbus Therapeutics (formerly Nimbus Discovery) has changed its name and raised $43m in a series B financing round in order to evolve into a clinical-stage company focused on treatments for Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH).</p><p>New investors in the newly dubbed Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm included Pfizer Venture Investments and Lightstone Ventures. Meanwhile, all of Nimbus's series A investors, including Atlas Venture, SR One, Lilly Ventures and Bill Gates, also participated in its latest financing effort. </p><p>Nimbus CEO Dr Don Nicholson said the $43m would "set the foundational stage for several key inflection points for Nimbus in 2015 and beyond."</p><p>Nimbus plans to use its new cash to advance its lead program, an Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor, into clinical development &ndash; representing the first allosteric and liver-targeted inhibitor intended for the treatment of NASH, the company noted. Nimbus plans to report Phase I data from this program later in 2015. </p><p>Nimbus's focus has been on medically important but previously intractable molecular targets &ndash; it is this strategy that Nimbus thinks has attracted substantial investor interest. "Owing to the progress that we have been able to make against difficult targets like ACC and others (eg, IRAK4 and Tyk2) we've been able to appeal to both strategic and venture investors," Nimbus said. </p><p>As the firm transitions into a clinical-stage company, Nimbus is anticipating "evolutionary" changes. "We plan to continue to build our company and its internal capabilities. We will continue to expand our deep collaborations with the research, medical and regulatory communities. We will also deepen our interactions within the Pharma/biotech ecosystem," it told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>However, Nimbus will continue to develop its NASH program alone for the foreseeable future. "We are not actively seeking a partner for our ACC inhibitor at this point and are comfortable that we can develop it ourselves through the next few years," Nimbus said. "But we will revisit our strategy at each major clinical milestone and do what is best to ensure our molecule gets to patients promptly, and also serves the best interests our company and its investors."</p><h2>competition in NASH</h2><p>NASH affects an estimated 16 million Americans and represents a growing, competitive area of interest for a number of pharma companies. Currently there are no approved therapies to treat the condition, but the pipeline for NASH drugs is broad. According to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database, in the US alone, there are six products in Phase IIb stages of development; six compounds in Phase II; 10 in Phase I; and a number of candidates undergoing preclinical research. There are also three products listed as under development outside of the US.</p><p>The most advanced product for the treatment of NASH is La Jolla Pharmaceuticals' GCS-100, for which an investigational new drug (IND) application has been filed with the US FDA. GCS-100 is a Galectin 3 Antagonist. Galectin-3 is an anti-apoptotic protein that protects T-cells, macrophages, and breast carcinoma cells from death triggered by a variety of agents.</p><p>Meanwhile, companies like Gilead Sciences are also getting involved in the area. In January this year Gilead <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-buying-another-NASH-program-for-up-to-470m-355961" target="_new">acquired a portfolio</a> of compounds targeting the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a means for controlling NASH and other liver diseases from Phenex Pharmaceuticals &ndash; in a deal worth a potential $470m. Gilead also has a monoclonal antibody called simtuzumab in Phase IIb clinical trials for NASH.</p><p>And Intercept Pharmaceuticals has a NASH product in Phase IIb trials as well, FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA). The product is also in Phase III for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).  </p><p>However, Nimbus said its technology could set it apart from other NASH therapy drug developers. "It is difficult to say without clinical data, but we believe that ACC inhibition has the potential to disrupt a key upstream event in the pathogenesis of NASH; namely the formation of cytotoxic lipids that accumulate in the liver and appear to drive other pathogenic events such as cell death, fibrosis and inflammation," the company said. ACC enzyme activity is required for de novo (new) lipid synthesis in the liver and by inhibiting the enzyme Nimbus believes it can prevent this from happening.  "In addition, our mechanism is highly targeted to this critical step in the liver and could therefore have a more favorable overall profile compared to other mechanisms that are being pursued for NASH," the company told <i>Scrip</i>. Nimbus plans to present the supporting preclinical data for its strategy at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) meeting in Vienna next month. </p><h2>other indications for Nimbus</h2><p>While Nimbus's first clinical ambition will focus on the NASH indication for its ACC inhibitor, it believes the technology could be used in metabolic indications including type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. The company's other pipeline assets are all in preclinical stages in unspecified cancer and immunology indications. </p><p><p><b>Related articles: </b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Tobira-Regado-merged-business-will-focus-on-NASH-therapies-356166" target="_new">Tobira, Regado merged business will focus on NASH therapies</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-buying-another-NASH-program-for-up-to-470m-355961" target="_new">Gilead buying another NASH program for up to $470m</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intercept-rollercoaster-continues-with-NASH-PBC-updates-354939" target="_new">Intercept rollercoaster continues with NASH, PBC updates</a></p>
