<p> Eli Lilly &amp; Co. is embarking on a rough forecast period, with analysts predicting a continuing decline in sales for the firm's central nervous system (CNS) franchise. However, calmer seas might be ahead if the ongoing trial for its Alzheimer's disease (AD) antibody solanezumab yields positive results and if growth products can reach their targets by year 2019. </p> <p> A shadow was cast over Lilly's outlook by the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Suffers-From-Lillys-Evacetrapib-Failure-361000">recent failure</a> of its cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, evacetrapib &ndash; which had been dubbed a potential blockbuster product for the firm. Analysts are expecting the company's prescription pharmaceutical revenues to fall from almost $17.3bn in 2014 to $15.3bn in 2018, before seeing an upturn. </p> <p> Analysts have also predicted revenues from Lilly's CNS drugs to decline by $2.2bn during 2014-24. So a positive result in the notoriously tricky therapy area of AD (which is not expected by some) would be a big win for Lilly, setting it back on course. But it will be an uphill battle: AD therapies represent a big risk and Sagient Research's BioMedTracker has only given solanezumab a likelihood of approval rating of 16% (36% below average for a product at a similar stage of development). </p> <p> The drug major is currently leading the race to develop the first disease-modifying drug for this neurological disease with its humanized monoclonal antibody, solanezumab, which targets beta amyloid. It is the most clinically advance antibody for AD and has already undergone two global Phase III trials, EXPEDITION I and II. However both of these studies missed their primary endpoints, leaving Lilly to rely on subgroup analyses that suggested an efficacy signal in mild AD. A third study, EXPEDITION III, is currently underway with interim data expected in 2016. These data will be an important indicator for the company's eventual AD market success. </p> <p> Approval of solanezumab would open up a huge potential market for the company &ndash; which is in need of new approved products to rejuvenate its portfolio as its establish brands face ongoing generic erosion. </p> <p> But a new treatment for AD hasn't reached the market in over a decade and Lilly is not the only one rushing to fill the treatment gap. The company faces competition from Roche's crenezumab and gantenerumab, and Biogen's aducanumab. </p> <h2> Playing The Long Game </h2> <p> On Oct. 22, Lilly reported its third-quarter financial results: worldwide revenue was $4.96bn, an increase of 2% compared with the third quarter of 2014, and sales for the company were mostly in line with expectations. Full year 2015 EPS guidance was also raised to $3.40-$3.45 (from $3.20-$3.30). 3Q15 EPS beat expectations at $0.89 vs predicted $0.76. The company still expects 2015 revenue of between $19.7bn and $20.0bn. </p> <p> However, analysts at Credit Suisse noted that Lilly's third and fourth quarters were not where investors should be focused, instead suggesting that the future was looking brighter for the company a few years down the line. </p> <p> &quot;Overall, we believe the focus on Lilly should be on their diverse and relatively de-risked pipeline as opposed to 3Q performance or 4Q expectations,&quot; they said. </p> <p> In the company's third-quarter results CEO John Lechleiter added that upcoming new medicines reinforced Lilly's &quot;confidence in its innovation-based strategy and in its ability to grow revenue and expand margins over the balance of this decade.&quot; </p> <h2> 2019: Turnaround Year </h2> <p> While solanezumab could be a big win for the Alzheimer's market if successful, Lilly has a Plan B in the form of other significant growth drivers among its recently launched and late-stage development portfolio. </p> <p> <preform><script id="infogram_0_lilly_growth_products" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?9E3" type="text/javascript"></script></preform></p> <p> Analysts have named 2019 the year that Lilly will begin to see a big turnaround, with growing sales in the endocrine, metabolic and genetic disorders portfolio helping to restore Lilly's revenues &ndash; to reach an estimated $18.1bn in 2024. In 2014, this portfolio posted sales of $5bn, which comprised 29% of Lilly&rsquo;s total prescription pharmaceuticals revenue. </p> <p> 2019 will be the year these &quot;growth driving&quot; late-stage programs ought to begin to shine, should they all reach the market. In this year, rheumatoid arthritis drug baricitinib will have been approved for 1.5 years and will be starting to infiltrate the RA market; psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis therapy ixekizumab will also be available in markets like the US and growing steadily; LY2605541, a basal insulin analog, will be reaching the market after an expected approval in 2018. </p> <p> Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Ali Al-Bazergan told <i>Scrip</i>: &quot;Although Lilly's termination of evacetrapib removes a large slice of revenues from its launch portfolio, Datamonitor Healthcare still expects $3.5bn of sales for the company out to 2024 from identified growth products.&quot; He added that recent positive readouts from Phase III baricitinib data and Jardiance's unprecedented data in its cardiovascular outcomes study will serve to push Lilly's previously dwindling portfolio. </p>
