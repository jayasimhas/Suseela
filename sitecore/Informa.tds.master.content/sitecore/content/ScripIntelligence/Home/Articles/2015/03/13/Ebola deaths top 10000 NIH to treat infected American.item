<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 March reported Ebola has now claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people in the current outbreak in Western Africa.</p><p>WHO said Ebola has infected 24,350 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since December 2013. </p><p>Meanwhile, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said an American healthcare worker who has contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone was being admitted to the agency's Clinical Center Special Clinical Studies unit in Bethesda, Maryland on 13 March. </p><p>The unidentified healthcare worker is the second patient with Ebola admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for care. </p><p>The NIH's first Ebola patient was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">Nina Pham</a>, a Dallas, Texas nurse who had become infected with the virus when she provided care to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">Thomas Eric Duncan</a> &ndash; the first person inside the US borders to be diagnosed with the disease. Ms Pham &ndash; who filed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-survivor-nurse-suing-Texas-hospital-357001" target="_new">lawsuit</a> against her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian &ndash; recovered, as did her colleague, Amber Vinson, who also contracted Ebola from Mr Duncan, who died of the disease on 8 October 2014.</p><p>Two other healthcare workers were admitted to the NIH's Clinical Center for observation of Ebola after experiencing high-risk exposures to the virus while serving in Sierra Leone. </p><p>Neither of those patients &ndash; an unidentified <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nurse-exposed-to-Ebola-under-observation-at-NIH-355620" target="_new">nurse</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NIH-discharges-doctor-exposed-to-Ebola-from-needle-stick-354342" target="_new">Dr Lewis Rubinson</a>, director of the critical care resuscitation unit at the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center &ndash; actually came down the disease. </p><p>The NIH Clinical Center's special clinical studies unit is specifically designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists, the agency noted. </p><p>The unit staff members are trained in strict infection control practices optimized to prevent spread of potentially transmissible agents, such as Ebola, the NIH said.</p><p>A <a href="http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/5nes.pdf" target="_new">description</a> on the NIH's website said its special clinical studies unit is a seven-bed patient care unit with three double-occupancy rooms and one single-occupancy room. The unit has special air-flow systems to provide patients and staff with a continuous flow of filtered clean air.</p><p>The NIH said access to the unit is strictly controlled. </p><p>"NIH is taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our patients, NIH staff and the public," the agency said.</p><p>On 12 March, Royal Free Hospital in London confirmed it was treating a military healthcare worker for Ebola at the facility's high-level isolation unit.</p><p>The hospital said it also was assessing two other healthcare workers who had returned from Sierra Leone, but had not been diagnosed with the virus. </p><p><b>Related articles:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-survivor-nurse-suing-Texas-hospital-357001" target="_new">Ebola survivor nurse suing Texas hospital</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nurse-exposed-to-Ebola-under-observation-at-NIH-355620" target="_new">Nurse exposed to Ebola under observation at NIH</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/2nd-Texas-nurse-survives-Ebola-discharged-from-hospital-354730" target="_new">2nd Texas nurse survives Ebola; discharged from hospital</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">Nurse gets Ebola survivor plasma; ZMapp maker ups efforts</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">1st US Ebola transmission; dialysis, intubation, PPE scrutinized</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-to-observe-American-doc-exposed-to-Ebola-354171" target="_new">NIH to observe American doc exposed to Ebola</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
