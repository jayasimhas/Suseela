<p>While the FDA approved 41 new molecular entities (NMEs) in 2014, it's not an accurate measure of the actual innovation that's going on in the biopharmaceutical industry or the effects of such research and development on health outcomes and costs, said analysts from the Washington-based think tank the Brookings Institution and the Deerfield Institute.</p><p>Other existing metrics that track R&D spending or regulatory activity and performance also are poor measures of the processes and dimensions of innovation and they don't show where the stumbling blocks have been or provide evidence Washington's policy changes have had their intended effects, the analysts said in an <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/34/2/319.full" target="_new">article</a> published this month in the health policy journal <i>Health Affairs</i>.</p><p>So the Brookings and Deerfield analysts have set out to create a publicly available "living database" to track key development and regulatory characteristics for new medicines aimed at shedding light on the factors contributing to the underlying successful drivers of innovation.</p><p>The database, they said, is intended for use by policymakers, researchers, investors, patient advocates and industry to help probe questions and guide initiatives aimed at enhancing innovative drug development.</p><p>New proposals like President Barack Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative and the legislative reform efforts out of the House and Senate &ndash; 21st Century Cures and Healthy Americans, respectively &ndash; along with others like them, will need to be supported by data-driven evidence to influence meaningful and effective policy change and to ensure they are targeting the right areas, said Dr Gregory Daniel, managing director for evidence development and innovation at Brookings Institution's Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-chief-has-big-plans-for-dream-research-cohort-356736" target="_new">13 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Data-security-diversity-debated-at-precision-medicine-Super-Bowl-356706" target="_new">12 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/21st-Century-Cures-leaders-vow-to-work-out-differences-356688" target="_new">11 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">29 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>). </p><p>At a forum in Washington hosted earlier this month by <i>Health Affairs</i>, Dr Daniel said the Brookings and Deerfield analysts are envisioning their multiphase approach to "collect better and more data" and paint the broadest picture possible of what drives innovation in drug R&D.</p><p>Unlike many other methods, he said the Brookings-Deerfield database will include data on therapies that didn't succeed.</p><p>"That's a difficult challenge" since "some of that data is very hard to collect," Dr Daniel acknowledged.</p><p>The living database also plans to show the actual impact of drugs in the populations for which the products are intended to treat, the quality of life outcomes and whether the medicines are really addressing unmet needs, he said. </p><p>"That will take developing standardized measures to measure across therapeutic areas," Dr Daniel said. </p><p>The database also will examine "macro issues," like measures not tied to specific drugs that could jumpstart innovation, such as public-private partnerships, precompetitive consortia and developing and validating biomarkers, Dr Daniel explained. </p><p>"We are interested in learning if those make a difference and do they really translate into success in innovation," he said. </p><p>Dr Daniel noted the Brookings-Deerfield living database is "still a work in progress" and will take strategic partnerships with the FDA, academic groups, research organizations and trade associations to develop and collect the data.</p><p>But he remained optimistic the completion of such a project was possible.</p><p>"There's tremendous opportunities to collaborate with others in the ecosystem and to develop a more systematic process for tracking and improving innovation," he said. </p><p>"We hope these efforts will create the basis for meaningful research and sound policy making and ultimately serve to advance the healthcare field," said Jonathan Leff, chairman of the Deerfield Institute. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>FDA clarifies registration for 'outsourcing' compounders </b></p><p>The FDA on 13 February issued five new draft documents &ndash; four guidances and one memorandum of understanding (MOU) &ndash; aimed at clarifying the agency's thinking about certain provisions related to pharmacy compounding imposed under the <i>Drug Quality and Security Act</i> (DQSA) of 2013.</p><p>The four draft guidance documents are focused on outsourcing facility registration; outsourcing facility adverse event reporting; drug repackaging; and mixing, diluting and repackaging biological products.</p><p>The draft MOU describes the responsibilities of states investigating and responding to complaints related to compounded drugs distributed outside of its jurisdiction. It also addresses the interstate distribution of "inordinate amounts" of compounded medicines.</p><p>The FDA said it has received questions about whether entities engaged in various types of activities, such as compounding only nonsterile drugs or only repackaging biological products, should register as so-called outsourcing facilities &ndash; a new category of pharmacies engaged in large-volume compounding that are allowed to send compounded products to healthcare facilities without obtaining prescriptions for identified individual patients, although they are not permitted to dispense their products to a patient without a prescription (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Voluntary-process-leaves-FDA-in-the-dark-over-compounders-identities-348462" target="_new">03 December 2013</a>).</p><p>Under the DQSA, signed by President Barack Obama in November 2013, entities that choose to remain as "traditional" pharmacies, meaning they must only compound products subject to a prescription, will continue to be regulated by state boards of pharmacy (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-signs-compoundingtrack-and-trace-bill-348404" target="_new">28 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/After-decades-of-apathy-blunders-compoundingtrack-and-trace-bill-done-348213" target="_new">19 November 2013</a>).</p><p>Because entities that register as outsourcing facilities &ndash; a voluntary process &ndash; were required to start paying a registration fee as of 1 October 2014 to the FDA, which will not be refunded, regulators wanted to clarify who should register. </p><p>Outsourcing facilities can qualify for exemptions from the FDA approval and labeling requirements, but they are subject to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. </p><p>Outsourcing facilities also must be inspected by the FDA according to a risk-based schedule and meet certain other conditions, such as reporting adverse events and providing federal regulators with certain information about the products the firms compound, the agency pointed out in its draft <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM434171.pdf" target="_new">guidance</a>, <i>For Entities Considering Whether to Register As Outsourcing Facilities under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</i>. </p><p>But, the FDA said, if a compounder does not intend to make all types of drugs at its facility and comply with cGMP requirements, it should not register as an outsourcing facility. </p><p>Regulators also pointed out that the definition of compounding does not include repackaging, so entities engaged in repackaging also should not register.</p><p>In addition, entities engaged in mixing, diluting or repackaging biological products subject to licensure should not register because those products do not qualify for the exemptions under the law. </p><p>The FDA issued separate draft guidances on mixing, diluting and repackaging biological products outside the scope of an approved biologics license application and repackaging certain medicines by pharmacies and outsourcing facilities. </p><p>The agency emphasized in another <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM434188.pdf" target="_new">document</a> that registered outsourcing facilities must report all serious "unexpected" adverse experiences associated with the use of their compounded prescription products &ndash; defining those as events resulting in life-threatening experiences, hospitalization or prolonged hospital visit, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect or death. </p><p><b>340B uses PhRMA suit to regroup; 'mega-guidance' expected June</b></p><p>Last year was a rocky one for the 340B drug discount program, with things left uncertain after a US district court judge sided with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in a lawsuit against the Obama administration involving prices for orphan drugs, said Dr Krista Pedley, director of the Office of Pharmacy Affairs at the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).</p><p>The court declared that HRSA, part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), had gone beyond "the bounds of its statutory authority" when the agency issued a rule in July 2013 permitting certain covered entities to purchase orphan drugs at discounted prices as long as the products were used for non-orphan indications. </p><p>The court vacated the rule, giving PhRMA a victory (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PhRMA-prevails-in-340B-orphan-drug-tussle-352037" target="_new">28 May 2014</a>).</p><p>Nonetheless, HRSA used the challenges created by the lawsuit to "re-group, re-focus and pour our energies into improving the integrity of the 340B program," Dr Pedley said last week in Washington at the Government Drug Pricing Forum.</p><p>Congress created the 340B drug discount program in 1992 under the <i>Public Health Service Act</i> to provide certain hospitals and federally funded grantees access to low prices on pharmaceutical products.</p><p>Drug manufacturers that participate in the US Medicaid program for the poor must offer 340B safety-net covered entities prices at or below the so-called ceiling price &ndash; the highest price a biopharmaceutical maker is permitted by the law to charge participating 340B entities for a prescription medicine.</p><p>Under the original 340B statute, covered entities were generally disproportionate share hospitals &ndash; those that serve indigent populations.</p><p>But under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA), Congress added several categories to the covered entities list, such as children's and free-standing cancer hospitals excluded from the Medicare prospective payment system, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals.</p><p>HRSA said it issued its July 2013 rule to clarify the ACA where the 340B pricing for orphan drugs was concerned.</p><p>But PhRMA argued the HRSA rule contravened the plain language of the statute, and was therefore invalid. </p><p>The court agreed.</p><p>So this past July, HRSA issued an "interpretative" rule &ndash; essentially taking the same stance it did in its earlier now-vacated rule on discounts for orphan drugs that are used for non-orphan indications. </p><p>And PhRMA, again, went back to the court seeking to have the interpretative rule struck down.</p><p>Last month, HRSA asked the court to throw out PhRMA's latest suit, insisting the rule was not subject to the court's review &ndash; so the saga has continued.</p><p>On 13 February, HRSA reported that 12 manufacturers &ndash; AuroMedics Pharma, Baxter, Bayer, Eisai, Lilly, Genentech, Ipsen, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Salix and Virtus Pharmaceuticals &ndash; were not offering 340B pricing for their designated orphan drug products when used for their non-orphan indications to newly eligible covered entities. </p><p>"As 340B discounts are not being provided on these drugs, there is no risk of 340B duplicate discounts. Therefore, states may utilize this information to obtain Medicaid rebates for such drugs," HRSA said.</p><p>Meanwhile, in light of the court's earlier ruling in the orphan drug case, HRSA withdrew its proposed Omnibus regulations &ndash; the so-called mega-rule &ndash; in November 2014, Dr Pedley pointed out. </p><p>Now, she said, HRSA is "moving forward in our goal to provide clear policy for all stakeholders."</p><p>"We are working on drafting regulations where we have explicit authority and guidelines subject to notice and comments where we don't have authority," Dr Pedley explained. </p><p>She said HRSA has "explicit authority" for civil monetary penalties (CMPs) for manufacturers and administrative dispute resolutions (ADR).</p><p>Dr Pedley said HRSA plans to publish its CMPs notice of proposed regulation (NPRM) this spring, which will include the calculation of the 340B ceiling price. </p><p>"These penalties would be levied when a manufacturer knowingly and intentionally charges covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price," she said.</p><p>The agency also plans to publish its ADR NPRM in the fall, Dr Pedley said. </p><p>She said additional policies will be addressed in the 340B Omnibus guidelines &ndash; the "mega-guidelines &ndash; which HRSA anticipates publishing in June.</p><p>It will include topics where HRSA does not have rulemaking authority, such as patient definition, hospital eligibility, contract pharmacies, recertification, covered outpatient drug, audits, duplicate discounts, including Medicaid managed care, manufacturer limited distribution plans and more, she said.</p><p>"It is important that all stakeholders review the guidance and provide HRSA with comments for us to assess the impacts on the community," Dr Pedley said. </p><p>She said HRSA is "actively engaged" in manufacturer oversight.</p><p>HRSA is required to collect information from manufacturers to verify the accuracy of 340B ceiling prices and then make ceiling prices available to covered entities.</p><p>The agency expects to operationalize a new system to provide prices by the end of FY 15, which also will include spot checks of sales transactions, Dr Pedley said.</p><p>"We will be using analysis of these sales transactions as an early warning system to conduct proactive analysis and trending of pricing data to assess manufacturer compliance," she said.</p><p>HRSA also is required to establish procedures for refunds and credits to covered entities &ndash; something it plans to address in its upcoming proposed guidance, Dr Pedley said.</p><p>She said HRSA also has statutory authority to audit manufacturers.</p><p>"We review and follow up on all allegations brought to our attention regarding manufacturer compliance, particularly that manufacturers are not charging covered entities at or below the 340B ceiling prices and ensuring that manufacturers are not discriminating against 340B entities," Dr Pedley said.</p><p>She noted that an audit of an undisclosed manufacturer currently is in the process in partnership with the HHS Office of Inspector General.</p><p>"We hope to have more information on the outcome soon," Dr Pedley said, adding that HRSA is developing a protocol to move forward on additional manufacturer audits to be conducted this fiscal year.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
