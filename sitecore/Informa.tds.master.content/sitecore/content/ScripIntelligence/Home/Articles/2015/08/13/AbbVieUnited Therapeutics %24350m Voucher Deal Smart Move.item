<p>AbbVie became the latest firm to test the FDA "voucher" strategy as a pathway to success &ndash; entering into a $350m deal with United Therapeutics in an effort to get an experimental medicine to the market quicker.</p><p>AbbVie laid down the cash to purchase United Therapeutics' rare pediatric disease priority review voucher (PRV) &ndash; paying the highest amount to date for one of the so-called golden tickets. </p><p>Holders of the PRVs, which are awarded by the FDA on the approval of designated applications for medicines aimed at treating neglected tropical or rare pediatric diseases, can use them on a subsequent application that otherwise would not have qualified for a priority review or the companies can sell them, like United Therapeutics did.</p><p>PRVs are valuable because the bearers can shave off at least four months of the time it takes the FDA to examine a marketing application, which means a product can get to the US market much faster, banking cash for the drug maker &ndash; obviously a goal AbbVie thought worthwhile to pay big money to achieve.</p><p>To use the voucher, however, the company must pay a special user fee, which currently is just over $2.5m.</p><p>AbbVie was mum on its plans for the voucher, but there was much speculation on Wall Street the firm may use it to speed approval of its experimental oral B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor venetoclax, which the company is developing under a partnership with Roche unit Genentech as a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or potentially one of its investigational hepatitis C virus drugs.</p><p>Another candidate could be its PARP inhibitor veliparib, which AbbVie is developing in breast and lung cancers.</p><p>Andrew Fisher, chief strategy officer at United Therapeutics, told <i>Scrip</i> the company has not yet articulated a specific purpose for the proceeds from the voucher, but said the firm is "actively seeking new opportunities in the area of pediatric orphan oncology indications," like its neuroblastoma drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Unituxin-United-Therapeutics-wins-pediatric-voucher-357213" target="_new">Unituxin</a> (dinutuximab) &ndash; the medicine for which it earned the PRV.</p><p>"We certainly would consider developing drugs for indications that, if the voucher program were renewed with the same parameters as the expiring program, could earn us another voucher down the road," he said. </p><p>But Fisher also emphasized United Therapeutics' interest in developing drugs for rare pediatric indications is "not conditioned upon the existence of a voucher program."</p><p>JP Morgan analyst Jessica Fye said the cash could be put towards repurchasing shares, given management have suggested they will continue to buy stock up to the $200 per share range, although she noted the board would likely need to authorize another program, since the current one was expected to be completed in July.</p><p>The new funds could potentially go towards business development, Fye said, noting management has pointed to an interest in bringing in additional pipeline assets.</p><p>Investors, however, were either lethargic on Aug. 19 over United Therapeutics capturing the unheard of amount of $350m for its rare pediatric disease PRV or they thought the firm should have held out for more.</p><p>Shares of the Silver Spring, MD-based company only got a $1.32 bump, less than 1%, before closing at $167.68, up 10 cents.</p><p><b>Momentum Builds</b></p><p>Congress initially created the PRV program in 2007 under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007</i> as an incentive to encourage the development of new medicine to prevent and treat neglected tropical diseases, which typically affect larger populations in poor nations.</p><p>But lawmakers expanded the program in 2012 to pediatric rare diseases under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.</i></p><p>The latter law, however, only set up the pediatric rare disease PRV program &ndash; the one under which United Therapeutics won its voucher &ndash; on a temporary basis, so it's due to end next year, unless Congress renews it.</p><p>BioMarin Pharmaceuticals was the first to make cash off its PRV, which also was the very first rare pediatric disease voucher ever granted by the FDA, which came on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Vimizim-BioMarin-wins-1st-rare-peds-disease-voucher-350063" target="_new">February 2014 approval</a> of the company's Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA enzyme replacement treatment Vimizim (elosulfase alfa).</p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron paid $67.5m in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">July 2014</a> for BioMarin's voucher &ndash; using it to gain a swifter approval of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab), which is the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitor cleared for the US market, coming in more than a month ahead of Amgen's Repatha evolocumab, whose <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date is Aug. 27.</p><p>Gilead Sciences followed in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-pays-unprecedented-125m-for-Knight-priority-voucher-355151" target="_new">November 2014</a> by paying $125m for Knight Therapeutics' tropical disease PRV, which it gained when the FDA approved the firm's leishmaniasis drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Impavido-in-leishmaniasis-Knight-wins-priority-voucher-350770" target="_new">Impavido</a> (miltefosine).</p><p>This past May, Sanofi <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-paying-big-for-FDA-voucher-Retrophin-snags-245m-358627" target="_new">bought</a> Retrophin's rare disease pediatric PRV for $245m &ndash; a voucher the latter firm acquired just two months earlier when it exercised its rights to purchase the newly approved <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Voucher-FDA-approval-lure-Retrophin-to-buy-Cholbam-357371" target="_new">Cholbam</a> (cholic acid) from Asklepion Pharmaceuticals for $27m, plus 661,278 shares of the former firm's common stock.</p><p>The FDA has awarded two other PRVs &ndash; one to Novartis in April 2009 on the approval of its malaria product Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine), and the other to Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen, which it gained in December 2012 on the approval of its tuberculosis drug Sirturo (bedaquiline).</p><p>J&J's Janssen has yet to use or sell its voucher.</p><p>While Novartis actually was the first to snag a PRV, it was all for naught, since it essentially went to waste when the company failed to gain a quicker approval for a broader use of Ilaris (canakinumab) &ndash; a lesson AbbVie may want to keep in mind when picking which drug it wants to use its voucher. </p><p><b>Expect More Vouchers </b></p><p>David Ridley, an associate professor of business and economics at Duke University, and his colleagues, whose 2006 proposal for a PRV "prize" was the basis on which the 2007 law was created, had estimated nearly a decade ago the vouchers could be worth $300m or more to a company &ndash; especially if it was used for a product that ultimately achieves blockbuster status.</p><p>He told <i>Scrip</i> the reason PRV buyers had to work their way up to the $300m figure was because they were initially cautious about the program. </p><p>"Few drug executives were willing to stick their necks out to spend over $100m for an unproven voucher," Ridley said.</p><p>The reason the FDA has not issued more vouchers, he said, is because drug development is so slow, with clinical testing often taking nearly decade. </p><p>But Ridley said he anticipated there will be "several vouchers awarded each year going forward."</p><p>BioMarin stands to gain another voucher after the FDA on Aug. 19 granted a rare pediatric disease designation to the company's experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-fates-converge-for-BioMarins-drisapersen-Sareptas-eteplirsen-359173" target="_new">drisapersen</a>, whose application currently is under review at the agency, with a Dec. 27 PDUFA date.</p><p>Ridley said the voucher program is working as intended to incentivize firms to pursue neglected tropical and rare pediatric diseases.</p><p>He pointed out that because of the voucher program, NanoViricides is now pursuing a treatment for dengue, and Medicines Development was provided some financial support for its river blindness drug by the nonprofit Global Health Investment Fund under an agreement it would share in some of the rewards from the sale of a voucher if the drug maker wins one. </p><p>Ridley noted Congress recently strengthened the voucher program by reducing the FDA notification period and increasing voucher transferability and added <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Congress-passes-Ebola-voucher-bill-355476" target="_new">Ebola</a> to the list of qualified neglected tropical diseases for which biopharmaceutical makers can gain the PRV if the firms develop drugs or vaccines to treat the deadly virus.</p><p>In a <i>Federal Register</i> notice posted online on Aug. 19, the FDA said it had determined that Chagas disease and neurocysticercosis satisfied the definition of tropical diseases for the PRVs under the 2007 law. </p><p>Ridley noted that Congress also has kicked around the idea of creating similar voucher programs for antibiotics or medical countermeasures, although no proposal has moved forward.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
