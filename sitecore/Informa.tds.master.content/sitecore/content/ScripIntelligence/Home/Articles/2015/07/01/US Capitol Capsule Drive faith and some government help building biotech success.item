<p>While there's 100 or so biotechs formed each year, an extraordinary thing happened last week that not only was another sign the industry is thriving after years of struggle, but also was a major achievement for the US National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), whose mission includes de-risking investigational medicines to attract commercial investment, with the aim of getting those products to the market sooner.</p><p>Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Vtesse, a spin-off of Massachusetts orphan-drug accelerator Cydan Development, was launched last week with the help of a $25m Series A investment led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from Pfizer Venture Investments, Lundbeckfond Ventures, Bay City Capital and Alexandria Venture Investments.</p><p>The biotech plans to use its proceeds to pursue development of a drug NCATS has been investigating for the past few years, cyclodextrin, which actually has been around for decades and is used as an additive to make products more soluble. </p><p>Johnson & Johnson owns the initial rights to cyclodextrin. </p><p>But under a partnership with J&J, NCATS has repurposed cyclodextrin as a treatment for Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), a rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), which is characterized by progressive impairment of motor and intellectual functions in early childhood.</p><p>NPC, which affects about 500 patients worldwide, 200 of whom are in the US, primarily strikes children, killing most before they reach adulthood.</p><p>Under a licensing deal with NCATS, Vtesse is now picking up the pursuit of cyclodextrin, dubbing it VTS-270.</p><p>The agreement also includes Vtesse obtaining the rights to the agency's IP to further develop another agent, delta-tocopherol, along with its derivatives, alone or in combination with cyclodextrin, in treating NPC and other LSD conditions, said NCATS Director Dr Christopher Austin. </p><p>Cyclodextrin and delta-tocopherol have been shown to reduce the accumulation of lipids and other macromolecules though lysosome exocytosis, a process by which materials are transported out of a cell. </p><p>Essentially, lysosomes are like trash cans for the cells, in which different substances can get stuck in them, Dr Austin explained.</p><p>Cyclodextrin and delta-tocopherol work in LSDs by emptying what is being stored up in those trash cans &ndash; "in the same way a trash can is turned upside down," he said. </p><p>Vtesse also has established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with NCATS and another agency with the National Institutes of Health, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), which currently is sponsoring a Phase I trial of cyclodextrin, Dr Austin said.</p><p>Under the CRADA, Vtesse will now be responsible for all further development of VTS-270 in LSD with the intent to seek marketing approval in the US and EU.</p><p>The CRADA gets to one of NCATS' central tenants: developing therapies that can be used to treat multiple diseases &ndash; "hitting more birds with one stone," Dr Austin told <i>Scrip</i>, noting there are about 50 different LSD conditions.</p><p>Getting cyclodextrin's development in NPC to the point of attracting investment not only involved the dedicated sweat of NIH scientists, but the unflinching drive and faith of patients and their families, along with their advocates, he said. </p><p>"This really was a team effort from the very beginning that involved patients with the disease, and that was critical to the success of this program," Dr Austin said.</p><p>Indeed, it was parents of children with NPC who pushed to get broader studies of cyclodextrin, he said.</p><p>NCATS had been developing cyclodextrin in NPC under a partnership through its Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program with J&J subsidiary Janssen, the Washington University in St Louis, Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York City and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. </p><p>The agency managed to draw interest in the cyclodextrin program through a notice in the<i> Federal Register</i>, alerting the public NIH was interested in licensing its intellectual property, and through the NCATS/TRND 12 September 2013 "R&D Day" event held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it caught the eye of executives from Boston-based Cydan, Dr Austin explained.</p><p>Had times been as hard as they were just a few years ago for the biotech industry, the cyclodextrin program likely would have ignored, he said.</p><p>"We are constantly having to take the temperature of investors and the biotech community to see how far we have to take a project to make it attractive," Dr Austin said. "Now, there's more resources out there, so some projects are attractive to companies that would not have been three or four years ago."</p><p>The Vtesse license and CRADA are not the first time a product initially investigated by NCATS scientists has grasped the attention of industry, Dr Austin pointed out, noting that last year Baxter International snagged Newton, Massachusetts-based AesRx, whose investigational sickle cell drug, Aes-103, a first-in-class, oral 5-hydroxymethylfurfural compound, was developed under a partnership with the agency (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Baxter-snags-NIH-backed-sickle-cell-drug-maker-352804" target="_new">10 July 2014</a>).</p><p>But sickle cell, a recessive disorder of the hemoglobin, has a much larger population than NPC, he said.</p><p>So the fact NCATS was able to attract venture capital to an ultra-rare disease like NPC and form a deal in which multiple LSD conditions will be targeted is a much greater achievement by the agency and a major milestone, he declared. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>White House: human capital investment vital for R&D</b></p><p>With the US federal government spending $130bn annually on research and development, President Barack Obama has ordered his administration to seek out ways to get a better return on the nation's investment, said Dr Doug Rand, assistant director for entrepreneurship at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p><p>One area the White House specifically has been looking at recently is improving the government&rsquo;s processes for developing human capital through finding better ways to transfer knowledge between the private and public sectors, Dr Rand told the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during a 9 January update on improving US lab-to-market activities.</p><p>The question the White House has been wrangling with is "how do we get more individuals with really deep private-sector expertise into the government, into the national labs, not just to go hunting for the one promising technology that they are going to pop out and form a company around in their next act, but really to deeply embed in an agency," he said.</p><p>Dr Rand noted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has had some "promising" success with pioneering programs, in which it has brought in private-sector experts to evaluate the agency's portfolio.</p><p>He pointed to the Innovation-Corps program, launched last June, as one of NIH's most recent endeavors at improving human capital. The program is aimed at teaching drug, diagnostic and device startups funded by the NIH smarter and more focused processes for commercializing their products (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-I-Corps-takes-startups-on-focused-path-to-commercialization-355648" target="_new">15 December 2014</a>).</p><p><b>CDC: Antivirals underused against nasty H3N2 flu</b></p><p>With the 2014-15 flu vaccine turning out to be a dud against the predominant virus circulating in the US, A(H3N2), the use of antivirals is critical against the disease, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned on 9 January.</p><p>But, said CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden, antivirals are being underused against the flu this season and US patients are paying the price &ndash; some with their lives.</p><p>"Antiviral treatment can mean the difference between a milder illness and a stay in the hospital or intensive care unit, or even death," Dr Frieden said during an afternoon media briefing with reporters. </p><p>If more people with flu-like symptoms, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma, renal disease or diabetes, got treated with antivirals, "we could prevent potentially tens of thousands of hospitalizations and possibly thousands of deaths," he declared.</p><p>The CDC had starting urging doctors in early December to make better use of antivirals after disclosing for the first time to the broader public the 2014-15 vaccine was not a good match against H3N2, which Dr Frieden said was a "nastier" virus than the other strains circulating in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/H3N2-flu-drift-alarm-too-late-for-vaccine-355430" target="_new">05 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-warns-severe-flu-season-urges-Tamiflu-Relenza-use-355433" target="_new">05 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-shot-less-effective-this-season-355412" target="_new">4 December 2014</a>).</p><p>There are three flu antivirals approved in the US: Roche's and Genentech's Tamiflu (oseltamivir), GlaxoSmithKline's Relenza (zanamivir) and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals' newly approved drug Rapivab (peramivir).</p><p>The drugs can reduce symptoms, shorten the duration of illness and prevent serious complications, Dr Frieden explained.</p><p>"They're the only medicines that can specifically treat influenza illness, and in the context of an H3N2 predominant season with a less effective vaccine, treatment with anti-flu drugs is even more important than usual," he said. "CDC scientists have looked very carefully at the use of influenza drugs in the clinical setting, and the conclusion is clear, they work."</p><p>But "they aren't being used nearly enough," Dr Frieden said, adding that doctors are failing to prescribe the medicines.</p><p>In fact, he said, one recent study showed that fewer than one in five high-risk outpatients who "clearly should have gotten treatment with antivirals actually did."</p><p>Part of the problem, Dr Frieden said, is prescribers are not aware of the CDC's guidance on use of antivirals.</p><p>He said another problem is some doctors hold the misconception antivirals don't work.</p><p>Consumers also may be unaware flu antivirals are available in the US, Dr Frieden added. </p><p>Doctors also fail to prescribe antivirals within the proper two-day window, therefore leaving the patient without the full benefit of the drugs, he said.</p><p>Dr Frieden urged prescribers not to wait for positive flu tests before prescribing Tamiflu or other antivirals.</p><p>In fact, he said, doing so may delay treatment.</p><p>Dr Frieden insisted doctors should not be worried about the risk of resistance in prescribing antivirals for the flu &ndash; arguing the situation is very different than the inappropriate prescribing that sometimes goes on with antibiotics, which leads to resistance.</p><p>"We have not seen the widespread emergence of resistance to Tamiflu," Dr Frieden said. "So unlike the situation where we're very concerned and we want to actually have better stewardship and conserve the antibiotics used for bacterial disease and we're working to reduce resistance, for the flu season we want to see more antivirals used."</p><p>The greater risk, he said, is progressive illness, hospitalization and death from the flu. </p><p>Dr Frieden acknowledged it will be a few weeks before the CDC knows for certain the overall effectiveness of this season's flu vaccine against the strains circulating.</p><p>Even though the 2013-14 influenza vaccine turned out to have a 61% overall efficacy against the strains circulating in the US last season, the CDC had declared that rate "solid" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-Flu-vaccines-providing-solid-protection-but-young-adults-hit-hard-350167" target="_new">21 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The CDC's influenza viral characterization data indicated that 31.6% of the influenza H3N2 viruses collected and analyzed in the US since 1 October 2014 were antigenically "like" the 2014-15 vaccine H3N2 component, or A/Texas/50/2012. But 68.4% were antigenically different, or drifted, from the H3N2 vaccine virus. </p><p>Among viruses that showed reduced titers with antiserum raised against A/Texas/50/2012, most were antigenically similar to A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 &ndash; the H3N2 virus selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. </p><p>The A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 strain is related to, but antigenically and genetically distinguishable, from the A/Texas/50/2012 vaccine virus. </p><p>The CDC admitted the A/Switzerland-like H3N2 viruses were first detected in the US in March 2014, shortly after the strains were selected for the 2014-15 vaccine, and began to increase through the spring and summer.</p><p>Advisers to the FDA are expected to meet on 4 March to discuss which strains should be selected for the 2015-16 vaccine for the US.</p><p>The epidemiology will guide what strains are ultimately selected, Dr Frieden said. </p><p>"We would expect if this variant strain of H3N2 continues, that will be in next year's vaccine," he said. </p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p>
