<p>The FDA on 4 February took steps to make it easier for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening illnesses to be treated with experimental drugs in the US in cases where there are no comparable alternatives under the agency's so-called expanded access program &ndash; commonly called compassionate use. </p><p>Regulators released a simplified form as part of a draft <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM432717.pdf" target="_new">guidance document</a>, <i>Individual Patient Expanded Access Applications: Form FDA 3926</i>, which is intended for use to request investigational drugs that are still undergoing the process of establishing their safety and effectiveness. </p><p>The FDA also unveiled its redesigned compassionate use <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ExpandedAccessCompassionateUse/default.htm" target="_new">website</a>, which includes the statutory background of the program, requirements for the individual patient access to investigational drugs, directions on how to apply for expanded access, what to expect after the submission and other information for doctors, patients and industry.</p><p>The FDA broadened and clarified its compassionate use rules in 2009.</p><p>But Dr Peter Lurie, associate FDA commissioner for public health strategy and analysis, said concerns persisted that the existing application form &ndash; which called for 26 separate types of information and seven attachments &ndash; was too complex.</p><p>In fact, he said, that older form was designed for use by drug manufacturers seeking to begin human testing, not for physicians seeking use by single patients. </p><p>The new proposed form, for which the FDA is seeking public comment, is intended to streamline the process for physicians, especially those unfamiliar with the investigational new drug application (IND) process.</p><p>"We know why patients want access to these drugs and we know how busy their treating physicians can be," Dr Lurie said in a blog posted on the FDA's website on 4 February. "So we streamlined the new draft form to be shorter and simpler for physicians to fill out." </p><p>The new form, which has yet to be finalized, requires only eight elements of information and a single attachment. </p><p>The FDA has estimated doctors will be able to complete the new form in just 45 minutes, versus the 100 hours listed on the previous form. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
