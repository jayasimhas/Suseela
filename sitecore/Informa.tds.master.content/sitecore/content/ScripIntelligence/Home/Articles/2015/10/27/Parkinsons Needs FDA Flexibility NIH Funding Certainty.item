<p>With Parkinson's affecting about six million people worldwide &ndash; with some estimates putting it as high as 10 million &ndash; and the condition becoming increasingly burdensome on health systems around the globe, "we don't have to do a lot of convincing" the disease is worthwhile to invest in and pursue for new treatments, said Todd Sherer, CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF).</p><p>"We have seen definitely in the last few years a renewed interest and renewed emphasis in Parkinson's, particularly driven by novel discoveries around some of the genetic factors that might lead" to the disease, Sherer told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He insisted researchers and industry are poised for many new discoveries in treatments and potentially a cure for Parkinson's disease, a chronic, degenerative neurological disorder.</p><p>"Now, we just have to make it happen," declared the MJFF chief, whose organization is hosting its annual Parkinson's Disease Therapeutics Conference on Nov. 3 in New York, where more than 300 academic and industry researchers and leaders are gathering to discuss the latest R&D advances.</p><p>While Sherer said "we are definitely in a better place than we were five years ago in terms of the number of companies and amount of investment coming from the private sector," he said he'd like to see more drug makers and academic researchers "jump in with two feet, instead of dipping a foot in" in Parkinson's R&D.</p><p>Nonetheless, Sherer said he was "extremely pleased" that Parkinson's is becoming more competitive, with several firms in late-stage drug development programs focused on improving symptoms.</p><p>He noted there's also several early-stage programs pursuing treatments that target alpha-synuclein, a protein that accumulates in the brain, forming clumps called Lewy bodies. </p><p>According to <i>Citeline</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, there are 33 drugs approved worldwide and more than 200 investigational products in development for Parkinson's disease &ndash; although most of them are at the preclinical stage.</p><p>"We are excited that we have a lot of potential novel therapeutics being tested in the clinic in the next couple of years," Sherer said.</p><p>One late-stage development firm is Pharma Two B Ltd., a privately held Israeli company, which recently reported positive Phase IIb pivotal study of its investigational fixed-dose combination Parkinson's drug P2B001, which combines a low dose of pramipexole with a low dose of rasagiline in a sustained-release formulation. </p><p>The 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase IIb study demonstrated overall improvement of 5.97 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) points for the P2B001 high-dose combination, leading to a significant change of 4.67 UPDRS points, compared with placebo, Pharma Two B CEO Nurit Livnah told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The results also showed there was an overall improvement of 5.14 UPDRS points in the P2B001 low-dose combination, leading to a significant change of 3.84 UPDRS units, versus placebo.</p><p>Livnah said the study, which enrolled about 150 participants at 29 sites in the US and Israel, also demonstrated a favorable safety profile for P2B001. </p><p>The firm plans to soon meet with the FDA to discuss the company's Phase III trial design. And if all goes well, Pharma Two B plans to start the study in the first quarter of next year, with results anticipated by the end of 2017 &ndash; with a potential US filing under the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tackling-Parkinsons-Pharma-Two-B-tests-FDC-in-Phase-IIb-350729" target="_new">505(b)(2) pathway</a> soon after, Livnah said.</p><p><b>Better FDA Guidance</b></p><p>While Sherer said the FDA has "done a very good job" in Parkinson's &ndash; noting the agency held a patient-focused drug development meeting devoted to the condition this past year &ndash; and has shown some flexibility, Sherer said the agency needs to produce more guidance for industry that would allow more creative mechanisms for developing disease-modifying treatments, whose clinical trial results could perhaps be generated more quickly.</p><p>Such an action, Sherer said, may help to spur more R&D investment in Parkinson's.</p><p>The FDA also could coordinate better with European and other global regulators on requirements for demonstrating disease modification in Parkinson's treatments, he said. </p><p>Sherer praised the FDA for designating Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s investigational Parkinson's disease psychosis drug Nuplazid (pimavanserin) as a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-dubs-Acadia-Parkinsons-drug-Nuplazid-breakthrough-353683" target="_new">breakthrough</a> therapy last year &ndash; calling that action a positive sign of progress at the agency for the disease.</p><p>The medicine's application is now under the agency's review with a priority status, with a decision expected by May 1, 2016.</p><p><b>Funding Uncertainty</b></p><p>One thing that's holding Parkinson's back, Sherer said, is the current unpredictability with the annual budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>"Research doesn't function well in fits and starts, particularly for some of these more ambitious projects that we would like to see done in neuroscience," he said, calling for lawmakers to ensure a longer-term funding stream for the NIH, which would allow the agency to actually do some long-term planning about the types of research it could fund.</p><p>Sherer noted that while the NIH supports a "significant amount of work in Parkinson's" &ndash; even having a strategic plan in place to tackle the disease &ndash; he said he would like to see the condition "be more explicitly worked into" President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> and Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-embraces-Obama-BRAIN-plan-341731" target="_new">BRAIN</a>) Initiative, launched in 2015 and 2013, respectively, which are being run by the NIH.</p><p>Sherer pointed out that while there's been great progress in Parkinson's research, there's still much to be learned about the disease's causes and its underlying biology if better treatments are going to be developed to actually slow the disease and more efficient mechanisms for testing those products in the clinic.</p><p>He noted there's a great need to identify better biomarkers for Parkinson's. </p><p>"We don't have great validated biomarkers for tracking the progression," Sherer said.</p><p>With it being an exciting time in Parkinson's R&D, Sherer said the MJFF's goal now is to "make sure we have all the tools in place and the infrastructure so we know how to test these compounds."</p><p><p><p><p>
