<p><p>Following the high-profile failure of its lead product in February, Celsus Therapeutics is merging with Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals in an all-stock transaction that will allow the company the ability to access cash and continue funding its other development programs. </p><p>The two small biotechs announced the merger on 13 July, but did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. Celsus security holders will own 8.32% of the company, while Volution Immuno Pharmaceutical shareholders will own the remaining 91.68%. The combined company will be called Akari Therapeutics. </p><p>Akari will pick up the development of Celsus' Coversin, a second-generation complement inhibitor that acts on complement component-C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b-9 &ndash; actors in autoimmune diseases. The drug has the potential to be a treatment for several rare diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), and Guillain Barr√© syndrome (GBS).</p><p>Celsus CEO Gus Roshwalb will remain at the helm of the new company </p><p>The drug was tested in a Phase I study in healthy patients last year and the new company intends to initiate a Phase II study in healthy subjects to determine dosing during the second half of the year. Akari hopes to initiate a compassionate use program for patients with PNH and aHUS who are resistant to Soliris (eculizumab), the only drug currently approved for the diseases. </p><p>The merger with VIP comes just months after Celsus US shares lost most of their value when its lead product, MRX-6, failed to beat placebo in a mid-stage trial of patients with atopic dermatitis. Shares of the company's stock plummeted and Celsus closed its IND with the FDA on the product. </p><p><p>
