<p>In the pharmaceutical industry, a good opportunity is generally one that provides sustainable cash flows, is worth a significant amount of money and provides barriers against competition. The asthma and COPD market is one that meets these criteria and the race is on amongst branded generic (BGx) / generic (Gx) manufacturers to enter the market, which will be worth $24.5bn by 2020 in EU5 and US. In 2014, the leading products Advair (fluticasone+salmeterol) and Symbicort (budesonide+formoterol) generated $5.9bn and $2.9bn respectively. These products have sustained commercial success despite the active molecules being off-patent. The molecule patent for Advair either expired or was revoked in the US and 5EU markets in 2010. For Symbicort, the primary patent in the 5EU expired in 2012 and in the US in 2014.</p><p><b>Setting the scene</b></p><p>The reason for sustained commercial success despite active molecule being off-patent relates to the technical composition of an orally inhaled product (OIP). The therapeutic effect of an OIP is a composite of the active molecule itself and the pattern by which the inhalation device is able to deposit the molecule into the lung. Although the active molecule is off-patent, the delivery devices for both Advair and Symbicort are on-patent and this is what prevents challengers from coming to the market. In terms of barriers to entry, this should be seen as a double-lock. The active molecule lock has been opened, but the device lock is tightly shut and will continue to be for a few more years (Advair Diskus patent expires in 2016, Symbicort Turbuhaler patents expires in 2019).</p><p><b>Overcoming the strategic barriers</b></p><p>This double-lock has not dismayed competitors; in fact it has motivated many to invest precisely for this reason. Due to the technical difficulty in overcoming the device patent lock, the market becomes very attractive for whoever is able to unlock it. The challenge then is how to overcome this device barrier. Companies such as Teva and Sandoz have decided to innovate and circumvent the device lock by producing their own devices. Essentially, they are putting the off-patent molecule into a new device and calling it a BGx product. </p><p>The process is technically very challenging compared with a generic tablet or syrup. First, investment is required to develop a device. Then clinical trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of the BGx OIP is equivalent to that of the originator product. In total, an upfront investment of up to ~$100m may be necessary to bring a BGx product to market. Despite these significant hurdles, manufacturers have shown innovation and technical competence, with Teva launching DuoResp Spiromax in Europe (BGx of Symbicort) and Sandoz launching AirFluSal Forspiro (BGx of Advair) in Europe.</p><p><b>Product launched but still more barriers?</b></p><p>Launching a BGx may sound simple, but the process is more complex than it may appear to be. A BGx product is not-substitutable for the originator brand at the pharmacy level; it has to be promoted to physicians so that they prescribe it. The challenge for manufacturers then is to build and maintain a marketing campaign as well as a sales field force. This results in greater costs, adds to the already significant upfront investment, and is by no means a straight forward process. How does one make the business viable when faced with these costs? Make sure the reimbursement price is appropriate.</p><p>Obtaining the right reimbursement price is critical. In the EU, payers are usually public bodies that decide whether to reimburse a product and the level at which it should be reimbursed. The concept of a BGx OIP is new to payers, and manufacturers must highlight the significant hurdles overcome, the innovation involved, and why the products are distinct from standard substitutable generics. Only in this way can a reimbursement price that is economically logical be obtained.</p><p><b>Negotiating the price</b></p><p>When negotiating price, the economic reality should push both manufacturers and payers to come to a price that is within a pricing corridor acceptable to both. The manufacturer knows that it cannot expect a price as high as the originator but also cannot go down to the price of a substitutable generic. The payer, if educated correctly, should understand that the manufacturer will not accept the price of a generic. The payer also knows that if reimbursement is not given then it will have to continue paying the higher price for the originator product when potentially a cheaper alternative is available. From the reimbursement price of BGx products that have launched in the EU, it is clear that in most territories BGx OIP are priced at a ~15% discount to originator products. This appears to be a sufficient compromise as economic value is gained by both sides.</p><p><b>The conclusion</b></p><p>Bringing a BGx OIP to market is a tricky and risky process, yet strategically an enticing one; the barriers that seem so difficult to overcome offer protection against additional competition. In terms of economic and societal gain, both the manufacturers and society benefit. Manufacturers benefit by obtaining a well-earned return for the risk taken and innovation shown. Society benefits as BGx OIP circumvent the device patent-block and patients pay less to breathe.</p><p><p><i>Ijlal Syed is a senior consultant with Datamonitor Healthcare Consulting, an Informa company.
