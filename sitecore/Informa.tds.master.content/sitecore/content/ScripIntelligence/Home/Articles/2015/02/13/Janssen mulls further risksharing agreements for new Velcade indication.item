<p>Janssen is considering more risk-sharing agreements as part of its market access strategy for cancer drug Velcade (bortezomib) in its newly approved mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) indication.</p><p>The European Commission gave Velcade, in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, final approval on 30 January for first-line use in mantle cell lymphoma. The CHMP had recommended the drug in December ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/CHMP-agrees-Revlimid-Tresiba-Velcade-and-Xiapex-extensions-355794" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 22 December 2014).</p><p>Janssen now intends to make the drug available in this indication across Europe as fast as possible. The company has no plans to phase its launch; timing will depend on national regulatory processes.</p><p>The company told <i>Scrip</i> that it plans to price Velcade in the MCL indication at the same level as the drug is priced for multiple myeloma, an indication for which is has been approved around 10 years. In the UK, the drug costs around &pound;3,600 for a three-week cycle. This is despite the fact that MCL is a much rarer disease, affecting around a tenth of the number of patients as multiple myeloma, or one in a hundred thousand.</p><p>Dr Thomas Stark, medical director for Janssen in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, said that Velcade had been shown to be cost-effective at its current price in multiple myeloma, and that he believed the same should be true for MCL. &quot;When we look at mantle cell lymphoma and the clinical data from the pivotal trial we are very happy because we think we have a pretty strong value proposition in the indication, and so we expect that we are able to demonstrate cost-effectiveness at the current price level also in this indication,&quot; he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>In addition, Janssen is open to alternative access models such as risk-sharing agreements, which may help the drug reach more patients. &quot;It all depends on the national situation, but it's one of the models we are exploring,&quot; said Dr Stark. Janssen already has experience with these sorts of access strategies, having set up a risk-sharing agreement with NICE in 2007 for the multiple myeloma indication ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Velcade-risk-sharing-scheme-cleared-by-NICE-in-final-appraisal-determination-36371" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 5 September 2007). Dr Stark said that there may be other markets to which this model is suited.</p><p>Janssen is beginning discussions with health technology assessment bodies, and feels confident that there will be no major challenges to overcome. The company's overall survival data in the MCL indication are not yet fully mature, which can sometimes be off-putting for HTAs, but Dr Stark said that he thinks Janssen has a robust set of endpoints including progression-free survival and overall survival data of four years so far ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASCO-2014-Velcades-eyes-first-line-mantle-cell-lymphoma-label-352130" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 3 June 2014).</p><p>However, the drug was recently delisted from England's Cancer Drugs Fund in three out of four indications, perhaps indicating that there will be hurdles to overcome ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cancer-Drugs-Fund-table-12-drugs-delisted-six-refused-entry-356128" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 January 2015).</p>
