<p>Bad Friday the 13th luck caught up with CTI BioPharma when the company's stock took a beating on 13 March after the disclosure of a few more details from its Phase III PERSIST-1 clinical trial for pacritinib in the treatment of myelofibrosis.</p><p>Seattle, Washington-based CTI jumped 6.4% to $2.82 per share of 9 March when the company, which is developing pacritinib in partnership with Baxter, said the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) inhibitor showed response rates similar to its Phase II results with a particularly strong effect in patients with low platelet counts that can't be effectively treated with JAK inhibitors, like the JAK1/2 inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib) from Incyte and Novartis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Phase-III-success-for-CTIs-pacritinib-but-second-study-crucial-357145" target="_new">10 March 2015</a>). </p><p>However, CTI fell 24.2% to $1.97 on 13 March when it revealed a 19.1% spleen response rate in the PERSIST-1 intent-to-treat (ITT) group, which appeared to be significantly lower than the 27% spleen response reported in Phase II.</p><p>But in an interview with Scrip, CTI president and CEO James Bianco insisted that the ITT group doesn't tell the best story about the Phase III study's primary endpoint, which is the percentage of patients who achieved a 35% or greater reduction in spleen size at week 24. </p><p>The ITT group included all patients enrolled in the trial at week 24, even those who weren't assessed for spleen size reduction during the 24th week. For instance, pacritinib-treated patients who were assessed at week 22 and met the primary endpoint were counted as non-responders in the ITT group. </p><p>The response rate was 19.1% for pacritinib patents in the ITT group versus 4.7% for best available therapy (BAT), excluding other JAK inhibitors (p=0.0003). However, the spleen response jumped to 23.6% for patients who received pacritinib and were scanned before or at 24 weeks of treatment versus 4.7% for BAT (p<0.0001). response="" rates="" rose="" further="" to="" 25%="" when="" considering="" only="" the="" patients="" who="" were="" evaluated="" at="" week="" 24="" in="" the="" pacritinib="" arm="" of="" the="" study="" versus="" 5.9%="" for="" bat="" (p=""></0.0001).></p><p>"We know what [the data] looks like at 36 and 48 weeks, and it looks as good or better, and we think it will look as good or better than the other JAK inhibitors," Mr Bianco said.</p><p>However, he said it's not appropriate to compare the PERSIST-1 data for pacritinib to the Phase III COMFORT clinical trials that showed spleen size reductions of 35% or greater at week 24 for 41.9% of Jakafi-treated myelofibrosis patients in COMFORT-1 and 31.9% of patients in COMFORT-2 who were treated with the Incyte and Novartis JAK inhibitor.</p><p>One major difference, he noted, is that only 8% of the myelofibrosis patients enrolled in the COMFORT program for Jakafi had mild thrombocytopenia, or low platelet counts, while about 25% of patients in CTI's PERSIST-1 study had mild to severe thrombocytopenia. </p><p>The Jakafi label says that myelofibrosis patients with the condition should be treated with a reduced dose of the approved drug or not at all, because Jakafi can lower platelet counts. </p><p>CTI will present more PERSIST-1 details, such as pacritinib's higher response rates in patients with reduced platelet counts, at a future medical conference &ndash; potentially the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting from 29 May to 2 June in Chicago.</p><p>"Baxter is extremely excited about [the data]. They're anxious to have a dialogue with the regulatory agencies," Dr Bianco said.</p><p>But before CTI and Baxter seek regulatory approvals for pacritinib, they must complete the Phase III PERSIST-2 clinical trial that pits their drug against BAT, including Jakafi. Full enrollment is expected in the summer of 2015 with data regarding spleen response at 24 weeks anticipated in late 2015 or early 2016.</p><p>"Our second trial will show that our drug is more active at its higher doses than lower doses of ruxolitinib" in myelofibrosis patients with thrombocytopenia, Dr Bianco said. </p><p>Those results will be especially important, if pacritinib performs well against Jakafi, because it will show that the CTI and Baxter drug can address patients who currently can't be treated with a JAK inhibitor. </p><p>The PERSIST-2 data also are important, because the next step in improving myelofibrosis treatment is combination therapies. Right now, it's difficult to combine multiple agents for co-administration, because of platelet-lowering or bone marrow-suppressing side effects.</p><p><p><p><p>
