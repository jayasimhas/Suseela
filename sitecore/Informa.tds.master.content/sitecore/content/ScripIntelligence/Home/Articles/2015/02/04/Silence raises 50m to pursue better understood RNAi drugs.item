<p>London, UK-based Silence Therapeutics has raised a total of &pound;38.9m ($58.2m) to fund development of its pipeline of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics. </p><p>Silence raised &pound;27.3m on 2 April via a placement of 11,371,669 new ordinary shares, followed by an additional option for &pound;12.7m which was fully subscribed by institutional investors a week later. </p><p>The company is developing a pipeline of candidates based on lead drug Atu027, which uses Silence's RNAi and patented lipid delivery systems.</p><p>Last month, Silence reported top-line results from a Phase IIa study of Atu027 in pancreatic cancer. A preliminary analysis of the open-label study indicated that subjects who were exposed to a 33% higher total dose of Atu027 had a longer duration of progression-free survival (median of 5.33 months) than patients on the lower exposure regimen (median of 1.81 months). This suggests that in this study, a dose-dependent effect was seen for Atu027. </p><p>The Phase IIa study results are "an important validation of Silence's two-component drug &ndash; a short interfering RNA (siRNA) and a delivery system," said analysts at Sagient Research's BioMedTracker. In the light of the "encouraging results" Silence will be reviewing the protocol for a planned head and neck cancer trial for Atu027. </p><h2>RNAi evolves</h2><p>A spokesperson for Silence said, "A better understanding and awareness of the potential of genetic medicine as a whole has helped" bring RNAi technology back into play after a quieter R&D period in the field.</p><p>"RNAi was seen as a very exciting breakthrough when it was first discovered and it still is ground-breaking technology. It takes time and funding to get from discovery to the market, and as no RNAi therapeutics have got to the market yet, the industry is still waiting." It will be "exiting" when the first RNAi drug is approved and the sector is making good progress now, Silence's spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>"The genome sequencing projects in the UK and US will continue to raise awareness and acceptance of the importance of genes in disease, in turn hopefully spurring increased interest in therapeutics that can potentially address these diseases," the spokesperson said. </p><p>After this latest fund raising, Silence now has around &pound;60m of firepower to invest in its technology. "Specifically we will be expanding our pre-clinical development capacity, focusing on RNA delivery, expanding the preclinical and clinical pipeline and exploring the use of mRNA delivery with gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9," Silence said. </p><p>The company highlighted that its siRNA product is one of the most tested, having been given to more than 400 people so far. "One of the real differentiators for Silence though is that we believe we are the only European listed company with the technology to switch gene expression both on and off<i>, in vivo</i>," the Silence spokesperson said.</p><p>Silence's pipeline includes siRNA candidates being tested in pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, lung indications and pulmonary hypertension. It is also partnered with Pfizer and Quark for PF-655 in diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration, as well as with Novartis and Quark for QPI-1002 for acute kidney injury. </p>
