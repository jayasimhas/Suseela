<p>Just a few days could make a big difference for your company, perhaps millions of Euros. Thanks to a ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union, some innovative products could have their market exclusivity period extended in some EU markets by a number of days or maybe weeks. This may not seem much on the surface, but it could mean a windfall for the originator company and isn't all bad news for the generics companies, explains Mike Gilbert, a partner at Marks & Clerk Solicitors. </p><p>The ruling centers around the way the Austrian Patent Office had calculated the duration of a Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) awarded to Seattle Genetics' brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris). SPCs are important because they give up to five years' extra market exclusivity to compensate companies if it takes them more than five years to win regulatory approval from the date they file their patent. Companies have to apply for SPCs in individual markets and they kick in as soon as the patent expires.</p><p>Key to calculating the term of an SPC is the marketing authorization date, which member states define in different ways. For some, including Austria, it is the date that marketing authorization is granted, and for others, it is the date that companies actually receive notification of authorization. Companies are not allowed to take steps to market their products until they receive such notification, which generally comes a few days after authorization is granted. This means the company can effectively lose a few days of additional market protection in certain countries. Seattle Genetics argued that Austria should have used the date of notification, not of authorization, in its calculations. It took its case to the Austrian courts, which referred the matter to the CJEU.</p><p>Happily for originators, the CJEU ruled that it is the date of notification that should be used in SPC calculations. A few days may not seem so important, but for big products it could mean extra sales in several EU member states worth millions of Euros before generic competition arrives, says Gilbert. In addition, uniform SPC expiry dates across Europe make risk management and financial modelling much easier for companies.</p><p>The news may not seem so good for manufacturers of biosimilars or generics as in some markets they will have to postpone launch, which could cost them a good deal of money. However, there is a silver lining. Competition to be the first generic on the market is fierce and complicated by the fact that firms have to negotiate a "patchwork" of SPC expiry dates to work with across Europe. Mistakes with the dates have been made, which can be expensive and lead to injunctions. However, the ruling gives generics manufacturers "certainty that fortress Europe has a consistent boundary for when all SPCs will come to an end," says Gilbert. </p><p>The ruling will be applicable to SPC applications being filed now and for those filed in the future. Gilbert sees no reason why the ruling shouldn't be applied retrospectively, although the court did not comment on this directly.</p><p>Gilbert advises companies to conduct a "vigilance exercise" to make sure they have the correct SPC expiry dates, and that they notify generic competitors of any changes. He also advises firms to revisit their financial modelling. "These changes could have a dramatic effect in terms of modelling and the management information that is provided to companies, especially for big products that may be blockbusters by the time the SPC kicks in."</p><p><p>
