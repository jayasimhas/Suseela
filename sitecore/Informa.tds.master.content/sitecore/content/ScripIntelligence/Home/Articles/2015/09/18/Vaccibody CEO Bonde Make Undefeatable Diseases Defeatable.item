<p> Norway-based vaccine company, Vaccibody, has recently begun the first stage of clinical trials with its immunotherapy VB10.16 for patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3). Dr. Martin Bonde, a biotech veteran who sold EpiTherapeutics ApS to Gilead Sciences Inc. earlier this year for $65m, is now its CEO. He tells <i>Scrip</i> about his new challenge to use Vaccibody's unique technology to treat CIN and make undefeatable diseases defeatable. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>You've recently been appointed as CEO of Vaccibody. What was it about Vaccibody that made you want to be part of it? </b> </p> <p> <b><i>Martin Bonde: </i></b>I would say the technology and team were the determining factors for me, and all the opportunities that lie in there. </p> <p> I spoke to people who knew about IP (intellectual property) and markets and I couldn't really punch any holes into the way Vaccibody had decided to move forwards. The other thing was I was very impressed with, were the two ladies running the R&amp;D organisation; the head of clinical, Mona Welschof and CSO, Agnete Fredriksen, who is also the founder of the company. They were very engaging and enthusiastic and clearly had a lot of knowledge and energy. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>What do you feel you bring to Vaccibody that makes you perfect for this job?</b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>I think three main things: marketing position, business development and an invested network. </p> <p> When you look at the expertise in Vaccibody, there is really strong expertise on the science side. Therefore, what I think I can contribute is to be more precise and sharp on the marketing position, meaning which indications would be the best fit moving forwards for the technology. Where do we see high unmet needs on the market place that would be appropriately fulfilled hopefully with the Vaccibody technology? </p> <p> There is also all the business development side of things, something that I have been doing for the last almost 20 years now. I have a network of interesting people to talk to in the field of oncology primarily, and also infectious diseases. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>What about Vaccibody's technology stands out?</b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>The ability of the Vaccibody vaccine to create a strong and long-lasting immune response is an outstanding feature. When you marry that to the fact that this is a DNA vaccine which can be produced very quickly, much faster than other types of vaccine, it offers some very good opportunities in terms of simply curing, or treating at least, difficult diseases. </p> <p> Interestingly, when it comes to DNA vaccines, there is a very strong targeting feature. This targeting makes sure that the Vaccibody goes to the right types of cells, thereby creating this very strong and long-lasting response. </p> <p> We combine that with the quite easy and pain free / painless jet injection methodology, which is merely a small hand-held device that I believe we can use because of the nature of the Vaccibody itself. You don't have to use electroporation, which is usually the standard [administration route] for DNA vaccines. By not using electroporation, you don't have to disturb the patient with current or needles and instead administer the vaccine needle free, through jet injection, and that seems to work, at least in preclinical models. It works very nicely in goats and primates. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>What is happening with VB10.16 right now? </b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>The idea with VB10.16 in the clinical study that we have just initiated is firstly to show that it is safe and that a number of so-called biomarkers are affected in the right direction. Of course we will look at the lesions as well. This study is looking into CIN, which is a pre-state of cervical cancer and the idea is to remove these pre-malignant lesions in the cervix. That's the aim of that study. At the same time we would like to show, for the first time in human, that the Vaccibody vaccine can do all the things we've seen it can do in the preclinical stages. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>How does your treatment compare to those in the pipeline? Inovio and Transgene are also in Phase II with their vaccines. How is your treatment different? </b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>Based on what we've seen, there's very good reason to believe that the combination of the targeting unit we have as part of a DNA vaccine and the epitope that's included in the Vaccibody, VB10.16, we will get the strong long-lasting response that will eventually remove lesions. More over from a practical point, I believe the jet injection methodology that we use is going to prove to be much more accepted by patients than electroporation, in which you would essentially be administrating a current and thrusting a needle in. I think those two things in combination, but mostly the way the Vaccibody construct is made, the way the DNA vaccine is made, has given us very strong preclinical data and hope to see this in the humans as well. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>Could you give us a brief overview of Vaccibody's history? </b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>The company was founded back in 2007 by our CSO, Agnete Fredriksen, and the basis for the work was created when she did the post-doc in designing and developing the first Vaccibody and worked from there. In 2011 the development of this first vaccine, VB10.16, was initiated and last summer the company raised NOK35m, which isn't a lot of money, but what impressed me was that Vaccibody has been able to bring a product to the clinic for around &euro;4m, which is outstanding. You don't see that in many places and of course there was also soft money and grants that went into the company but in terms of spending the investors' money, very little has been spent. </p> <p> So last summer we raised NOK35m in order for us to go to clinic and then in August 2015, we got the approval to move forward into the first clinical trial with VB10.16 and the process began. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>What motivates you personally?</b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>The fact that Vaccibody has technology which maybe best in class or could be tuned to become best in class, and see how that could fit in somewhere [to help] people who have undefeatable and unmet medical needs. That's really intriguing, to work with technology and companies who have that opportunity. </p> <p> It's of course very challenging but then again if and when you get there, sometimes you do and sometimes you don't, then it's very rewarding. </p> <p> In the case of EpiTherapeutics, I was the first employee when I started as part time CEO, and we ended up selling that to Gilead. We built up a chemistry platform on the basis of profound epigenetic insight and created a path which could be used to develop treatments for cancer patients, which was of course very rewarding. So I hope to see whether I can do something similar again or be part of a team that can change something out there. </p> <p> <b><i>Scrip: </i>What are your goals for 2016?</b> </p> <p> <b><i>MB: </i></b>First and foremost, to get a good read out from our clinical trials in the CIN 2/3 patients. A good read out means that we see it's safe and we see the biomarkers go in the right direction. Furthermore, that we also see some signs that it is effective. They are clearly our number one goals. </p> <p> Another corporate goal in 2016 is to collaborate with a bigger partner to further substantiate the value of the platform that we have. It would be great because there are so many opportunities in this platform and it would be great to get somebody with stronger financial muscle on board to work with us and to develop more products with the basis of the Vaccibody technology. Those are the most prominent goals for 2016. </p> <p>
