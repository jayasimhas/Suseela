<p><p>Merck & Co has inked another combination deal for its ultra-hot PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab); this time with Waltham, Mass.-based biotech Syndax Pharmaceuticals. The big pharma has placed significant emphasis on the success of Keytruda, which dominates the company's pipeline.</p><p>The pair announced the research collaboration on 31 March, but did not disclose financial details. The deal will combine the programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor with Syndax's oral, highly selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor entinostat in a Phase Ib/II study. </p><p>The combination therapy will be tested in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer or melanoma and the trial is expected to begin in the second half. The clinical trial will be conducted in two parts &ndash; the first part will evaluate safety, while the second part will measure efficacy of the combo.</p><p>Entinostat was one of the first and only biotech oncologics to be granted the US FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation; the regulatory agency gave the status to entinostat in combination with hormone therapy for the treatment of advanced hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer. The drug is currently in Phase III trials for the indication. </p><p>The companies believe that the two drugs could be an ideal combination &ndash; entinostat has been shown in preclinical models to enhance the anti-tumor activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda, which works by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. </p><p>Keytruda was <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">the first PD-1 inhibitor</a> approved in the US; it gained the greenlight from the FDA in September for use in patients with advanced melanoma who have already been treated with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab). While Merck won the race to get a drug to the market first, Bristol's Opdivo (nivolumab) <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">got clearance</a> shortly after in the same indication and more recently got the FDA ok for use in patients with lung cancer. Yet, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Keytruda-beats-Yervoy-and-edges-ahead-of-Opdivo-in-first-line-melanoma-357471" target="_new">recent data</a> shows Keytruda could be more effective than both Yervoy and Opdivo in first-line melanoma. </p><p>While approval in melanoma was a major milestone for the checkpoint inhibitors, lung cancer is expected to be a much better commercial opportunity for the drugs. Opdivo, having already been approved in the indication, obviously has a leg up, but Merck is expected to file for approval of Keytruda in the patient population by the middle of this year. </p><p>Merck has put in place an aggressive R&D operation surrounding Keytruda since it unveiled the drug a couple of years ago, and has placed major emphasis on the oncology treatment as the future of the company. The company currently has 70 ongoing and planned clinical trials of Keytruda, including 20 combination studies. </p><p>Like the collaboration with Syndax, Merck has been drawing up partnerships for Keytruda left and right. Analysts and scientists believe that combination therapy will be the key to achieving even greater efficacy for the checkpoint inhibitors. </p><p>Merck has a multi-drug tie-up with Pfizer, with aims of combining Keytruda with Pfizer's ALK inhibitor Xalkori (crizotinib) in ALK-positive NSCLC, with Pfizer's Inlyta (axtinib) in kidney cancer and with the other pharma's PF-05082566 in multiple tumor types. It also has an agreement with Incyte to test INCB24360 with Keytruda in NSCLC, as well as partnerships with BMS, Celgene, GlaxoSmithKline and Amgen. </p><p>Most recently, Merck signed a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Merck-and-Co-and-Eisai-team-up-for-combination-cancer-studies-357098" target="_new">research deal with Eisai</a> to test the PD-1 inhibitor with the Japanese pharma's lenvatinib (Lenvima) and eribulin (Halaven) in multiple clinical studies.</p><p>Merck isn't the only one relying on collaborations &ndash; BMS has signed several partnerships as well, including deals with Pfizer, Celgene, Incyte, Celldex and GSK.</p><p><p>
