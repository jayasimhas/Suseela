<p>With antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) doomsday scenarios coming fast and furious in recent months &ndash; with one even projecting as many as 10 million people worldwide could be sickened by "superbug" infections by 2050 &ndash; one wonders why with all the dire warnings the problem has not yet been solved and why it's been such a tough nut to crack.</p><p>The most recent warning comes from the nonprofit Consumer Reports, which has called on doctors, patients, hospitals, drug makers and government officials to work together to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. </p><p>Getting attitudes to change has been difficult, said Lisa McGiffert, director of Consumer Reports' Safe Patient Project.</p><p>Hospitals, in particular, she told <i>Scrip</i>, don't want to discuss the issue because they've been at the center of much of the spread of the superbugs, including <i>Clostridium difficile</i> &ndash; a particularly hard-to-treat pathogen.</p><p>Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-C-diff-spread-underscores-need-for-improved-antibiotic-use-356955" target="_new">February reported</a> that <i>C diff </i>was responsible for about 500,000 infections in the US each year &ndash; killing more than 29,000 Americans annually within 30 days of a diagnosis.</p><p>They said most of those infections were contracted by people while they were hospital inpatients, although the CDC researchers noted 150,000 were acquired in the community, likely at doctor or dentist offices or outpatient facilities.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Super-bug-outbreak-spotlights-need-for-potent-antibacterials-356853" target="_new">Another pathogen</a> increasingly making its way through hospitals is carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, which CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden has called a "nightmare" superbug.</p><p>In the first in a three-part series, Consumer Reports noted there are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BIO-2015-Dispatches-Enough-ideas-plans-time-for-action-on-antimicrobial-resistance-359005" target="_new">numerous efforts</a> ongoing to combat AMR, with various initiatives underway, including those launched by the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nations-back-WHO-antimicrobial-resistance-global-action-plan-358603" target="_new">World Health Organization</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Antibiotic-crisis-spurs-UK-prime-minster-to-action-352628" target="_new">European leaders</a> and the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">Obama administration</a> &ndash; the latter of which hosted a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-superbug-summit-Saving-miracle-antibiotics-358716" target="_new">superbug" summit</a> in early June.</p><p>The US consumer nonprofit group, which is known for its product testing and ratings and investigative reports, argued that educating doctors was the "real antibiotic solution" &ndash; pointing to a study in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, which found that physicians who attended a one-hour session on guidelines for treating common upper-respiratory tract infections, followed by feedback on their prescribing habits, cut their use of broad-spectrum antibiotics by nearly half. </p><p>Consumer Reports also took a swipe at drug makers in its new report &ndash; declaring that a "big reason" there's a lack of new antibiotics for fighting AMR is because the medicines are not profitable enough to incentivize manufacturers, which actually was acknowledged by some in the industry at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BIO-2015-Dispatches-Antibiotics-Uninteresting-to-investors-tough-to-find-advocates-359004" target="_new">recent forum</a> at the annual Biotechnology Industry Organization Convention in Philadelphia in June.</p><p>But the consumer group also expressed concerns Congress and the FDA were lowering the standards for antibiotic approval &ndash; pointing to some of the new incentives under the <i>Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act</i>, enacted in 2012, and proposals in the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which is expected to soon come up for a vote by the full House.</p><p>But Dr Edward Cox, director of the FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products, insisted the agency had not lowered its standards and he defended the GAIN incentives as necessary to attract manufacturers, such the additional five years of market exclusivity for drugs approved that had earlier won the qualified infectious disease products (QIDP) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-adds-3-new-qualifying-pathogens-for-GAIN-incentives-352156" target="_new">designation</a>.</p><p>So far, the FDA has granted the QIDP designation at least 76 times to 51 unique molecular entities, agency spokeswoman Lyndsay Meyer told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Dr Cox also noted that six antibacterial medicines with the QIDP designation have been approved in the US since the GAIN Act was passed: Actavis' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-antibiotic-combo-Avycaz-OKd-for-2-infections-356951" target="_new">Avycaz</a> (ceftazidime-avibactam) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/APPROVED-Duratas-Dalvance-1st-QIDP-antibiotic-OKd-for-US-market-351986" target="_new">Dalvance</a> (dalvabancin), Astellas' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Astellas-wins-FDA-nod-for-antifungal-Cresemba-357117" target="_new">Cresemba</a> (isavuconazonium sulfate), The Medicines Company's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medicines-single-dose-ABSSSI-drug-Orbactiv-OKd-353227" target="_new">Orbactiv</a> (oritavancin) and Merck's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Cubists-Sivextro-another-antibiotic-GAIN-352461" target="_new">Sivextro</a> (tedizolid) and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cubist-wins-FDA-nod-for-antibiotic-Zerbaxa-355772" target="_new">Zerbaxa</a> (ceftolozane/tazobactam).</p><p>The FDA's antibiotics chief noted there are "real scientific and economic challenges" faced by makers of antimicrobial drugs.</p><p>"You have to get something that's going to get to the right place in the body and then it's also got to be active against the bacteria while not having adverse effects on the human host," Dr Cox explained. "That's challenging."</p><p>Studying antibiotics is particularly complex, because when patients get sick with bacterial infections, "it's at unpredictable times," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"It could be late at night and they are acutely ill and need the rapid institution of an antibacterial drug, so trying to think about enrolling a patient when all of this is going on," Dr Cox said, "can be very challenging."</p><p>Indeed, bacterial infections are quite unlike other diseases, like hepatitis C, where there generally is much more time for diagnostic testing and there's likely a series of visits over potentially weeks, where the discussion of entering a clinical trial could take place, he said.</p><p>In bacterial disease, Dr Cox said, the patient generally is acutely ill and "there may be diagnostic uncertainty" about whether there are underlying co-morbidities causing the patient to decline, which makes studying antibiotics that much more difficult.</p><p><b>Work to address a great need</b></p><p>While Dr Cox noted antibiotics are a "smaller fraction of the market," the need for the medicines "is still there &ndash; and increasing. </p><p>"Patients really do need these drugs to have therapies to treat their infections effectively," Dr Cox said.</p><p>For its part, he said, the FDA has been very involved over the last several years in a series of different efforts &ndash; advisory committee meetings, workshops, talking to firms about their clinical trial designs.</p><p>And, Dr Cox added, "We've done a lot of work revising our guidance documents" &ndash; an effort he called "an important part of what we've done."</p><p>"There's been a strong effort within the revision of those guidance documents to recommend trial designs that are scientifically sound, feasible and to provide the type of information that will allow us to evaluate antibacterial drugs, recognizing there are real challenges in this area," he said.</p><p>"We've got guidance documents out there that provide quality recommendations, and that's really important for the field to have that degree of certainty, that degree of stability," Dr Cox declared. "We will continue to work to refine as needed. But I think there's stability out there with the types of designs we are looking for and the types of information that people are presenting. That is noted in some degree with the recent approvals. That represents the fact people are comfortable doing trials in those areas."</p><p>Dr Cox said the FDA also has been collaborating with groups like the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, which has been working on endpoints and trial designs for community-acquired pneumonia, skin infections and most recently for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and the Clinical Trial Transformation Initiative (CTTI) at Duke University, which has been looking at clinical trial conduct and trying to find ways to make those studies more efficient.</p><p>He noted the CTTI project is examining whether the data being collecting adds much informational value or if it could be trimmed without impacting the quality of information derived from the study to make the trial more efficient.</p><p>It also is looking at whether the best approaches are being used for informed consent, Dr Cox said.</p><p>But above all, he said, the most important thing the FDA is doing to help spur the development of new antibiotics against AMR is "talking to companies and advising them" &ndash; what Dr Cox called the agency's "core work."</p><p>"We are obviously very engaged," he said.</p><p>Dr Cox noted that many drug manufacturers are now taking the FDA' advice to seek the agency's counsel early.</p><p>"We see a fair number of companies that are interested in early discussions and we are able to meet with them and talk with them about their development programs," he said.</p><p>If issues with trial design, particularly challenging issues, arise, Dr Cox said FDA is always willing to meet with companies.</p><p>"It may take a couple of meetings, but we try to work through the challenging scientific issues so that we get to a plan or a program that will provide the technical scientific information that will allow us to evaluate their drug," he said. "That typically involves a fair bit of exchange, but I think it is a generally helpful process."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
