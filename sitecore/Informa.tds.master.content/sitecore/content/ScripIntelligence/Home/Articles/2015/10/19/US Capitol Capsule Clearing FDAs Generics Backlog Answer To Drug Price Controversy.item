<p>With the recent "chatter" about the FDA's backlog of generic drug applications &ndash; some of it triggered by Capitol Hill's concerns over recent extreme price hikes of older medicines &ndash; regulators want to set the record straight: the agency is doing just fine in its reviews of those products, and actually is ahead of schedule, contrary to some reports and popular belief, officials told an exclusive small group of reporters on Oct. 16.</p><p>Over the years, the term "backlog" has had many definitions, noted Mike Jones, a special assistant in the FDA's Office of Generic Drug Policy, who said he's "been around the block a couple times and I've heard plenty of definitions."</p><p>Historically, "backlog" meant the "pile of applications no one was touching," explained Mary Beth Clarke, director of the Office of Executive Programs at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.</p><p>During the first two decades after Congress passed the <i>Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984</i> &ndash; commonly called the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act</i> &ndash; which gave the FDA the authority to approve generic medicines, the agency typically received about 300 to 400 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) per year.</p><p>But when the law entered its third decade, there was a sudden surge in ANDA submissions &ndash; so much so that the FDA had a hard time keeping up, drawing criticism from lawmakers and consumer groups alike.</p><p>The backlog grew from about 1,300 in the middle of the last decade to nearly 3,000 in 2012.</p><p>"They were coming in so fast, it outstripped the FDA's capacity to even address them," Clarke declared.</p><p>But in crafting the legislation to establish the <i>Generic Drug User Fee Amendments</i> (GDUFA) &ndash; the law that authorized the FDA to collect user fees from industry to help provide a measurable return on investment related to the predictability of facility inspections and review timelines &ndash; members of Congress defined "backlog" as "everything that was pending," plus other ANDAs that were being worked on, Clarke said.</p><p>"The backlog is a term of art we negotiated with industry," added Keith Flanagan, director of the FDA's Office of Generic Drug Policy, who noted GDUFA actually defined the terms of the backlog as 2,866 ANDAs &ndash; the number of generic drug applications that were waiting for approval as of Oct. 1, 2012, when the law kicked in.</p><p>But the FDA, which entered the fourth year of GDUFA on Oct. 1 and started the public process in June to reauthorize the law, which expires on Sept. 30, 2017, has come under fire for not moving fast enough to clear its backlog.</p><p>Late last month, Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) sent a letter to acting FDA Commissioner Stephen Ostroff telling him to "quickly process the substantial backlog applications for generic medications in light of the recent drastic prescription drug price increases."</p><p>The lawmaker accused the FDA of having a backlog of over 3,000 ANDA applications "currently gathering dust," which he said served as a "major obstacle to a market-based competitive response to manufacturers who choose to run up prices."</p><p>Vitter specifically called out the nearly 5,500% spike by Turing Pharmaceuticals AG in the price of its toxoplasmosis medicine <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">Daraprim</a> (pyrimethamine) &ndash; a move that's triggered an investigation by the New York attorney general, who is looking into whether the firm <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">violated antitrust rules</a>.</p><p>"This is unacceptable," Vitter charged, insisting the FDA could help fix the problem of out-of-control drug costs by clearing the generic drug application backlog.</p><p>But Ted Sherwood, acting director of the FDA's Office of Regulatory Operations, emphasized the agency already has acted on more than 80% of the 2,866 ANDAs that were in the backlog when GDUFA launched, with the agency poised to reach the agreed-on 90% goal mark by the time the first round of the user fee program ends.</p><p>"So we're kind of ahead of schedule," Flanagan said. "We think we are exceeding expectations."</p><p>Sherwood said there currently are about eight ANDAs pending filing review by the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs.</p><p>As of Sept. 21 &ndash; the date for which the most recent information is available &ndash; Sherwood said there were 493 ANDAs filed, but with no review commitment, meaning the FDA had not provided any communication to the companies.</p><p>There also were 2,115 ANDAs at the FDA with at least one review communication issued, he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, there were 872 ANDAs waiting for industry to respond to the FDA's complete response, he said.</p><p>Sherwood also pointed out that there also were 276 ANDAs that had been granted a tentative approval, meaning "We've done everything we can from a review perspective &ndash; it meets the criteria of safe, effective, quality, substitutable generic product &ndash; but, and it's a big but, it can't go to market because of patent and/or exclusivity."</p><p>Nonetheless, "this is actually a great bucket" to be in, he declared.</p><p>But Sherwood also noted that with the 872 ANDAs for which the FDA is waiting for a response from industry and the 276 ANDAs with tentative approvals, about a third of the backlog is in drug makers' control.</p><p>"Good, bad or indifferent, we can't affect that outcome," he said.</p><p>Since Oct. 1, 2012, the FDA has approved 1,293 ANDAs that were submitted before the third year of GDUFA &ndash; when the goal dates actually kicked in, Sherwood said.</p><p>Of the ANDAs that received refuse-to-receive status since GDUFA launched, there were 78 that were resubmitted in year three of the program, but there were 128 that were not resubmitted, he said, noting there were 398 ANDAs that were withdrawn.</p><p>Regulators said it's too soon to know how well the FDA is doing in meeting its agreed-on goal of approving 60% of original ANDAs within 15 months from submission during the third year of GDUFA, which ended on Sept. 30.</p><p>But, Sherwood said, the best metric of that success is the fact the first ANDA approved in GDUFA year three was well ahead of schedule &ndash; Spear Pharmaceuticals' tretinoin gel 0.05% &ndash; which gained the FDA's blessing on Aug. 13. </p><p>"There will be a stark drop in review times for year three submissions, which will have goal dates for the first time," Flanagan insisted.</p><p>He noted the FDA considers "public health priorities," like first generic submissions, when it is reviewing ANDAs, so in those cases, "we are going to try to expedite those."</p><p>While Sherwood said the FDA could not specifically discuss the high price of Turing's Daraprim, which may make it unaffordable for some patients, or whether the agency would consider the situation a public health priority under which to expedite a competitor drug, he noted that "one of the values of the generics program is not just availability, but lower costs often means greater availability."</p><p>And, he said, "if it's formally defined as a drug shortage, we can also turn on this fast track."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zarxio-Rehearing-Denied-Biosimilars-Questions-Await-Next-Case-361104" target="_new">Zarxio Rehearing Denied; Biosimilars Questions Await Next Case</a></p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Oct. 16 said it won't rehear arguments in a lawsuit brought by Amgen Inc. against Sandoz Inc. involving its biosimilar Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), leaving several lingering questions about the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> &ndash;
