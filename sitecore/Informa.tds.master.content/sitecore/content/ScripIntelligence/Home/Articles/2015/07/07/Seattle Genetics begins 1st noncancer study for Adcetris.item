<p><p>Seattle Genetics has begun its first clinical trial in a non-cancer indication for the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) and the Phase II lupus study may be the first-ever human trial initiated by a biopharma company for any ADC.</p><p>Adcetris is approved in the US to treat Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The ADC is being evaluated in more than 30 clinical trials to expand the therapy's approved label. Seattle Genetics has not run a trial in indications outside of oncology prior to the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) study that was announced on 9 July.</p><p>There is an ongoing 28-patient investigator-sponsored study that involves Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in graft-versus-host disease, which may include cancer patients, but Seattle Genetics is not conducting the trial. </p><p>The company pointed out that CD30, the target for Adcetris's antibody component, is expressed on activated lymphocytes that may play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases.</p><p>"Based on a retrospective review of information collected from patients being treated with Adcetris in the US for lymphoma, we noted some patients reported clinical improvement of concomitant autoimmune diseases, including lupus," Seattle Genetics president and CEO Clay Siegall said in a statement.</p><p>The placebo-controlled Phase II lupus study will enroll 40 SLE patients in the US.</p><p><p>
