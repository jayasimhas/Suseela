<p>AstraZeneca's gout treatment lesinurad used in combination with Takeda Pharmaceutical's Uloric (febuxostat), has missed its primary endpoint at the lower 200mg dose tested in another Phase III trial. </p><p>Data from the company's CRYSTAL trial, presented at the European League Against Rheumatism Annual Congress (EULAR 2015) in Rome, showed 200mg of lesinurad in combination with febuxostat did not reach greater serum uric acid (sUA) lowering to the target for tophaceous gout of <5.0mg l="" compared="" with="" febuxostat="" alone=""></5.0mg><0.05).></0.05).></p><p>But the higher lesinurad 400mg dose in combination with febuxostat met the primary endpoint, with a significantly (p<0.0001) higher="" proportion="" of="" patients="" reaching="" the="" target="" sua=""></0.0001)></p><p>The results could be problematic for AstraZeneca as it has filed the 200mg dose of the product for market authorization in Europe and the US &ndash; and the 400mg dose of lesinurad has been associated with renal safety concerns. </p><p>AstraZeneca stressed that the 200mg dose did demonstrate greater sUA lowering at all months except at the six-month time-point for the primary endpoint (56.6% vs 46.8%; non-significant).</p><p>The lower dose version of the product also failed to meet key secondary endpoints: lesinurad 200mg in combination with febuxostat did not result in a significant difference in patients achieving a complete resolution of at least one tophus (urate crystals) by month 12.</p><p><p>Also in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AstraZenecas-Lesinurad-data-make-CLEAR-case-for-lower-dose-355084" target="_new">November 2014</a>, the drug did not significantly reduce gout flares or resolve tophi in Phase III studies CLEAR 1 and CLEAR 2. However an investigator involved in the study said at the time that long-term treatment with lesinurad would affect the secondary endpoints over time.</p><p>AstraZeneca was not immediately available to comment on its latest CRYSTAL data. But in a statement Johan Hoegstedt, global medicines leader for lesinurad, said, "While no oral agent has demonstrated a beneficial effect on flares in 12-month randomized controlled clinical trials, this analysis showed that over time &ndash; as lower sUA levels were maintained &ndash; flares decrease and tophus area reduce."</p><h2>subgroup focus?</h2><p>The Phase III miss for lesinurad 200mg aside, AstraZeneca may be able to push the product through regulators at its lower dose by focusing on a specific subset of patients with more severe cases of gout. </p><p>In the CRYSTAL study, a subgroup of patients with baseline sUA ?5.0mg/dL (those above recommended sUA treatment target for tophaceous gout) treated with lesinurad 200mg in combination with febuxostat did reach target sUA of <5.0mg l="" compared="" with="" febuxostat="" alone="" at="" month="" 6="" (44.1%="" vs="" 23.5%="" respectively;="" p=""></5.0mg></p><p>"It's important to note that CRYSTAL studied patients with gout and visible tophi, also known as tophaceous gout, which is particularly challenging to treat," stated Dr Nicola Dalbeth, Professor of Medicine at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and principal investigator of the study.</p><p>International treatment guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR recommend achieving an sUA target at a minimum of <6.0mg l="" in="" all="" gout="" patients="" and="" to=""></6.0mg><5.0mg l="" in="" gout="" patients="" with="" greater="" disease="" severity="" and="" urate="" burden,="" such="" as="" those="" with="" visible="" tophi,="" astrazeneca="" referenced,="" noting="" that="" approximately="" half="" of="" patients="" do="" not="" achieve="" recommended="" sua="" goals="" with="" the="" current="" standard="" of="" care="" of="" xois="" allopurinol="" or="" febuxostat=""></5.0mg></p><p>In the Phase III CRYSTAL study, the most common adverse events with lesinurad 200mg and 400mg in combination with febuxostat compared with febuxostat alone were nasopharyngitis, hypertension and headache. Those taking lesinurad also experienced a higher incidence of predominately reversible serum creatinine (sCr) elevations.</p><p>Lesinurad monotherapy raised renal safety concerns in the Phase III LIGHT clinical trial, which enrolled patients who cannot tolerate XO inhibitors, but the drug was expected to be more effective in combination with allopurinol and febuxostat in patients who can tolerate the standard of care. </p><p>The CRYSTAL study was conducted by Ardea Biosciences, a member of the AstraZeneca Group.</p>
