<p>The Japanese vaccines developer UMN Pharma has emerged fairly well from the first day of trading after its initial public offering on the Mothers market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closing around 3.8% above the offer price on 11 December.</p><p>In a generally challenging market, the loss-making firm ended up pricing the IPO right at the bottom end of the initial guidance range of &yen;1,300-1,600 per share, and in the event has raised &yen;4.26 billion ($51.8 million) to support its pipeline and for general corporate purposes. The shares reached &yen;1,349 by market close after trading as high as &yen;1,385. </p><p>Investors seemed attracted by the generally positive prospects for growth in the vaccines market both in Japan and elsewhere, with Nomura Japan Equity Research predicting "rapid market penetration" for UMN's lead development project, the cell cultured trivalent seasonal flu vaccine UMN-0502, following its expected domestic launch in 2015. </p><p>The Akita and Yokohama-based firm, set up in 2004 and with around 75 employees at present, had received prior funding mainly from private Japanese venture investors and some government-linked development funds. Major pre-IPO shareholders included the Japanese heavy industrial group IHI Corp, with around 8.5%, and the pharma contract manufacturing firm API Co (7.5%), which had entered into production joint venture and manufacturing agreements respectively with UMN. </p><p>The firm is expecting consolidated net income of just &yen;100 million this calendar year and says its net loss for 2012 will widen to around &yen;2 billion on higher development costs. But a just-released mid-term plan envisages revenues rising to &yen;7.8 billion in 2015, by which time the company expects to move into the black with a net profit of &yen;1.4 billion, derived from a mixture of sales, fees, royalties and contract manufacturing. </p><p>Construction of a commercial-scale production facility in Japan is scheduled for completion next March. </p><p>UMN's main technology asset is a baculovirus expression vector system that it has licensed from Protein Sciences Corp of the US for selected Asian markets. This offers faster, more efficient vaccine production and improved safety and antigen yields compared with traditional egg-based techniques. </p><p>The gene coding for the target hemagglutinin protein is cloned into a baculovirus, which is then used to infect cultured cells from the fall armyworm caterpillar. These cells then express the target protein for harvesting.</p><p>The approach has already proven attractive to Astellas, which is partnering with UMN for the development and commercialization of both UMN-0502 (ASP7374) and the H5N1 pandemic flu vaccine UMN-0501 (ASP7373) in Japan.</p><p>Both firms announced on the first day of trading that administration had been completed in a non-inferiority Phase III trial for UMN-0502, which is enrolling around 1,000 elderly volunteers and comparing the vaccine with an approved egg-derived trivalent inactivated product. </p><p>Protein Sciences has already applied for US approval of its version of the vaccine, FluBlok, while UMN-0501 is still in Phase II trials but already has orphan status in Japan. </p><p>UMN licensed South Korean rights to UMN-0501, UMN-0502 and UMN-0901 (a flu vaccine against H9N2) to Ildong Pharmaceuticals in October (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/UMN-expands-horizons-with-new-deal-for-baculovirus-flu-vaccines-336101" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 October 2012</a>), and earlier this year acquired from Finnish researchers the worldwide rights to a combined cell cultured vaccine against norovirus and rotavirus.</p><p>
