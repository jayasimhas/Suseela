<p>A House bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise had an easy time of it on 14 May meeting its first test in the legislative process, with lawmakers in the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee clearing it with no amendments by a voice vote, with little pushback.</p><p>The legislation, known as the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, which is intended to help accelerate the discovery, development and approval processes for medical products, now moves to the full committee, which is expected to consider it next week.</p><p>The bipartisan Republican and Democratic authors of the House "Cures" bill, led by Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), E&C chairman, unveiled what was the third version of the legislation on 13 May &ndash; which included some additional details.</p><p>Colorado Congresswoman Diana DeGette, who has been the Democratic lead on the effort, however, acknowledged during the markup hearing "We still have work to do," although she said "we've come so, so far." </p><p>Specifically, Representative DeGette said, "we need to address FDA resources."</p><p>While the National Institutes of Health (NIH) can find the cures for diseases with unmet needs, those products are not much good if they can't reach the marketplace and patients, and that's why ensuring the FDA has sufficient funding for its regulatory activities is so important, she argued. </p><p>But she praised the Cures bill, nonetheless, for calling for investment to advance biomedical research "to foster the future of science" &ndash; although lawmakers have yet to disclose how they will <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Source-biopharma-didnt-refuse-Cures-pay-for-no-one-asked-358307" target="_new">pay for</a> the legislation's proposed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">$10bn boost</a> for the NIH and the other measures.</p><p>The legislation, Representative DeGette said, "modernizes clinical trials, it encourages improvements in the drug and device approval process, it supports the development of new drugs and devices to address areas of unmet need and it advances the important concept of precision medicine."</p><p>Representative Joseph Pitts (Republican-Pennsylvania), chairman of the health subcommittee, noted the bill would require the FDA to establish a structured framework for meaningful incorporation of patient experience data into the regulatory decision-making process &ndash; "putting patients more directly in the center of finding treatments."</p><p>If enacted, Mr Pitts said the Cures legislation would establish a priority review for breakthrough devices and diagnostics &ndash; something advocates have said is essential to fulfilling the promise of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Precision-medicine-clarity-NIHFDA-gains-Cures-update-358418" target="_new">precision medicine</a>.</p><p>The Pennsylvania lawmaker also insisted the bill would grow "good biotechnology jobs" in the US and ensure American manufacturers "do not face needless red tape in overseas markets."</p><p>A measure that was widely lauded by lawmakers during the 14 May markup hearing was the resurrected provision that would extend by six months the exclusivity protection for marketed drugs that seek and gain new indications aimed at preventing, diagnosing or treating rare diseases or conditions.</p><p>The measure, known as the <i>Orphan Product Extensions Now Act</i>, was in the initial draft Cures bill unveiled in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">January</a>, but was yanked from the revised version released on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">29 April</a>.</p><p>But lawmakers put it back into the legislation's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-resurrects-orphan-exclusivity-Dormant-protection-dead-and-buried-358417" target="_new">third rendition</a>.</p><p>Representative Jan Schakowsky (Democrat-Illinois), however, questioned why additional exclusivity for rare disease indications was needed and whether awarding it would impede access to those medicines or lead to higher costs for some patients.</p><p>In addition, she raised concerns the additional exclusivity protection could mean higher spending costs for Medicare and Medicaid. </p><p>"We simply don't know, and that concerns me," Representative Schakowsky contended.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
