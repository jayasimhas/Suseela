<p>In the latest stage in the EU's efforts to widen the publication of clinical trial data, the European Medicines Agency has opened a public consultation on how to decide exactly what information should be available in the future clinical trials database, which will be accessible to the general public.</p><p>The agency is responsible for setting up the database, as well as a portal for sponsors to submit trial data, as required by the new clinical trials Regulation (CTR). The CTR cannot come into effect until the IT infrastructure for the database and portal has been audited and shown to work as intended.</p><p>Under the regulation's transparency provisions, all trials carried out in the EU must be registered and their details and summary results published on the database. The information that will be made public includes the design and aim of the trial, substantial modifications to the trial, the end date, and the summary results. Where a trial is included in a marketing authorization application, the clinical study report will be published once the approval procedure has been completed or the MAA withdrawn.</p><p>There will, however, be certain exceptions to publication where there is a need to protect personal data, commercially confidential information (CCI), confidential communications between member states, and the supervision of clinical trials by member states. The determination of what might be CCI depends on criteria such as the nature of the trial and whether or not the product has been approved for marketing.</p><p>The consultation document notes that the study protocol, for instance, can contain "extensive detail of a commercially confidential nature", especially where the marketing authorization has not yet been granted, or where new indications or formulations of a marketed drug are concerned. </p><p>As for the substance itself, the investigator brochure contains extensive detail of a commercially confidential nature, as does the investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD), which can include details of future trials for example, including those planned for other indications or formulations.</p><h2>Complex task</h2><p>The problem facing the regulator is how best to apply the transparency provisions of the CTR so as to ensure that the database respects these exceptions to publication and that the rules on what should and should not be published are applied fairly and systematically.</p><p>Given that the database will be dealing with some 4,000-5,000 clinical trial applications and related additional processes each year, the rules will need to operate in an automatic way and not rely on human intervention. This means that "there should be fields in the data or metadata that enable the system software to determine if and for how long a particular data element or document should not be made public", the EMA says. A manual override should be included to enable publication in "exceptional circumstances where an overriding public interest applies".</p><p>"The rules," the agency says, "need to be applied in a fair and systematic way, in accordance with established rules, and not based on repeated human judgment and intervention, which would be impossible to control and create a very large burden on authorities and on sponsors." They must be designed "in order that the system produces a consistent and predictable outcome so that those submitting data and documents and those viewing them benefit from legal certainty as to what is made public and when".</p><p>The consultation document makes a number of proposals as to which documents and data should be released and when, and asks stakeholders to say which of the proposals they feel best meets the aims of the CTR. </p><p>For Phase I-III trials, it puts forward four suggestions with regard to the publication of study-specific and product-specific documents, only one of which will be included in the final rules. For example, the documents could be made available at the time of the decision on the trial, or disclosed more readily the later the stage of product development (ie conservatively for Phase I and II, and less so for Phase III), on the grounds that the degree of commercial confidentiality diminishes during the course of drug development as more information becomes available. </p><p>It also suggests that because Phase I trials have more than the normal level of commercial sensitivity, release of information that would normally be made available at the start of and during the trial could be deferred until the summary of the trial results is published 12 months after the end of the trial (although this would not apply to pediatric studies).</p><p>Stakeholders interested in responding to the consultation are asked to send in their comments before 18 February. </p><h2>Welcome from UK regulator</h2><p>The consultation has been welcomed by regulators in the UK. Martyn Ward, head of clinical trials at the UK MHRA, said the agency supported more transparency of clinical trial data and encouraged all stakeholders to respond to the consultation. "It is important that information on clinical trials is made available to the research community, patients and the public but at the same time we must ensure that researchers in Europe are not put at a competitive disadvantage compared to other parts of the world," he declared.</p><p>Janet Wisely, chief executive of the Health Research Authority, said greater transparency was "fundamental to medical advancement, improving efficiencies and increasing public confidence" in trials, and would boost high-quality, ethical health research. She also suggested the EU might have something to learn from the UK on this front. Progress already made by the UK in terms of study registration left it "well prepared for this legislation", she said, adding: "Our simple deferral mechanism for early phase trials with issues of commercial sensitivity provides a model for Europe that creates a balance of transparency, patient safety and competitiveness for attracting these trials."</p><p>The CTR is distinct from the EMA's policy on publication of clinical trial data, which came into effect at the beginning of this month and allows the agency to proactively publish clinical study reports, including those on trials conducted outside the EU but submitted to the EMA as part of an MAA.</p>
