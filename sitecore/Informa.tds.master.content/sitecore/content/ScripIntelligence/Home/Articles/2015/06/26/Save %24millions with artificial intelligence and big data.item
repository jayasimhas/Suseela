<p>If you could find an easy way to save your company tens of millions of dollars or more, what would you do with the money? Invest in a startup company or new R&D programs? By using artificial intelligence and big data to improve spending decisions and make procurement more efficient, you too could make big savings and free up capital, so says Stefan Foryszewski, executive vice president at Tungsten Network, an invoicing and analytics company. </p><p>He says companies can save an average of 1.6% of what they spend on everything they procure, from excipients, to active ingredients, from pens to i-pads. "That may not seem like a big percentage, but when a company is spending $5-10bn year, there are substantial savings to be made," he says. The biggest saving identified for a firm are so far is $200m.</p><p>Tungsten offers an electronic invoicing service and provides companies with a network of their transactions where providers and suppliers exchange invoices. The UK-based firm has developed an application that exploits the data that the service generates and it is able to analyze what a firm is buying and what prices it is paying, potentially making procurement much more efficient. </p><p>As Mr Foryszewski explains, global companies do their procurement all over the world, for example, in Leeds, New York and Cincinnati. And often, purchasers are buying the same thing. The application allows a company to drill down into the data and find out which supplier is offering the best price and then potentially negotiate one big contract with that supplier. Alternatively, it can reveal missed opportunities for companies to negotiate fixed-price contracts with the same supplier. If a firm thinks it only buys 20 products from one supplier but in fact it buys 100, it has missed the opportunity to negotiate 80 contracts that could secure a better, more stable price.</p><p>In one instance, the application showed one pharma company that it had bought 475,000 different products over 18 months and Tungsten was able to identify $80m worth of potential savings. Identifying such savings would otherwise be unlikely. "Without a machine, it would be impossible to analyze the data from 475,000 products. You'd only be able to go for the low hanging fruit and opportunities."</p><p>The company is working on a second application with Goldsmiths University in London to take this first iteration a step further. It will mine big data available on the internet to find cheaper suppliers or alternative products. The first "deliverable" from this project should be ready within 18 months, says Mr Foryszewski. </p><p>The artificial intelligence can also offer companies a risk analysis on their suppliers. For example, if a supplier is increasingly late in sending in his invoices, it could indicate a problem. The application would then be able to mine the internet for information on the supplier, including court orders, share price dips and other red flags.</p><p>"We are thinking about pricing, and we are thinking about supply consolidation", he says.</p><p>Mr Foryszewski was unable to comment on the price of the applications as Tungsten is still working with its clients to work out what approach fits best. However, he would like to see a price that reflects the level of savings and value provided.</p><p><p><p>
