<p>OK, first the disclaimer: this isn't a defence of any firm that isn't up to scratch when it comes to quality. Fudging of data is totally unacceptable and non-adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) or Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) should attract the toughest regulatory action. </p><p>Yet, when <i>Scrip</i> dug into some of the background around the much publicized case concerning EU action against the Indian contract research organization, GVK Biosciences, what emerged were some unusual facts and perhaps a few unanswered questions. </p><p>Clearly none of it gives GVK a completely clean chit, but it seemingly isn't all that black and white either. There are some grays and these may probably explain why the Indian government took the unprecedented step of deferring trade talks with the EU over the issue. GVK has been in the eye of a storm after the French Agency on medicinal products (ANSM) detected data manipulations of electrocardiograms (ECGs) following an inspection in 2014.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GVK-India-Row-Stalled-EU-Trade-Talks-And-Vendetta-Claims-359801" target="_new">The Government of India</a> previously said it was disappointed and concerned by the EU's action in imposing a legally binding ban on the sale of around 700 pharma products clinically tested by GVK Biosciences, Hyderabad. </p><p>India's commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman was recently reported in the local media as saying that India wanted "answers" on the GVK issue before it revived negotiations for a free trade agreement with the EU.</p><p>The EU confirmed in July the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EU-confirms-suspension-of-700-products-hit-by-Indian-CRO-issues-359668" target="_new">suspension</a> of the products linked to the GVK issue starting from Aug. 21. </p><h2>Need for Speed</h2><p>First, to what seems to be really speedy regulatory action. The ANSM conducted an inspection at GVK Hyderabad from May 19-23, 2014. A draft inspection report was issued on July 2, 2014, to which GVK Bio responded on July 18 (a Friday).Typically such responses tend to be elaborate and possibly run into several dozens of pages, but that didn't seem to stop the ANSM from coming out with its final report just after the same weekend on July 21. GVK's request for additional time to respond to the inspection report was apparently turned down.</p><p>Data manipulation concerns probably expedited the regulator's action but the promptness, at least from a layman's point of view, appears unusual. The ANSM's own draft report acknowledged that ECGs are "not pivotal" in the determination of bioequivalence and the regulators have themselves acknowledged no real safety concern around the products linked to the flawed GVK studies. </p><p><i>Scrip</i> contacted the ANSM with specific queries on the case, including on the seemingly unusual speed and whether it believed that GVK may have been playing for time but the French agency only provided a copy of the European Commission's decision of July 16 that confirmed the suspension of products linked to the GVK studies.</p><h2>Cardiologists</h2><p>At the crux of the GVK issue is the French agency's detection of "data manipulations" of ECGs in each of the nine trials it inspected. The ANSM suspected that ECG print-outs from one volunteer were duplicated and used for other volunteers. These manipulations cast doubts on the authenticity of all other clinical records of these nine clinical trials and hence these were considered by the ANSM as not compliant with GCP and unreliable to support marketing authorisation applications (MAAs). The ANSM also noted that the "systematic" nature of the ECG data manipulations, the extended period of time during which they took place, and the number of staff members involved highlighted critical deficiencies in the quality system in place at GVK Bio's clinic in Hyderabad.</p><p>GVK, in its defence, has denied tampering with the ECGs and claimed that it was not possible unequivocally to conclude that the ECGs had been duplicated as the agency had concluded. The CRO provided opinion from a number of cardiologists including Drs Johann Christopher (India), Robert Kleiman (US) and Daniel Mauch (Germany). For example, Kleiman, who reviewed several pairs of ECGs, claimed that one pair was "definitely recorded from different individuals" and noted, among other things, that the anterior R wave patterns were also different. </p><p>Mauch's report noted that while certain candidate pairs showed some similarity, based on all evaluated characteristics of the investigated ECGs it is "equally inappropriate" to claim that these ECGs are from the same person.</p><p>While it's unclear why the ANSM rejected GVK's submissions outright, the Indian firm was apparently also denied an opportunity to meet with French cardiologists involved in the case. </p><p>ANSM did not comment on whether it had more reasons or perhaps evidence to back its conclusion on the ECGs, while dismissing the opinion of several other experts.</p><h2>Joint Inspections</h2><p>Interestingly, during the same period of the ANSM May 2014 inspection, the UK's MHRA also inspected two studies at the GVK Hyderabad site. The MHRA's GCP inspection statement dated Sep. 2014 &ndash; while noting that a "critical deficiency" relating to data integrity had been identified by the ANSM from the review of studies selected by the French agency &ndash; stated that no critical findings had been identified during its inspection.</p><p>Moreover, another subsequent joint inspection doesn't seem to have red flagged any data manipulation concerns. A surprise joint inspection by the ANSM, Netherlands and the FDA in September-October 2014 of the same facility did not apparently detect data falsification issues for 11 studies between 2011 and 2013, though the Dutch and US regulators could not immediately be reached for specific comment.</p><p>Similarly, a 2012 joint inspection by the FDA, ANSM, Austria and the WHO, apparently triggered by a whistle-blower, also did not find data integrity issues. The ANSM then apparently went on to monitor 17 more studies and held that no documented evidence was found to either "support or dismiss" certain allegations made in an anonymous e-mail received by regulatory agencies. However, it said that the manipulations described were found to be "technically feasible" and further went on to add that a recommendation will be made to assessors to review MAA dossiers containing GVK data with utmost vigilance for potentially suspicious trends, patterns or similarities.</p><p>ANSM again did not comment on whether its 2014 actions build on its previous observations, following the 2012 joint audit, though it's probably unreasonable to assume that the other regulators were less vigilant.</p>
