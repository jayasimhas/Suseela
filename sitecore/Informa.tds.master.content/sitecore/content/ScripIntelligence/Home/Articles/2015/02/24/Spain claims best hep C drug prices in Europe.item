<p>Spanish authorities are to cap spending on new hepatitis C treatments at &euro;727m over three years, says the health ministry. In addition, the pricing commission has authorized the funding of three new therapies: Gilead's Harvoni (sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir) and Abbvie's Viekira (ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir) and Exviera (dasabuvir). However, reimbursement comes with strings attached as the Spanish health minister claims to have secured the best prices in Europe.</p><p>The news comes as part of the health ministry's strategic plan for combatting hepatitis C, newly announced on 26 February. That plan was finally revealed after heavy pressure from political opponents, patients and the medical community to grant hepatitis access to the new, highly effective, but very costly hepatitis C treatments (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Hepatitis-C-treatment-gets-political-in-Spain-356342" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>According to the plan, the new antivirals are an important weapon in the battle against hepatitis C and all patients with a fibrosis grade of F2, F3 and F4 will receive treatment. So too will patients on the transplant list, patients who have not responded to triple treatment with first generation protease inhibitors, patients with extrahepatic manifestations that are clinically relevant as well as patients who are at high risk of transmitting the disease and fertile women who wish to become pregnant. According to figures gathered by the autonomous regions, some 52,000 patients out of a total of 95,500 that have been diagnosed will receive treatment. </p><p>In order to finance "the whole therapeutic arsenal of new antivirals available", the ministry has been negotiating with the companies behind the drugs. Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Janssen's (simeprevir) were approved for funding last year, but according to patient activists, few patients were accessing the drugs. On 23 February, the interministerial commission for medicine prices approved the financing of Harvoni, Viekira and Exviera (the latter products used together). </p><p>Thanks to the negotiations, price volume agreements are in place and a risk sharing scheme means that authorities will only pay the cost of 12 weeks of treatment, even, for example, if a patient needs 24 weeks of treatment. In addition the total spend on the drugs will not exceed &euro;727m over the next three years. This money should be made available so that health services in Spain's 17 autonomous regions can make the appropriate treatment available within three weeks. More could become available as the health minister Alfonso Alonso says he is working with the treasury to provide more funding guarantees for the regions. </p><p>Mr Alonso claims that Spain is committed to securing the lowest antiviral prices in Europe, and should another country secure a better price, this will be reflected in the Spanish price.</p><p>The patient group <i>Plataforma de Afectados por Hepatitis C </i>has welcomed the government's plan, but is sceptical that the government will fulfil its promises.</p><p>
