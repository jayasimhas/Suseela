<p>Canada's private pharmaceutical market is a big and growing opportunity for companies, but taking a piece of the pie is not as easy as it used to be, says Arvind Mani, director of market access and policy research at PDCI Market Access (PDCI), a Canadian pricing and reimbursement consultancy. Private insurers are starting to worry about cost containment and according to PDCI, product listing agreements could become a prerequisite for companies selling expensive specialty drugs. In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, Mani explained what companies need to know about these agreements to get ahead.</p><p>Canada was the world's 10th biggest pharmaceutical market in 2014. The private sector generated nearly 60% of drug spending, or $CDN16.7bn. Private insurers took $CDN10.3bn, with the rest generated by out-of-pocket spending. But insurers are no longer the "free ride" for companies that they used to be, says Mani. Traditionally they have been reluctant to apply the kind of cost savings seen in the public sector, but they are now starting to voice concerns about the cost of some drugs. Specialty drugs account for 2% of claims, but 26% of drug spending, according to the 2014 Drug Trend Report from Express Scripts, Canada's second biggest PBM (pharmacy benefit manager, which adjudicates claims). One big insurer, Manulife, says it is concerned about the increasing number of high priced drugs entering the market, and it wants to start a debate about whether "more expensive drugs generate sufficient additional health outcomes to justify the higher cost". It cites as an example Amgen's anti-cholesterol PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha (evolocumab), which it says can cost up to $CDN7,300 per patient per year. "That's 80 times the cost of the generic version of the cholesterol drug Crestor. When you consider that about 40% of all Canadians between the ages of 40 and 59 have unhealthy levels of cholesterol, the scope of the financial impact grows," it says. </p><p>One way insurers are taking on big prices is with product listing agreements. Manulife looks set to roll some out &ndash; it recently announced its DrugWatch program, under which it will place very expensive drugs "on watch" and gauge their value using information made public by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), Canada's HTA body. It will then "work with companies" to find the best possible price. The program signals a dramatic shift ahead in the way private insurers operate, says Mani. "If you are a specialty drug maker the world is going to be just a bit more challenging in Canada. If you are non-specialty it is status quo for time being." However, he adds that private insurers are also addressing the chronic diseases that affect drug spending and productivity, which may open the door to new collaborations on disease management.</p><p>Previously these agreements were largely limited to the public sector, and were negotiated between companies and the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA), Canada's key public reimbursement body. However, PDCI's <a href="http://www.pdci.ca/resources/publications/" target="_new">Private Payer PLA Survey</a>, available at no cost, and to which 19 companies and 8 payers responded, suggests that 2015 has so far been a big year for these agreements. Mani believes that the agreements will only become more important in the near future.</p><p>There are two types of agreement: non-outcomes based deals and outcomes based deals. The former include volume agreements, price rebates and caps on expenditure, while the latter depend on some sort of clinical measure and are similar to the risk sharing deals or coverage with evidence development deals seen in Europe. Companies responding to the survey flagged up two outcomes based deals, which PDCI found surprising, says Mani. These certainly won't be the norm, he predicts. In the short-term, or over the next two or three years, the bulk of deals are likely to be non-outcomes focused. This is because private insurers, aside from the three biggest providers, lack the systems to keep track of the outcomes that outcomes-based deals inevitably require. "From a payer perspective, the simpler, the better, they don't want to put a lot of systems in place. If you look at the agreements in the public sector, they are simply a rebate cheque that the manufacturers provide to the drug plans on a quarterly basis." However, it isn't clear what might happen over the longer term, especially where specialty drugs are concerned. As Mani points out, all payers will want to ensure that some measures are in place to show the product has a meaningful impact. </p><h2>How to strike the best deal</h2><p>So how can companies prepare for the deals? According to Mani, many will already have experience through negotiating deals with public payers in Europe and private insurers in the US. However, he warns that insurers are likely to come up to speed very quickly when they see potential in the agreements.</p><p>Because a deal will likely lead to lower end prices further down the line, Mani advises companies to make sure they win the best possible entry price, which is regulated by the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), Canada's patented drug pricing regulatory body. In the past this was the price that private insurers generally paid while the public payers negotiated it down. However, these deals mean that private insurers will also regard it as a starting price, particularly for specialty drugs. </p><p>Firms should also be prepared that the final price may not remain confidential. In the public sector, both government and companies remain tight lipped and are bound by confidentiality agreements. However, in the private sector there are more stakeholders, including pharmacy benefit managers and consultants, involved in talks, which means that it is harder to make sure everybody keeps quiet, especially if there are potential conflicts of interest. In addition, there may be a need for more transparency in the private sector to ensure that the insurer passes on the savings to the patient. </p><p>Although the bulk of PLAs will likely be negotiated for costly specialty drugs, Mani says other drugs stand to benefit too. They could help firms secure a competitive advantage over rivals by negotiating preferential sequencing in the treatment pathway. </p><p>Mani also advises companies to tailor their approaches according to the insurer. For example, smaller carriers don't have the capacity to negotiate more complex deals. Meanwhile, the three biggest insurers, which account for 60% of the market, have much more expertise and impact. </p><p>It is also likely the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, the industry trade group, will continue to push for a single national price for each drug, and for closer ties with both the provincial pCPA and the federal PMPRB. "If or when those alliances are established, the Canadian reimbursement landscape will become a lot more interesting for all new products," says Mani.</p><p>
