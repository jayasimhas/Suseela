<p><p>Venture capital investment has picked up, having dropped off in 2009 with much of the traditional venture funding drying up or moving on, but with that recovery, the shape of VC investments has shifted dramatically. </p><p>Capital raised by private companies in 2014 was $7.3bn, up 28% from the year prior, according to E&Y's recently released Beyond Borders report. </p><p>While the increase is clearly a positive, big pharma executives on a 18 June panel at the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) meeting in Philadelphia noted that VCs are now funding biotechs to be sold, instead of investing in the creation of companies. </p><p>"It's a business model change. If you look at Atlas Ventures, Third Rock, it's not company formation, it's about build-to-buy, finding a company with a tech platform that has a single asset that can move to proof of concept quickly," said Horizon Pharma CEO Timothy Walbert. "They are built so companies can come in and buy it in a much more efficient fashion. The business model has evolved."</p><p>Corporate VCs started taking a more prominent role in the wake of the global economic downturn in late 2008/early 2009. This move has led to a new era in venture funding with a much more collaborative effort between traditional venture investors and corporate venture funding from big pharma.</p><p>"Recently we've seen funding models that mitigate the risk," AbbVie Head of Ventures and Early Collaborations David Donabedian said. </p><p>This sort of model has begun to take hold throughout the industry. The most recent example of these collaborative efforts was announced earlier this week when GlaxoSmithKline and Avalon Ventures revealed the second slate of biotechs that they are seeding. The partnership began in 2013 and promised to fund 10 biotechs with a total of $500m dollars &ndash; each getting seed funding of $10m plus R&D support. </p><p>"What we've seen this year is US venture dollars exceeding previous levels and part of that is, for the VCs that stuck with it and evolved, they've been able to put more money back into that early innovation," Mr Donabedian noted. </p><p>"There is a shared vision that we want to make patients' lives better. We're a strategic investor and invest in the areas that AbbVie is most interested, but there is this shared mindset," the AbbVie exec added. </p><p>Historically, venture investors seeded a company with an exit in mind, but typically hoped for an initial public offering or for assets to be acquired by a big pharma partner. Now, as IPOs become less of an exit and more of another financing point, VCs are making it easier for big pharmas to acquire an entire company by making sure biotechs don't have any baggage (i.e. other drugs) that the buyer might not be interested in. </p><p>"It's a fundamental change with capital availability," agreed Patrick Verheyen, global head of Janssen business development. "VCs are getting much more asset centric," the Johnson & Johnson exec said. "They&rsquo;re building companies around an asset with the focus of getting those assets to clinical proof of concept. The mindset of collaboration is different. Five years ago, big pharmas would approach VCs, and they were much more buyers and sellers. Now you see much more intense collaboration."</p><p>This level of collaboration has changed the way companies and assets are developed. Biotechs (and the VCs who create them) are becoming much more focused on regulatory, development and commercialization pathways long before the company has even been seeded or the asset brought to the clinic. Now, the members of the panel noted, VCs are working with potential big pharma partners early in the lifecycle of biotechs to determine the proper endpoints, the proper patient populations and where drugs will fit in the continuum of care. </p><p>"It's being talked about much earlier, what is the paradigm for patient care. That's the mindset we all have to have and we are seeing that much more in biotech," Mr Donabedian said. </p><p><i>[Editor's note: Our daily BIO 2015 Dispatches draw on the combined forces of "The Pink Sheet" and Scrip Intelligence staff, reporting from the Philadelphia meeting.]</i></p><p>
