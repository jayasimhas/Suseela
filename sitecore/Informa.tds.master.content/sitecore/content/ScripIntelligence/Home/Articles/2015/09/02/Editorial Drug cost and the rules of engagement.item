<p>As I write, European Parliamentarians are limbering up for a debate on access to medicines in the EU. The Greens/European Free Alliance are arguing that it is a scandal not only that some patients cannot afford life-saving medicines because of their "astronomical prices", but also that the European Commission and EU governments are failing to act by "tackling the issue of monopolies and abuse of market position". This viewpoint is expected to set the tone for a debate in which the pharma industry is the villain.</p><p>Today's debate is a reprise of one that took place in Strasbourg last September. Then, there were calls from MEPs for shorter patents, price caps and compulsory licensing of Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), as well as accusations of monopoly abuse, greed and profiteering by pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>It is an irony that the current poster-child for excessive drug pricing by the pharma industry is Sovaldi, a product that even the UK's notorious health technology assessment body NICE has decided is a cost effective treatment. </p><p>Those arguing that this product could and should be made available for &euro;100 per course, versus the &euro;41,000 or more that it costs in major EU countries, are failing to recognize the rules of engagement under which Sovaldi was delivered to patients, doctors and healthcare payers. Developing a new drug takes much time, expertise and money, and in recognition of that the pharma industry has been granted patent exclusivity rights so that it can recoup its costs and continue to innovate. </p><p>Pricing negotiation is fair enough, but throwing the rule book right out of the window and looting pharma for its assets is not a sustainable solution. </p><p>MEP's misplaced demands for generic drugs, for example in the case of Sovaldi, suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the system, agreed upon by governments and industry, whereby companies can charge significantly more than the cost of goods for a period, after which the field opens for generic competition. Generics have their part to play and the innovative pharmaceutical industry has conceded that. But if societies want the search for new and better treatments to continue &ndash; and let's face it there's a great deal of unmet medical need &ndash; then they cannot wrench new medicines away from R&D-based industry for pennies. </p><p>
