<p>The US vaccines firm Inviragen has started off the new year on the right foot by meeting one of the main goals for its cell cultured Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine: to partner the program with a local manufacturer in an endemic region. </p><p>A new agreement gives the state-owned Vietnamese vaccines producer VABIOTECH (The Company for Vaccine and Biological Production No 1) exclusive development and commercialization rights to Inviragen's cell-based production technology for the vaccine in Cambodia and Myanmar (Burma) as well as Vietnam, in return for undisclosed milestone payments. </p><p>In addition to the new income for the privately held Fort Collins, Colorado-based company, the deal is significant in that it clears the way to the wider distribution in the three countries of a potentially lower cost alternative to current animal-derived vaccines for the mosquito-borne Flavivirus infection.</p><p>Such live attenuated JE vaccines (which target genotype III of the virus) have already been administered to more than 300 million children across Asia, but Inviragen says its one-shot, cloned viral seed reconstruction of this standard product improves manufacturing consistency, safety and purity by reducing process contaminants, excipients and preservatives, and "can be manufactured at significantly reduced cost for the JE endemic regions of Asia." </p><p>VABIOTECH, a semi-independent company operating under Vietnam's ministry of health, already manufactures an inactivated JE vaccine derived from infected mouse brains using technology transferred from Japan's Biken Institute, for use in adults and children over 12 months old. </p><p>The enterprise said that Inviragen's cell culture techniques would now be incorporated into its JE vaccine line, which has so far been provided mainly to Vietnam's national expanded program of immunization, but did not indicate the likely impact on product costs.</p><p>JE is endemic in Southeast Asia and while only one out of 250 infected people develop full-blown encephalitis (acute brain inflammation), the World Health Organization estimates that there are around 68,000 severe clinical cases annually in Asia, resulting in 10,000-15,000 deaths a year. Lasting neurological damage occurs in around 30% of all severe infections and mortality rates are higher in children.</p><p>Inviragen's own live attenuated JE vaccine is also moving towards the clinic, although the firm's in-house clinical pipeline is led by a vaccine for dengue fever that is now in Phase II trials.</p><p>VABIOTECH also manufactures vaccines for hepatitis A and B (the latter using technology licensed from South Korea's Green Cross Corp) and an oral product for cholera, along with associated diagnostic kits, and is also working on an H5N1 flu vaccine. Annual revenues at the operation are around $5 million. </p><p>Other firms working on inactivated cell cultured vaccines for JE include India's Biological E, which launched its product JEEV for use in adults and children in India last September. This makes use of cell culture manufacturing technology licensed from Intercell. </p><p>
