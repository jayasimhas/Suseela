<p>As its acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline's oncology portfolio draws nearer to closing, Novartis is essentially paying Array BioPharma to take over development and commercialization of the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib (LGX818) just one month after the Swiss big pharma gave back its rights to Array's MEK inhibitor binimetinib under attractive terms. </p><p>Array closed up 40.8% at $7.11 per share on 23 January after the Boulder, Colorado-based company announced the encorafenib agreement, but both of Array's transactions with Novartis can't close until Novartis and GSK complete their deal during the first half of 2015. And considering the clinical trial funding that Novartis will provide to support development of encorafenib and binimetinib, the company will pay a lot to pass the Phase III drug candidates to Array so that antitrust regulators will approve the acquisition of most of GSK's oncology assets for up to $16bn (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">22 April 2014</a>). </p><p>Array will give Novartis what the biotech company described as a "de minimis" upfront fee for global rights to encorafenib, but the company will make no other milestone or royalty payments even though Novartis will continue to finance late-stage studies. </p><p>The only major condition of the deal, besides completion of the Novartis and GSK transaction, is a European Commission (EC) requirement that Array find a suitably experienced partner to commercialize encorafenib and binimetinib in the EU &ndash; a requirement added to the deal to address EC competition concerns. If the company can't find a partner on its own within an undisclosed amount of time, a trustee will seek out a European collaborator on Array's behalf.</p><p><b>Competitive field</b></p><p>The favorable financial terms substantially reduce Array's risk as it takes on a BRAF inhibitor and retains full rights to a MEK inhibitor at a time when each drug will compete with two commercial products. </p><p>Novartis, once it closes the GSK deal, will own the approved BRAF inhibitor Tafinlar (dabrafenib) and the approved MEK inhibitor Mekinist (trametinib). The two drugs already are approved in combination with each other in the US to treat BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced melanoma, but EU approval is pending submission of additional data (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Mekinist-approved-in-Europe-but-commercial-success-uncertain-352696" target="_new">8 July 2014</a>).</p><p>GSK is in close competition with Roche to treat skin cancer with both a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-and-GSK-in-MEKBRAF-melanoma-combo-face-off-354192" target="_new">29 September 2014</a>). Roche markets the approved BRAF inhibitor Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and with partner Exelixis the company is seeking FDA approval for the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib in combination with Zelboraf for the treatment of BRAF V600-mutated advanced melanoma (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/RocheGenentech-seek-FDA-nod-for-cobimetinibZelboraf-in-melanoma-355669" target="_new">15 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Encorafenib is under investigation in 11 clinical trials, including the Phase III COLUMBUS trial testing the BRAF inhibitor in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of BRAF-positive melanoma. </p><p>Array CEO Ron Squarer said during the company's 23 January conference call with investors and analysts that "we believe there may be important differences between the Array-Novartis MEK/BRAF combo and other existing approved or soon-to-be-approved combinations in the area of tolerability."</p><p>Array and Novartis previously reported data from a Phase I clinical trial that showed none of the fevers or photosensitivity previously associated with BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations and a low incidence of rash. The Phase I trial also showed evidence that the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib (formerly MEK162) may mitigate on-target side effects seen with single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy, such as cutaneous toxicities, myalgia and arthralgia.</p><p>The two drugs together also may be more effective than the Array MEK inhibitor selumetinib, which is being developed by AstraZeneca, in the treatment of melanoma (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASCO-Array-slips-on-MEK-data-debt-sale-343716" target="_new">4 June 2013</a>).</p><p>Whether encorafenib-plus-binimetinib turns out to be a more effective BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination than the GSK and Roche drugs remains to be seen, but Mr Squarer said Array's conference call, "we do see differentiation on tolerability being important. And the reason is because the duration of effect on our BRAF/MEK combo has been quite substantial, certainly over nine months and even approaching potentially a year. And to have a regimen that is easier to live with and to live well with, we think, will be critical."</p><p>Tolerability will be especially important if the two drugs are to be tested in combination with immunotherapies or other agents, he noted. </p><p>Novartis previously targeted new drug application (NDA) and marketing authorization application (MAA) submissions to the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2016 for the encorafenib and binimetinib combination based on the Phase III COLUMBUS results in melanoma.</p><p>Novartis also targeted regulatory submissions for binimetinib during the first half of 2016 in the treatment of NRAS-mutant melanoma and later in 2016 for the treatment of low-grade serious ovarian cancer. Between the MEK inhibitor and BRAF inhibitor there are 35 clinical trials under way for encorafenib and binimetinib as single agents and in combination.</p><p><b>Deal terms</b></p><p>Like the binimetinib deal, under which Novartis will pay for the COLUMBUS clinical trial in BRAF-mutant melanoma and the Phase III NEMO and MILO trials in NRAS-mutant melanoma and ovarian cancer (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-pays-85m-to-shed-Array-and-other-recent-brush-offs-355423" target="_new">4 December 2014</a>), the company will continue to fund ongoing studies for encorafenib even after global rights for the drug shift to Array. </p><p>Novartis will conduct and fund COLUMBUS through 30 June 2016 or until completion of the first visit for the last patient enrolled, whichever comes first. After Array assumes responsibility for the trial, Novartis will reimburse Array for out-of-pocket costs and 50% of Array's associated full-time employee costs. Similar terms are in place for all of Novartis's other ongoing clinical trials for encorafenib.</p><p>Novartis also will provide transitional regulatory, clinical development and manufacturing services for encorafenib and give all intellectual property for the BRAF inhibitor to Array. The company also will supply encorafenib for clinical and commercial uses for 30 months after the transaction with Array closes, and Array will have access to other Novartis compounds that are being evaluated or that will be tested in combination with encorafenib.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
