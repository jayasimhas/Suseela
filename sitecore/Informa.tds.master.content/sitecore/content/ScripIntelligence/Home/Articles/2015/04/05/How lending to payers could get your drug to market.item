<p>Debt financing agreements, often coupled with performance guarantees and added services, could be the way to convince budget-conscious payers to pay out for your expensive drug, according to Soeren Mattke, senior scientist at the Rand Corporation, a research organization that develops public policy solutions.</p><p>Everyone knows that pharma is bringing to market more costly drugs that promise new treatment paradigms, but what few companies fully understand is how best to convince payers that they can afford the budget impact. Dr Mattke spoke to <i>Scrip</i> about the possibilities of lending payers the funds upfront, ahead of his presentation at the Eyeforpharma Market Access and Pricing Excellence conference in June.</p><h2>The problem</h2><p>The high-cost treatments reaching the market so far have mainly served small patient populations, for example patients with rare diseases. A big price tag has therefore been easier for payers to swallow as the overall costs have not been so great. However, expensive breakthrough treatments are now starting to reach bigger patient populations. Gilead's breakthrough hepatitis C drug costs $80,000 in the US, $66,000 in Germany and $59,000 in the UK, and such figures soon add up to big outgoings for healthcare providers given the volume of patients. As Dr Mattke points out, the problem is likely to get worse as new drugs for chronic diseases hit the market. The new wave of PCSK9 inhibitors for lowering cholesterol, for example, are likely to command a high price, he points out.</p><p>"These are very effective drugs, payers don't argue that the prices are not justified, or that the drugs don't offer value for money &ndash; they do pass the conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds. But the conditions are common and the prices will be high and that will create short-term budget constraints," said Dr Mattke.</p><h2>The remedy</h2><p>The solution, he believes, could be debt financing agreements that spread payment over a number of years as the drug's value materializes. Such supplier financing agreements are common in other industries such as manufacturing, where manufacturers buy machinery on credit from a supplier and pay the debt back over time as that machine helps the company become more productive, Dr Mattke points out.</p><p>These deals would be an effective way forward for financing high-cost drugs and could help payers overcome short term cash flow problems and budget constraints. For example, according to Dr Mattke, a developing country wanting to tackle dengue fever with an upcoming and potentially expensive vaccine (offerings from Sanofi and Takeda are likely to hit the market from this year onwards) would have to vaccinate the bulk of its population as soon as possible for optimum protection. This could prove too expensive as it would require a big initial financial outlay and the country may instead choose only to vaccinate 10% of the population each year, which would be less effective. </p><p>The alternative, according to Dr Mattke, is that the company lends the money to the government in some form of debt instrument with the sum paid back with interest over a period of years. "This is affordable in the short run ... It is credit &ndash; they are not giving it away for free."</p><p>The debt instruments could be structured in a number of ways: </p><ul><li>as a bond, that would see the manufacturer receive only interest payments until maturity, when a balloon payment would be paid out; </li><li>as fixed monthly instalments that tail off, like a mortgage; </li><li>or as a credit line with agreed milestone payments. </li></ul><p>There could obviously be some risk to the company, and that would be reflected in the interest rates, says Dr Mattke. </p><p>And to minimize the risk for payers of a debt burden that fails to yield good outcomes, the agreement could incorporate a risk sharing or performance guarantee element. These could set targets on the product's real world effectiveness and impact on outcomes. </p><p>Such performance guarantees need not be a turn off to payers, which have complained that older models of risk sharing or pay for performance deals have failed. They have come unstuck because they have centered around monitoring individual patients on a case-by-case basis, obliging payers to produce the right "paper trail of evidence" for manufacturers. As Dr Mattke explains, it is difficult to encourage patients to stick to the follow-up procedures, like regular CAT scans, as patients may move, or fail to turn up to appointments. However, performance guarantees linked to the finance deals would instead track a sample of patients to calculate a population level effectiveness of the drug. This is much more achievable, argues Dr Mattke. He adds that the burden of proof does not necessarily have to fall on the payer. </p><p>And aside from assuring value for money, the performance guarantees will also appeal to payers because they may encourage manufacturers to tackle poor compliance. This problem often contributes to poor real world outcomes that are worse than those seen in trials. Traditionally, industry left the problem of compliance to other stakeholders, but this will change if poor health outcomes affect their returns. </p><p>Companies may therefore choose to offer solutions to track compliance, like smart phone apps that record whether a patient has taken their medication, or lids that send out signals when they are opened. "If you have an idea the patient isn't taking the pill as prescribed, you can figure out what the issues might be, like side effects, or distrust in the drug. Then you can do something about it, but you can only do something if you know there is a problem. At the moment no one is asking or looking, so we can't do much about it," says Dr Mattke. </p><p>These deals may offer solutions to some problems, but they will not be a quick win for companies. The financial details of an agreement will be complex. "You have to figure out the trajectory over which the drug generates value, the time frame and the shape of the repayment curve so you align the structuring of the borrowing arrangement with the way the savings accrue. You need statistical modelling to show how savings will come back to a payer and then structure the finance arrangement accordingly," says Dr Mattke.</p><p>The performance guarantees add another layer of complexity as companies will need to show a projected differential showing what happens to patients with the drug and without it. This requires expertise in disease trajectories and statistical modelling. "The deals won't be easy to set up, and it will only worth it if for a reasonably common disease and a relatively expensive drug."</p><p>
