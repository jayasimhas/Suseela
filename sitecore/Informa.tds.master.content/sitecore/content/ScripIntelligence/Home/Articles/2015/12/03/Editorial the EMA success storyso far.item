<p>Readers may have noticed that this month we have published a series of articles on the theme of "The EMA at 20". They culminated on 18 March in the publication of an exclusive supplement by <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> and its sister publication <i>Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i> to mark the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency. </p><p>The supplement is available in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EXCLUSIVE-EMA-20th-anniversary-supplement-357355" target="_new">PDF format</a> on www.scripintelligence.com, and brings together all of the interviews, overviews and contributed features in our series. </p><p>These articles encompass the voices of key players past and present, both within the EMA and representing those who interact with it (including industry, the FDA and patient groups). Reading them, one is led to dwell upon the great strides that have been made in medicines regulation over the past two decades: the once seemingly insurmountable hurdles overcome, the swathes of terra incognita mapped, the bridges built between stakeholders in different countries and with often apparently divergent interests; the changing (and challenging) nature of new therapies coming through the pipelines. The EMA has been at the heart of these changes.</p><p>The pharma industry is often frustrated with the assessment processes it must negotiate, and on a day to day basis it is easy to focus on those frustrations, on the things that don't work, on the pressing need for simplification, greater harmonisation, clarity, and so on. But stepping back and taking the long view, there is much to appreciate. From that perspective it is apparent that the EMA, while perhaps not perfect, is on a path that over the past 20 years has led broadly to major benefits for all stakeholders and promises further improvements ahead. We can expect to see greater patient involvement in assessment processes, an onward push towards flexibility (for example, through increased adaptive licensing) and greater common understanding and information sharing between the agency and industry, patients, healthcare providers, HTAs and other regulators.</p><p>The date of our special supplement coincided with an anniversary celebration event held by the EMA in London, entitled "Science, Medicines, Health: Patients at the heart of future innovation". A celebration, then, but also a chance to probe how the EMA must adapt for the future. </p><p>Happy anniversary, EMA. Onwards and upwards.</p>
