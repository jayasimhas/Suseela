<p>The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved the country's first biosimilar monoclonal antibody &ndash; Hospira's Inflectra (infliximab), a version of Johnson & Johnson's Remicade. </p><p>Hospira said the approval "paves the way for the federal government to reduce the cost of some of the most expensive medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)," noting that Remicade cost the PBS more than A$100m ($73m) last year. </p><p>Inflectra has been registered for all of Remicade's indications: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. As in the EU, where Inflectra is now available in 26 countries, the gastro-intestinal (GI) indications for Inflectra were approved based on data extrapolation. </p><p>"Registration of Inflectra by the TGA shows that they support the fundamental principles of data extrapolation which allows patients and healthcare professionals to access the full suite of indications," said Wayne Lee, Hospira's associate director of medical affairs. "This is an important development for patients, prescribers and payers," he declared.</p><p>By contrast the health authorities in Canada, where it was approved in 2014 and launched earlier this year, did not approve the GI uses because of "differences between Inflectra and the reference product that could have an impact on the clinical safety and efficacy of these products in these indications."</p><p>The Australian government is taking numerous steps to increase the use of biosimilars, which it says could produce PBS savings of around A$880m over the coming five years. The PBS Access and Sustainability Package, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Australian-medicines-access-package-includes-biosimilar-substitution-price-cuts-358612" target="_new">announced</a> in May this year, includes the possibility for pharmacists to substitute biosimilars for the prescribed drug, as well as an A$20m biosimilars awareness campaign. </p><p>"Biosimilars increase access to medicines and we look forward to working with the government and prescribers to ensure the full benefits of biosimilars are realised in Australia," Mr Lee said.</p><p>As of May this year, nine biosimilars were authorized for marketing in Australia, the most recent being Lilly's Basaglar (insulin glargine) in November 2014, according to the Generics and Biosimilars Initiative (GABI).</p>
