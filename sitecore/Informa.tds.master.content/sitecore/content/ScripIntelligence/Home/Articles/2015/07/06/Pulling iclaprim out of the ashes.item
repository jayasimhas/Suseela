<p>Seven years ago, the antibiotic iclaprim looked dead in the water. Seven months ago, Motif Bio was barely a blip on the biotech radar. But seven years is a long time in the antibiotic space, and seven months is a long time in biotech. Things are looking very different for both iclaprim and Motif. <i>Scrip</i> met with CEO Graham Lumsden, formerly of Merck & Co, and chairman Richard Morgan, CEO of majority shareholder Amphion Innovations, to get the details.</p><p><b>'perfect storm'</b></p><p>Iclaprim, a synthetic diaminopyrimidine, has shown bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of pathogens including multidrug-resistant bacteria. It was discovered by Roche and licensed to Arpida, which took the antibiotic through to an NDA filing with the US FDA and an MAA submission in Europe in 2008. Then disaster struck. The FDA declined to approve iclaprim and Arpida was forced to withdraw the MAA. The company went bankrupt in 2009. </p><p>"Iclaprim ran into a 'perfect storm' at the FDA," Mr Lumsden explained. The US regulatory authority was dealing with significant controversy regarding research fraud following the Ketek (telithromycin) antibiotic scandal over potential liver toxicity, which had resulted in Ketek's approved uses being sharply curtailed.</p><p>The agency requested more data on iclaprim and three other new antibiotics that it was evaluating around that time. "Two of those four went on to be approved last year, and the fourth &ndash; being developed by Paratek &ndash; is about six months ahead of us," noted Mr Lumsden.</p><p>Arpida sold the asset in 2009 to a company called Acino, "which had no plans to develop it, it was picked up for commercial purposes." In 2014, Arpida's old management team (including the CEO and CSO) under the name Nuprim &ndash; sensing the time was right to resuscitate iclaprim &ndash; negotiated with Acino to retrieve the product, and began the search for a partner. Motif signed an agreement with Nuprim at the end of December 2014 which resulted in Motif acquiring exclusive rights to Nuprim's iclaprim assets, and around 600kg of iclaprim API.</p><p>In the meantime, iclaprim's patents were abandoned, "but this doesn't concern us," claimed Mr Lumsden. "They would have expired soon with all the time that's elapsed. Also, with the US GAIN (Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now) Act, all novel antibiotics get 10 years of exclusivity following approval. We have started the process of getting QIDP (Qualified Infectious Disease Product) designated."</p><p>A condition of the deal was that Motif become a publicly-listed company, which it did at the start of April. Mid-April saw the FDA agree on a proposed Phase III program for iclaprim, which Motif plans to start in the second half of this year. </p><h2>what's new?</h2><p>So what went so wrong for Arpida seven years ago and why is Motif so confident that it can avoid the same pitfalls? "The regulatory environment is much more supportive for antibiotics now," said Mr Lumsden. "At that time, there was less urgency around new effective antibiotics. It's completely different now. Also, in retrospect, Arpida stretched itself by comparing iclaprim to linezolid in Phase III. Phase II trials had compared it to vancomycin. Iclaprim did perform well but Arpida got itself embroiled in a non-inferiority discussion, and then one of the two Phase III trials did not meet the lower confidence limit. The limit had actually been lowered after the trial was completed. It met the original limit. It then went in front of the [FDA's] advisory committee and the decision went against iclaprim."</p><p>The program Motif has agreed with the FDA will involve two separate trials of around 600 patients each in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) where iclaprim will be compared with vancomycin. These will take around 18 months to complete. Motif is also planning a separate follow up trial in HAPB. Arpida had conducted a small Phase II trial in this indication in which iclaprim performed better than vancomycin.</p><p>The trials will have co-primary endpoints that will serve to satisfy both FDA and EMA requirements, explained Mr Lumsden. The FDA wants to see the size of lesion shrinkage at 48 hours, while the EMA will look for clinical test of cure proof. "The FDA's requirements suit us, as iclaprim has been shown to work very quickly," noted Mr Morgan. Meanwhile, the clinical test of cure endpoint was the same as that used by Arpida in the earlier positive trials.</p><p>There are other variances between Arpida and Motif's iclaprim Phase III program but Mr Lumsden declined to comment on them. </p><p>"Another piece of good news is that the FDA confirmed in April that we can use the safety data from the 991 patients in the earlier Arpida trial," he added.</p><h2>funding</h2><p>"The FDA rejection was a big turn off for investors and the IPO wasn't easy. But as the news flow comes out, the share price is responding," said company chairman Mr Morgan. Motif listed its shares at 20p and its initial market cap was around &pound;13m. Its share price has since more than doubled and closed at 64p on 9 June. </p><p>The challenge now for Motif's management is to secure funding for the Phase III program.</p><p>"We have several options," said Mr Lumsden. "We are reaching out to potential pharma partners; we may be able to secure grants &ndash; we're in talks with the Wellcome Trust in the UK and NIH/NIAID/BARDA in the US; if the share price keeps climbing we could even go back to the markets. There are also debt providers that are keen to talk to us. It might end up being a combination of all of these."</p><p>If all goes well, Motif believes iclaprim could be on the market within three years. While commercializing the product itself is feasible, with all the M&A in the antibiotic space of late, being acquired is a sensible consideration. "Durata got acquired by Actavis, Cubist by Merck & Co&#8230;so big pharma are coming back in. Some are willing to talk now, others want to wait for the Phase III data. We have plenty of options."</p>
