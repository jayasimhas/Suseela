<p>The UK reaps higher government spending on health R&D than many of its European peers; yet speedy access to the new, innovative medicines developed is still an issue in the region according to a new government report. </p><p>The UK government has released its <i>Life Science Competitiveness Indicators</i> report, which is intended to give a broad understanding of the UK sector, and how it compares internationally. The report looks at indicators such as government life science investment, exports of pharmaceutical products, employment figures for pharmaceutical manufacturing, life science academic numbers, private equity investment and share of global life science IPOs. </p><p>However in its research for 2015, at the request of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, the report also looked at the uptake of new medicines approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which depicted poor results for the UK. </p><p>The report &ndash; which noted that the UK receives more government funding for heath R&D than the likes of Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain &ndash; also found that uptake of new medicines in Britain was only 11% of the average of other developed countries after one year, less than a third of the average after two years, and still only half the average after four years. </p><p>Alison Clough, the ABPI's executive director of commercial UK said these numbers highlighted that access to new medicines in the UK "remains a major issue".</p><p>Ms Clough said that the results showed that slow access to new medicines "is a disadvantage to the country as a whole, impacting our global competitiveness."</p><p>The UK government is in the midst of a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/A-step-in-the-right-direction-UK-reviews-innovation-access-357240" target="_new">review</a> looking at how to speed up and improve the assessment of innovative new drugs. </p><p>The Innovative Medicines and Medtech Review is a flagship project for the new life sciences minister George Freeman. It is examining three areas of potential reform: regulation (how to speed up the assessment of innovative therapies, for example); reimbursement (how to adapt health economic assessment systems to reflect technological advances in genomics, precision medicine and informatics, while reducing time spent and risk in the traditional R&D model, and pioneering new models of reimbursement for innovation); and uptake (how the NHS can support and drive medical innovation).</p><p>Reform of the system though has been slow and must be able to balance with the complexity of the NHS &ndash; a state-funded system bound by strict budgetary constraints.</p><h2>industry opinion on UK assessments</h2><p>Particularly, new therapies for various cancers have struggled the under current technology assessment system to gain swift access to patients in the UK through the NHS, because of very high costs not considered viable for the service by assessor, NICE. </p><p>In a recent interview Celgene's UK general manger Wim Souverijns told <i>Scrip</i>: "Fundamentally, I think value for money is the right approach - we do it in our daily lives all the time. I don't think this should be any different for drugs, but how you achieve this is important. When it comes to cancer drugs HTAs have a hard time getting a grip on how they work."</p><p>He added, "It is my hope that in the current review in the UK, there will be a greater understanding and measures built into the system to allow for more flexibility with cancer drugs. One of the existing reasons that companies and NICE clash is because drug makers come with smaller trial sets and there is uncertainty because of these smaller, focused trials."</p><p>Mr Souverijns hopes that a balance can be struck to maintain NICE's expectations amidst the changing format of clinical testing. "Commission through evaluation could be a good middle ground between what we want &ndash; earlier access &ndash; and the concerns around uncertainty," he noted.</p>
