<p>Novartis AG has named Dr. James E. Bradner president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) and a member of the company's executive committee &ndash; effective March 1, 2016. Bradner will replace Dr. Mark C. Fishman, who is retiring after 13-years leading Novartis's discovery and early clinical development efforts.</p><p>"Mark has done an outstanding job leading NIBR, and he will be missed," said CEO Joe Jimenez. He added that Fishman "redefined research at Novartis [by] recruiting top scientists and clinicians from around the world and by putting patient need and disciplined science at the center of our strategy."</p><p>To be based at NIBR's global headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, newcomer Bradner is currently a physician-scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. He will join Novartis in January 2016 to work alongside Fishman and the NIBR leadership team to ensure a "smooth transition," Novartis said. Bradner, a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Chicago Medical School, did his residency in medicine at the Brigham & Women's Hospital and fellowship in medical oncology and hematology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where he has been on the faculty since 2005.</p>
