<p>Johnson & Johnson Inc.'s subsidiary Janssen Biotech Inc. and its partner Genmab AS were the latest beneficiaries of the FDA's swift acting Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, which approved the firms' multiple myeloma drug Darzalex (daratumumab) well ahead of its March 9, 2016 expected goal date and just two months after the FDA accepted the medicines biologics license application (BLA).</p><p>The companies pointed out that Darzalex, which is administered as an intravenous infusion, is the first human anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody approved anywhere in the world to treat multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer that is expected to be diagnosed in about 27,000 Americans this year, with more than 11,200 of those dying, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>CD38 is a surface protein that is expressed by most, if not all, multiple myeloma cells, Janssen explained.</p><p>Darazalex is believed to induce tumor cell death through multiple immune-mediated mechanisms of action, in addition to apoptosis, in which a series of molecular steps in a cell lead to its death, the firm said.</p><p>The drug, which gained the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GenmabJanssen-MM-drug-daratumumab-wins-breakthrough-status-342741" target="_new">breakthrough</a> therapy designation in 2013 &ndash; a status intended to expedite the R&D and regulatory processes &ndash; was cleared by the FDA under its accelerated approval program to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), or who are double-refractory to a PI and IMiD.</p><p>When the FDA accepted Janssen's BLA in September, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the chances of Darzalex gaining the agency's nod at 85%, which was 3% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Janssen acknowledged that continued approval of Darazalex in the multiple myeloma indication may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. </p><p>The company noted that Darzalex is administered more frequently at the start of treatment to achieve optimal response, with patients receiving one infusion per week for the first two months. </p><p>In months three to six, patients receive Darzalex every two weeks. And then after month six, patients receive the drug once per month.</p><p><b>Pricing</b></p><p>Janssen has priced Darzalex at $5,850 per infusion.</p><p>For the first full year &ndash; a total of 23 doses &ndash; the average monthly wholesale acquisition cost is $11,212, or about 134,550 per year, the company said.</p><p>In the second year &ndash; and any year thereafter &ndash; patients would receive a total of 13 doses for a monthly cost of $6,337, or about $76,050, the firm said.</p><p>Janssen said that once a patient is past the first two months, the monthly cost of the drug during the bi-weekly administration phase is comparable to other leading relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatments. And beyond month six, the monthly cost of Darzalex is about half that of other leading relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treatments, the company said.</p><p>The J&J unit also pointed out the dosage was based on patients' weight &ndash; using average patient weight of 176lbs &ndash; so cost would for each patient would vary.</p><p>But the company emphasized its prices do not reflect the actual amount a payer will pay due to price negotiations.</p><p>"We are working to explore innovative contracting options," Janssen said. It also said it has a "wide variety" of patient assistance approaches available for patients who are prescribed Darzalex to ensure they can obtain the drug.</p><p>Janssen said it has a comprehensive access support program for patients, including a cost support program for eligible "commercial" patients, who may receive co-pay support where they pay no more than $10 per infusion &ndash; paying $5 each for the first eight infusions and $10 thereafter &ndash; which is subject to annual maximum benefit of $15,000 per calendar year, with patients responsible for any remaining out-of-pocket costs above that amount.</p><p>The company noted the co-pay support program is not valid for patients enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid.</p><p>Janssen also said that private foundations may provide support to Darzalex patients who qualify with co-pays, transportation and other treatment-related expenses. </p><p>Walter Capone, president and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, said his organization's clinical network, the Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium (MMRC), has worked with Janssen to initiate an expanded access program (EAP).</p><p>As part of that support, he said MMRC worked with its member institutions to identify and open EAP sites across the US &ndash; helping to streamline processes to ensure patients have access to Darzalex.</p><p>The MMRC also has helped initiate a trial of Darzalex in patients with "smoldering" multiple myeloma, Capone said.</p><p><b>Competition</b></p><p>Darzalex will be entering the market well ahead of other new multiple myeloma drugs, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s and AbbVie Inc.'s elotuzumab, which they plan to market as Empliciti, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.'s ixazomib.</p><p>For now, Darzalex is expected to compete with Amgen Inc.'s Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and Celgene Corp.'s Pomalyst (pomalidomide).</p><p><b>Efficacy And Safety</b></p><p>The safety and efficacy of Darzalex were demonstrated in two open-label studies. </p><p>In Janssen's pivotal open-label Phase II MMY2002 study, which also goes by the moniker SIRIUS, demonstrated that treatment with single-agent Darzalex resulted in an overall response rate of 29.2% in patients who received a median of five prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.</p><p>Stringent complete response was reported in 2.8% of patients, very good partial response was reported in 9.4% of patients, while partial response was reported in 17% of patients.</p><p>For responders, the median duration of response was 7.4 months. </p><p>At baseline, 97% of patients were refractory to their last line of therapy, 95% were refractory to both a PI and an immunomodulatory agent, and 77% were refractory to alkylating agents.</p><p>In another study of 42 participants receiving Darzalex, 36% had a complete or partial reduction in their tumor burden.</p><p>The most common adverse effects of Darzalex were infusion-related reactions, fatigue, nausea, back pain, fever and cough. </p><p>Darzalex also may result in low levels of white or red blood cells and blood platelets.</p><p>The FDA noted that blood banks should be informed that patients are receiving Darzalex because the drug may interfere with certain tests, such as antibody screening, for patients who need a blood transfusion. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
