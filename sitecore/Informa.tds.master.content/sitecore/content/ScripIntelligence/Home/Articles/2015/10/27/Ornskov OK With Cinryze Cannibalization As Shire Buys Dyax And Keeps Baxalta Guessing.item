<p>Shire PLC is to acquire Dyax Corp. for $37.30 in cash per Dyax share, valuing the US biotech at around $5.9bn upfront. Dyax's promising hereditary angioedema (HAE) treatment DX-2930 could generate annual global sales "of up to $2.0bn" if approved for the prevention of type 1 and type 2 HAE, according to Shire. It is likely some of this revenue would come from "cannibalizing" Shire's current successful HAE treatment Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]), but this doesn't concern CEO Flemming Ornskov. </p><p>"Even with this transaction, we will continue to have the financial firepower to pursue other value-added strategic acquisitions, including Baxalta," added Ornskov. However, "The coming days will be focused on Dyax."</p><p>Jefferies analysts said they did not believe the acquisition of Dyax "has any direct implications for Shire's proposed combination with Baxalta as this would be an all equity transaction, versus the debt funded cash purchase of Dyax."</p><p>However, Bernstein analysts noted that while Shire had explicitly highlighted its continued interest in the Baxalta deal "this [latest news] clearly deemphasizes the deal in our minds," they said.</p><p>As recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Says-Investors-More-Favorable-Now-To-Baxalta-Bid-361219" target="_new">as its third-quarter earnings announcement</a> saw Shire was touting the benefits of a merger with Baxalta. Its latest offer valued the Baxter spin-out at around $30bn but it was swiftly turned down.</p><p>Shire currently markets Cinryze for the prophylaxis of HAE and Firazyr for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. These products had 2014 sales of $503m and $364m, respectively. "We forecast 2015E $647m and $446m, for c.$1.1bn combined representing 18% of product sales," noted Jefferies analysts. Dyax markets Kalbitor for acute HAE "with 2015E $71m US sales."</p><p>Dyax is developing DX-2930, a Phase III-ready, long-acting injectable monoclonal antibody for HAE prophylaxis targeting plasma kallikrein (pKal) with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dyax-surges-on-surprise-results-for-HAE-drug-357631" target="_new">proof-of-concept Phase Ib efficacy data</a> released earlier this year. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Dyaxs-missing-no-effect-dose-357680" target="_new">Not everyone was convinced</a> that Dyax would have a smooth onward journey through the development process, but despite these concerns, DX-2930 has received fast track, breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designations by the FDA and has also received orphan drug status in the EU. Shire says it expects DX-2930 to enter Phase III by year-end 2015. </p><p>The acquisition could be worth an additional $646m to Dyax shareholders through a non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) that will pay $4.00 if DX-2930 is approved in HAE by Dec. 31, 2019.</p><p>Speaking on the media call accompanying the news announcement, Shire's chief financial officer Jeffrey Poulton elaborated on where the $2bn in revenue DX-2930 could generate (if approved) would come from. </p><p><b>$2bn potential revenue?</b></p><p>"We think there are three primary sources," he explained. "The first is from market expansion, driven by increasing diagnosis and treatment rates." According to Shire, 30-40% of HAE sufferers in the US are undiagnosed, and that percentage is higher outside the US. The second source of potential revenue is from patients that are "currently on acute or on demand therapies," of which there are four marketed products in the US, including Firazyr (icatibant injection), which is a Shire product. "We think that DX-2930, given its convenience and potential for improved efficacy, would take some business from the acute therapies. The benefit for us from switching a Firazyr patient to this product is that the Firazyr IP (intellectual property) expires in 2020 [while] the IP on DX-2930 extends beyond 2030." </p><p>The third source of the potential $2bn in revenue is the prophylaxis therapies in the market such as Cinryze, the market leader. "We do think DX-2930 would cannibalize portions of patients that are on other prophylactic therapies but from a Shire perspective, if that switch were to occur, we would see that as beneficial from a financial perspective as we expect the gross margin on DX-2930 to be substantially higher than that for Cinryze due to lower anticipated costs of goods sold for DX-2930," said Poulton.</p><p>The major difference is between Cinryze and DX-2930 is convenience, with Cinryze being a twice weekly IV product, while DX-2930 is administered via a subcutaneous injection.</p><p>CEO Ornskov noted that Shire is pursuing Cinryze in other potential indications, "so we think there is ample room for both '2930 if approved and for Cinryze. Shire's overarching principle even if it means some cannibalization &ndash; which is manageable &ndash; is to bring the best product to market and we think that '2930 is in that category." </p><p>According to Ornskov, the deal offers "other potential upside opportunities, including Dyax's early-stage pipeline." In addition to DX-2930, Dyax has early-stage, preclinical, antibody pipeline programs, including exploration of DX-2930 for diabetic macular edema; DX-2507, an anti-FcRN for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, and DX-4012, an anti-factor Xlla antibody for thrombosis.</p><p>Ornskov is confident that Shire's M&A expertise will enable rapid and effective integration following the closing, "as demonstrated by the success of our NPS and ViroPharma acquisitions." Cinryze was brought in through the acquisition of ViroPharma at the start of 2014. </p><p>The proposed transaction is expected to enhance Shire's long-term top and bottom line growth profile, and is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings in 2016 and 2017, and accretive in 2018 and beyond, assuming US approval of DX-2930 in 2018.</p><p>Related to the transaction, Shire anticipates that it will realize operating synergies of $50m starting in 2017 and growing to at least $100m in 2019.</p><p><b>Financing</b></p><p>Shire has secured a $5.6bn fully underwritten term loan bank facility, which, in addition to the amount undrawn under its $2.1 billion revolving credit facility, is available to finance the transaction. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency.</p><p>
