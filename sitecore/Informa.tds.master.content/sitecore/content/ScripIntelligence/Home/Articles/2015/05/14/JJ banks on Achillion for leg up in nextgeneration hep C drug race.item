<p>Achillion has ended speculation (some of it self-generated) that it is fending off potential acquisitors from within the hepatitis C space by signing a significant collaboration with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen unit. J&J will be hoping that the deal catapults it to the front of the pack in the development of ultra-short-duration, pan-genotypic hepatitis C treatments.</p><p>The deal pools hepatitis C assets from both companies, with Janssen responsible for all subsequent development and commercialization. Achillion will receive up to $900m in milestones and double-digit royalties, in addition to a separate $225m equity investment from J&J's venture arm, Johnson & Johnson Innovation. </p><p>The companies' goal is to develop short-duration, pan-genotypic, oral regimens that will enter the market in 2018 and compete with front runners in the hepatitis C space that already have all-oral regimens, such as Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co.</p><p>Achillion's share price has taken a beating on the news, down by around 15%, "likely partly because of prior expectations of a straight takeout of the company, much the same as Idenix's acquisition by Merck," noted analysts from William Blair. </p><p>"Instead of the $20 takeout [that] 'bulls' were looking for, Achillion is guaranteed to exist as a milestone/royalty company for another several years, with the only remaining proprietary program in the preclinical stages," remarked analysts from RW Baird. "While it's hard to get enthusiastic about a backend-loaded hepatitis C deal with the fourth most relevant player in the space, we think there is a scenario where J&J can emerge with the only regimen better than Gilead's."</p><p>Under the agreement, Achillion is contributing its NS5A inhibitor ACH-3102, its 'nuc' ACH-3422, and protease inhibitor sovaprevir. Janssen will contribute the marketed protease inhibitor Olysio, AL-335 &ndash; a nuc that was obtained through its 2014 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Reading-between-the-lines-of-JandJs-1.75bn-Alios-buy-354222" target="_new">acquisition of Alios BioPharma</a>, and other compounds.</p><p>"In our opinion, it was ACH-3102, the very differentiated NS5A inhibitor, that drove the deal," said the William Blair analysts. "We note that the obvious weakest link in Janssen's portfolio is the lack of a good NS5A inhibitor."</p><p>The companies will now seek to develop a triple combination containing an NS5A inhibitor, a protease inhibitor, and a nuc, aimed at a cure with an ultra-short six-week treatment duration. A study could be initiated as early as later in 2015. As a long as one of the components of the regimen originated at Achillion, it is eligible for the royalties.</p><p>Baird analysts believe the impetus behind the deal "may be driven by J&J taking a shot at a regimen that could be better than Gilead's, as opposed to AbbVie and Merck who seem to be pursuing a 'close enough' strategy." However, success is dependent on J&J's nuc, Alios' AL-335, "putting up safety/activity data on par with sofosbuvir, which could mean AL-335 plus ACH-3102 could be a short (6-8 week), pan-genotypic regimen. A lackluster AL-335 likely means J&J is fourth to market with an undifferentiated combination."</p><p>Credit Suisse analysts acknowledge that the Achillion alliance is a positive for J&J and a potential headwind for other players in the space, most notably AbbVie and Merck, as another strong player enters a highly competitive market. "From a J&J perspective, collaborating with Achillion increases the probability that [it] will return to being an important player in the HCV space in the 2018 timeframe, even as next-generation regimens from Merck, Gilead and AbbVie enter the market in the coming years."</p><p>If J&J/Achillion manage to get a pan-genotypic, once-daily, six-week regimen on to the market in the 2018 timeframe, "we feel it is reasonable to assume this regimen will represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity given we expect the global HCV market to still be a ~$15bn market at that time," added Credit Suisse. "The launch of Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb's regimens (as well as Gilead and AbbVie's next-generation regimens) prior to 2018 will impact market share and pricing dynamics."</p><p>Prior to the J&J announcement, the latest acquisition rumor surrounding Achillion linked it with Gilead. While unlikely, there would have been a minor rationale, explains Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock.</p><p>"The NS5A inhibitor component of Harvoni is ledispavir, and there are now better NS5A inhibitors out there, such as Achillion's ACH-3102. But Gilead is already in Phase III testing with a potential ledispavir replacement, GS-5816, which may allow it to expand into the remaining genotypes."</p><p>AbbVie has so far been managing without a late-stage nuc in its arsenal. However, it's collaboration with Enanta Pharmaceuticals gives it access to a preclinical stage nuc candidate.</p>
