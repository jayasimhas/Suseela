<p>The I-SPY trials in breast cancer broke new ground in drug trials by creating a model for testing multiple medicines at the same time through a public-private partnership that enabled collaboration for mutual benefit among different stakeholders, including companies that are usually pitted against each other in competition. Now, a new initiative from Europe's Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) hopes to do something similar in the notoriously difficult field of Alzheimer's disease drug development.</p><p>The EPAD (the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia) initiative has been launched as a collaborative research project that aims to get past some of the key hurdles that have meant that drug development in this field has yielded such disappointing results to date. </p><p>Current therapies are limited in their scope to affect the disease and no new active substance has been approved to treat the disease for more than 10 years. Recent advances in understanding of the disease mean that it is now known that the disease process begins many years before dementia develops, so this project will focus on early intervention.</p><p>Dr Luc Truyen is EFPIA co-lead for EPAD and member of the EPAD executive, and VP Neuroscience External Affairs at Janssen R&D, which has been involved in Alzheimer's disease research since the late 20th century and continues its R&D despite the high-profile late-stage failure in 2012 of its amyloid-beta targeting monoclonal antibody bapineuzumab (partnered with Pfizer and Elan; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-and-partners-pull-plug-on-bapineuzumab-for-Alzheimers-after-second-Phase-III-failure-333577" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 August 2012</a>). "One of our biggest learnings after our bapineuzumab efforts didn't yield the results that we all hoped for was that we probably wanted to intervene much earlier," he told <i>Scrip. </i>"We see there is an opportunity to affect the disease early before significant damage is done and give these disease-modifying drugs a chance to show what they can do."</p><p>"One of the areas we don't have a problem with is developing a range of interventions," commented Professor Craig Ritchie, EPAD co-ordinator and Professor of the Psychiatry of Ageing at the University of Edinburgh. "We have drugs in development that are probably going to be effective; we just need to create an environment where they can be tested accurately and effectively." With this in mind, he outlined two significant challenges in developing Alzheimer's treatments. </p><h2>early intervention challenges</h2><p>"Number one is identifying accurately that population in terms of who would benefit most from pharmacological intervention," he told <i>Scrip</i>. "And the second main challenge is then how does one make decisions on outcomes, as to whether drugs are effective in a population that may well be entirely asymptomatic."</p><p>With an initial budget of &euro;64m contributed by the European Commission, academic partners and the 14 participating pharmaceutical companies, the 35 industry and academia partners hope to address both those problems in a way that any single stakeholder acting alone would be unable to do.</p><p>The initiative will build on previously launched projects, including IMI-EMIF (European Medical Information Framework), which developed a common information framework of patient-level data from diverse sources, and IMI-AETIONOMY, a project aimed at laying the ground for a new approach to the classification of neurodegenerative diseases based on their underlying mechanistic causes rather than their symptoms, by organizing and structuring different types of data from many different sources. </p><p>As Dr Serge Van der Geyten, EPAD co-ordinator and Director for Neuroscience External Affairs at Janssen Pharmaceutica, explained, the project will involve setting up a global infrastructure to enable studies in large enough numbers of people to confirm a therapeutic effect and to test several treatment options rapidly within one single trial. </p><h2>clinical trial</h2><p>The clinical part of the collaboration will have two aspects, he said: "One is an observational study that's going to allow us to do better disease and risk modelling, and at the same time it will allow us to better characterize subjects that at a later stage could actually enrol in the second part, which is a clinical trial where they will be treated with a therapeutic intervention." </p><p>This adaptive, multi-arm trial will test several therapeutic interventions at Phase II against a shared placebo group. Any partner that contributes a candidate to the trial must have already conducted the Phase I work; after EPAD's Phase II trial they will be able to continue Phase III development independently. While the project agreement includes clauses to safeguard the intellectual property of the parties involved, each party will be free to go on and commercialize any products from the trial without any other financial ties to the partnership.</p><p>The benefit to the companies involved is that it "allows us to de-risk our compounds in a much faster and clearer way", said Dr Truyen. "We will also learn early on about the relative efficacies of these interventions from multiple partners and may choose then to take only the best forward rather than all of them." He noted that it is better for companies to know earlier on that their compound cannot compete with another based on relative outcomes, rather than finding out after lengthy Phase III development.</p><p>EPAD is a five-year program which is aiming to establish a Europe-wide register of 24,000 participants, of whom 1,500 will be invited to enrol in the Phase II trial of new treatments to prevent Alzheimer's. </p><p>One problem that the participants don't foresee is the recruitment of patients. "The public appetite for this type of research is unbelievable," commented Professor Ritchie, who runs a cohort study in the UK that looks at people for mid-life risk. "People really recognise the need to understand more about these diseases before dementia develops." The EPAD trial will build on existing cohorts and registers across Europe that have already identified potential patients (for example, those who have biomarker abnormalities as identified by specific tests that suggest evidence of the disease, but who have few or no complaints or clinical symptoms).</p><p>Much of the work is "front-loaded" into the first 18 months and will involve co-ordinating the project to get to the first "big milestone" of starting to enrol patients, Professor Ritchie explained. </p><p>The target is to have the first version of the EPAD platform ready to start enrolling subjects in the observational study in April 2016, with the actual proof of concept study involving drug candidates scheduled for launch in September 2016. The first results from the product trials could therefore come out from mid to late 2018, specified Dr Van der Geyten.</p><p>Meanwhile, another aim is to set up a global Alzheimer's platform, deploying the EPAD template elsewhere, potentially including the US, Canada and Australia, Dr Truyen said. In the US the BRAIN Initiative is a public-private collaboration with a broad research remit that includes Alzheimer's disease (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BRAIN-blueprint-in-hand-NIH-chief-confident-funds-will-come-346609" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 17 September 2013</a>).</p>
