<p>Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc. won the FDA's approval on Oct. 22 to market Onivyde (irinotecan liposome injection), an topoisomerase inhibitor, as a treatment in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. </p><p>Andrea Wang-Gillam, an associate professor of medicine and clinical director of GI oncology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and an investigator in the Onivyde Phase III NAPOLI-1 study, said Onivyde's approval was a "significant achievement in the oncology community," given the long history of failed studies in the post-gemcitabine setting.</p><p>But Onivyde's labeling came with a black-box warning alerting prescribers and patients about the risks of severe neutropenia and diarrhea, which caused investors to panic &ndash; knocking shares of Merrimack down 28% on Oct. 22.</p><p>The stock closed at $8.71, a loss of $1.30, or 13%.</p><p>Specifically, the black box warns prescribers and patients that fatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8%of patients receiving Onivyde. </p><p>Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving the drug in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin. </p><p>Prescribers are advised to withhold Onivyde for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 or neutropenic fever and to monitor blood cell counts periodically during treatment.</p><p>The box also warns that severe diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin. </p><p>Patients with bowel obstruction should not get Onivyde, the labeling warns. The drug also should be withheld in patients with diarrhea of grade 2-4 severity. </p><p>Onivyde's approval was based on the results of Merrimack's international randomized, controlled NAPOLI-1 Phase III study, which achieved its primary endpoint of a significant improvement in overall survival, with a 45% improvement in median overall survival of 6.1 months for patients receiving the drug in the combination regimen, versus 4.2 months for those who received 5-FU and leucovorin alone. </p><p>The Onivyde combination also demonstrated improvement in progression-free survival of 3.1 months, versus 1.5 months.</p><p>But the monotherapy regimen in the study did not achieve its primary endpoint and, therefore, the FDA did not approve the drug as a single agent. </p><p>The most common adverse reactions with Onivyde were diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, stomatitis and pyrexia.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
