<p>In a 28-2 vote, the Senate Appropriations Committee on 16 July adopted a spending bill that would provide the FDA with $4.6bn for fiscal year 2016, $2.63bn of which would be discretionary funding, with the remainder made up of user fees.</p><p>The legislation now goes to the full Senate for consideration &ndash; the 11th of 12 spending bills the chamber must consider and then reconcile with the House.</p><p>Under the bill, the FDA would gain an increase of $116m above FY 2015 appropriated levels, with about $40m of which is in discretionary spending.</p><p>But the Senate appropriators would not back the amount President Barack Obama had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">requested</a> for the FDA &ndash; falling short by about $106m in discretionary spending. </p><p>The amount, however, is $10m above what the House Appropriations Committee was willing to give the FDA when the panel <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-closer-to-gaining-added-funding-is-it-enough-359314" target="_new">passed its bill last week</a>.</p><p>But Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat-Maryland), ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the bill failed to provide relief for the FDA from the across-the-board sequester spending cuts under the <i>Budget Control Act of 2011</i>, leaving the agency "without necessary resources."</p><p>The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, bill included a $5m boost in spending for the FDA's medical product safety activities, which was slightly higher than what the House panel included in its spending legislation. </p><p>Senator appropriators also included a $3m increase to combat antibiotic resistance, although Democrats pointed out that amount was still $12m below what President Obama had requested.</p><p>The $2m increase the Senate panel provided for the FDA's activities related the president's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> also fell short by $8m of his request.</p><p>"FDA regulates products worth 20 cents of every dollar spent by American consumers, so these funds are vital to making sure our drugs and food are safe," said Senator Jeff Merkley (Democrat-Oregon), the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, where the bill originated.</p><p>He said the Senate appropriations bill also failed to provide requested increases for implementing the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, oversight of drug compounding facilities or evaluating additional over the counter sunscreen products. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
