<p><p>Epizyme collected a $10m extension fee and may earn up to $620m in milestone payments plus single-digit royalties on sales from drugs against three undisclosed targets under a revised partnership agreement with Celgene.</p><p>The new deal terms add three years to the companies' collaboration in the development of histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors for the treatment of epigenetically-driven cancers, but the amendments also narrow the focus of the agreement to specific programs. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Epizyme traded as high as $24.60 per share after the deal extension was announced on 9 July, but closed up 0.8% at $22.97.</p><p>Celgene paid $90m up front in 2012 under the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Epigenetics-focused-Epizyme-gains-90M-upfront-in-deal-with-Celgene-on-targeted-cancer-therapies-329832" target="_new">initial</a> three-year agreement with Epizyme, which was set to expire in August unless Celgene exercised its option for a one-year extension. The original deal terms gave Celgene an exclusive option to license ex-US rights for any new HMT inhibitor developed by Epizyme. </p><p>Under the new agreement, Celgene retained ex-US rights to pinometostat (EPZ-5676), which targets DOT1L and is in Phase I development for certain leukemia patients. However, the big biotech gave up its exclusive option for ex-US rights to any Epizyme-developed HMT inhibitor, but claimed an option for global rights to drugs against two targets and ex-US rights for the third target.</p><p>Celgene may decide to exercise its option when Epizyme submits an investigational new drug (IND) application to the US FDA for each drug candidate, but Epizyme will be responsible for development through Phase I. Celgene must make an additional milestone payment if the company continues its license beyond Phase I. </p><p>The potential milestone payments include up to $75m in fees for development milestones, $365m for regulatory milestones, and $170m for commercial milestones plus single-digit royalties on drug sales.</p><p>Epizyme also noted on 9 July that its current cash reserves will last through the second quarter of 2017. The company had $244.5m as of 31 March, including proceeds from a 17 March stock offering that grossed $124.5m before overallotments sold during the next 30 days. The net cash gain from the stock sale as of 17 April was $130.7m.</p><p>Epizyme's cash burn projection includes money on hand as of early July, including the $10m license extension fee from Celgene, but it excludes any other licensing or milestone payments that the company may receive during the next two years. Epizyme also reallocated resources to priority development programs to make sure that its cash will last through mid-2017.</p><p>The company's lead drug candidate is the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (EPZ-6438), which is in Phase I/II development for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Eisai held <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Eisai-moves-into-epigenetics-with-Epizyme-alliance-312498" target="_new">worldwide</a> rights to tazemetostat under a 2011 deal, but earlier this year Epizyme <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Eisai-gives-lymphoma-program-back-to-Epizyme-357267" target="_new">reacquired</a> the right to commercialize the drug globally, except for in Japan.</p><p>A deal worth up to $650m plus royalties also was negotiated with <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Epizyme-nets-20-million-up-front-as-GSK-widens-interest-in-epigenetics-308423" target="_new">GlaxoSmithKline</a> in 2011 to discover and develop novel small molecules targeting epigenetic enzymes in cancer and other diseases. Epizyme completed its research under the agreement and planned to hand over all related materials to GSK in the second quarter of 2015, according to the company's first quarter financial update filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April.</p><p>Epizyme has collected $53m in milestone fees from GSK to date and under deal terms amended in 2014 the company could earn up to $620m in additional milestone fees plus royalties, according to the 28 April SEC filing.</p><p><p><p><p>
