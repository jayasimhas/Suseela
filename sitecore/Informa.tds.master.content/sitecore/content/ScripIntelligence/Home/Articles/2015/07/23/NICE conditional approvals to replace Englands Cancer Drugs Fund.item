<p>A new "managed access fund" for financing oncology drugs conditionally approved by NICE could provide a proper long-term remedy to England's poor uptake of oncology products if it can replace the Cancer Drugs Fund, something that has become a soggy sticking plaster. But although the plans may offer companies hope of market access for future drugs, there is still uncertainty over what will happen to patients and drugs failed by the current system, like Eisai's Halaven. </p><p>The Cancer Drug's Fund was introduced in 2010 with an annual budget of &pound;200m. It was only supposed to be a temporary measure to ensure access to cancer drugs that failed to get through NICE until the new value-based pricing system was up and running in 2014. But VBP never happened and the Cancer Drugs Fund remained in place with an ever increasing budget (currently &pound;340m). According to NHS England the current fund does not "enable access to innovative drugs in a smart or sustainable way". It adds that England is throwing increasing amounts of money at less cost-effective treatments for end-of-life care, and the impact is "felt further down the cancer pathway".</p><p>So under an "emerging proposal" NHS England suggests a new fund that would be aligned with adapted NICE processes, including revised end-of-life criteria. The managed access fund would pay for new drugs that seem promising but which lack the evidence to be backed by a recommendation for routine funding. The funding would last for a set amount of time while further real-world evidence is gathered. The product would then go through an abbreviated NICE appraisal and the institute would say yes or no depending on the new evidence and the drug's price.</p><p>NHS England will put more defined plans out for consultation by September at the latest. Meanwhile, NICE will also consult on any changes introduced as a result to its methodologies.</p><p>While the plans look like a step in the right direction, it is not clear what will happen to drugs that have fared poorly under the current arrangements, said Nick Burgin, president of Eisai's global value and access unit. No new treatments are currently scheduled to go through the fund for the foreseeable future, including Eisai's thyroid cancer drug Eisai's Lenvima (lenvatinib). It is not clear what will happen to drugs like Lenvima, whether they will be reviewed by NICE or when assessments will resume.</p><p>Eisai has also struggled to get its end-of-life breast cancer drug, Halaven (eribulin) to patients. The fund threatened to delist it, along with 11 other drugs, in January after all drugs had to undergo a controversial new cost-effectiveness assessment. Eisai <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Eisai-wins-Halaven-Cancer-Drugs-Fund-appeal-and-exposes-systems-flaws-357277" target="_new">appealed the decision and won</a> but the fund refused to re-list the drug unless it reached a new confidential arrangement with the NHS and it resubmitted to NICE. Mr Burgin declined to comment further on the details of the agreement but said that it was "hugely detrimental to business".</p><p>Mr Burgin says that the transition from the Cancer Drugs Fund to the new system must cater for drugs like Lenvima and Halaven. "What happens to the treatments in between? What can't happen is that you have a very unfair, shambolic process that gets you from point A to point B."</p><p>Nevertheless, he said he was confident that a long-term solution to the cancer drugs problem that modified the NICE process was in sight. </p><p><p><p>
