<p>Pharmacyclics reported just before the US stock market closed on 16 March that an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) unanimously recommended that the Phase III HELIOS clinical trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) be unblinded due to a significant treatment benefit in the Imbruvica (ibrutinib) arm of the study.</p><p>The trial was sponsored by Pharmacyclics partner Janssen Biotech, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, to test the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor Imbruvica in combination with bendamustine and Rituxan (rituximab) versus placebo plus bendamustine and Rituxan (BR) in CLL and SLL patients who failed at least one prior line of therapy. However, Sagient Research noted in a BioMedTracker analysis that the results could push Imbruvica into the front-line setting depending on results for the progression-free survival (PFS) primary endpoint in HELIOS.</p><p>As a monotherapy, the BTK inhibitor has US FDA approval to treat CLL patients who've failed at least one prior line of therapy or who have a deletion of the 17p chromosome. If the drug's combination with BR encourages doctors to use Imbruvica as a first-line CLL therapy, the $21bn price that AbbVie is paying to acquire Pharmacyclics may make more sense to investors who pushed AbbVie's stock lower following its recent decision to buy Pharmacyclics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-outdoes-rumored-JandJ-bid-with-21bn-Pharmacyclics-buy-357078" target="_new">5 March 2015</a>).</p><p>Both Pharmacyclics and AbbVie saw their stocks spike toward the end of trading on 16 March. Pharmacyclics gained 0.7% to close at a new high of $256.70 per share. AbbVie ended the day 1.9% higher at $59.12 after falling below $60 and remaining there after the Pharmacyclics transaction was announced on 4 March.</p><p>Sagient's analysis noted that BR is the most commonly prescribed first-line CLL treatment regimen in the US, so positive HELIOS data could give prescribers a reason to use Imbruvica earlier in CLL treatment and in larger patient populations than allowed by the FDA-approved indications. </p><p>"We are very interested in the magnitude of the PFS benefit seen with Imbruvica combination therapy, as a strong result could also drive off-label usage with BR in first-line treatment," Sagient said in its BioMedTracker report, which noted that overall survival [OS] data also may be important for prescribing physicians.</p><p>Roche/Genentech's "Gazyva (obinutuzumab) provided strong PFS results in a trial against Rituxan for elderly CLL patients (both arms with chlorambucil), but failed to provide an OS benefit, which has thus far put a damper on uptake," Sagient said.</p><p>Pharmacyclics did not share the magnitude of PFS benefit for Imbruvica plus BR versus placebo plus BR, but the company said the difference was statistically significant. HELIOS data will be submitted for presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting from 29 May to 2 June in Chicago and for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The data also are being assembled for review by regulatory authorities for consideration of an Imbruvica label update.</p><p>"These results build upon early results in the Phase I/II program and are very encouraging as we continue to explore the benefits Imbruvica provides to patients when it is combined with other treatments," Pharmacyclics head of oncology Danelle James said in a statement from the company.</p><p>Safety results in HELIOS were described as consistent with prior clinical experience.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
