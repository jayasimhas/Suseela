<p>New UK specialist biotech company Mereo BioPharma is on the look-out for a handful of further promising products to add to the three clinical-stage products it has just acquired from Novartis, according to company CEO Denise Scots-Knight.</p><p>The formation of Mereo BioPharma is being funded with $119m from UK institutional investors in a series A round, and follows a collaborative effort between Novartis and UK VC firm Phase4 Partners to set up the firm. The new company is based in London and was initially founded in March 2015. </p><p>The products acquired from Novartis are: a fully human monoclonal antibody BPS-804 to improve bone density in brittle bone syndrome, an orphan disease; an orally active p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BCT-197 for acute exacerbations in coronary obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); and an orally active aromatase inhibitor BGS-649 being developed as a first line therapy for obese men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism to normalize testosterone levels.</p><p>An "assets for equity" swap between Novartis and Mereo was finalized on 28 July and will see Mereo take the three former Novartis products through the clinical development process, with the help of a further partner, the global contract research organisation ICON. Novartis could receive undisclosed milestone and royalty payments on any future commercial sales of the products, the companies announced July 29. </p><p>With ICON also being involved in discussions, further clinical development of the three Novartis products should begin relatively quickly, Dr Scots-Knight said. One of the products is going into a Phase IIa study, a second is to enter a Phase IIb trial and the third is shortly entering a pivotal registration study.</p><p>By all accounts the spin-off of the three investigational products into Mereo was not a case of Novartis getting rid of assets in a non-core therapeutic area, but was a much more interactive process. "We actually had a long discussion with Novartis about bringing external financing to bear on pharma pipelines, and over a number of months we went through an iterative process to find product assets at Novartis that we could move forward with," Dr Scots-Knight explained. </p><p>Dr Scots-Knight previously led Phase4 in a buyout from Nomura in 2010. She is also chair of Austria-based Nabriva Therapeutics, incidentally a 2006 spin out from Sandoz, now part of Novartis. Dr Scots-Knight is also on the board of OncoMed and Albireo.</p><p>Mereo is not aiming to be another Entasis Therapeutics, one of the most recent spin-outs from big pharma. That company was spun out of AstraZeneca with a portfolio of non-core antibiotics.</p><p>The long-term goal of Mereo is to have five to seven products in a diversified risk portfolio consisting of specialist products in different therapeutic areas with different mechanisms of action and different regulatory risk profiles. But they are not "niche" products; they each address large unmet clinical needs and have large potential markets, Dr Scots-Knight said.</p><p>The products are in "specialist" therapeutic areas so clinical trials should be more affordable, but they all have billion dollar market potentials, rather than the $200m or so associated with niche products, she believes. For example, the black box warnings put on testosterone products by the FDA at the beginning of 2015 because of potential cardiovascular risks has opened up that market and the potential for BGS-649.</p><p>As Mereo finds and acquires further products, the company will look for additional funding, partnering or divestment opportunities, but will still have the option of directly commercializing products in orphan disease indications, Dr Scots-Knight said. Current investors include Woodford Investment Management and Invesco Perpetual, and Novartis has said it intends to make cash investments in Mereo in any future financings.</p><p>
