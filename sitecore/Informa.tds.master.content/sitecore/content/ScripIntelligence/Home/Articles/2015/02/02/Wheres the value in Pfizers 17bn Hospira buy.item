<p>With Pfizer's pending $17bn acquisition of Hospira there's a lot of interest in the target company's biosimilar portfolio, given the potential for cheaper copies of biological medicines to steal substantial market share from major drug makers, but the most valuable part of the deal for Pfizer could be the addition of Hospira's generic injectable products and manufacturing capabilities.</p><p>The $90 per share transaction may contribute significant growth to Pfizer's Global Established Products (GEP) division &ndash; one of three operating units set up so that the company can consider whether to split into independent businesses after a three-year evaluation period (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-to-buy-Hospira-for-17bn-in-injectables-and-biosimilar-boost-356560" target="_new">5 February 2015</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-CEO-Read-urges-patience-as-drug-maker-reorganizes-mulls-breakup-347709" target="_new">30 October 2013</a>). However, Pfizer executives do not anticipate a decision on breaking up the company until 2017 or later, regardless of the value that Hospira may add to GEP's portfolio.</p><p>Hospira jumped 35.3% to close at $87.64 per share on 5 February with a market cap of $14.8bn based on the deal with Pfizer, which values the company at a 38.9% premium to its 4 February stock price. Pfizer closed up 3.9% at $32.99 per share, bringing its market cap to $207.9bn following the company's conference call with investors and analysts to discuss the Hospira transaction. </p><p>As analysts peppered Pfizer executives with questions about its plans to separate its three business units into independent companies, Pfizer chairman and CEO Ian Read noted that the company is "not in a position to make any decision regarding potential future action that could involve an external split of any of our businesses. We believe it will take the next few years to fully realize the potential of these businesses, which is predicated upon the success of our product launches, the advancement of our innovative pipeline, strengthening our capabilities to grow our off-patent portfolio, which this deal certainly has done, continuing effective cost management, and capital allocation."</p><p>Adding Hospira's assets to GEP, which is responsible for Pfizer's products with expired or nearly expired patents and its biosimilar programs, could shift the division from one with declining sales to one with growing sales, which may justify a spin-off from the largest pharma company in the world. </p><p>"In addition to the pure monetary value of existing generics sales and pipeline products, Hospira will offer Pfizer manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities that fit well with its Established Products division. I would imagine that once Hospira has been brought in and restructured, spinning off the generics business becomes a more likely prospect," said Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Giles Somers.</p><p><b>Biosimilar opportunity and overlap</b></p><p>But Mr Somers also noted that while Pfizer has one of the most advanced biosimilar programs in the industry Hospira has a lead over its acquirer. The company has three biosimilars on the market in Europe and Australia, including a copy of Remicade (infliximab) that was developed by Hospira's partner Celltrion and launched a year ago in the EU (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biosimilar-Remicade-now-available-in-Europe-350035" target="_new">13 February 2014</a>).</p><p>"Like most other companies in biosimilars, Pfizer, like Celltrion, has focused its efforts on developing copies of the biggest selling monoclonal antibodies. The Big 5 of Humira, Remicade, Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin are estimated to have generated sales of $18bn in 2014 in the US market alone. Global sales for the year will be around $30bn. This huge opportunity has attracted a number of large pharmaceutical companies as well as biotechs of various sizes," Mr Somers said.</p><p>Pfizer notes that biologics with more than $100bn in combined annual sales will lose patent protection during the next five to 10 years, creating a $20bn worldwide biologics market by 2020. </p><p>The table below, which shows the biosimilars that Pfizer and Hospira have in development, illustrates where the companies' pipelines overlap. It also shows where Hospira is ahead.</p><table><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"><p><b>Reference brand</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td valign="bottom"><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td valign="bottom"><p><b>Biosimilar name</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td valign="bottom"><p><b>US/EU development stage</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Remicade (infliximab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Remsima/Inflectra</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched/ Approved (EU); Registration (US)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-06438179</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Rituxan (rituximab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-05280586</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P10</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Herceptin (trastuzumab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-05280014</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P6</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Humira  (adalimumab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-06410293 </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P17</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Avastin (bevacizumab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-06439535</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P16</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Erbitux (cetuximab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P15</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Synagis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celltrion/Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>CT-P14</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Epogen (epoetin)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Retacrit</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched (EU); Registration (US)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Neupogen (filgrastim)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Nivestim</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Launched (EU)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Neulasta (pegfilgrastim)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hospira</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>not disclosed</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><i>Source: Datamonitor Healthcare</i></p><p><p>"In biosimilars, our strategy is to build a broad portfolio. With the addition of Hospira, we'll obtain biosimilar portfolios of both marketed and pipeline assets," Mr Read said.</p><p>Even with the overlap between the company's product candidates and Hospira's biosimilars, he said Pfizer doesn't expect antitrust regulators to oppose the merger for competitive reasons.</p><p>If regulators do raise anti-competitive concerns, Mr Somers said Pfizer could sell some of its biosimilar programs or divest some of the Hospira assets, including giving rights to the Celltrion-partnered programs back to the South Korean company.</p><p>That will be part of the uncertainty for investors as Pfizer works to close its acquisition of Hospira during the second half of 2015: Will the company hold on to existing programs or favor Hospira's assets, some of which are further along in development, even if that means sharing revenue with Celltrion?</p><p><b>Injecting value into injectables</b></p><p>The value of Hospira to Pfizer's specialty injectable pharmaceuticals business seems clearer, given the overlapping product candidates in the companies' biosimilar portfolios. And compared with the $20bn potential market size for biosimilars in 2020, Pfizer and IMS Health forecast a 10% compound annual growth rate for specialty injectables, resulting in a $70bn market by 2020.</p><p>Pfizer's GEP division markets 73 off-patent, brand-name sterile injectables, including anesthetics, anti-infectives and oncology products. Hospira has 200 mostly generic injectable products for acute care and oncology indications.</p><p>"Hospira will add the broadest portfolio of generic sterile injectables molecules in the industry to our business, with a focus on first-to-market," GEP group president John Young said during Pfizer's conference call. </p><p>Mr Young said most of Hospira's injectable products are sold in the US, so Pfizer should be able to boost ex-US revenue from the portfolio based on the big pharma company's larger global footprint.</p><p>Pfizer expects to trim $800m in yearly costs from the combined company's balance sheet by 2018, most of which will come from sales, marketing and other costs unrelated to research and development.</p><p>President of global supply Anthony Maddaluna said Pfizer inspected three of Hospira's manufacturing sites, which had been the subject of US FDA warning letters and "we feel very comfortable that the issues raised by the regulators have been addressed or are being properly addressed."</p><p>Hospira disclosed in its third quarter 2014 earnings report that it has gotten warning letters from the FDA related to manufacturing facilities in Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia; Clayton and Rocky Mount, North Carolina; La Aurora de Heredia, Costa Rica; Irungattukottai , India; and Lake Forest, Illinois. The company responded to the letters and is working to correct the problems.</p><p><b>Where to expand next?</b></p><p>Despite the manufacturing issues, Hospira's products generated $4.4bn in sales for the 12 months ending 30 September, which means the company's assets could add significant growth to Pfizer's GEP division. The established products business is the big pharma's largest division with $25.2bn in 2014 sales, but revenue fell 9% from $27.6bn in 2013 &ndash; a gap that the acquisition of Hospira would more than fill.</p><p>Investors have been waiting for Pfizer to execute a large transaction that would add significant revenue following the company's loss of patent exclusivity for major blockbusters, such as Lipitor (atorvastatin). And after Pfizer failed to complete a more than $100bn buyout of the unwilling target AstraZeneca in 2014, shareholders have been particularly interested in how the company would deploy its cash.</p><p>Mr Read said Pfizer continues to look at potential acquisitions, regardless of the size of the target, implying that the company still could chase very large deals. </p><p>"We have opportunities of all sizes from bolt-ons to niche opportunities to major acquisitions," he said.</p><p>Whether the next transaction will be done to boost waning sales in the GEP division or in the Global Innovative Product (GIP) business, or to accelerate growth in the much smaller vaccines and oncology group, remains to be seen.</p><p>"Overall, we see the [Hospira] deal as not totally unexpected, and it won't likely be the last deal that Pfizer is going to do in the near-to-medium term as they try to boost their two businesses (the innovative business and the established/generics business) ahead of potential split into two standalone entities two to three years from now. We remain focused on the optionality the company can still provide in terms of business development and its mid-late stage clinical pipeline," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a 5 February report.</p><p><p><p><p>
