<p>Viekira Pak, AbbVie's fixed-dose combination therapy for hepatitis C, fell short of Wall Street consensus sales estimates during the second quarter, but the Chicago-area pharma company pointed to several factors causing below-expectation US sales, while international sales exceeded projections.</p><p>AbbVie reported worldwide quarterly sales of $385m for Viekira (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets) during the second quarter, putting it solidly on pace to be a blockbuster product. Chairman and CEO Rick Gonzalez said during AbbVie's 24 July earnings conference call that the company has determined some causes for the disappointing US sales, but remains confident Viekira can become a $3bn per year product, as originally predicted.</p><p>AbbVie, intent on growing its portfolio of marketed HCV products, obtained early US FDA approval of a second HCV combo drug to treat non-cirrhotic genotype 4 patients a few hours after its conference call with investors and analysts. Technivie is a fixed-dose combo of the NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir and protease inhibitor paritaprevir with the boosting agent ritonavir &ndash; three of Viekira's four components &ndash; and it is the first drug approved to treat genotype 4 infection in the US without co-administration of interferon.</p><p>AbbVie announced a wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $76,653 for Technivie, based on a 12-week course of therapy, which a company spokesperson pointed out is the shortest duration of therapy available for non-cirrhotic genotype 4 patients.</p><p><b>Non-HCV sales</b></p><p>Overall, AbbVie reported a strong second quarter, posting revenues of $5.5bn, which was up 19.4% year-over-year on an operational basis or 11.1% when the impact of foreign exchange was factored in. It was a mixed quarter for the pharma's top-seller, Humira (adalimumab), which now faces <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-biosimilars-not-a-threat-to-Humira-358037" target="_new">biosimilar competition</a> in Europe.</p><p>The biologic brought in $3.5bn for the quarter, which was up 16.4% on an operational basis and 7.6% with the foreign exchange impact. That includes international sales of $1.4bn, which was 3.6% higher than a year ago, but well below Street expectations. Chief financial officer Bill Chase said foreign exchange reduced international Humira sales by 18%, with the currency hit reducing global sales of the product by 8.8%.</p><p>"Internationally, Humira sales have grown nearly 9% on an operational basis in the first half of the year consistent with our planning expectations," Mr Chase said on the call. "As we noted last quarter, the first quarter international growth rate of nearly 15% was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets. Consequently, international sales growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by this shipment timing."</p><p><b>Improvement expected for Viekira in US</b></p><p>Sales of Viekira totaled $227m in the US and $158m internationally. For the first six months of 2015, the product yielded $616m in sales, including $365m domestically.</p><p>"Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come," Mr Gonzalez said. "With the launch of Viekira, we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market. We continue to see progress, particularly internationally, which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions. We received approval in 47 markets and we expect a number of additional countries to come online as the year progresses and into 2016. This includes Japan, where we continue to expect a regulatory decision during the second half of this year."</p><p>Despite the lower-than-expected US sales, the CEO said Viekira is "still tracking against" the company's aspirational goal of $3bn in annual peak sales. Sales were up 67% compared to the first quarter, he noted, with a $1.5bn run rate for 2015 that is "continuing to grow nicely."</p><p>"The international side of the business obviously has performed better than the US," Mr Gonzalez said. "I think the US has not met our expectations. I think we understand why and we're continuing to work on that, but certainly the international market is performing incrementally better than what we expected."</p><p>He cited two reasons for the disappointing US numbers: an overall decline in US HCV patient treatment totals across all therapeutic regimens, with an expected stabilization at the current level; and funding difficulties at the Veterans Administration that should resolve when the new federal fiscal year begins on 1 October. </p><p>Beyond the US, Mr Gonzalez also said approval and commercial success in Japan would be crucial to meeting AbbVie's $3bn Viekira sales goal.</p><p>Mr Chase added that AbbVie is ramping up its share of patients in its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">exclusive US payer accounts</a> for Viekira and has achieved "our target level of penetration in our largest contract," which is with Express Scripts.</p><p><b>More coming in HCV</b></p><p>Chief scientific officer Mike Severino said during AbbVie's earnings call that AbbVie's plans to launch a pan-genotypic, once-daily, second-generation combo for HCV in 2017 are continuing apace. "Our current position will serve as a base from which we will launch further innovation," he said.</p><p>Dr Severino noted that impressive early results in a Phase IIb study of AbbVie's next-generation protease inhibitor ABT-493 and NS5A inhibitor ABT-530 are holding up as the trial progresses. The combination yielded a 99% sustained virologic response (SVR) rate at four weeks in genotype 1a and 1b treatment-experienced and treatment-na&iuml;ve patients.</p><p>"Today, I am pleased to report that the SVR12 results are equally impressive," he said. "In fact, the dose we intend to pursue in Phase III drove an SVR12 rate of 100%. Evaluation in other genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results and we're also evaluating shorter duration of therapy with this combination. We expect to present data from the Phase II studies at the [American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)] meeting later this year, and we remain on track to advance into Phase III development this year with commercialization expected in 2017."</p><p>UBS Investment Research analyst Marc Goodman maintained a "buy" rating for AbbVie shares in a 24 July note, saying overall Humira and Viekira trends remain strong. "HCV trends are solid and continue to trend toward $750m in the fourth quarter as the EU kicks in further and Japan gets approved in the second half," he wrote.</p><p>Also bullish on Viekira is Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets, who estimated in a 24 July note that the combo can grab market share ranging between 13% and 18%, varying by region. He projects worldwide sales of $2.8bn next year and $2.6bn in 2017, given Viekira's strength in clinical trials in the genotype 1b population, which is especially prevalent outside the US, notably in Japan.</p><p><p>[Editor's note: This story is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
