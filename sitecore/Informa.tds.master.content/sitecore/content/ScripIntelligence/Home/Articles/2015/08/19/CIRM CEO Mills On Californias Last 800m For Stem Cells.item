<p>Randal Mills left Osiris Therapeutics a few years after the company won the first-ever approval for a stem cell therapy and wasn't sure where he'd go next, but Mills ended up moving across the country to help California's stem cell research funding agency decide how best to spend its last $800m.</p><p>The California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was created in late 2004 when voters approved a measure that allowed the state to generate $3bn in bond sale proceeds to fund stem cell research. Most of the grants and loans to date have gone to academic research, but since the agency wants to spend a greater proportion of the remaining money on therapies with the potential to become commercial products, it makes sense that the former CEO of a stem cell therapy company was tapped to lead CIRM.</p><p>Mills &ndash; the agency's president and CEO since May 2014 &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CIRM-asks-patients-how-to-spend-last-800m-for-stem-cell-therapies-359450" target="_new">visited San Diego</a>, Los Angeles and San Francisco in July to solicit patient input on how CIRM should allocate its remaining funds, which are expected to last until 2020. The feedback will inform the agency's ongoing strategic planning process.</p><p><b>CIRM 2.0 Under Way</b></p><p>Mills spent his first year at CIRM drafting and implementing "CIRM 2.0" to speed up the delivery of stem cell therapies to patients. CIRM 2.0 includes more frequent opportunities for researchers and companies to apply for grants and loans as well as a shorter review process for funding applications. The number and speed of CIRM funding opportunities was an impediment to regenerative medicine companies that might seek funds for clinical trials.</p><p>"Industry has never not had access to CIRM funding. I just think the access has not been well-utilized," Mills said.</p><p>With only a handful of requests for grant and loan applications each year and approval timelines that stretched to 22 months, few companies with programs nearing the clinic applied for CIRM funds. Now, with CIRM 2.0 bringing the review time down to 100 days, the agency received 12 applications to fund clinical projects during the first half of 2015 versus none in all of 2014. </p><p>Caladrius Biosciences, formerly NeoStem, received a $17.7m grant from CIRM in May to fund a 250-person Phase III clinical trial for NBS20, a treatment that turns a patient's own cells against the cancer stem cells that make tumors grow.</p><p><b>Bringing Commercial Perspective To CIRM</b></p><p>Mills spent 10 years at RTI Biologics &ndash; a spinout from the University of Florida Tissue Bank &ndash; before he moved on to Osiris for 10 years. He left the second company to take a break from full-time work, serve on some boards of directors and spend time with his children. But when Jonathan Thomas, chairman of CIRM's Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee, approached Mills during a CIRM grant review meeting about taking the agency's CEO job, it was an opportunity that Mills couldn't refuse.</p><p>"The most valuable thing about my experience at Osiris that I can bring to CIRM is the connection of the technology to the patients that we're trying to treat and help," Mills said. "Bringing forward a treatment for desperately ill patients had a profound impact on me and my life going forward."</p><p>Osiris <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/First-stem-cell-treatment-approved-in-Canada-330745" target="_new">won approval from Health Canada</a> in 2012 for Prochymal (remestemcel-L) in the treatment of children with acute graft-versus-host disease who fail to respond to steroid therapy. The company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Osiris-offloads-Prochymal-to-Mesoblast-347273" target="_new">sold its mesenchymal stem cell therapy</a> to Mesoblast in 2013 to focus on stem cell-based wound care, sports medicine and orthopedic products.</p><p>"At CIRM, we're trying to build a better machine that connects from the discovery process to clinical to regulatory and commercialization and have those things work very efficiently," Mills said.</p><p><b>Accelerating Treatments To Patients</b></p><p>CIRM wants to push programs forward faster at each stage of a stem cell therapy's pre-commercial progress, but the agency also needs industry to pull promising programs through the later stages of the development, regulatory and commercialization process.</p><p>"Then lastly, we have to think about what we can do to improve the regulatory process to get the most efficient pathway for these therapies going forward. Other countries are taking the lead on these very unique products," Mills said.</p><p>CIRM's strategic plan reaffirms the agency's mission ("Accelerating stem cell treatments to patients with unmet medical needs") and establishes a strategy for connecting all the pieces of the stem cell therapy development machine together. CIRM's board of directors will review the proposed plan in September, at which time the board can accept, reject or modify the proposal. </p><p>However, the board already is approving programs that support CIRM's mission of accelerating treatments into the clinic. The board endorsed another component of CIRM 2.0 in July that authorized two new programs for discovery and translational research. Under the two programs, CIRM is expected to approve 50 Discovery grants totaling $53m, 12 Translation awards totaling $40m and 12 Clinical grants totaling $100m each year. </p><p>Both programs includes financial incentives to move programs into the next stage. For instance, the Discovery program gives scientists incentives to either find a partner for translational work or conduct it themselves.</p><p>"Almost all of these great ideas are coming from academia, but industry is better at taking them into clinical testing," Mills said. "What we need to do is put them together better."</p><p><b>When The Money Runs Out</b></p><p>There has been some discussion among CIRM's original supporters &ndash; people and organizations who campaigned in favor of the 2004 bond measure that established the agency &ndash; about floating another bond measure in the next few years to replenish CIRM's funds before the last $800m runs out. However, CIRM hasn't taken an official position on the agency's future.</p><p>"Bond measures and other appropriations are not something that we get into at CIRM, so we're looking at being fiscally responsible with the money that's left and investing it wisely," Mills said. "We can fund new programs at the current rate through 2020, which is a very long runway. I can't emphasize enough how significant an amount of time and money we have left to deploy. If we use it wisely and efficiently, we'll have a great impact."</p><p><p><p><p>
