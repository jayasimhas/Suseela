<p>While lawmakers are working on getting the across-the-board sequestration spending cuts lifted on the National Institutes of Health (NIH), its employees last week appeared more concerned about the toll contracting out a significant number of jobs and the oversight of travel and attendance of scientific conferences was taking on the agency's budget. </p><p>At a 2 April "town hall," NIH workers vented their frustration over a number of concerns, with NIH Director Dr Francis Collins and Senator Ben Cardin (Democrat-Maryland) listening attentively.</p><p>Senator Cardin started off the town hall gathering by acknowledging "Congress has a strange way of saying thank you" to the NIH, with the lawmaker pointing to the agency's flat budget for the past decade and the sequestration spending cuts.</p><p>But he said he was optimistic the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Departing-NIH-advocate-Mikulski-Im-not-done-yet-357610" target="_new">legislation</a> he is co-sponsoring with his Maryland colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat), aimed at negating the impact on the NIH of the sequester by increasing its budget by an initial 10% for each of the first two years, or $3bn per year, and then by 6% each year thereafter until 2020 &ndash; ultimately bringing it to $45bn &ndash; has a good chance of being adopted.</p><p>Senator Cardin said he's "not heard a single member of Congress criticize Dr Collins and the work you do" &ndash; to which the NIH chief quickly quipped "I could tell you one or two."</p><p>The lawmaker attempted to reassure the NIH employees that federal workers were not to blame for the deficit.</p><p>But the NIH workers wanted to know why, then, were they being targeted by Congress for various ways to cut spending.</p><p>One 36-year NIH veteran wanted to particularly know whether the agency's employees would again have to endure the turmoil created in 2003 when the Bush administration ordered the implementation of a cost-containment policy, known as Circular A-76, a competitive outsourcing process in which anything that was determined to be a commercial activity had to be bid on in a competition &ndash; pitting certain government employees against outside vendors. </p><p>"We lost some real good people because of their fear of losing their jobs," the NIH employee declared. </p><p>Senator Cardin responded that he and his colleagues would "very much fight the outsourcing issue."</p><p>He insisted the A-76 process, which lasted until the end of the Bush administration, had "turned the corner" and that all "central services must be performed under the auspices of federal workers."</p><p>Joe Martin, deputy director of client services in the NIH's Office of Human Resources, told <i>Scrip</i> he was not aware of any outsourcing currently going on at the agency.</p><p>Another worker, who said he had been at the NIH main campus for five years, wanted to know why the agency could not simply hire on the contract employees, of which he was one, rather than using that process, which he said was more expensive because the government was covering the costs of paying outside managers and companies &ldquo;to make a profit.&rdquo; </p><p>"If you give us the option of hiring us, it would save money for the government," he said.</p><p>Senator Cardin acknowledged there have been numerous "objectively" done studies that showed contracting out costs US taxpayers more money.</p><p>"The contracting out has nothing to do about saving money," the Maryland Democrat argued. "It has everything to do about a philosophy that &lsquo;Government is bad, let's make government as small as possible, or appear to be as small as possible, because we reduce the number of federal workers. Even though we are spending more taxpayer money, it's not being done by government employees, therefore, we can claim we've reduced the size of government.&rsquo;"</p><p>He said such a philosophy was "illogical" &ndash; words that brought the room of NIH workers to their feet, giving loud cheers and applause.</p><p>The most recent figures show the NIH has about 11,800 contract employees, of which about 5,400 are located on the agency's main campus in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><p>NIH's Mr Martin said contract workers who want to become full-time NIH employees must go through the regular federal application process.</p><p>But, he said, "We want anyone to apply who could hit the ground running."</p><p>Another employee complained that "It doesn't do any good to de-motivate us if you want government to work better," to which Senator Cardin responded that he thought the "overwhelming majority of the members of Congress on both sides of the aisle want government to work."</p><p>But he admitted "There are some who don't" and are "very happy when things don't work well because it feeds well into their agenda for a smaller government." </p><p>One agency employee, who had his question read because he was off-site watching the town hall on an NIH-only webcast, argued that a "few bad apples" has resulted in "multi-tiered oversight" of the funding spent on travel to scientific conferences, which he insisted has "slowed the work to near paralysis in some quarters."</p><p>"These travel restrictions and conference restrictions are ridiculous," Senator Cardin declared &ndash; again bringing the NIH employees to their feet. </p><p>"You don't work in a bubble. You work by collaboration. That's how creativity starts," he said. "You have to be able to share. That's absolutely part of innovation."</p><p>He said the restrictions on conference travel &ndash; imposed a few years ago by President Barack Obama in response to a scandal in which the General Services Administration spent $800,000 to fly 300 employees to Las Vegas for a 2012 gathering &ndash; were "counterproductive." </p><p>"Yes, there have been abuses," Senator Cardin said, declaring he wants to eliminate abuses in government spending wherever they arise, but "don't overreact to someone who has abused the system by preventing the appropriate type of collaboration that is critically important for the mission."</p><p>Dr Collins said the time and money spent on the NIH's conference oversight has been stressful and an "enormous" burden on his agency.</p><p>He pointed out that the NIH is now spending about $15m each year "just on the necessary paperwork for people to go to scientific conferences, using the skills of hundreds of employees, who could be doing something else, for what I see is zero added value."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
