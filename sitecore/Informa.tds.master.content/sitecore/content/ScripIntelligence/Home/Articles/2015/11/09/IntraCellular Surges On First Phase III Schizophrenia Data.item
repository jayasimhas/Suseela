<p>Intra-Cellular Therapies saw its share price climb 86.9% to close at a new peak of $48.79 on Sept. 16 after the company reported that ITI-007 showed a potentially differentiated safety profile relative to approved antipsychotic drugs in the first of two Phase III schizophrenia clinical trials.</p><p>New York-based Intra-Cellular is pursuing a first-line indication for the treatment of schizophrenia with ITI-007, which combines serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, dopamine receptor phosphoprotein modulation (DPPM), glutamatergic modulation and serotonin reuptake inhibition in a once-daily pill. The first Phase III trial was placebo-controlled, but the company is expected to report data from a second late-stage study comparing ITI-007 with <i>Risperdal</i> (risperidone) in mid-2016.</p><p>"We believe the data clearly validates the 60mg ITI-007 as an attractive treatment option for schizophrenia and will increase the likelihood of success of the overall program," Jefferies analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a Sept. 16 research note.</p><p><b>Efficacy With A Side Of Safety</b></p><p>Intra-Cellular said its once-daily 60mg dose of ITI-007 met the Phase III primary endpoint by showing statistically significant superiority against placebo in terms of antipsychotic efficacy at Week 4 as measured by changes from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score &ndash; a mean decline of -14.5 versus -10.3 (p=0.022). The difference between the 40mg ITI-007 dose and placebo was not statistically significant.</p><p>Sagient Research said in a Sept. 16 BioMedTracker report that the placebo-controlled study confirmed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-United-Therapeutics-Upsher-Smith-Intra-Cellular-348647" target="_new">positive Phase II results</a> that Intra-Cellular first reported in 2013, although the difference between ITI-007 and placebo was slightly larger in the mid-stage clinical trial.</p><p>"In the previous trial the placebo response on PANSS was lower than observed in the Phase III study (-7.4 vs -10.3), but the treatment response was also lower in the Phase II study in the ITI-007 group (-13.2 vs -14.5). The overall separation between groups was higher in the Phase II study versus the Phase III study (-5.8 vs -4.2), but still significant. This decrease in overall magnitude of effect is not unexpected due to the high variability seen in Phase III trials of psychiatric illness," Sagient said in its BioMedTracker report.</p><p>Intra-Cellular reported that ITI-007 did not differ significantly from placebo in terms of safety, including motor, metabolic and cardiovascular side effects associated with other schizophrenia drugs: akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders) and changes in prolactin, body weight, glucose, insulin and lipid levels. The most common adverse events were somnolence (17.3% for 60mg ITI-007 versus 4% for placebo), mild sedation (12% versus 5.4%), and fatigue (5.3% versus 1.3%).</p><p>The company also reported top-line data from a separate clinical study, which found that ITI-007 dosed at 60mg once-daily was associated with a 40% mean striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy in the brain as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) scans of schizophrenia patients. Intra-Cellular said the low striatal D2 receptor occupancy relative to levels needed for effective treatment of schizophrenia with other drugs probably contributes to ITI-007's safety profile.</p><p>Sagient increased its likelihood of US FDA approval (LOA) for ITI-007 by 5% to 58% based on the Phase III efficacy and potentially differentiating safety observed to date. The LOA is 7% above average for drugs in similar indications and stages of development.</p><p><b>Safety In the Front Line</b></p><p>"To have achieved efficacy at lower dopamine receptor occupancy levels more commonly associated with clozapine, arguably the most efficacious antipsychotic, while maintaining a placebo-like safety and tolerability profile is a remarkable advance in the development of drugs for schizophrenia," said professor Carol Tamminga, who chairs the Psychiatry department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, in a statement from Intra-Cellular.</p><p>Intra-Cellular vice president of medical affairs Cedric O'Gorman told <i>Scrip</i> that the company is not evaluating ITI-007 versus clozapine, because while the latter drug is effective it is indicated for people with schizophrenia who are treatment-resistant or treatment-refractory to other antipsychotics and not for patients in the first-line setting due to safety concerns &ndash; clozapine can cause a rare, but serious blood disorder. </p><p>In regard to Tamminga's observation, O'Gorman noted that "like clozapine, the antipsychotic effect or efficacy seen with ITI-007 is associated with lower levels of D2 receptor occupancy as demonstrated in the PET (positron emission tomography) study," but "unlike clozapine, ITI-007 requires no titration, is well-tolerated and has a safety profile similar to placebo."</p><p>Jefferies analyst Fernandez noted that 87% of patients treated with 60mg of ITI-007 completed the four-week treatment period in Intra-Cellular's first Phase III clinical trial versus about 75% of patients in the placebo arm, which was an improvement over the 80% completion rate for patients in the 60mg ITI-007 arm of the company's Phase II trial versus 82% for risperidone.</p><p>"The robust tolerability profile, coupled with 40% D2 occupancy data from the PET study, strongly suggest ITI-007 could have appeal in [a] broad range of patient[s], including pediatrics and elderly patients. It also bolsters our confidence of ITI-007 in multiple indications outside schizophrenia, such as bipolar depression and behavior disturbances associated with dementia," Fernandez said in his report.</p><p><p><p><p>
