<p>A young Indian social healthcare venture, Arogya Finance, has linked up with Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories, to roll out a financing initiative for the latter's hepatitis C therapy, Resof (sofosbuvir). </p><p>This is probably among the earliest of such efforts in the competitive sofosbuvir segment, though out-of-the-box hepatitis C therapy financing initiatives in India are previously believed to have improved access to interferon alfa 2b.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> had earlier reported that Dr Reddy's was working on a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dr-Reddys-Tests-Financing-Model-For-Sofosbuvir-In-India-359789" target="_new">pilot financing initiative</a> with a partner - for sofosbuvir. Resof is priced at INR 20,000($309) for a 28s pack. </p><p>Arogya said that it will facilitate easy Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) to patients to pay for the hepatitis C therapy and a few other therapies provided by Dr Reddy&rsquo;s. </p><p>"Arogya Finance in association with Dr Reddy&rsquo;s has taken an initiative to offer medical loans at reasonable terms and making it available at the right time, right place and reaching out to the patients in rural India," Jose Peter, co-founder and CEO of Arogya Finance, said. </p><p>Peter told <i>Scrip</i> that Arogya finances up to 100% of the drug cost in this case and the maximum tenure allowed is 36 months and the maximum loan could be up to INR200,000.</p><p>"Our interest rate is a reasonable 12% (flat)," he said.</p><p>World Health Organization estimates that more than 12 million Indians suffer from chronic hepatitis C. </p><p>Arogya does not require collaterals or formal income proof which is mandatory in other forms of finance. It offers medical loans to the traditionally "un-bankable", using a psychometric test as an innovative risk assessment tool to enable evaluation of the credit risk profile of people outside the formal banking system. </p><p>Peter, a former CFO of the retail finance firm, Tata Motor Finance, had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that most of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Can-Indias-Borrow-And-Treat-Market-Move-The-Access-Needle-360422" target="_new">expensive treatments</a>, in general, reach only 10-20% of patients who could benefit from the therapy in India, mainly due to challenges in awareness, availability and affordability. </p><p>"While all these issues need to be addressed, affordability is the single most important aspect in the decision -making process of the patient and the doctor/care giver," Peter then said.</p><p>Arogya is also implementing the concept of an Arogya Card, a pre-approved medical loan for the entire family, across the nation. </p><p>In addition to potentially moving the access needle, it will be interesting see whether the loan option will have a major impact in the multi-player Indian sofosbuvir market. </p><p>A clutch of players including Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Natco Pharma, Strides Arcolab and Mylan have launched <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-Sovaldi-generics-saga-2-suppliers-and-falling-prices-357593" target="_new">sofobuvir</a> in India following licensing deals with Gilead. In March this year, Dr Reddy&rsquo;s entered into an agreement with the local firm, Hetero, to distribute and market sofosbuvir 400mg tablets under the brand name Resof in India. </p><p>Several firms now appear to be working on similar financing schemes for other products as well. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BI-wants-to-own-lung-therapy-space-as-India-priced-afatinib-debuts-358851" target="_new">Boehringer Ingelheim</a> had earlier indicated that it is evaluating financing models for its oncology as well as other critical care products, while Medtronic offers financial assistance for its cardiac stents. <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roches-Tchoumi-On-Selling-Cancer-Drugs-In-Emerging-Markets-360895" target="_new">Roche</a> too is working on similar plans for its oncology products. </p><p>
