<p>Novartis is facing the prospect of an unprecedented temporary suspension order against its business in Japan over failures to report serious side-effects with its drugs.</p><p>The potential suspension against Novartis Pharma KK (NPKK), which multiple media sources in Japan have reported is likely to last around 15 days, is at the final stages of consideration by the ministry of health, labour and welfare (MHLW).</p><p>"We can confirm that NPKK has received a pre notification from the MHLW," Novartis told <i>Scrip</i>. "NPKK will take all necessary steps to ensure that Japanese patients are not adversely affected by any proposed business suspension order. While we would need to evaluate the details of any proposed business suspension order from the MHLW, we believe that the financial impact will be manageable."</p><p>It is not yet clear exactly what form the order would take, if imposed, but it is expected to apply to most of the subsidiary's business operations. It would be the first ever such move by the ministry, which has in the past halted for short periods the selected activities of pharma companies found violating quality and other regulatory standards, but never issued such a broad suspension.</p><p>The order relates to the subsidiary's delayed or non-reporting to the ministry of information on side-effects occurring during the use of various products. Novartis sales reps in Japan were found not to have passed on information to the subsidiary's internal safety team for submission to the ministry, as is required within either 15 or 30 days under Japan's Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, depending on severity.</p><p>The company's internal investigations have looked into a total of 3,264 improperly reported side-effects related to its product portfolio, concluding that no changes to current safety documents were required.</p><p>The health ministry had already issued a rare business improvement order to Novartis Japan in July over adverse reaction reporting failures for the leukemia drugs Glivec (imatinib) and Tasigna (nilotinib), requiring the company to conduct more thorough training and to improve internal oversight systems. </p><p>Those issues in turn came in the wake of Novartis's Japanese operations attracting earlier official investigation over the involvement of its employees in, and the use of data from, various post-marketing clinical studies for the antihypertensive Diovan (valsartan).</p><p>The affair cast a broader shadow over the credibility of such studies in Japan and the company's business in the country.</p><p>The Tokyo-based subsidiary has already shaken up its senior management in the wake of the problems, and adopted new standards for investigator-initiated studies and strengthened compliance measures, submitting additional information on its remedial actions late last year.</p><p><b>potential impact</b></p><p>While a company the size of Novartis could absorb a 15-day suspension in Japan relatively easily, the possible impact in actual monetary and reputational terms could still be large. For calendar 2014, Novartis reported Japanese pharmaceutical sales (excluding Sandoz, Alcon, vaccines and consumer health) of $2.7bn, a fall of 11% at constant currency and hit by lower Diovan sales, a general biennial price cut, and "the impact of issues related to investigator initiated trials."</p><p>This equates to a monthly figure of $225m, or roughly $113m over 15 days.</p><p>Peak annual Japanese sales of Diovan reached around $1bn at reimbursement prices, making it one of the top selling drugs in the country, but along with competitors such as Takeda's Blopress (candesartan) it is now available generically. </p><p>Reflecting the troubles at the business and in addition to the executive restructuring, Novartis Japan has also implemented a voluntary retirement program, which the group said accounted for the bulk of the $207m in restructuring charges it booked in the fourth quarter </p><p>(An earlier version of this story was published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>).</p><p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-admits-hiding-thousands-of-serious-Glivec-Tasigna-side-effects-353658" target="_new">Novartis admits hiding thousands of serious Glivec, Tasigna side effects</a> 2 September 2014</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-hid-10000-Japanese-safety-reports-review-uncovers-352407" target="_new">Novartis hid 10,000 Japanese safety reports, review uncovers</a> 18 June 2014</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shake-up-at-Novartis-Japan-as-second-scandal-emerges-351043" target="_new">Shake-up at Novartis Japan as second scandal emerges</a> 4 April 2014</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Media-throng-as-Novartis-Tokyo-office-raided-350143" target="_new">Media throng as Novartis Tokyo office raided</a> 20 February 2014</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Novartis-in-spotlight-again-over-Japan-study-practices-350042" target="_new">Novartis in spotlight again over Japan study practices</a> 14 February 2014</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Novartis-facing-criminal-probe-in-Japan-Diovan-data-affair-349190" target="_new">Novartis facing criminal probe in Japan Diovan data affair</a> 9 January 2014</p>
