<p>On 27 March 2015, the European Medicines Agency's advisors gave the BI-Lilly Diabetes Alliance a little push forward, voting in favor of Synjardy, its fixed dose combination (FDC) of SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance (empagliflozin) with metformin for treating Type 2 diabetes mellitus. But while the decision in Europe is important, Europe is not a big market for FDC products in diabetes. BI-Lilly's real battle in the SGLT2 market will be fought around the long-term safety data of SGLT2 compounds and on their efficacy when combined in fixed doses with gliptins.</p><p>Assuming the EMA gives Synjardy the formal nod in a May and that that the US FDA follows suit later in 2015, BI-Lilly will join Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca in having SGLT2s in all the major markets, and FDCs with metformin approved in both Europe and the US. </p><p>BI-Lilly has catching up to do: Datamonitor's forecast has the Jardiance franchise worth $650m by 2019, well behind market leading SGLT2 inhibitor Invokana (canagliflozin) from J&J ($1.5bn across the franchise by 2019) and behind SGLT2 pioneer, Farxiga (dapagliflozin), worth a projected $1.1bn by 2019 and now solely owned by AstraZeneca.</p><p>The safety profile of SGLT2 inhibitors as a class is under scrutiny with phase III trials on a number compounds suggesting genital tract or urinary tract infections in 5-10% of the patient population, a significantly elevated level over placebo or comparator groups. The European approvals of Jardiance, Farxiga and Invokana, and their combinations with metformin, are all associated with additional monitoring requirements both for infection rate and kidney function.</p><p>Probably a more significant regulatory decision for BI-Lilly came eight weeks ago in February 2014 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-LillyBI-dual-mechanism-diabetes-drug-Glyxambi-356510" target="_new">when FDA approved</a> its fixed dose combination of Jardiance and Tradjenta (linagliptin), Glyxambi, after the combination lowered blood glucose levels better than either component in a trial involving 686 adults. That approval gives BI-Lilly a chance to make some in-roads into the $3bn market of Merck's Januvia (sitagliptin) before Merck and partner, Pfizer, get their own gliptin-SGLT2 combo to market sometime after 2017.</p><p>AstraZeneca, with its FDC of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin (Onglyza) expected to launch in 2016, will chip away at Januvia's market, too.</p><p>The CHMP positive opinion has to be ratified by the EMA, probably in May 2015.</p>
