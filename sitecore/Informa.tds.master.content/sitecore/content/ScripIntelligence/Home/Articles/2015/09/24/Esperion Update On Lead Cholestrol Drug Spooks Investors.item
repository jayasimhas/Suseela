<p>Worries Esperion Therapeutics is falling behind competitors in the race to bring the next generation of powerful cholesterol-lowering drug to market suddenly surfaced this week, sending the US biotech's share price plummeting more than 40% on Tuesday. </p><p>Investors were spooked by unexpected news during a company management update on Sept. 28 that the FDA is now urging Esperion to "promptly" launch an expensive cardiovascular outcomes study as part of the drug's late-stage assessment, which may need to be completed prior to a regulatory review, depending on the analysis of the drug's risks versus its benefits.</p><p>That contrasted with the upbeat message on Aug. 17 when management said that, based on FDA feedback, it would not need a completed cardiovascular outcomes trial before seeking US regulatory approval of ETC-1002, a statement which had suggested FDA confidence in the reliability of LDL-cholesterol-lowering as a surrogate for clinical benefit in certain high-risk populations extends beyond the statin and PCSK9 classes. Based on that scenario, Esperion on that investor call said it expected to start Phase III development by the end of 2015.</p><p>ETC-1002 is the lead pipeline candidate of Esperion, a spin-off from Pfizer Inc. The drug is an inhibitor of ATP citrate lysase, an enzyme on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Statins and ETC-1002 have a similar mechanism in that they inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, decrease intracellular cholesterol, up-regulate LDL receptors and cause increased LDL-C clearance and reduced plasma levels, according to Esperion. Like statins, ETC-1002 is a small molecule oral drug.</p><p>Investors had up until Monday expected the regulatory pathway for ETC-1002 to look similar to the route taken by PCSK9 inhibitors now making their way to the US market, with initial approval in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease and a broader indication likely to await results from ongoing outcomes trials. </p><p>That now looks in doubt. </p><p>Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a reaction note that "ESPR [Esperion ] management's update to investors following receipt of the official End-of-Phase 2 Meeting Minutes from the FDA leaves us somewhat confused, as the company's message and plan now appears quite different than what it initially said following the meeting."</p><p>The analysts said that while the underlying intent of the company might have been "to add some conservatism to their communications", it was nonetheless worrying and that consequently "we are finding it more challenging now to understand the exact path forward for ETC-1002 and how the drug will ultimately fit into this rapidly evolving therapeutic area, especially with other, more powerful drugs either now on the market or in late-stage development." Their assumptions for the company "now include a 20% probability that ESPR will need to complete a cardiovascular outcomes study prior to approval, potentially delaying launch by 3 years or so."</p><p>That's because cardiovascular outcome trials for novel cholesterol drugs are expensive and can take many years to complete.</p><p>Thus "the significant risk that goes along with an investment in ESPR right now makes it difficult for us to recommend the stock to investors," the Credit Suisse analysts concluded.</p><p>Esperion Therapeutics itself declined to comment on the sharp fall in its share price which followed the Sept. 28 update. </p><p>Asked by <i>Scrip</i> via email what management's strategy now is, and whether it has changed since August, Esperion Therapeutics replied: "Our strategy remains to ensure the most efficient route to market for ETC-1002 that puts patients and their caregivers first in terms of efficacy, tolerability and convenience."</p><p>It said its plan "is to conduct multiple Phase III clinical trials that will separately evaluate patients with statin intolerance and patients who are inadequately treated despite maximally tolerated statin therapy &ndash; what we've previously referred to as the "add-on-to-statin" patient population." </p><p>Asked why its latest update had caused consternation among investors, the company replied: "the communication was to ensure an accurate portrayal of our feedback from the FDA, namely that the FDA has encouraged us to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes trial promptly, which would be well underway at the time of the New Drug Application submission and review, since any concern regarding the benefit/risk assessment of ETC-1002 could necessitate a completed cardiovascular outcomes trial before approval.</p><p>Asked whether the timeline for ETC-1002 been extended and if so, by how much, Esperion said exact timeline estimates for the potential approval of ETC-1002 "will not be available and/or communicated until the first half of 2016, but we have confidence that the program will be well designed to bring ETC-1002 to patients in the most efficient manner."</p><p>"Our team remains focused on delivering a Phase III program that will be acceptable to major regulatory agencies around the world."</p><p>"We are committed to this patient community and we are designing studies to bring a drug to market that we believe is best for them clinically and economically. We have no doubt that patients, physicians and payers will welcome a new, oral LDL-C lowering therapy, especially those patients who are considered to be intolerant to statin therapy," the company email said.</p><p>
