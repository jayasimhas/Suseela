<p>Martin Shkreli, the hedge funder-turned-pharma CEO, who jacked up the price of a rare disease medicine from $13.50 to $750 per pill after acquiring it last month, found out the hard way that picking a fight with the HIV/AIDS advocacy community and presidential candidates already on the war path about skyrocketing drug prices wasn't the best idea.</p><p>Caving under pressure, Shkreli, CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, went on the evening U.S. network news programs on Sept. 22 to announce he planned to now lower the price of Daraprim (pyrimethamine) &ndash; although he said he was not quite ready to disclose what that cost would be for patients, only declaring it would be something that's "more affordable" and less than $750, but would still allow the company to make a "very small profit."</p><p>On <i>ABC</i>, Shkreli tried to defend the more than 5,000% price increase for Daraprim, a drug used to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection often seen in HIV-infected patients, and malaria, by insisting the American public has a "fundamental misunderstanding of the way the pharmaceutical companies operate."</p><p>He argued that at the $750 per pill price, Daraprim, which Turing acquired in August from Impax Laboratories, "is not a substantially profitable drug."</p><p>Going on <i>NBC</i>, Shkreli said it was "easy" for people to look at the large price increase for Daraprim and assume Turing was "gouging" &ndash; an accusation made by presidential candidates former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).</p><p>"But when you find out that the company is not really making any money, what does that mean?" Shkreli said. "I think in the society we live in today it's easy to want to villainize people, and obviously we're in an election cycle where this is very, very tough topic for people and it's very sensitive."</p><p>The criticism over Daraprim's significant price increase was fast and furious on Twitter &ndash; where patients, doctors and advocates condemned Turing and Shkreli, who was called the "most hated man in America."</p><p>But it was a tweet from Clinton that caused a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">panic on Wall Street</a> on Sept. 21 &ndash; with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index immediately dropping, falling as low as 5.4%, before closing down 4.5%.</p><p>The timing of the news reports over the price hike couldn't have been better for Clinton &ndash; who already had planned to lay out her health care plan this week.</p><p>And indeed, the Daraprim controversy set the stage for Clinton to grab the spotlight from her rival Sanders, who already had been critical of companies that had been acquiring older drugs and then boosting their prices &ndash; even <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introducing legislation</a> earlier this month to try to rein in prescription drug prices. </p><p><b>Clinton's Plan</b></p><p>During a speech in Iowa on Sept. 22, Clinton disclosed the details of her plan to control drug costs &ndash; which actually mirrors Sanders' ideas and even some of those proposed earlier by President Barack Obama.</p><p>Like Obama, Clinton wants to lower from 12 years to seven the exclusivity protection period for innovator biologics against biosimilars &ndash; insisting that to do so would save the U.S. federal government $5bn over 10 years. </p><p>She said the FDA also should give prioritized, expedited review to biosimilar applications that only have one or two competitors in the marketplace.</p><p>Under Clinton's plan, drug makers that receive federal funding and tax credits would be required to invest a "sufficient amount" of their profits in research and development, although she didn't specifically say what that portion would be.</p><p>She also wants to cut the corporate tax breaks companies get for direct-to-consumer advertising on their prescription drugs, which Clinton said would save the federal government "billions" of dollars over the next decade.</p><p>Those funds, Clinton said, would be used to help pay for making permanent and simplifying the R&D tax credit. </p><p>She said she also would establish a mandatory FDA preclearance procedure for the ads funded through user-fees paid for by pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure that the commercials provide clear and understandable information to consumers.</p><p>Also included in her plan was a proposal to "fully fund" the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs to "clear out their multi-year" drug approval backlog, which Clinton said "has kept competitors off the market."</p><p>By taking those actions, prescription drug prices overall would be lowered, she said.</p><p>Clinton also wants to prohibit so-called pay-for-delay deals, in which innovators pay generic makers to keep their products off the market for a period of time.</p><p>She also wants to permit Americans to import drugs from abroad &ndash; "with careful protections for safety and quality" and allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
