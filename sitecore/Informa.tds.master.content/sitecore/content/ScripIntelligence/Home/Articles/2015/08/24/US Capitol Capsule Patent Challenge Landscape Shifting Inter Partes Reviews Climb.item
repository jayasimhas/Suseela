<p>While biopharmaceutical firms initially were slow to pursue <i>inter partes</i> reviews (IPRs) &ndash; trial proceedings intended to be a faster and more affordable way for third parties to challenge patents than going through the American court system &ndash; there's been a significant uptick in the past year in the number of petitions filed involving drug makers' patents, which has more than doubled from 4% the previous two years to 9%, said Washington lawyer Eleanor Yost, a partner in Goodwin Procter's intellectual property litigation group. </p><p>IPR proceedings, which are conducted by the US Patent & Trademark Office (US PTO) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), were created under the <i>American Invents Act (AIA) of 2011</i> and became available in September 2012.</p><p>The PTAB also administers two other types of post-issuance review proceedings created by the AIA: transitional program for covered business method patents (CBM) and post-grant reviews (PGRs).</p><p>But it's been the IPRs that have caught on like wildfire &ndash; with the US PTO acknowledging the filings have been much more popular than the agency ever anticipated.</p><p>Indeed, Michelle Lee, director of the US PTO, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Patent-Office-Takes-Steps-To-Improve-Trial-Board-Reviews-360036" target="_new">last week reported</a> that as of July 31, the PTAB had received 3,655 petitions, of which 3,277 were IPRs, versus 368 CBMs and 10 PGRs.</p><p>Yost, who along with some of her colleagues at Goodwin Procter recently <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/News/Press-Releases/2015/07_29_15-Goodwin-Procter-Publishes-Guidebook-On-Litigating-Pharmaceutical-Cases.aspx" target="_new">published a report</a> analyzing IPRs, <i>Pharmaceuticals at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board</i>, pointed out the filings are likely to continue to be dominated by the electrical, computer, mechanical and business method arts over those involving biopharmaceutical patents &ndash; with the latter sector unlikely to ever reach the level of the others.</p><p>Nonetheless, she predicted the IPR filings involving drug makers' patents will keep rising as entities become more comfortable in pursuing them. </p><p>Generic firms Mylan, Apotex and Amneal are the three top filers of IPR petitions, according to the law firm's report, while Teva and Novartis and its Sandoz unit also have filed multiple petitions. </p><p>Someone else who has sprung up as a major player in filing the petitions to invalidate drug companies' patents and has become a factor in the increase of IPRs in the past year, Yost told <i>Scrip</i>, is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-reform-its-all-about-the-trolls-no-Bass-358182" target="_new">Kyle Bass</a>, chief investment officer at the hedge fund firm Hayman Capital.</p><p>Bass, who has filed several IPRs under an organization he created, known as the Coalition for Affordable Drugs (CAD), targeting drug patents from firms like Acorda, Biogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Horizon, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Pharmacyclics, which is now part of AbbVie, Pozen and Shire, has become the person the Washington biopharmaceutical industry trade groups love to hate.</p><p>Indeed, Jim Greenwood, president and CEO of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), in February accused Bass of opening a "new door to abuse of the US patent system, exploiting the US PTO's patent challenge proceeding as part of his cynical short-selling strategy against innovative biotech companies that are delivering transformative therapies to patients in need."</p><p>"Congress never intended for the patent challenge system to be utilized by those attempting to profit from the confusion the current system creates," Greenwood charged. "Such efforts not only damage the value of companies working on cures, but hurts those sick and suffering patients and their families who are eager for cures."</p><p>BIO is among those who have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-What-to-do-about-inter-partes-reviews-Reforming-reforms-359257" target="_new">called on Congress</a> to include in the pending House and Senate patent reform bills measures that would prohibit those with a financial interest in the value of the patent owner firm's stock or have demanded payment in exchange of filing an IPR petition from pursuing the PTAB avenue.</p><p>Critics of Bass, who is expecting a decision from the PTAB later this week on whether it will review the first of the CAD-filed IPR petitions, which is challenging the patents on Acorda's multiple scleorosis drug Ampyra (dalfampridine), also want Congress to only allow competitors of the patent owners to file IPR petitions.</p><p>Goodwin Procter's analysis revealed that many biopharma innovators increasingly are finding their patents entangled in parallel petitions filed at U.S. district courts and at the PTAB &ndash; a situation in Yost and her report co-authors said likely will further complicate the legal-regulatory interplay under the already complex scheme established by the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984</i>, which created the FDA approval pathway for generic drugs.</p><p>Among the several drugs Goodwin Procter identified whose patents are caught up in dual IPR petitions and pending Hatch-Waxman litigation are Lilly's Alimta (pemetrexed), Teva's Treanda (bendamustine), UCB's Vimpat (lacosamide) and Merck's Cubicin (daptomycin).</p><p>While some may hesitate to use the IPR filings where the patents are or will be the subject of Hatch-Waxman litigation because of the prospect of a time consuming appeal, the lack of a final district court opinion and the potential for litigation estoppels, Yost and her Goodwin Procter colleagues suggested companies may find the PTAB process a faster and more cost effective alternative to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">biosimilars litigation</a> process under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i>, whose complexities <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Fights-Over-Interpretation-Of-Biosimilars-Law-Disruption-To-Markets-Future-359974" target="_new">may take three to five more years</a> to get worked out.</p><p>"Initiating a PTAB post grant trial proceeding against one or more patents may be one strategy to avoid the 'When can we sue?' question," they said. "Filing IPRs could also increase the pressure on the patent owner to license the patents and settle."</p><p>One major positive change that may be coming to the IPR process that could be somewhat of a game changer for the biopharmaceutical industry, Yost said, is a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Patent-Office-Takes-Steps-To-Improve-Trial-Board-Reviews-360036" target="_new">proposed rule</a> issued last week by the US PTO aimed at permitting patent owners to include new testimonial evidence, such as expert declaration with their patent owner preliminary response (POPR).</p><p>Currently, petitioners are allowed to include detailed information, including expert testimony, in their petitions to make their case in trying to invalidate patents, Yost noted. </p><p>Three months later, the patent owners can submit a POPR, she said.</p><p>"But the scope of that response is limited right now in that the patent owner can't present new testimony or they can't bring an expert in for the first time," Yost explained.</p><p>Patent owners, particularly biopharmas, felt they were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BIO-More-work-needed-on-patent-bill-to-ensure-balance-358777" target="_new">hobbled</a>, she added.</p><p>If finalized, the proposed rule, which is among a package of PTAB change proposals issued last week, will put patent owners on more of an even playing field with the petitioner during the "pre-institution" phase, or early part, of the proceeding, Yost said.</p><p>While putting together the more substantive documents will be more expensive and time-consuming for patent owners, the POPR is going to become a more on-the-merits discussion, she said.</p><p>BIO and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said that while they appreciated the US PTO's efforts, the groups complained the proposed PTAB rule changes don't go far enough in addressing all of the problems with IPR process.</p><p>The US PTO is accepting comments on the proposed PTAB rules until Oct. 19, Yost noted, although she added she doubted the agency would roll out any final rules until early 2016.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">Amgen/Sandoz Zarxio Fight Not Done; Rehearing Sought</a></p><p>Amgen and Novartis unit Sandoz both decided a ruling last month by a panel of appeals court judges involving the latter firm's biosimilar Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) referenced on the former company's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) was a glass half-empty kind of decision &ndash;
