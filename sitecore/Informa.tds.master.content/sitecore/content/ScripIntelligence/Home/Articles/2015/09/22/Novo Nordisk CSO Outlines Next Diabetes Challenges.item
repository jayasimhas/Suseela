<p> Novo Nordisk, market leader for diabetes therapies, released data fora number of its products at the recent European Association for the Study of Diabetes meeting, but the company is still striving for domination of the entire diabetes spectrum, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, executive vice-president and chief science officer at Novo Nordisk, told <i>Scrip </i>in an exclusive interview on the side lines of the event. </p> <p> One of the biggest current challenges for all diabetes drug developers is pricing pressures, he said. </p> <p> &quot;We all have to make meaningful improvements to the current standard of therapy and these have to be improvements that payers are willing to pay for,&quot; he noted. In addition, these benefits have to be &quot;more evident and less incremental&quot;. </p> <p> However, this is a challenge Novo Nordisk's science chief has welcomed. &quot;As long as we are up against a fair opponent [i.e. a healthcare authority] who acknowledges innovation when innovation is there, then I like this challenge because what we want to do is create products, like <i>Tresiba</i> (insulin degludec) or semaglutide, which are truly changing people's lives,&quot; Krogsgaard Thomsen said. &quot;We will play fair and square and create real innovation for patient benefits as long as society is willing to acknowledge what we have done and reward it with access.&quot; </p> <p> Another challenge that Novo Nordisk is keen to tackle is the study of other barriers facing diabetes patients outside of access to the right medicines. The company has recently published the results of a study it sponsored on patient perceptions of what diabetes control actually means, compared to physician perceptions. The company highlighted in a press conference at the EASD meeting that everyday burdens on diabetes patients and the confusing language used by doctors and other parties can lead to poor disease management. </p> <p> &quot;We as an industry have to use our technologies to accommodate patient needs in a better way than we have previously done,&quot; Krogsgaard Thomsen noted. &quot;I think Novo Nordisk is paving the way in this regard; we are very patient-centered and have been so for a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are still advancing down this path by taking more direct voices from patients on board as we do our research.&quot; </p> <p> Novo Nordisk's scientific leader added that he was &quot;worried&quot; that payers and governments are going to &quot;dictate&quot; too much around this topic. &quot;The patient voice should be included in the future because if they cannot handle the disease and its management, whether it's diabetes or something else, then whatever new treatment we have is going to be a failure. This is why we will do even more to focus not only on molecular brilliance, but on this innovation put into a context where simplicity and ease of use are also important,&quot; he said. </p> <p> In addition to companies adapting to include the patient voice in research, Krogsgaard Thomsen said it was vital that all regulators start accepting patient-reported outcomes too. &quot;When a patient has taken the time to write out how they see their situation when they enter a clinical study and as they leave that study, how their life has changed in the meantime, if their physical and psychological wellbeing has improved, I think the patients deserves that regulators acknowledge this.&quot; </p> <p> The way forward in this area is to work in unison with all parties, Krogsgaard Thomsen said. &quot;We need to work more closely with both regulatory agencies and patients and physicians to come up with the right sets of PRO surveys and questionnaires that are relevant for the disease in question and are validated enough for the regulators.&quot; </p> <h2> Expanding Business Everywhere </h2> <p> Emerging markets also present a complex situation for most international pharms and Krogsgaard Thomsen highlighted a couple of scenarios which have been learning curves for Novo Nordisk. </p> <p> &quot;Take Brazil,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a market where we want to win the insulin tender. We have to make a bid to the Brazilian government in which we will offer insulin at a daily cost of US$0.20 and the essence is we will cater for the big volumes of patients who cannot afford anything but human insulin in a vial.&quot; However he noted that Tresiba has also been launched in the region to target Brazil's private healthcare market. &quot;There are fortunate people in Brazil who are willing to spend what it takes to get the best. The important thing for us is that in some way we will be there for everyone,&quot; he said. </p> <p> Krogsgaard Thomsen noted that finding this balance in some emerging markets is a complex task that not all industries face. &quot;Aston Martin doesn't make cheap cars for poor people. You can do that as a car maker but when you are a producer of medicine you can be accused of not being responsible. So we want to maintain our social license to operate responsibly by catering to the needs of people not only with different kinds of diabetes but also in terms of different financial capabilities.&quot; </p> <p> He added that while Novo Nordisk was a global pharma, &quot;there are markets where we are not as strong as we deserve to be based on the products and the people we have in the company.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;There are some Latin American markets where we will be aiming to strengthen our presence,&quot; he said. &quot;Overall we are happy but the places where we are not yet close to 50% or more of the market share we need to look at what we are not doing well enough. Do we need different types of skillsets? Do we need to negotiate in a different way with the authorities? We need to assess what is not working and take the correct action and get better.&quot; </p> <h2> Biggest developments </h2> <p> While there are challenges ahead for Novo Nordisk in diabetes, Krogsgaard Thomsen also highlighted the company's successes over the past 12 months and laid out his big expectations for the next year. </p> <p> He picked Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide product as the biggest success for the company in 2015. </p> <p> <preform><iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/225041776&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe></preform></p> <p> Novo Nordisk is also experimenting with an anti-interleukin21 product in combination with <i>Victoza</i> (liraglutide). The candidate was reserved by the company last year from its inflammatory disease program, which it decided to discontinue. The firm is now taking the drug into a Phase II trial for type 1 diabetes. Krogsgaard Thomsen said 12 months on Novo Nordisk still believes holding onto this product and divesting the rest of its inflammation program was the right step. &quot;The way our company started was with type 1 diabetes research, so we owe it to this population that even when a project is riskier or not as likely to be profitable we should still try. This is the intention here,&quot; he said. <br> <br> Krogsgaard Thomsen added that one year later this decision has had two effects on the wider business. &quot;All the skills and excellent people that had been employed in our inflammation area are still mostly with the company and they are now working on obesity, diabetes and protein chemistry. They are doing good stuff to the benefit of other patient cohorts,&quot; he noted. &quot;At the same time we did have some very good projects that have been picked up by big companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb. So the innovation we created in our labs is now coming to fruition hopefully in the labs of others. We have not spilt everything we had and that is important to us as scientists.&quot; He said Novo Nordisk is now streamlined to focus on all aspects of diabetes, where the company &quot;excels&quot;. <br> <br> For the rest of 2015, and moving into 2016, Novo Nordisk has a lot on its plate. The company is eagerly awaiting data from a head-to-head study of once-weekly semaglutide versus AstraZeneca's once-weekly <i>Bydureon</i> (exenatide extended-release). &quot;My hope is that we can document, just as Victoza is the most efficacious GLP-1, that semaglutide will have similar results up against a fierce competitor like Bydureon,&quot; Krogsgaard Thomsen said. &quot;We hope to see semaglutide positioned to be the next class leader, in a post-Victoza era.&quot; <br> <br> The company is also awaiting decisions on Tresiba and <i>Ryzodeg</i> (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) in the US. It expects to get a verdict from the FDA for both products in October this year. <br> <br> In early2016 data from the firm's ongoing cardiovascular outcomes study LEADER &ndash; which is assessing cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes patients treated with Victoza &ndash; will begin to emerge; as well as clinical results from a comparison study of Tresiba and Sanofi's <i>Lantus</i> (insulin glargine). </p>
