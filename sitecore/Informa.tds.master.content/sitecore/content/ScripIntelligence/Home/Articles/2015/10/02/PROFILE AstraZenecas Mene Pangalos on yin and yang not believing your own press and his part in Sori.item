<p> Menelas (Mene) Pangalos is AstraZeneca's executive vice-president of innovative medicines and early development. It's his job to build the pipeline that CEO Pascal Soriot says will generate revenues $45bn in sales by 2023. He was sitting right next to Mr Soriot last May when top-level executives from AstraZeneca and Pfizer were called in to parliament to answer questions from the UK government regarding implications of a merger between the companies. The merger, of course, failed to go ahead &ndash; not least owing to AstraZeneca's management robust resistance. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/5F904F05ABB2406CA1CA6D0C585F1458.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>Mene Pangalos, AZ executive vice-president of innovative medicines and early development</i> </p> <p> In the latest instalment of <i>Scrip's</i> executive profile series, Dr Pangalos talks of his early scientific and leadership influences, the importance of speaking at the right volume, and the myths about the pharma industry that he finds maddening. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What are the key things that shaped you when you were growing up?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>Mene Pangalos</b></i><b>:</b> The importance of family, my Greek heritage, and wanting to be successful. My family struggled to give me a good education and so although they never pushed me, I had an inherent drive to succeed because I felt they had sacrificed so much to educate me. I'm an only child, so there was a bit of added pressure because of that too. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Probably my two PhD supervisors &ndash; David Bowen who was my academic supervisor at the Institute of Neurology (at University College London) and Derek Middlemiss, my industrial supervisor, who was at Merck and whose department was sponsoring my PhD. </p> <p> David Bowen was one of the scientists to first identify the cholinergic deficit in Alzheimer's disease. His research led to the foundations of acetylcholine replacement therapy and the discovery of drugs like Aricept, which are still used today to treat Alzheimer's disease. He was also funded by Astra, as it happens. David was incredibly rigorous as a scientist - really tough - I had to grow a hard skin in his lab! But in turn I learnt about being rigorous: being questioning, being curious and working hard, and most importantly we did really good science. </p> <p> One of the things I remember well whilst working on the neurochemistry and neuropharmacology of Alzheimer's disease in the late 1980s, was the discovery of the first familial APP mutations, the first genes identified to be causative in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. I remember some of the scientists being on TV news and radio and stating &quot;We're going to have a cure for Alzheimer's disease in the next five to ten years.&quot; David stormed into the lab the following morning and I remember him taking me to see some of those scientists who had made the discovery and listening to David telling them off for being irresponsible and raising people's and patients' expectations for a quick cure of Alzheimer's disease unrealistically. He taught me how difficult it is to develop drugs and challenging it is to turn scientific discovery into medicines. David's passion and his energy, and his fantastic scientific reputation, were truly inspirational. Because of his extensive networks and reputation it also opened doors for me and helped introduce me to other great scientists. It taught me the importance of working with the best people you possibly can. </p> <p> For all his passion and energy he was not the best manager of people. I didn't know any better at the time and was somewhat young and impressionable. That's where Derek Middlemiss provided a great balance. Where David was the yin, Derek was the yang of my education as a scientist. Derek was also a great scientist and drug discoverer but he was also interested in thinking about my future career and development. He was the mentor who suggested that I should head out to America to do a post doc: &quot;Go and work in a great lab in the US, and then after that you can do what you want, wherever you want.&quot; </p> <p> So David was an inspirational scientist because of who he was and how he was, and Derek taught me a lot about leadership and development. Both these things have really stayed with me in terms of how I think about science and developing people. Without that I don't think I would have got to where I am today. Both great guys. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What's the best advice you have ever had?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: One of them is never to believe your own press clippings. And it's true - through my career I've seen lots of great people stumble because they started to believe they were fantastic or invincible. Don't surround yourself with people who will always say yes. Surround yourself with people who will challenge you and push you to be the best. And that's both scientifically and from a leadership perspective. </p> <p> Figure out what you truly believe in and don't waver from that. And that came from those early conversations with Derek. From then, I've always been driven by science, and having that science recognized through publication and through peer review. It's stayed with me throughout my career. The driving force for every group that I've worked in or led has been to do really good science, to be rigorous, to ask challenging questions, and to not to take the easy route to just get the 'yes' answers you want because you'll end up making lots of mistakes and wasting lots of money. Today I call it 'scientific truth-seeking' and I think it is one of the most difficult things for scientists to do. </p> <p> As I've reached more senior levels in companies one other good bit of advice I remember from one of my senior commercial colleagues is that when you speak, people will hear you &quot;at setting 10 on the volume dial, even if you think you're speaking at setting 1.&quot; You don't realize how much what you say can influence and impact people. You might think you are having a debate or conversation, while the other person thinks you are giving instructions. So remembering to be humble, approachable and clear that you are indeed having a discussion is good advice as you grow in your career. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Who do you admire in the industry and why?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Roy Vagelos, and not just because he's Greek and from an island close to where my family is from! Roy for me was the first CEO I had heard of that was a scientist and drove his business based on good scientific decision making. He was interested in science, he understood science, and many of the successes that Merck had decades ago was I think down to that fact. </p> <p> I've been in many companies with great CEOs, but where decisions have been driven by finances or quarterly earnings. What I love about being at AstraZeneca is that Pascal [Soriot] is doing the same sort of thing at AstraZeneca [as Roy Vagelos did at Merck]. He's driving us to make decisions based on scientific evidence and on defining the unmet medical need. We are not driven by the size of the financial opportunity or the peak year sales but by if there is a clear unmet medical need and if we have data that gives us confidence that the drug works and that we have the capability to turn it into a useful medicine for patients. I love it. As a scientist there's nothing more you could want. And for me, Roy was one of the first CEOs in pharma to drive that type of culture. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: If you weren't in this line of work, what would you be?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Does being a doctor count as this line of work? I suppose that's a bit too close to what I do to be interesting. I am an avid amateur photographer. So I think if I hadn't been blessed with being reasonably good at science, I would probably have tried to do something in the arts, probably photography. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What has your proudest moment been?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: I have to go with the approval of olaparib [Lynparza, an oral inhibitor of polyadenosine 5-diphosphoribose polymerases (PARP) for the treatment of ovarian cancer, was approved in the US and EU in December 2014]. Olaparib has been such a great challenge. It was written off a few years ago. The work we did to keep that molecule moving through the pipeline because we believed in the science, to get many of the issues sorted out and to get the diagnostic approved. It was a remarkable effort by a remarkable team. And to see patients getting the drug now - it's absolutely incredible and a gives us a wonderful sense of achievement. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: And your most difficult moment?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Every site I've had to close. There are decisions made that make absolute sense but when you're standing up in front of colleagues, friends, people that you've worked with for years, having to tell them that their site, their job, is going &#8230; it is an incredibly tough thing to do. </p> <p> Also, breaking up my neuroscience group at Wyeth when we were acquired by Pfizer. We'd built up a really fantastic group that had become one of the company's best research groups. Then we had to dismantle the whole thing. I knew that group of people so well; I had been working with them for seven years. That was absolutely gut-wrenching. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What was your first ever job?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Working in the laundry department at the Novotel in Hammersmith (in London). Cleaning towels. It was a very unpleasant job, waiting for all those dirty towels to come down the chute. I was sixteen and it definitely made me study harder! </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: How did you get into the industry?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Through Derek [Middlemiss, from Merck]. I spent a year at the Terlings Park site in Harlow during my PhD. I loved that environment. They were doing fantastic research, publishing in <i>Nature</i> and <i>Science</i>. That PhD for me was the beginning of me starting to think about how science could be translated into medicines and a benefit for patients. </p> <p> Derek then went to SmithKline Beecham, I went to the US and worked as a post doc at Mount Sinai in New York and then at BMS [Bristol-Myers Squibb] for a year. Then I went to work in Belgium for Janssen, in a completely different area to neuroscience, applied molecular biology. I was there for three years. Derek kept calling to tell me to come and work with him at SmithKline Beecham and I kept on saying, 'No, I'm happy'. Then there was a change in circumstances at Janssen and that led me to finally joining Derek at SmithKline which later became GlaxoSmithKline. </p> <p> When I talk to students and some of our young emerging scientists at the start of building their careers, one of the bits of advice I try to give them is about taking risks. I think about my career, and about the transitions I have made. Going from a neuroscience job in the US to an applied molecular biology group in a country where I didn't speak the language, and from a post-doc position to one where I became a group leader. Big uncomfortable jumps, yet each one worked out and I ended up doing well and growing rapidly as a scientist and a leader. Encouraging people to take those jumps and risks, pushing themselves to grab opportunities when they see them, is a fun thing to do. Every job that I've taken, I've thought: &quot;Can I do this, should I do this? I'm really comfortable with what I'm doing now so why move and get uncomfortable again?&quot; But every time it's been fantastic. </p> <p> In the same way, as people have taken risks on me throughout my career, I like taking risks on people too. If I see dynamic emerging scientists who I think have got the makings of a fantastic scientist and leader, I challenge them to see how we can accelerate their careers. People can be quite conservative about taking risks on people. You get it wrong some of the time, but when you get it right it is fantastic to see the speed at which people can grow. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: What's your favorite gadget?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: My iPhone. I don't go anywhere without it. It keeps me in touch with my daughters, my emails, my PowerPoint presentations. It's funny because before I had one, I never thought I'd want to be without my Blackberry. Now I can't imagine life without an iPhone. Bit boring but there you go. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Tell us one myth about the industry that you would like to set straight.</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: That we don't do good science. That drives me mad. That we're not interested in high-quality basic research. I think we do some of the best research in the world in our industry, some of the most rigorous research. If there's one thing I've been on a mission all my career, it is to prove to people, whenever I go out to academia or give presentation at a conference, that the quality and the depth of science that we do is as good as any of the top academic institutions. </p> <p> <i><b>Scrip</b></i><b>: Finally, what's your contribution to Pascal Soriot's vision of $45bn sales by 2023?</b> </p> <p> <i><b>MP</b></i>: Building the pipeline. Pascal came in two years ago, and what he's enabled us to do is put our foot down on the scientific accelerator. </p> <p> Take olaparib. It had been stopped. We had taken it for a Phase III investment decision and it had been turned down and written off as a molecule. Pascal came and one of his first questions was, &quot;Why isn't this molecule in Phase III?&quot; And then low and behold it was in Phase III, we started having conversations with regulators about filing and before you know it, it has been approved. What he's done is amazing. </p> <p> My contribution is helping to push the science agenda, building our scientific reputation as the best research organization in the world and delivering our pipeline. </p>
