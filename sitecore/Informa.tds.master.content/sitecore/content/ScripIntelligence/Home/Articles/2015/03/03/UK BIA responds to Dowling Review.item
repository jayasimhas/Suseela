<p>The UK's BioIndustry Association (BIA) has responded to Dame Anne Dowling's <a href="http://www.raeng.org.uk/policy/dowling-review" target="_new">review</a> of business-university research collaborations by highlighting certain areas for policymakers to examine. These include: technology transfer office (TTO) processes and incentives that align with those of industry and value longer term benefits over short- to medium term revenues; improving the technology transfer experience, building a culture and framework within academic departments that supports and rewards researchers to collaborate with industry and appropriate incentives to do so; increased funding for industrial PhDs, larger scale grants to employ more post-doctoral researchers on a project for longer, and funding to enable purchase of expensive but industrially relevant equipment, e.g. for biomanufacturing. However, the BIA was also keen to note that "despite inherent challenges" in collaborations between academic and industry partners, there are many examples of varied and successful UK partnerships, with knock on benefits for the UK economy, businesses and patients. Government initiatives including the Biomedical Catalyst and a focus on supporting strategically important areas such as regenerative medicine and synthetic biology (two of the 'Eight Great Technologies'), which have helped to spur collaboration between university partners and industry and have been of particular benefit to SMEs, according to the BIA.</p>
