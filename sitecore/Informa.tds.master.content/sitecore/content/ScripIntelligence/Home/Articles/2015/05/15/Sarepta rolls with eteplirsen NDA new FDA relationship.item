<p>Maybe it was having a new CEO that put Sarepta Therapeutics in a better light with the FDA, which finally gave the company the green light to move forward with its rolling new drug application (NDA) for its experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug eteplirsen.</p><p>And investors were elated &ndash; driving shares of Sarepta as high as 67.8% on 20 May, before closing at $26.24, up $9.96, or 60.2%.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, however, only put the chances of Sarepta gaining the FDA's blessing for eteplirsen at 56%, which is 6% below the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Sarepta said it will submit the first two components of the eteplirsen NDA this week, with plans to complete the submission by midyear.</p><p>This comes after the company held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA, where Sarepta agreed to initiate the submission and also submit the non-clinical and chemical, manufacturing and controls components of the application by the end of this week. </p><p>Sarepta interim CEO Dr Edward Kaye, who took the reins of the company in March after the resignation of Christopher Garabedian &ndash; who appeared to have an oftentimes rocky relationship with the FDA &ndash; called the initiation of the rolling NDA a "significant milestone for the Duchenne community," which has advocated fiercely for regulators to quickly approve the experimental DMD drugs, which includes BioMarin Pharmaceutical's drisapersen, whose own rolling NDA was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioMarin-completes-rolling-NDA-for-Duchenne-drug-drisapersen-358083" target="_new">completed late last month</a> &ndash; an application <i>BioMedTracker</i> said had an 84% chance of gaining US approval &ndash; and PTC Therapeutics' Translarna (ataluren).</p><p>No wonder the DMD community is so passionate about getting a drug on the market. The rare neuromuscular disease is severely debilitating &ndash; and fatal. In fact, it is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood &ndash; affecting about 1 in every 3,500 live male births, with about 20,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year.</p><p>DMD, which occurs mostly in boys, is caused by mutations in dystrophin, a gene essential for muscle function.</p><p>Duchenne advocates were successful last summer in getting the FDA to respond to a "We the People" White House petition &ndash; a platform created in 2011 by the Obama administration to allow any American over 13 years to call on the federal government to take action on requested matters.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-chief-cranks-it-up-with-captains-of-industry-353164" target="_new">the response</a>, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Centers for Drug Evaluation and Research, pledged that regulators were "willing to explore the use of all potential pathways" for therapies against DMD.</p><p>After Sarepta <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarepta-soars-on-US-NDA-plan-for-Duchenne-drug-eteplirsen-351388" target="_new">revealed last year</a> it likely would not be submitting an NDA to the FDA for eteplirsen, an exon-skipping medicine, until mid-2015 rather than in 2014 as the company earlier planned because of the need for additional data &ndash; something the agency said it had been consistent in communicating all along to the firm &ndash; Pat Furlong, president and CEO of the advocacy group Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, sent a letter to regulators expressing the Duchenne community was "devastated" and "disappointed" by the news and urged the agency to be flexible in its review of applications to treat the disease.</p><p>This past fall, regulators apparently felt compelled to try to calm the DMD community and clear up the confusion that resulted from certain public statements made by Sarepta over the timing of the eteplirsen NDA filing.</p><p>Indeed, in an unusual move, the FDA posted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-to-Sarepta-This-is-what-we-really-meant-354795" target="_new">statement on its website</a> explaining its side of the interactions it had with Sarepta, declaring the agency recognized the unmet need and the "dire" urgency to make new treatments available for the "devastating" disease.</p><p>In its back-and-forth with Sarepta, the FDA asserted it had "worked extensively," "been working intensively," "consistently advised," "worked closely, "consistently stated" and "expressed willingness."</p><p>While regulators appeared to be exasperated with Sarepta last fall, finally giving the go-ahead with the rolling NDA for eteplirsen may signal the firm may now be on better terms with the FDA &ndash; or at least, investors seemed to think so on 20 May. </p><p>"We do not think it is feasible that management could have misread the agency, given the controversy surrounding their dialogue in the past, and believe the agency is indicating a favorable bias that will result in NDA acceptance and priority review," said RW Baird analyst Brian Skorney. </p><p>He said he expected the FDA to hold an advisory committee meeting this fall &ndash; noting the agency's "Great Room" at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, may not be able to hold the number of people wanting to attend. </p><p>Many on Wall Street anticipated a favorable outcome at the FDA for Sarepta, despite its wobbly past with the agency.</p><p>Analysts also said that even if BioMarin beats Sarepta to the market, eteplirsen still is expected to be successful, given the unmet need. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
