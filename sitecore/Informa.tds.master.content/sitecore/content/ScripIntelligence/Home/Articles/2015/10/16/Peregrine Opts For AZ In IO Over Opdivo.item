<p><p>Peregrine Pharmaceuticals is putting its faith in one immuno-oncology frontrunner over another, as it nixes one trial and expands its work with another big pharma. But is the biotech betting on the wrong horse?</p><p>The biotech announced Oct. 15 that will be adding a second trial to its previously announced research collaboration with AstraZeneca. The pair said in late August that they will test AstraZeneca's programmed cell death ligand -1 inhibitor (PD-L1) durvalumab in combination with Peregrine's own immunotherapy bavituximab. The combination is planned to enter a Phase I/Ib study to test the combo in a variety of solid tumor types. The company expects to move forward with the most promising indications. </p><p>AstraZeneca and Peregrine will also move the combination therapy into a Phase II trial in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the biotech said on Oct. 15</p><p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Both trials are <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-Takes-A-Fancy-To-Peregrines-Bavituximab-In-IO-Combo-360084" target="_new">expected to begin</a> in early 2016. </p><p><b>Shifting Gears</b></p><p>While the tie-up between Peregrine and AstraZeneca seems pretty in line with other immuno-oncology collaborations that have been inked over the last year, Peregrine briefly noted in its press release that the Phase II trial in NSCLC would be replacing a previously announced trial. </p><p>"We expect this extension of our collaboration with AstraZeneca will allow us to run a much more cost-effective and time-efficient trial than would have been possible under our previously planned study using Opdivo as the combination drug in the same lung cancer population," said Joseph Shan, VP of clinical and regulatory affairs of Peregrine. </p><p>"This Phase II study offers several key advantages including a supply of durvalumab that will enable us to conduct a global trial that can enroll patients more rapidly. In addition, the expanded collaboration provides for a more cohesive clinical program utilizing the same PD-L1 and other biomarker analysis across both the new Phase II trial and the already planned Phase I/Ib study," he explained. </p><p>Peregrine announced in June that it would test bavituximab in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's already-approved and highly-touted PD-1 inhibitor <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) in a Phase II trial in patients with NSCLC. That trial was meant to start before the end of this year and will no longer take place. Peregrine CEO Steve King said in an interview that the previously announced study was not a deal with BMS and was simply an effort by the biotech to test its drug with an already-approved PD-1 inhibitor. </p><p>Had Peregrine stuck with the Opdivo trial, the biotech would&rsquo;ve had to purchase the other drug to provide it for the trial and would've been constrained by the indications and places that Opdivo had gained approval. </p><p>The trial swap comes just days after AstraZeneca announced that it has <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AstraZenecas-Immune-Oncology-Strategy-Suffers-Setback-360999" target="_new">suspended recruitment</a> in two trials that were testing durvalumab in combination with another of its immunotherapies, AZD9291, in patients with NSCLC. Patients in the AZD9291/durvalumab arm of a Phase Ib study showed a higher incidence of interstitial lung disease.</p><p>Peregrine management seemed unfazed by the halted trial and noted in an interview that the study was in patients the EGFR mutation. King added that similar toxicities were not expected in the trial of bavituximab and durvalumab. "You never know what is going to happen when you start combining things," he said, "but we've been happy with the safety profile of bavituximab so far."</p><p>King said that Peregrine has been receiving a lot of attention lately from other parties in the immuno-oncology field due recent data that showed bavituximab may have potential in patients who are PD-L1 negative, which could open up plenty of opportunity for Peregrine to partner. </p><p>Oncology drug developers have come to the conclusion that combination therapies of two &ndash; even three or four &ndash; oncology drugs will eventually lead to finding a cure for a variety of cancers. Companies have been teaming up left and right in order to test their respective drugs with as many options as possible in hopes of hitting the right combination for each patient population.</p><p>
