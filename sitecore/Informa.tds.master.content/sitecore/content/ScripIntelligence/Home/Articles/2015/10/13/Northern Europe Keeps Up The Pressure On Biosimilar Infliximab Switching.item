<p>Northern European efforts to boost the use of biosimilar infliximab rather than Janssen's Remicade are gathering pace, with the Norwegian NOR-SWITCH study having been extended by 26 weeks to complete the switch from Remicade to Celltrion's biosimilar, Remsima, and a number of similar studies being conducted by both industry and non-commercial sponsors in the Netherlands. </p><p>A key aim of these efforts is of course to reap the rewards in terms of lower spending on the increasingly expensive biotech medicines. Norway, for example, has already used its tendering process to secure a high discount for Remsima, which has now taken about 80% of the infliximab market, a situation that is pretty much mirrored in Denmark. </p><p>Earlier this year the Dutch medicines agency, the MEB, officially <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dutch-take-the-lead-on-biosimilar-switching---others-to-follow-357882" target="_new">came out in favor</a> of biosimilar switching, to be followed shortly after by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Boost-for-biosimilar-switching-as-Finns-add-their-backing-358581" target="_new">Finland's regulator Fimea</a>. These countries all believe that more data from switching studies will offer physicians more evidence that biosimilar infliximab can be safely and effectively prescribed in place of the originator.</p><p>The NOR-SWITCH study, which began in October 2014, is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching from Janssen's Remicade to Celltrion's biosimilar Remsima in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and chronic plaque psoriasis. </p><p>Designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group Phase IV study, NOR-SWITCH is being sponsored by the Norwegian health ministry and will eventually recruit some 500 patients. One-year results of the study are now expected in August 2016, according to Steinar Madsen of the Norwegian Medicines Agency. He told <i>Scrip</i> the study had been extended in order to allow all the remaining patients still taking Remicade to be switched to Remsima. </p><p>Norway has led the way in infliximab switching, launching a health service tender for infliximab in February 2014 that saw Remsima being offered at a 39% discount to Remicade, and a second tender in February this year when the discount was upped to 69%, with the result that Remsima's market share <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Norways-infliximab-experience-shows-effect-of-deep-price-cuts-on-biosimilar-success-358091" target="_new">shot up to 51% by March</a>.</p><p>Moreover, its share of the market has continued to rise since then. Madsen said: "Interestingly, biosimilar infliximab has taken over the whole market in Norway and Denmark." He cited data from Norway showing that Remsima's share had reached 79.9% in September, and said that in Denmark it had done even better, taking practically all (96.2%) of the market.</p><p>But while the biosimilar discount is around 70% in all Nordic countries, this has not led to a similar leap in biosimilar use in Finland and Sweden. Madsen said that in Finland Remicade was still the market leader, albeit not by much, and in this case it was Hospira's biosimilar, Inflectra, that was challenging the originator, with 39.9% of the market in September, while sales of Remsima were flat. </p><p>In Sweden, Remicade has succeeded in holding its own against biosimilar incursion, with Remsima having just 9.4% of the market, and sales of Inflectra remaining low. </p><p>"And that is what is happening across Europe &ndash; uptake is high in some countries and low in others," Madsen observed, noting that biosimilar discounts in Europe are in the range of 45 % to 70%. </p><h2>Dutch Switching Studies</h2><p>Meanwhile, a number of Phase IV studies evaluating Remicade and biosimilar infliximab with a view to switching from one to the other are being conducted in the Netherlands.</p><p>One of these is the BIO-SWITCH study led by the Dutch hospital group Santeon, which is looking at the effect of switching treatment from Remicade to a biosimilar in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis or psoriatic arthritis.</p><p>The study, which began in July this year and is due to end in 2017, is to recruit 200 patients who are currently taking Remicade and will told of the possibility of switching to a biosimilar. Both those who want to switch and those who don't will be invited to take part, and data will be collected during routine outpatient clinical visits for a 12-month follow-up period. The overall outcome will take account of two other studies with Remicade and Remsima: PLANETRA and PLANETAS.</p><p>"Taking into account the overall data from the PLANETRA and PLANETAS study, previous positive experiences with switching to a biosimilar, the viewpoint of relevant (inter)national stakeholders and the large cost difference, switching from Remicade to infliximab biosimilar in RA, SpA and PsA patients might be a sensible option," the BIO-SWITCH sponsors say. </p><p>"This should be done in shared decision making with the patient and should be monitored with caution. It is expected that in 2015 a substantial number of patients will switch from Remicade to infliximab biosimilar in daily clinical care," they add.</p><h2>SIMILAR Study</h2><p>Another non-commercial Dutch switching study, again with the involvement of Santeon, is the SIMILAR trial, which is looking at the feasibility of moving patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission from Remicade over to Inflectra. It will aim to show the non-inferiority of the biosimilar in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease in remission during a three-month treatment period. </p><p>Celltrion and its partner Hospira are separately running a study with the primary aim of showing non-inferiority of biosimilar infliximab versus Remicade in IBD. The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term secondary efficacy and overall safety of their biosimilar in comparison with Remicade up to week 54. Three sites in both the Netherlands and Belgium are taking part in the study, during which 53 patients will be treated with Remicade and 53 with biosimilar infliximab, and will be switched at week 30. </p><p>A further trial, called SECURE, is under way at nine Dutch hospitals, with 11 patients of a planned 159 included so far, according to a presentation last month by Lissy de Ridder, a pediatric gastroenterology specialist at the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam. It is intended to demonstrate that the infliximab serum concentration of Remsima is non-inferior to that of Remicade 16 weeks after a switch from Remicade to Remsima, in subjects with CD, UC or RA in stable remission for more than 30 weeks.</p><p>The UK is also taking steps to facilitate the use of biosimilar infliximab, and this summer the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) issued some <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-how-to-switch-NHS-patients-from-Remicade-to-a-biosimilar-359800" target="_new">practical advice</a> for the NHS on how to manage the introduction of Remsima and Inflectra. </p>
