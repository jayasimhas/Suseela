<p>The European Medicines Agency has published the final version of its revised guideline on biosimilar products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues, following a drafting and consultation process that lasted more than two years.</p><p>Adopted by the CHMP on 26 February and coming into effect on 1 September this year, the guideline explains the non-clinical and clinical requirements for securing approval of biosimilar insulins. It differs from the earlier version in that it covers intermediate and long-acting insulin preparations and insulin analogues, and takes a risk-based approach to non-clinical <i>in vivo</i> studies.</p><p>It also offers more detailed guidance on the design, study population, insulin doses and endpoints of the clamp study, and further clarifies expectations regarding the safety study and the criteria for waiving such a study.</p><p>The non-clinical section covers pharmacodynamic and toxicological studies, while the clinical section covers pharmacology and clinical efficacy and safety. The guideline also addresses the pharmacovigilance plan and extrapolation of indications. </p><p>The revised guideline, which replaces the first version dating from 2006, has been a long time coming. This is mainly because it had to be redrafted and put out for a rare second public consultation in 2014 last year as a result of the substantial number of comments received in the first consultation, which ran from December 2012 to June 2013 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Keen-interest-in-EU-biosimilar-insulin-guideline-prompts-second-consultation-351676" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 8 May 2014). </p><p>The second consultation round drew less interest &ndash; only four stakeholders submitted comments &ndash; although between them they made a fair number of suggestions, some of which were rejected and others accepted and incorporated into the guideline. </p><p>The stakeholders were the European Biopharmaceutical Enterprises (EBE), which is part of the European industry federation EFPIA, the European Biosimilars Group, part of the (newly renamed) European Generic and Biosimilar medicines Association (EGA), the Indian company Wockhardt, and the Dutch regulatory agency, the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB). </p><p>Among the changes accepted by the EMA were the following:</p><ul><li>The EBE suggested that, where possible, specific assays capable of distinguishing between exogenous and endogenous insulin should be used to evaluate PK properties. It also suggested the following change to the text: "The issue of immunogenicity can only be settled through clinical trials of sufficient duration, which for subcutaneous administration is at least 12 months. Since anti-drug antibodies, if any, usually develop early on, a 6-month study investigating incidence and titres of antibodies to the test and reference medicinal products should be performed completed pre-approval. Data at the end of 12 months could be presented as part of post-marketing commitment." The EMA only partially accepted this change, saying that a statement had now been included to the effect that, depending on the results, the study may have to be extended up to a total duration of 12 months. </li><li>On the question of clinical efficacy, the EBG said it fully agreed with the statement that apart from the comparative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessment there was no anticipated need for separate efficacy studies. The justification for this is the lack of efficacy endpoints sensitive enough to detect clinically relevant differences between two insulins, it noted. It proposed the following change, which the EMA accepted: "There is no anticipated need for specific efficacy studies since endpoints used in such studies, usually HbA1c, are not sensitive enough for the purpose of detecting clinically relevant differences between two insulins."</li><li>The MEB noted that the revised guideline stated: "Together, these assays should cover the whole spectrum of pharmacological/toxicological aspects known to be of clinical relevance for the reference product and for the product." However, the Dutch agency said that increased mitogenic activity was mainly a property of insulin glargine, and was less prominent for other insulins, and that even for insulin glargine "this mitogenic property is hardly clinically relevant in the <i>in vivo</i> situation. Mitogenic properties will in general, therefore, not add to the evaluation of biosimilarity." The EMA said that regarding the need for mitogenicity testing, it accepted the MEB's arguments and had changed the text of the guideline accordingly.</li></ul><p>The revised guideline can be found at <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2015/03/WC500184161.pdf" target="_new">http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2015/03/WC500184161.pdf</a></p><p>
