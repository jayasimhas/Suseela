<p>US drug makers everywhere owe Amarin Pharmaceuticals a big pat on the back for challenging the FDA's threats of bringing misbranding actions against manufacturers that seek to promote their drugs for off-label uses, said Philadelphia lawyer James Beck, counsel in the life sciences industry group at Reed Smith.</p><p>Amarin's win on Aug. 7 in convincing a federal judge in New York to permit the firm to share "truthful and non-misleading" information about unapproved uses of the company's US-approved fish oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) "without incurring liability for misbranding" is a huge step towards dissolving the FDA's blanket ban against all off-label promotion, Mr. Beck told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Through its victory, the New Jersey biotech has cleared a path for other drug makers &ndash; not only making it easier for them to follow in Amarin's steps, but more likely the FDA will ease up on its restrictions and be more willing to discuss options with manufacturers for promoting safe and effective off-label uses, rather than threatening the companies with prosecution, he said.</p><p>Companies that want to engage in off-label promotion need to be confident the speech they planned to engage in is truthful and non-misleading, Amarin lawyer Joel Kurtzberg, a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, told reporters.</p><p>But Mr. Kurtzberg advised firms to first check with the FDA on its views.</p><p>If the FDA doesn't agree with the firm and there's a dispute, he said, the company could take its case to court &ndash; something Mr. Beck said was just made easier by the Amarin ruling.</p><p>But Mr. Beck urged manufacturers to take control of the situation and proactively bring off-label promotional materials to the FDA to seek its blessing, which he said the agency may be more willing to do in light of the Amarin decision.</p><p>Plus, Mr. Beck said, by going to the agency first, "the companies are the ones picking the battlefield rather, than the FDA."</p><p>The FDA declined to comment on the ruling from Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York &ndash; a decision that sent shares of Amarin soaring as high as 27% on Aug. 7.</p><p>But the agency, nonetheless, already has started moving towards revising its policies about off-label promotion &ndash; declaring earlier this year it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-to-hold-off-label-drug-meeting-358249" target="_new">planned to hold a public meeting</a> devoted to the topic and is working on "comprehensive guidance" about manufacturer communications involving unapproved uses of approved products.</p><p>"The FDA is not stupid. They understand what's going on," Mr. Beck declared, noting the agency is now recognizing it's going to have to bend somewhat on off-label promotion, rather than what it's been doing: Just saying "no."</p><p>The declaratory judgment granted to Amarin by Judge Engelmayer, Mr. Beck said, was a "significant decision" because it provides a mechanism for any company engaged in a similar off-label dispute with the FDA to seek an injunction within the jurisdiction of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p><p>The Second Circuit was the same court that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Americans-unwilling-to-sacrifice-Medicare-but-back-better-Part-D-deal-339427" target="_new">overturned</a> the October 2008 conviction of a New York sales representative, Alfred Caronia, for conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce related to discussions he had with doctors about unapproved uses for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' narcolepsy drug Xyrem (sodium oxybate). </p><p>The appeals court held that a pharmaceutical company has protected rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution to engage in off-label promotion, as long as it is truthful.</p><p>Mr. Beck said the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Americans-unwilling-to-sacrifice-Medicare-but-back-better-Part-D-deal-339427" target="_new">didn't pursue an appeal</a> to the Supreme Court of the Caronia decision because if the agency lost, there would be "chaos," because it would have no fallback position on the off-label issue.</p><p>Amarin asserted in its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amarin-files-free-speech-suit-against-FDA-358256" target="_new">complaint</a> the FDA's threat to bring misbranding charges against the company for promoting the "truthful" off-label use of Vascepa was "chilling" its constitutionally protected free speech under the First Amendment &ndash; basing that argument on the Caronia decision.</p><p>The FDA, however, contended that if Amarin's off-label promotion was endorsed by the court, it would "set a course toward undermining the drug approval process that Congress enacted in 1962" &ndash; an argument Judge Engelmayer didn't buy.</p><p>"Amarin had a very strong case here for a lot of reasons," not the least of which was the fact it had engaged in an additional study &ndash; ANCHOR &ndash; the details of which were worked out with the FDA in advance under a special protocol assessment agreement, insisted Floyd Abrams, a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, who has been leading the company's legal team in the lawsuit.</p><p>"The test did everything it was designed to test," Mr. Abrams told reporters on Aug. 7 &ndash; pointing out the study demonstrated that Vascepa significantly reduced triglyceride levels in patients with persistently high triglyceride levels.</p><p>The only reason the court fight was necessary, he said, was because "the FDA won't acknowledge the test was a complete success" &ndash; instead <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-expanded-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-358103" target="_new">rejecting</a> Amarin's proposal earlier this year to expand Vascepa's approved indication.</p><p>But Judge Engelmayer's order was clear the off-label language Amarin wanted to share with doctors was truthful and non-misleading, Mr. Kurtzberg said. </p><p>He said the judge's opinion also gave Amarin the go-ahead to promote off-label uses of Vascepa "generally" &ndash; meaning even if the company ventured outside of the language laid out in the court's order, "as long as it's truthful and non-misleading, they would be OK."</p><p>Mr. Kurtzberg acknowledged, however, there would be "some element of risk if they deviated from the approved statements."</p><p>"But they're OK as long as they are truthful and non-misleading," he said.</p><p>Mr. Kurtzberg said it's difficult to predict now how the FDA will react to the decision in the Amarin case.</p><p>And, he said, "it remains to be seen whether this decision will influence what the FDA advises to the industry" in guidance or otherwise.</p><p>The FDA has 60 days to appeal Judge Engelmayer's ruling. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
