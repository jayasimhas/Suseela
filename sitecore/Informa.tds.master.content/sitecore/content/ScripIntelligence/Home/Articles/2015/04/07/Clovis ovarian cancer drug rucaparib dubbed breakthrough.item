<p>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy status to Clovis Oncology investigational agent rucaparib as monotherapy to treat advanced ovarian cancer in patients who have received at least two lines of prior platinum-containing therapy, with BRCA-mutated tumors, inclusive of both germline BRCA (gBRCA) and somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutations. </p><p>Shares of Clovis jumped 12%, or $8.34, in after-hours trading on 6 April.</p><p>Rucaparib is an oral, potent inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 being developed for the treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, specifically in patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA, commonly referred to as "BRCA-like" or "BRCAness." </p><p>Data from Clovis' ARIEL2 study demonstrated that 70% of evaluable BRCA-mutant patients achieved a RECIST or CA-125 response, and 65% achieved a RECIST response. </p><p>Responses were observed in both germline and somatic BRCA-mutant tumors. </p><p>ARIEL2 recently was expanded into a registration study, which will include an additional 300 women with recurrent disease after at least three prior lines of chemotherapy.</p><p>Data from the study are planned to serve as the basis of a new drug application for rucaparib as an ovarian cancer treatment, which the firm plans to submit in 2016.</p><p>The breakthrough therapies designation was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> under the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act</i> to speed the development and review processes for medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases.</p><p>To gain the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a>, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.</p><p>As of 20 March &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 71 of the 244 requests for the breakthrough designation it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 121.</p><p>As of 31 March, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least 11 of the 49 requests it has received for breakthrough status, denying at least 34.</p><p>At least two breakthrough therapy designations have been withdrawn after being granted.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
