<p>With the FDA set to make a decision any day on whether it will approve Apotex Corp.'s pegfilgrastim biosimilar, Amgen Inc. is seeking to block the product from entering the US market for at least six months after the medicine gains the agency's blessing.</p><p>Amgen, whose long-acting human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) is the product on which Apotex's biosimilar is referenced, has asked US District Court for the Southern District of Florida to impose a preliminary injunction to restrain the latter firm from marketing its drug.</p><p>The two firms currently are entangled in a legal dispute over whether Apotex provided proper notice to Amgen of commercial marketing under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA) &ndash; the 2010 law that gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>Amgen is insisting the notice must be given at least 180 days before the first commercial marketing of Apotex's pegfilgrastim biosimilar and may not be given until the product is licensed by the FDA.</p><p>But Apotex is claiming that a ruling in July by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has made the notice requirement moot for any firms that have engaged in the BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures about what patents will be litigated &ndash; the so-called patent dance.</p><p>That lawsuit &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">first biosimilar case</a> to go before the Federal Circuit and the first chance for the court to interpret the BPCIA &ndash; also was filed by Amgen, which targeted Sandoz Inc. and its product Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), which was the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">first biosimilar approved</a> in the US.</p><p>In that suit, Amgen said Sandoz, a unit of Novartis AG, had violated the BPCIA's patent dance requirements when the Swiss firm withheld its biosimilars application and manufacturing information for Zarxio from the California innovator, whose Neupogen (filgrastim) was the reference product on which the biosimilar was based.</p><p>In a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">2-1 ruling</a>, the Federal Circuit panel said that when a biosimilar applicant opts out of the dance, notice of commercial marketing of biosimilars is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval &ndash; telling Sandoz it had to wait 180 days after Zarxio was cleared before it could launch the product.</p><p>But the panel also ruled 2-1 that Sandoz and other biosimilar makers could choose not to disclose their applications and manufacturing details &ndash; meaning, they could opt out of the patent dance.</p><p>Amgen and Sandoz both had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">sought a rehearing</a> of their arguments by the full Federal Circuit en banc, but on Oct. 16, the court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zarxio-Rehearing-Denied-Biosimilars-Questions-Await-Next-Case-361104" target="_new">denied the firms' petitions</a> &ndash; leaving several questions about the BPCIA unanswered.</p><p>After the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-biosimilar-of-Amgens-Neulasta-under-FDA-review-355732" target="_new">accepted Apotex's application</a>, known as a 351(k), for its pegfilgrastim biosimilar, the firm notified Amgen on Dec. 16, 2014, and the companies engaged in the patent-dispute resolution process.</p><p>Apotex, however, sent Amgen a letter this past April of notice of commercial marketing.</p><p>So Amgen filed a complaint, accusing Apotex, like it did Sandoz, of violating BPCIA's notice requirements &ndash; sending it before the FDA had licensed the pegfilgrastim biosimilar.</p><p>"Apotex gambled that the Federal Circuit would hold that notice of commercial marketing could be given before FDA approval. Apotex lost that bet," Amgen asserted in its motion for the preliminary injunction &ndash; holding to the argument the Federal Circuit had held that a biosimilar applicant "may only give effective notice of commercial marketing after the FDA has licensed its product," regardless of whether the companies had danced. </p><p> "Apotex's April notice was ineffective," Amgen insisted. "Rather than agreeing to give notice after any FDA approval, Apotex now argues that it need not give notice at all, because giving notice is not mandatory. But that argument is foreclosed by the statute and by the same Federal Circuit case."</p><p>Even though Apotex has complied with the provisions of the BPCIA by providing its 351(k) application, Amgen is arguing that does not excuse the biosimilar maker from the notice-of-commercial marketing requirement. </p><p>Apotex, however, has called Amgen's lawsuit a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Apotex-Amgens-Biosimilar-Lawsuits-A-Sham-Predatory-360865" target="_new">sham" and part of an "overall predatory scheme</a>" to monopolize the relevant market, with the intent to "delay, hamper, hinder and impede" the company from bringing its pegfilgrastim biosimilar to American patients.</p><p>Amgen's "exclusionary, anticompetitive and unlawful activities" threaten to damage Apotex by "forestalling, frustrating and preventing" its ability to complete, the biosimilars maker contended.</p><p>Earlier this month, the two companies filed a joint motion requesting a hearing and briefing schedule on Amgen's motion for preliminary injunction, which the company at that time said was forthcoming &ndash; showing up exactly when it said it would.</p><p>Under the joint motion, Apotex agreed it would not commercially manufacture, use, offer to sell or sell within the US or import into the country its pegfilgrastim biosimilar through an undisclosed agreed-on date &ndash; information that was filed under seal to "preserve the confidentiality," which the firms said was "commercially sensitive."</p><p>Apotex has until Nov. 6 to file documents opposing the motion for the preliminary injunction. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
