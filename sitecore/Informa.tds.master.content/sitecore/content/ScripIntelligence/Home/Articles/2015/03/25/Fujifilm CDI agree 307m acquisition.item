<p>Fujifilm is forking out $307m for US firm Cellular Dynamics International (CDI) in order to become "more competitive in the field of drug discovery and regenerative medicine," said Fujifilm CEO Shigetaka Komori. </p><p>Originally a maker of photo films, Fujifilm has been expanding its medical equipment and pharma businesses recent years. In November 2014, the company said it plans to invest around JPY400-500bn in strategic M&A over the coming three years. It also highlighted healthcare, highly functional materials and the documents business as its most promising units.</p><p>The Japanese firm will disclose the impact of the purchase on its consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2016 once the impact has been determined, it said</p><p>Fujifilm will obtain CDI via an all-cash tender offer to be followed by a second step merger. The Tokyo-based acquirer will purchase all issued and outstanding shares of CDI's common stock for $16.5 per share. The offer represents a premium of 108% to CDI's closing price on 27 March. </p><h2>Who is CDI?</h2><p>CDI was founded in 2004 and listed on Nasdaq in July 2013. The company saw global revenues of $16.7m in 2014 and had 155 employees as of 31 December last year. CDI &ndash; which has units in Madison, Wisconsin and Novato, California &ndash; has a technology platform which enables the production of high-quality fully functioning human cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), on an industrial scale.</p><p>Customers use CDI's products, among other purposes, for drug discovery and screening, to test the safety and efficacy of their small molecule and biological drug candidates, for stem cell banking, and in the research and development of cellular therapeutics. </p><p>Fujifilm said in a statement that the acquisition of CDI will allow it to gain entry into the area of iPS cell-based drug discovery support services. Fujifilm also plans to benefit from the combination of CDI's iPS cell technology and experience and Fujifilm's expertise in material science, engineering, and J-TEC's quality management systems. "The combination of these will help accelerate product development in regenerative medicine while expanding the commercial opportunities," it said. </p><p>Robert J Palay, chair and CEO of CDI, said: "CDI and Fujifilm share a common strategic vision for achieving leadership in the field of regenerative medicine. The combination of CDI's technology with Fujifilm's technologies, know-how, and resources brings us ever closer to realizing the promise of discovering better, safer medicines and developing new cell therapies based on iPSCs."</p>
