<p>Spun out from the University of Oxford, new born NightstarRx is finding its feet in the biopharma field and has closed a $35m series B funding, with which it will boost its inherited retinal disease pipeline.</p><p>Founded in 2014 and funded by a &pound;12m investment from Syncona Partners, NightstaRx is a company focused on therapies for retinal dystrophies. The company is set to begin its Phase III pivotal trial next year into treatment for choroideremia, an inherited X-linked recessive disease that eventually causes blindness. </p><p>NightstaRx's gene therapy technology consists of a viral vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) used to deliver a wild-type copy of the Rab-escort protein 1 (REP-1) gene (AAV2-REP1) into the retinal cells of patients with choroideremia. In patients suffering from the disease, the REP-1 transgene is missing which results in deterioration in their vision. The vector developed by a team of researchers led by professor Robert MacLaren of the University of Oxford, was being studied in a 12 patient Phase I/II clinical trial, which was completed this year. The data on the first 6 patients presented improvement in vision and was published in the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962117-0/abstract" target="_new">Lancet</a> in 2014. </p><p>There is currently no effective treatment for the disease; however NightstaRx is not the only one in the race to find one. Spark Therapeutics is also developing a treatment and is recruiting patients for its Phase I/II trial. Still, NightstaRx's CEO David Fellows said his company's product has the competitive advantage and is further ahead in development. </p><p>"We are both using AAV2 but we do have one regulatory element that they do not, WPRE, which in the animal model enhances expression of the transgene. We think we might have a superiority claim," Fellows said, but added that it "remains to be seen once we get through human clinical trials." As things now stand though, the biggest difference between the two is that NightstaRx has the lead while Sparks is a "little bit behind," he said.</p><p>If all goes to plan and the pivotal trial next year is successful for the choroideremia patients, NightstaRx will be in a position to file for approval in 2018/2019. Beyond this, it has five other inherited retinal disease programs affiliated with Oxford. </p><p>The company's long-term strategy is to be a gene therapy company that focuses on inherited retinal disease. Fellows emphasised that they have a "real strong know how and knowledge in manufacturing of AAV2" and that thanks to Robert McLaren's program in Oxford, they also have a "strong understanding of the disease." </p><p>The company is currently not looking for potential partners, as NightstaRx has the resources its needs at this point, Fellows said, and is therefore not involved in any collaboration discussions at present. </p><p><p>
