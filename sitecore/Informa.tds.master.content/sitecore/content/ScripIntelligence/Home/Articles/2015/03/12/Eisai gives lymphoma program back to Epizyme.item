<p>Eisai has given all development and commercialization rights of its EZH2 program, except for in the Japanese market, back to originator company Epizyme. The program includes lymphoma therapy EPZ-6438, a first-in-class inhibitor of EZH2, which is currently being evaluated in Phase I/II clinical studies. Under the new agreement, Epizyme will make a $40m upfront payment to Eisai, with a total of up to $20m in potential clinical milestone payments and up to $50m in potential regulatory milestone payments. Epizyme will pay Eisai a royalty at a percentage in the mid-teens on sales of EPZ-6438 outside of Japan, and Eisai will pay Epizyme a royalty at a percentage in the mid-teens on sales in Japan. Eisai will have a limited right of first negotiation for Asia rights if Epizyme decides to license Asia rights to a third party. Following completion of the transition of EPZ-6438 from Eisai to Epizyme, the Massachusetts-based biopharma plans to conduct a five-arm Phase II study in approximately 150 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. </p><p>Eisai and Epizyme struck up their original partnership in April 2011 when Epizyme received a $3.0m upfront payment from Eisai. Through to March 2013, Epizyme had received $11.3m in research funding payments and $7.0m in research milestone payments from its Japanese partner. </p>
