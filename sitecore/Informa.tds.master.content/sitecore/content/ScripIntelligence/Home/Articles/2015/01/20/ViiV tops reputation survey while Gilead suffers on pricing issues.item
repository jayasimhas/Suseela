<p>For the second year in a row, ViiV Healthcare has topped the reputation ranks for pharma companies in a survey of patient organizations. But Gilead, for whom 2014 should have been a year patients celebrated, slipped 12 places as a result of pricing controversies.</p><p><i>The Corporate Reputation of Pharma in 2014 &ndash; the Patient Perspective</i> represents the views of 1,150 patient groups, who were surveyed between mid-November 2014 and January 2015 on the corporate reputation of the pharma industry and individual companies.</p><p>ViiV came first out of 37 companies assessed by PatientView, the group which funded the survey, while Gilead slipped from second place in 2013 to 24<sup>th</sup> place in 2014. ViiV also ranked first in a number of sub-categories, including patient centricity, patient information, patient safety and useful products. Manuel Goncalves, head of government affairs, patient advocacy, community partnerships, access and communications for the HIV-focused company, said the company was delighted, adding: "Everyone at ViiV Healthcare is committed to put patients' interests at the forefront of what we do every day."</p><p>Gilead, meanwhile, was ranked second for useful products, but still managed to drop out of the top 10 altogether. The authors of the study attribute this to the company's "controversial pricing strategy for its new hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir)." The company declined to comment on the results of the survey.</p><p><b>Table 1: Overall rankings for corporate reputation from a patient perspective: Top-ten pharma companies</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Rank in 2014</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Rank in 2013</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ViiV Healthcare</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>First</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>First</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AbbVie</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Equal second</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Third</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novo Nordisk</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Equal second</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10th</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novartis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fourth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ninth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Lundbeck</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Equal fifth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>22nd</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Roche</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Equal fifth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Sixth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pfizer </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Seventh</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fourth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Janssen</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Eighth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fifth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>UCB</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ninth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>11th</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Eisai</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10th</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>-</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><p>Source: The Corporate Reputation of Pharma in 2014 &ndash; the Patient Perspective</p></table><p><p>Gilead's fall is indicative of the rising importance of pricing in the healthcare world following the financial crisis. How pharma companies handle pricing strategy, and explain it to the public, is becoming a crucial issue for reputation. Nick Adams, vice-president of corporate branding at Novo Nordisk, commented: "Particularly in Europe it's going to continue to be a major challenge for pharmaceutical companies to get paid for the innovation they're developing. I think pharma as a whole needs to be better at the story of why a drug can cost so much. Sometimes that story gets missed." Novo Nordisk itself jumped eight places in 2014, from 10th in 2013 to second in 2014.</p><p>Only 14% of patient groups surveyed ranked pharma as "good" or "excellent" at pricing drugs.</p><p>For Gilead, a company which has just had its most successful year ever with the blockbuster launches of two highly effective hepatitis C products, it has been particularly difficult to explain its pricing story. The company has been fighting against a tide of widely-reported protests from multiple quarters arguing that Sovaldi and Harvoni are "exorbitant" and "astronomical" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Editorial-Drug-cost-and-the-rules-of-engagement-356705" target="_new">11 February 2015</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Charity-seeks-to-overturn-European-Sovaldi-patent-356676" target="_new">10 February 2015</a>). </p><p>Somewhere along the line it seems to have been overlooked that Gilead has also arranged licensing agreements with generic companies in India to make Sovaldi more affordable to the poorest patients, and that it created other access agreements for its HIV medicines with Mylan and the Medicines Patent Pool (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MylanGilead-AbbVieMPP-boost-access-to-HIV-medicines-355355" target="_new">2 December 2014</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Has-Gilead-bottled-the-Indian-compulsory-licensing-genie-354000" target="_new">17 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Roche appears to have escaped the same reputational damage despite a public row with health technology appraisal body NICE, as well as patients, over the price of breast cancer drug Kadcyla (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/UK-patients-turn-on-Roche-to-demand-lower-Kadcyla-pricing-354589" target="_new">21 October 2014</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EMBARGOED-UNTIL-0001-BST-Friday-8-August-Roches-feud-with-NICE-deepens-over-Kadcyla-backbiting-353258" target="_new">8 August 2014</a>). This may be because the argument was contained to the UK. Roche rose from sixth place in 2013 to joint fifth in 2014.</p><h2>Pharma &ndash; Still Unpopular</h2><p>Meanwhile, the pharma industry as a whole is still languishing near the bottom of the rankings compared with other facets of the healthcare industry (see table below). The industry managed to outstrip health insurers, as it did in 2013 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Good-news-Pharma-narrowly-beats-for-profit-health-insurers-in-corporate-reputation-survey-350027" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 February 2014), but was outranked by pharmacists, medical device makers, generics makers and biotech.</p><p><b>Table 2: 2014 and 2013 rankings for eight healthcare industries</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Industry</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Rank in 2014</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Rank in 2013</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Retail pharmacists</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>First</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>First</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Medical device companies</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Second</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Second</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Private healthcare services</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Third</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Third</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Biotechnology companies</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fourth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Sixth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Generic drug manufacturers</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fifth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fifth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Multinational pharma</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Sixth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Seventh</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Non-profit health insurers</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Seventh</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Fourth</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>For-profit health insurers</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Eighth</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Third</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><p>Source: The Corporate Reputation of Pharma in 2014 &ndash; the Patient Perspective </p></table></p><p>While the survey noted that patients recognized the industry for being innovative and ensuring patient safety, the authors suggested that the following areas are still perceived by patients as needing work:</p><ul><li>Having a good relationship with the media</li><li>Providing high-quality information for patients</li><li>Providing access to clinical trials</li><li>Having a patient-centred strategy</li><li>Acting with integrity</li><li>Managing adverse news about products</li><li>Having ethical marketing practices</li><li>Providing services to patients outside its business remit</li><li>Being transparent in all corporate activities</li><li>Practising philanthropic activities</li><li>Fair pricing policies</li></ul><p>For pharma, however, the difficulty is that there is often a discrepancy between how companies perceive their activities, and how patients perceive them. Mr Adams commented, "I think it's a long stretch for patients to really understand what companies are doing on a long-term basis to increase transparency, and what companies are really doing to increase their patient focus." He points out that most patients, those who are not involved in intensive treatment regimens, only have an interface with companies via the product they are using. "To understand some of the bigger initiatives that a company does, you'd need a pretty good understanding of who that company is and what it does to really understand its benefits."</p><p>Anders Schroll, head of corporate communication at Lundbeck (which rose further up the rankings than any other company in 2014), thinks that time is a key issue, and that reputations are built over the long-term. "I think what we can see is patient organizations that know us also trust us and recognize that we are a company that is transparent, that is open, that is authentic and so on. But if you have groups that don't know us, and they are still skeptical, then it can take years to change that view."</p><p>However, it is becoming increasingly important for the industry to impress patients as they become more active stakeholders. Mr Schroll notes: "If you look back in the past century it was the doctor that diagnosed, and also chose which medication the patient would have. Nowadays we're in a situation where it's likely that the patient comes to the doctor having already diagnosed themselves because they have been talking to friends and looking it up on the internet, and they also have a clear idea of what treatment they need, so in that case you have a much more active patient." </p><p>Mr Adams agreed, saying: "We're looking at a future with more patient power and hopefully patients will have more influence, and so of course we want to maintain a strong reputation." </p>
