<p>The FDA on 3 February gave its approval to Pfizer to market Ibrance (palbociclib) as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) &ndash; granting the nod more than two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>Word of the approval came shortly before the markets closed on 3 February.</p><p>Shares of Pfizer closed at 32.02, up 37 cents, or 1.17%. The stock continued to climb in after-hours trading, rising to $32.15 at 5:30pm EST.</p><p>Ibrance is intended to be used in combination with letrozole as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease. </p><p>Ibrance, an oral drug, selectively inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle control and block tumor cell proliferation.</p><p>Dr Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, called the use of Ibrance with letrozole a "novel treatment option" for women with MBC.</p><p>The agency was not expected to make a decision on Ibrance until 13 April &ndash; the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Verdict-expected-for-Pfizers-palbociclib-in-April-354440" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Pfizer-seeks-to-market-palbociclib-in-ERHER--breast-cancer-353433" target="_new">18 August 2014</a>).</p><p>But analysts had anticipated an early win for the drug after Pfizer revealed last month the FDA would not convene its Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee to examine the company's application for the medicine (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/No-FDA-panel-bodes-well-for-Pfizers-palbociclib-356029" target="_new">09 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the likelihood of Ibrance gaining the FDA's blessing at 94%, which is 12% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum said Pfizer is expected to price Ibrance at $9,850 per month, which he said is in line with his market model. </p><p>He noted that consensus currently models risk adjusted peak sales of Ibrance at $3.8bn in 2020, lower than the $4.2bn Dr Schoenebaum had modeled. </p><p>He estimated that every $500m in additional sales during 2019-2020 would increase adjusted earnings per share by about 8 cents. </p><p>Dr Schoenebaum pointed out there are a few other companies with similar CDK inhibitors in development for breast cancer, including Lilly&rsquo;s LY2835219 and Novartis&rsquo; LEE011, although those firms are likely about 2 years behind.</p><p>In April 2013, Ibrance gained the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation &ndash; a status intended to expedite the regulatory process (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Pfizers-palbociclib-wins-breakthrough-status-342000" target="_new">11 April 2013</a>).</p><p>The FDA cleared Ibrance under its accelerated approval program &ndash; an expedited process for medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases based on clinical data showing the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients. </p><p>Pfizer will be required to submit data confirming Ibrance's benefits in MBC. </p><p>The company already has an ongoing Phase III trial of the drug.</p><p>Pfizer's new drug application for Ibrance was based on the results of the firm's Phase II PALOMA-1 trial, which compared the drug at the 125mg once-daily dose three out of four weeks in repeated cycles in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 2.5mg once daily on a continuous regimen alone in post-menopausal women with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. </p><p>The study achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival for the combination of Ibrance and letrozole versus letrozole alone &ndash; 20.2 months versus 10.2 months.</p><p>Final results for the secondary efficacy endpoints of duration of treatment and clinical benefit rate demonstrated superiority in the Ibrance plus letrozole arm, versus letrozole-only arm. </p><p>An initial assessment demonstrated a median overall survival (OS) of 37.5 months in the combination arm, versus 33.3 months in patients who received letrozole alone.</p><p>The OS observation at the time of final PFS analysis, however, was not statistically significant. </p><p>Pfizer said follow-up OS analysis will be conducted following the accrual of additional events.</p><p>Dr Schoenebaum noted the OS data were not included in the initial labeling, "as data considered immature."</p><p>There's also a recommendation for complete blood count prior to start of therapy, the beginning of each cycle and on day 14 of the first two cycles in the labeling.</p><p>The combination of Ibrance and letrozole was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previously reported data, the company said. </p><p>The most commonly reported adverse events in the Ibrance plus letrozole arm in PALOMA-1 were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue and anemia.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
