<p>Ralph Neas, president and CEO of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), said he plans to leave the lobbying group by this fall after serving in the position for four years.</p><p>GPhA said it has launched a search for a new chief, but said Mr Neas, a lawyer, will stay in the CEO position until September to ensure a smooth transition and has pledged to make himself available to the trade group through spring of 2016 to support and advise the new leadership. </p><p>Mr Neas took the helm at GPhA in September 2011, after serving as president and CEO of the nonprofit, nonpartisan National Coalition on Health Care.</p><p>Mr Neas had also previously spent time on Capitol Hill, working as chief counsel to Republican Senators Edward Brooke (Massachusetts) and Dave Durenberger (Minnesota). </p><p>For much of his time at GPhA, Mr Neas has been leading the charge against the FDA's proposal to allow generic drug makers to independently update their US product labeling with newly-acquired safety information before regulators review those changes.</p><p>The change could expose those manufacturers to liability when patients have adverse reactions &ndash; something those companies currently are protected against under two ruling by the US Supreme Court, known as Pliva v Mensing and Mutual Pharmaceutical v Bartlett, which found that federal law preempts state tort claims against generic makers (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">11 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Supreme-Court-to-weigh-generic-drug-liability-patent-burden-of-proof-standards-313148" target="_new">27 June 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-FDA-OK-preempts-state-flawed-design-liability-laws-344350" target="_new">24 June 2013</a>).</p><p>By law, generic makers must include the same information in their product labeling as the referenced innovator medicine.</p><p>But only makers of brand-name drugs currently are permitted to independently update the safety information on their product labeling by submitting a so-called changes being effected (CBE-0) supplement to the FDA. </p><p>If regulators signs off on those safety updates, then generic drug makers are required to include the same revisions in their labeling.</p><p>But when a generic company becomes aware of a potential risk, it cannot update its product labeling without first submitting supporting information to the FDA, which then determines if the labeling should be revised for both the innovator and the copycat medicines before an update can occur.</p><p>The FDA said its proposed rule, revealed by the agency on 8 November 2013, would create parity among application holders for safety information in product labeling (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">11 November 2013</a>).</p><p>But Mr Neas has asserted that if the FDA finalizes the rule, multiple versions of safety information could lead to unnecessary confusion and uncertainty for prescribers and other healthcare professionals, with harmful consequences for patients (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GPhA-Survey-evidence-FDA-generics-rule-would-confuse-prescribers-352415" target="_new">19 June 2014</a>).</p><p>By coincidence, on the same day that Mr Neas announced his pending departure from GPhA, the Supreme Court refused to hear a case brought by Teva against the Superior Court of California in Orange County.</p><p>The case stems back to a lawsuit brought by a California woman who claimed Teva breached its duty to warn about the risk of femoral fractures with its generic version of Fosamax (alendronate), which is marketed by Merck. </p><p>She claimed her injuries would have been avoided had the generic makers disclosed the risks. </p><p>The California court ruled in the woman's favor, rejecting Teva's preemption argument. The California Fourth District Court of Appeal denied the company's interlocutory petition for review. </p><p>With the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case, it's likely the next move will be up to the FDA. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
