<p>A bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Education and Related Agencies on 23 June would boost the fiscal year 2016 budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by $2bn over last year's spending level, but overall HHS funding would be cut by $646m.</p><p>Agencies whose funds would be sliced in FY 2016 include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which would lose $251m, or a drop of almost 4% from FY 2015. </p><p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration also would have its funding cut by $159m, or 4.4%.</p><p>But the bill includes $200m for the NIH to run President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> &ndash; matching a House proposal <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Spending-bill-seeks-1.1bn-NIH-boost-but-defunds-Obamacare-358984" target="_new">unveiled last week</a>. </p><p>The president's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-1st-wave-of-BRAIN-awards-not-usual-suspects-354230" target="_new">BRAIN Initiative</a>, which the NIH also is overseeing, also would get $135m in FY 2016 &ndash;an increase of $70m over last year.</p><p>The House bill actually would provide a higher amount of $150m total for the BRAIN Initiative &ndash; a collaborative project unveiled last year between the US government and the private and academic sectors aimed at shedding light on the complex links between brain function and behavior.</p><p>The NIH also would gain an extra $100m, or a total of $461m, for efforts aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance &ndash; also another initiative from President Obama, who actually called for $1.2bn total for that project.</p><p>The Senate subcommittee also approved an additional $350m increase for the NIH's National Institute on Aging &ndash; the lead agency conducting Alzheimer's research.</p><p>While Senator Patty Murray (Democrat-Washington), the ranking member on the subcommittee, said she appreciated the additional funds for biomedical research, "I am deeply disappointed" by the fact the legislation would "double down on the automatic budget cuts" under the 2011 Budget Control Act &ndash; the sequester. </p><p>"Instead of spending more time on partisan sequester level spending bills that have no chance of becoming law and only push us closer to another budget crisis, we should be working together to reach another bipartisan budget deal to roll back the automatic budget cuts to domestic and defense investments and allow this committee to truly work together to pass our bills," Senator Murray said.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
