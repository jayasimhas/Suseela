<p>Alchemia Limited planned to spin out its oncology business as Audeo Oncology through a US initial public offering in 2012, but now the Australian biotechnology company is selling its cancer drug operations to Panther Biotechnology, an acquisitive firm based in Chicago and San Diego.</p><p>Financial terms were not disclosed in Panther's 1 July deal announcement, but the companies agreed to close the transaction within the next 120 days. Completion depends on Panther's ability to move its US stock from trading on the Over-the-Counter Board to the Nasdaq exchange.</p><p>Panther is building its portfolio of therapies to treat neoplastic, autoimmune and antiviral disorders by acquiring external assets. With Alchemia's oncology business, Panther will gain the HyAct Drug Delivery Platform in which Alchemia has invested more than $70m during the past 15-plus years.</p><p>HyAct is a portfolio of preclinical through Phase III therapeutic candidates that are designed to exploit the structure and biological properties of hyaluronic acid. Alchemia's US IPO for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alchemia-preps-for-60mn-US-IPO-for-oncology-spin-off-Audeo-332608" target="_new">Audeo</a> would have funded Phase III for lead HyAct drug candidate HA-Irinotecan, but the offering was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Astellas-drops-Aveo-Alexion-Prothelia-collaborate-Akebia-files-Audeo-withdraws-IPO-350065" target="_new">withdrawn</a> in 2014. Panther will submit a new Phase III protocol to the US FDA in 2015 to advance HA-Irinotecan's development.</p><p><p><p><p>
