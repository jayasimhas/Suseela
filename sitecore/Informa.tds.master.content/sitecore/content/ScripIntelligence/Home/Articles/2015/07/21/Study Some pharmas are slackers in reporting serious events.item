<p>Drug makers miss the FDA's 15-day deadline 10% of the time for reporting deaths, life-threatening side effects and other serious or unexpected adverse events (AEs) related to the firms' medicines, researchers said on 27 July in an article published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Internal Medicine</i>.</p><p>Because the FDA uses the information to update drug warnings, "delays in reporting can have important public health consequences, particularly if manufacturers selectively delay reporting based on relevant patient outcomes," declared Dr Pinar Karaca-Mandic, of the Division of Health Policy and Management at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis and the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her co-authors.</p><p>The FDA deems medication adverse events as any that are "associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related." </p><p>Healthcare professionals and patients can voluntarily report a drug AE directly to the FDA through its <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm" target="_new">MedWatch</a> reporting system or alternatively to the manufacturer. </p><p>Drug companies that receive serious AEs reports &ndash; deaths, life-threatening side effects and those that require hospitalization or cause disability or birth defects &ndash; or reports of unexpected events, which are experiences not listed in the current labeling, from patients and healthcare professionals are <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm" target="_new">required</a> to provide them to the FDA "as soon as possible but in no case later than 15 calendar days of the initial receipt of the information," according to information on the agency's website.</p><p>Biopharmaceutical firms also are required to conduct an investigation of the serious or unexpected AEs and forward the findings as follow-up reports to the FDA.</p><p>For their study, Dr Karaca-Mandic and her colleagues examined "expedited" reports, or those subject to the 15-calendar day requirement, made to the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, or FAERS from January 2004 through June 2014.</p><p>Of the 1.6 million expedited reports, about 10%, or 160,383, missed the deadline, including 40,464 involving patient deaths, which were more likely than other serious or unexpected AEs to come in late.</p><p>The researchers said their findings likely are an underestimate of overall underreporting or misreporting, "given the anecdotal evidence of FDA warning letters to manufacturers alleging downward misclassification of serious AEs." </p><p>The researchers noted, however, the delay in reporting deaths to the FDA may be late because of the additional time it takes to verify information about the occurrence.</p><p>Nonetheless, <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i> editor Dr Rita Redberg insisted in an editorial that "Such reporting delays should never occur, as they mean that more patients are exposed to potentially avoidable serious harm, including death." </p><p>"No disciplinary actions have been taken when companies fail to submit reports to the FDA in the time frame required," she asserted. "Clearly, the lack of consequences contributes to a lack of deterrence for these illegal and dangerous delays."</p><p>Dr Redberg suggested suspension of drug sales or withdrawing approval could be an enforcement tool the FDA could begin to deploy immediately &ndash; arguing the agency has the authority to do so when manufacturers fail to establish and maintain records and make timely reports.</p><p>"Physicians and their patients must be knowledgeable of benefits, harms and alternatives for a wide choice of treatments, especially those recently approved for which clinical experience is limited," Dr Redberg declared.</p><p>She agreed with the <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i> article co-authors that one solution would be for physicians and patients to report AEs directly to the FDA rather than relying on manufacturers to do the job. </p><p>FDA spokesman Christopher Kelly told <i>Scrip</i> the agency "has not had the opportunity to review the study yet, and therefore is not in position to comment."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
