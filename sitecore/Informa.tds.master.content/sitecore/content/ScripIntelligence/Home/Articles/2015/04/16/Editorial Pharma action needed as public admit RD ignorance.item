<p>The development of new medicines cannot take place without the involvement of the public, but getting people on board is more challenging if they don't understand the process or their role in it. </p><p>Pharmaceutical companies know patients matter, and the emergence of a new leadership role, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Scrip-100-UCBs-Lode-Dewulf-We-can-and-should-talk-to-patients-350788" target="_new">patient affairs officer</a>, is an indication of how serious they becoming about patient engagement. If the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EMA-and-national-agencies-outline-their-vision-of-the-future-regulatory-network-357704" target="_new">draft EU regulatory strategy</a> for the next five years is anything to go by, regulators are thinking along similar lines. </p><p>However, the public feels largely ignorant on the topic of medicines R&D, and craves more information. This was the finding from <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006420.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=LJa9LX1il555KeX&utm_source=Press&utm_campaign=0e66c73642-Original_EUPATI_Publication_Medicines_Research&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_2781022a12-0e66c73642-102498509" target="_new">research just published</a> in <i>BMJ Open</i>, and it is worth a look for those interested in patient engagement throughout the drug development process. </p><p>84% of nearly 7,000 online survey respondents in six European countries felt they had less than good overall knowledge of medicines R&D. The data were gathered by researchers at the University of Manchester and others under the auspices of the Innovative Medicines Initiative's European Patients Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) project. Some of this ignorance may be attributable to a lack of interest among some people. However, given that significant numbers of people also expressed an interest in learning more about various aspects of the topic, there is clearly room for better engagement with the public. </p><p>Those who had been involved in medical research reported greater awareness and also greater interest in learning more. </p><p>By building understanding through broader outreach initiatives, patient involvement in clinical trials could be further facilitated, thus driving a virtuous cycle of awareness, participation and positive engagement. A concerted effort to engage sections of the public who feel they don't know enough but would like to know more, and who have never been involved in medical research, could enhance clinical trial recruitment among under-represented groups. For example, women had a consistently higher level of interest than men in learning more about the range of sub-topics listed in the survey, while older people expressed more interest than younger ones in selected areas, such as medicines safety and predictive medicine.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how EUPATI and others use this research to develop new approaches for patient and public engagement in medicines research.</p>
