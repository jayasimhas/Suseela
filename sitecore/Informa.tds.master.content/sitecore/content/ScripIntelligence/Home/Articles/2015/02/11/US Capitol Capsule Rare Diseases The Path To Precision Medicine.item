<p>The path to achieving the promise of precision medicine &ndash; prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle into account &ndash; must go through the discovery, research and development processes of rare diseases, a panel of experts and advocates said last week during a Capitol Hill briefing hosted by the House Rare Disease Congressional Caucus, headed by Reps. Leonard Lance (R-NJ) and Joe Crowley (D-NY).</p><p>"You really have to go through rare diseases to help the rest of America," said Matt Might, president of NGLY1.org and an associate professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. "We can sort out exactly which genes do what by studying rare disease patients. Rare diseases can help accelerate our understanding of the entire genome and help us understand and move towards treatments."</p><p>By curing rare diseases, scientists will more efficiently be able to unlock ways to treat more common diseases, insisted Might, whose son Bertrand was the first patient ever identified with an extremely rare disorder, known as N-Glycanase deficiency, whose symptoms include global development delay, movement disorders, seizures, liver dysfunction, diminished reflexes and peripheral neuropathy.</p><p>"There is great potential in curing common disease by starting with rare disease," added Erynn Gordon, director of clinical development at Mountain View, Calif.-based 23andMe, which became the first company given the FDA's blessing to market a direct-to-consumer genetic test under a regulatory classification for novel devices.</p><p>Rare disease "is a simpler model and more likely to yield success," said Gordon, whose company also is using its database of over one million genotyped customers to try to improve the R&D success rate of prescription drugs through more clearly defining targets.</p><p>Even though sequencing the human genome was a "major undertaking, spanning many years and costing a lot of money," Might contended that was the "easy part" on the road to achieving <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Unveils-Precision-Medicine-Working-Laboratory-Plan-360515" target="_new">precision medicine</a>, for which President Barack Obama wants to put millions of dollars into pursuing under an initiative he <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">created earlier this year</a>. </p><p>The greatest challenge, Might said, is understanding the human genome.</p><p>That's why rare diseases must be the model for precision medicine R&D rather than something like cancer, where he said every time a mountain is climbed, "another mountain appears."</p><p>"Until we have a full command of the genome, I don't know that we can ever say that we can cure cancer," Might said.</p><p>But Christopher Austin, director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), pointed out that thanks to the Human Genome Project, common cancers are being "parcellated into genetically defined rare diseases."</p><p>He pointed to lung cancer &ndash; the most common form of cancer worldwide &ndash; as the perfect example, noting the fact the FDA now considers anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, which affects about 20,000 people in the US, an orphan disease. </p><p>"We really view rare diseases as a testing ground for precision medicine," Austin explained. "In rare diseases, you start with the genetic information, and so it is precision medicine by definition."</p><p>"I believe there will be a time in the not too distant future when all diseases will be considered rare," he declared.</p><p>What NCATS is doing is "speeding up that process," Austin said, although he noted Congress has been known to "get a little testy" with the agency for not going faster &ndash; asking "'What are you doing up there?'"</p><p>But basic science often takes time, he said, and "it's the only route" from taking drug R&D from a "trial-and-error process to predictive science."</p><p>Austin lamented the fact that while the genetic basis is known for over 5,000 diseases, there remains only about 500 treatments for those conditions &ndash; with the number of diseases that go from the untreatable category to treatable at only about three every year.</p><p>"At the current rate, it's going to be 2,000 years before every human disease is treated," he said, declaring "That is not acceptable."</p><p>"We have to apply science to this problem," Austin said. "We can't just keep doing same old same old."</p><p>NCATS, he said, is trying to change that through two programs the agency is running: the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND).</p><p>The RDCRN, which consists of 22 distinct clinical research consortia with a data management and coordinating center, is designed to advance medical research on rare diseases by facilitating collaboration, study enrollment and data sharing. </p><p>Since its launch in 2003, nearly 29,000 participants have been enrolled in the RDCRN network's clinical studies. </p><p>The RDCRN network currently is composed of about 2,600 researchers, including NIH scientific program staff, academic investigators and members of about 100 patient advocacy groups (PAGs). </p><p>Direct involvement of PAGs in operations and strategy is a major feature of the network, and the consortia can't get NIH funding unless they have one of those patient groups as a member of their research teams, Austin pointed out.</p><p>"That has been absolutely transformational in the focus, urgency and relevance," he said.</p><p>According to NCATS, there currently are about 100 RDCRN studies underway involving about 200 rare diseases.</p><p>Austin noted, however, the RDCRN teams are not researching diseases one at a time, but are studying the commonalities in groups of diseases.</p><p>TRND is a program that specifically is providing opportunities for encouraging and speeding the development of new drugs for diseases where there may be a very limited market, and therefore less commercial interest, Austin explained.</p><p>TRND originally was created in May 2009 with $24m from Congress with the intent of taking promising molecules through the riskiest stages of drug development &ndash; the preclinical stage &ndash; and then seeking out private partners to bring the products to the US market.</p><p>"It has not escaped the attention of many, many, many biotechs and pharmas that there is enormous opportunity here in developing novel therapeutics," Austin said. </p><p>But, he said, "for rare disease populations where the disease is not well understood, it's just too risky for [companies] to take it on from the beginning." </p><p>So, Austin said, the idea behind TRND is to "derisk" projects to bring them closer to the point where a company would consider taking on the ultimate development and approval of a new drug.</p><p>Another program NCATS is working on to better predict a drug's safety and effectiveness before testing it in humans, and therefore streamlining the R&D process, is its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NCATS-chases-crystal-balls-to-predict-drugs-futures-357676" target="_new">tissue chip initiative</a>, in which it is partnering with the US Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the FDA, Austin said.</p><p>He said the agencies are collaborating to develop 3-D tissue chips loaded with human cells, which are intended to model the structure and function of human organs, like lungs, livers, hearts and kidneys, with the idea to ultimately combine the chips into an integrated system that could mimic the complex functions of the human body. The compounds then could be tested on the chips to tell if the agents are toxic and show activity against specific diseases.</p><p>If the chips are successful, scientists could avoid using animals altogether for toxicity testing, Austin said.</p><p>"By looking at rare diseases as a group, by focusing on a different paradigm of developing drugs and by using novel technologies like the tissue chips, we are going to be able to get to treatments much more quickly, much more efficiently and much cheaper," Austin declared.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-Drug-Pricing-Probes-Merck-Lilly-Targeted-361421" target="_new">More Drug Pricing Probes: Merck, Lilly Targeted</a></p><p>Merck & Co. and Eli Lilly and Co. are the latest drug makers to reveal their pricing practices have caught the attention of federal prosecutors &ndash; both disclosing in recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has got the companies in its sights.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/TPPs-Details-On-Patent-Linkage-Reimbursement-Revealed-361402" target="_new">TPP's Details On Patent Linkage, Reimbursement Revealed</a></p><p>While much attention has been paid to the intellectual property chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the biologics exclusivity debate, there are other provisions in the agreement, whose details were revealed last week, that affect the biopharmaceutical industry, specifically, the measures in the so-called "Annex on Transparency and Procedural Fairness for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices," which is part of the Transparency and Anti-Corruption chapter.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Price-Battle-Now-Bipartisan-Should-Pharma-Fret-361377" target="_new">Drug Price Battle Now Bipartisan; Should Pharma Fret?</a></p><p>Drug companies, particularly Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, got a double punch from Capitol Hill on Nov. 4 when lawmakers from the House and the Senate upped their pressure on drug pricing &ndash; with a group of Democrats forming a new task force focused on combating "skyrocketing" costs of medicines and two senators turning the battle into a bipartisan fight by opening a new investigation and revealing plans for a hearing in December on the matter.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-Severe-Asthma-Drug-Nucala-OKd-361376" target="_new">GSK Severe Asthma Drug Nucala OK'd</a></p><p>GlaxoSmithKline PLC on Nov. 4 gained the FDA's blessing to market Nucala (mepolizumab) as the first anti-interleukin-5 treatment in the US for adults and adolescents with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype &ndash; gaining broader use than a panel of experts had advised.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Anaphylaxis-Uncertainty-Lingers-For-Mercks-Sugammadex-361375" target="_new">Anaphylaxis Uncertainty Lingers For Merck's Sugammadex</a></p><p>Before an FDA panel on Nov. 6 unanimously backed approval of Merck & Co.'s sugammadex, an injectable drug intended to reverse neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium &ndash; drugs that are employed during surgical procedures &ndash; agency reviewers said anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity events remained a concern with the drug.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hashing-Out-Rising-Drug-Costs-An-Invitation-Only-Event-361363" target="_new">Hashing Out Rising Drug Costs: An Invitation-Only Event</a></p><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell wants to bring drug manufacturers together with consumers, health care providers, employers, insurers, state and federal government officials and other stakeholders at a Nov. 20 invitation-only forum to discuss the rising costs of prescription medicines &ndash; an issue that's been at the center of debates in recent months among politicians, payers and patient advocates.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Parkinsons-Needs-FDA-Flexibility-NIH-Funding-Certainty-361345" target="_new">Parkinson's Needs FDA Flexibility, NIH Funding Certainty</a></p><p>While Todd Sherer, CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said the FDA has "done a very good job" in Parkinson's disease, he said the agency needs to produce more guidance for industry that would allow more creative mechanisms for developing disease-modifying treatments, whose clinical trial results could perhaps be generated more quickly. One thing that's holding Parkinson's back, Sherer said, is the current unpredictability with the annual budget for the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
