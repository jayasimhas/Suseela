<p>A recent exposé of National Health Service (NHS) staff in the UK allegedly accepting financial inducements and lavish hospitality from pharmaceutical companies suggests that despite high-profile enforcement cases in recent years, the pharmaceutical industry still has work to do to ensure all bribery and corruption in connection with the promotion of medicinal products has been eradicated. Consequently, the industry will face increasing pressure and scrutiny to demonstrate it has robust policies in place to monitor compliance and mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption.</p><p>The piece in <i>The Telegraph</i> focused on the alleged professional misconduct of healthcare professionals ("HCPs") employed by the NHS. The provision of hospitality, gifts or any kind of inducements to HCPs or other decision makers within healthcare organizations ("HCOs") by the pharmaceutical industry is strictly governed by UK law, including the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, the Bribery Act 2010 (the "Act") as well as voluntary industry codes of practice. We consider below the interaction between the relevant law and voluntary codes.</p><p>The control of advertisement and promotion of medicines in the UK is based on the long established system of self-regulation. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry's Code of Practice (the "Code"), administered by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA), sets out in detail the requirements for the promotion of medicines and interactions with HCPs and appropriate administrative staff. </p><p>The Act establishes offenses of offering or accepting bribes; bribing foreign public officials; and the "corporate offense" of failing to prevent any person associated with a commercial organization, ie any person who performs services for or on behalf of an organization, from making a bribe. </p><p>The provisions of the Act concerned with hospitality and promotional expenditure are of particular relevance to the sort of activities that were reported by The Telegraph. Although the government recognizes that bona fide hospitality, promotional and other business expenditure is an important part of doing business, the guidance published alongside the Act makes it clear that lavish and extravagant hospitality may constitute a bribe, particularly when such hospitality is not commensurate with the 'reasonable and proportionate' norms for the particular industry. </p><p>When the Act came into force, the Serious Fraud Office, the body charged with enforcing the Act, stated that it will not normally intervene in matters governed by the Code, but reserves the right to take action if the issue is deemed serious enough to merit investigation.</p><p>The standard of 'reasonable and proportional' behavior required by the pharmaceutical industry in the promotion of medicines will therefore be judged by the <a href="http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/thecode/Pages/default.aspx" target="_new">provisions of the Code</a>. Specifically, clauses 18 and 22 of the Code detail the circumstances in which hospitality and gifts can be made available to HCPs, and breaches of these requirements could also mean that an offense has been committed under the Act. It is also important to note that the global reach of the Act means that activities conducted abroad that would fall outside the Code could still give rise to liability under the Act.</p><p>Sanctions for non-compliance with the Code include, <i>inter alia</i>, a public reprimand, suspension or expulsion from the ABPI. Sanctions for non-compliance with the Act include an unlimited fine and, for individuals, imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine, or both. </p><p>There is, however, recognition that an organization may not be able to prevent an individual intent on committing bribery from doing so. The Act therefore provides a full defense to the "corporate offense" of failing to prevent any person associated with a commercial organization from making a bribe on their behalf if an organization can demonstrate it has implemented "adequate" anti-corruption procedures. The Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bribery-act-2010-guidance.pdf" target="_new">guidance</a> sets out six principles that a company should consider when formulating appropriate anti-bribery/corruption policies: proportionate procedures; top-level commitment; risk assessment; due diligence; communication (including training); and monitoring and review. The PMPCA <a href="http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/thecode/InteractiveCode2015/Pages/guidelines.aspx" target="_new">also provides guidelines</a> on company procedures which are regarded as representing good practice in the implementation of the Code. </p><p>The Telegraph exposé highlights the need for all compliance teams working within the pharmaceutical industry to revisit this guidance and ensure that their organization has addressed its corruption risk and has adequate anti-corruption policies in place, based not only on the UK Bribery Act and the Code, but also the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local corruption standards, wherever it does business. </p><p>Risk assessments should extend to all those intermediaries contracted to work on the company's behalf, both in the UK and abroad, and the behavior of those intermediaries should be regularly monitored. Systems should be implemented to ensure that both corruption risk within the organization and also the effectiveness of its anti-corruption policies are scrutinized on a regular basis. A training refresher on both the Code and relevant anti-bribery policies for employees and associated persons may be timely.</p><p>Finally, the Code has recently been amended to reflect changes to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Disclosure Code. Pharmaceutical companies are now required to document the individual names of HCPs and HCOs that receive any financial contributions &ndash; this includes any sponsorship of an HCP's attendance at meetings and any fees/contributions paid towards the costs of meetings to HCOs or to third parties managing events on their behalf. From June 2016, there will be a requirement that this information is made publicly available. </p><p>Although such transparency should assist both the pharmaceutical industry and the NHS in eradicating corruption in connection with the promotion of medicinal products, it will no doubt add a further burden onto already stretched compliance departments in the industry.</p><p><p><i>Gillian Johnson is Head of Life Sciences at Stevens & Bolton LLP</i></p><p>
