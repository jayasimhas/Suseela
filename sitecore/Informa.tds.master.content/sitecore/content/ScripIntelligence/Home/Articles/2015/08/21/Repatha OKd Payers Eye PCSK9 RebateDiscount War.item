<p>Seeking to stay ahead of the other proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor on the US market, Amgen said it was pricing its newly approved drug Repatha (evolocumab) at $14,100 per year &ndash; $500 below Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Praluent (alirocumab), whose annual cost is $14,600.</p><p>But who comes out the market winner will come down to which firm offers the best rebates and discounts to payers, analysts said.</p><p>Steve Miller, CEO of mega pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, said his company plans to "leverage this competition" between the PCSK9 inhibitors "to achieve the greatest possible discounts for our clients and patients."</p><p>"And it appears they will utilize several avenues to do so, potentially including exclusive formularies," remarked J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov.</p><p>The FDA on Aug. 27 gave Amgen the go-head to market Repatha as a therapy to bring low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) under control in high-risk patients when statins are not enough &ndash; making it only the second PCSK9 inhibitor cleared for the US market. </p><p>Amgen said Repatha is expected to be available next week. </p><p>With being a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">month behind Praluent</a> in entering the market, Amgen is betting on a somewhat lower price in spurring Repatha's sales. </p><p>But the company also said it plans to work with payers and other purchasers to "provide "innovative pricing programs linking the net price of Repatha to the expected LDL cholesterol reductions and anticipated appropriate patient utilization."</p><p>"While it is unclear exactly what this comment entails for Repatha, we are still inclined to think that the gross stocker price won't hold much meaning at the end of the day," J.P. Morgan's Kasimov said. Amgen set the US wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) for Repatha at $542.31 for one 140mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or prefilled syringe, or $14,100 annually for the every two weeks administration. </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Last month</a>, Sanofi and Regeneron put Praluent's WAC at $40 per day, or $1,120 every 28 days, or about $14,600 per year, for both the 75mg and 150mg doses &ndash; a price that came in higher than Wall Street analysts had anticipated.</p><p>But with the indications almost identical between the two PCSK9s, Kasimov said Repatha's slightly lower price is unlikely to hold much weight.</p><p><b>Approval</b></p><p>Like Praluent, Repatha was approved by the FDA for use with diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) &ndash; a genetic condition that causes unusually high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; or patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of LDL-C.</p><p>But Amgen also won a second indication: homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a more rare form of familial hypercholesterolemia that causes early onset of arthrosclerosis, often resulting in patients experiencing heart attacks in their early teens and dying before they reach 30.</p><p>Regeneron and Sanofi did not seek the HoFH use for Praluent.</p><p>Repatha was approved in HoFH in patients as young as 12 years.</p><p>While the FDA has approved two drugs in recent years for HoFH &ndash; Genzyme's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/A-win-for-antisense-IsisGenzyme-score-US-OK-for-Kynamro-339490" target="_new">Kynamro</a> (mipomersen sodium) and Aegerion Pharmaceuticals' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/No-HoFH-definition-could-give-Aegerion-market-lead-with-Juxtapid-338576" target="_new">Juxtapid</a> (lomitapide) &ndash; patients and doctors have insisted there remains an unmet need in that indication. </p><p>Repatha comes as a single-use 140mg prefilled SureClick autoinjector or prefilled syringe intended for self-administer, with a recommended dose for adults at 140mg every two weeks or 420mg once a month. For adults with HoFH, the recommended dose is 420mg once a month.</p><p>Amgen did not gain approval for the 420mg every two weeks dosing for HoFH patients, but said it would continue discussions with the FDA on eventually allowing that dosage in that population. </p><p>Amgen said it plans to make a single injection monthly 420mg dosing option available next year. Until then, the firm said it anticipated monthly administration predominately for HoFH patients. </p><p>In June, the FDA's outside expert advisers backed the approval of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Repatha</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Praluent</a>, although they said the drugs should be limited to certain groups, like adults with HeFH and those at high CV risk where statins are not enough.</p><p>The FDA's advisers also unanimously backed the use of Amgen's Repatha in patients with HoFH.</p><p>The panels also said they were comfortable with the term "maximally tolerated statin therapy."</p><p>Analysts noted Repatha and Praluent likely will gain broader use once the companies have completed their ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOT), if the firms are able to show their medicines lower heart attacks and stroke &ndash; evidence that's currently lacking.</p><p>Amgen has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">completed</a> the enrollment of its CVOT of Repatha, known as FOURIER, which now has about 27,500 patients.</p><p>The company expects results by 2017 &ndash; around the same time Sanofi and Regeneron are anticipating data from their 18,000-patient CVOT for Praluent, known as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES.</p><p><b>Barriers</b></p><p>The PCSK9s are expected to face some barriers to uptake.</p><p>For instance, some physicians are likely to be resistant to using biologic therapy for LDL-C reduction and may be reluctant to take on the responsibility of providing the documentation insurers demand for "prior authorization" before paying for the drugs.</p><p>The lack of urgency by some doctors and patients to get LDL-C under control is likely to contribute to the PCSK9 inhibitors not being used and some patients also may be unwilling to inject themselves.</p><p>But the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">worry by payers</a> that the volumes of patients expected to use the medicines could <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Economist-Pharmas-Are-Government-Protected-Fragile-Little-Birds-359948" target="_new">break the US health care</a> system is likely the greatest challenge the PCSK9s will confront.</p><p>Indeed, FH Foundation Katherine Wilemon, president and CEO of the FH Foundation, said her group already has heard access to Praluent has been blocked by insurers for some patients, and she told <i>Scrip</i> she anticipated Repatha to face the same roadblock.</p><p>Wilemon, who noted that her foundation has estimated that 90% of patients with HeFH are going undiagnosed, said she expected mostly cardiologists to prescribe the PCSK9s since those professionals are the most familiar with the drug and the disease.</p><p>A <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-Inhibitors-What-Do-Cardiologists-Think-360139" target="_new">survey</a> of 23 cardiologists conducted by Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, showed that 74% of the respondents were at least moderately confident the LDL-C changes seen with the PCSK9 inhibitors would lead to an outcomes benefit, while 52% said they were at least moderately confident the drugs were safe &ndash; a figure that rose to 78% if the CVOTs demonstrated safety. </p><p><b>Statins Don't Fear Competition</b></p><p>Sarah Walters, executive director of AstraZeneca's CV lipids franchise, said her firm does not fear any competition from the PCSK9s for its HMG co-A reductase inhibitor Crestor (rosuvastatin) and remained "confident in the clinical importance" of the drug for appropriate patients with high cholesterol at increased CV risk.</p><p>"Because PCSK9s were studied along with statins, we believe that statins will continue to be the standard of care for patients with high cholesterol at increased risk," she told <i>Scrip</i> in an email response to questions. "This standard has been reinforced by treatment guidelines."</p><p>She insisted some payers consider Crestor as a treatment option for patients who are not at goal on another statin before considering additional non-statin treatment options. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
