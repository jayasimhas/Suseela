<p>Johnson & Johnson and NewLink Genetics are among the winners of the first round of funds granted by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) under a program aimed at speeding Ebola vaccines and diagnostics to battle the disease, which has infected more than 21,000 people in West Africa, killing nearly 8,500.</p><p>The IMI, a joint venture of the European Union and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, has awarded &euro;215m ($248.6m) to eight projects of a total planned &euro;280m fund ($324m).</p><p>IMI&rsquo;s so-called Ebola+ program was first unveiled this past November (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/IMI-invests-350m-to-speed-Ebola-vaccines-research-354947" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Four of the Ebola+ projects involve J&J, which has formed various partnerships to tackle the disease with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), the University of Oxford, La Centre Muraz, Bavarian Nordic, Vibalogics, the Grameen Foundation and World Vision of Ireland.</p><p>J&J noted the firm and its collaborators will receive &euro;100m ($115.6m) of the IMI Ebola+ program funds.</p><p>Other groups are collaborating on four other projects.</p><p>"Previous experience at IMI has shown that consortia of this kind, bringing together diverse groups from around the world, can make progress in even the most challenging disease areas," IMI said in a 16 January statement.</p><p>"It is great to see the multiple partners come together to accelerate the development of an effective vaccine both for the current epidemic and future outbreaks," said Dr Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and one of the scientists that first identified Ebola in 1976.</p><p><b>J&J-BN vaccine</b></p><p>Three of the J&J projects being awarded the IMI funds are aimed at accelerating Phase I, II and III trials of the company's experimental prime-boost Ebola vaccine, which is being co-developed with Bavarian Nordic, and scale up production of the product. </p><p>A Phase I trial of the J&J-BN vaccine, which is being led by Oxford, got underway earlier this month (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Oxford-tests-JnJBavarian-Nordic-prime-boost-Ebola-vaccine-355965" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The vaccine also is expected to enter Phase II and III trials in Europe and Africa, subject to review of the preliminary Phase I data, which will be carried out in parallel (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>).</p><p>A fourth J&J project being funded by IMI's Ebola+ program is intended to investigate innovative ways and technology to raise awareness and acceptance of vaccination campaigns. </p><p>J&J and BN said they already have produced more than 400,000 regimens of the prime-boost vaccine for use in large-scale trials, expected to last until April.</p><p>The firms have projected that 2 million regimens will be available through the course of this year, with the ability to quickly scale up to a projected 5 million regimens, if required, over a 12 to 18 months.</p><p>This past October, J&J said it would commit up to $200m to accelerate and significantly expand production of its Ebola vaccine program, which is under development at its subsidiary Janssen (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharma-pulls-together-for-Ebola-vaccine-JandJ-invests-200m-354617" target="_new">23 October 2014</a>).</p><p><b>NewLink vaccine partnership</b></p><p>Under a much smaller Ebola+ program award of &euro;3.9m ($4.51m), NewLink's subsidiary BioProtection Systems is collaborating with Sclavo Vaccines Association, Microbiotec SRL and Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Siena of Italy; Eidgenössisches Department für Verteidigung, Bevölkerungsschutz und Sport and University of Geneva of Switzerland; Emory University of Atlanta; Leiden University Medical Centre of The Netherlands; the UK Department of Health; the University of Gothenburg in Sweden; the University of Oxford; and University of Tübingen of Germany.</p><p>The project will build on existing work to advance the development of NewLink's recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Zaire Ebola vaccine, rVSV-EBOV, which the company is partnered on with Merck (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-looks-beyond-Ebola-with-NewLink-venture-355242" target="_new">24 November 2014</a>).</p><p>IMI said the rVSV Ebola vaccine project will use "cutting-edge technologies" to carry out in-depth analyses of samples taken from clinical trial participants before and after vaccination, which will allow the researchers to gather information on the strength of the immune responses triggered by the vaccine and vaccine safety.</p><p>The rVSV vaccine, whose development also is being funded by a $30m grant from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, is expected to enter Phase II/III testing in West Africa this month (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BARDA-grants-30m-to-advance-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-355800" target="_new">22 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Diagnostics</b></p><p>The other three projects being funded by IMI's Ebola+ program are focused on rapid diagnostic tests.</p><p>One group of collaborators from Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the UK has received &euro;1m ($1.15m) to develop a test that will deliver results in under 45 minutes on whether the patient has Ebola or a related disease.</p><p>Another group of partners from German, Italy and the Czech Republic won &euro;2.3m ($2.66m) to develop an ultra-fast, accurate diagnostic instrument to test for Ebola in under 15 minutes.</p><p>The third group of international collaborators was granted &euro;4.3m ($4.97m) to develop and validate in the field a rapid diagnostic tool intended to be simple and safe to use in low resource settings by people who may not have specialist training. </p><p>At the same time, the project is expected to implement a large-scale capacity building program in West Africa with a strong focus on diagnostics, biosafety and outbreak management. It also is expected to ensure its results are communicated widely, especially to public health bodies, charities, outbreak management teams and local hospitals. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
