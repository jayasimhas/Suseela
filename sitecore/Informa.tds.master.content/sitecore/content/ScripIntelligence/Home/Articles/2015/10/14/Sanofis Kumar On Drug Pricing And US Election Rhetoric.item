<p>Suresh Kumar, member of Sanofi's executive committee and executive vice president, external affairs, says that part of the high octane discussion in the US around drug pricing in the run up to the presidential election is "populist" but there's another part that stakeholders need to address.</p><p>Kumar's observations perhaps merit more than the usual attention &ndash; after all he was in the Obama administration at the same time as Hillary Clinton and served as US Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service. </p><p>In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, Kumar said that while the conversation of price alone may not be entirely wrong, there's a "timing" issue involved. </p><p>"Several things independently happened&#8230;Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio&#8230;..what else would you expect in the last two years of an election campaign in the US? It's everyone's favourite to speak on," Kumar told <i>Scrip</i> at the side lines of the annual general meeting of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India in Mumbai on Oct.17.</p><p>He explained that the flipside of price is value and that eventually industry is going to be held to one standard &ndash; did it take care of patients and improve their lives or not?</p><p>"That's the only thing which counts. And it's both a function of price and value."</p><p>Democratic presidential contenders former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders both have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Clinton-Sanders-Proud-Pharmas-An-Enemy-361031" target="_new">taken shots</a> at the biopharmaceutical industry over the recent past, following the price gouging controversy around Turing Pharmaceutical AG's toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine). </p><p>Many analysts &ndash; including Washington DC policy analyst Andy Bressler in an Oct. 15 report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch &ndash; believe that the focus on drug pricing issues is mainly because of election rhetoric. The issue is, however, expected to stay on the policy agenda through the upcoming November 2016 presidential elections. The BoA Merrill Lynch report also terms proposals to curb drug spending in the US as mere "headline risks" that would be difficult to pass through Congress and even more challenging to execute.</p><p>Kumar wouldn't comment specifically on practices of firms such as Turing but said that Sanofi "does not subscribe" to such practices. </p><p>"That's not what we do. Our job is to find innovative product science solutions to take care of disease and that's our central focus."</p><p>The Sanofi executive referred to how society has been grappling with the price issue and how to "practically" move forward. </p><p>"Several things are now coming together&#8230;.for example real world experience. It's just not about well controlled double blinded studies but even beyond &ndash; how do we actually look at claims data; how people are prescribing; what patients are being medicated with; what are their electronic medical records. And glean behavior value and associated or unassociated cost as a consequence&#8230;I think that needs to be done and that's happening."</p><p>Price, he declared, is "right" only when "those who must pay can afford to" and those who must invent, discover and manufacture are able to do so and make a profit. </p><p>"Otherwise, we will have solutions which are non-sustainable, non-scalable."</p><p>He also emphasized the need to look at health economic outcomes research experiences, but underscored that healthcare is not delivered in a vacuum.</p><p> "It's delivered by several stakeholders in a value chain&#8230;.it starts not only with medicines but also policies which govern the medicines/treatment formularies/immunization and public health infrastructure. All these contribute to delivery of overall health," he said.</p><h2>One Price</h2><p>Kumar also mentioned one of Sanofi's "thoughts" with relation to dengue &ndash; a "one price" approach, based on the "intensity" of a nation's immunization programme. </p><p>This is essentially a global price, where if a program that immunizes 90% of the population, is eligible for a different discount structure compared with if on that immunizes 70%.</p><p>"In a proper sense, you are looking at the risk of disease burden. Because if you are only going to immunize 10%, the effectiveness of your own program cannot be as good as it is. But if you are committing, then we are committing," Kumar said. </p><p>Sanofi Pasteur's late stage <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofi-eyes-India-for-dengue-vaccine-Phase-III-study-354874" target="_new">dengue vaccine</a> has progressed across territories and the company expects to file for registration of the product in several endemic countries in 2015. </p><p>Kumar noted how countries may also have access to other forms of creative financing, referring to, among others, certain novel forms of financing being explored by various institutions including the World Bank around the maternal child health program.</p><p>In July this year, the UN, the World Bank Group, and the governments of Canada, Norway and the US launched the Global Financing Facility (GFF) and announced that $12bn in domestic and international, private and public funding had been aligned to country-led five-year investment plans for women, child and adolescent health in the four GFF front-runner countries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. The World Bank Group also announced a new GFF partnership with its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to raise funds from capital markets for countries with significant funding gaps for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health.</p><p>Kumar added that Sanofi's approach is to understand that various markets are at different stages of development and noted how the French multinational's re-organization plans will help it stay focused so that it can address the needs best. </p><p>Earlier this year Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt had noted how the proposed new organization "simplifies and focuses" Sanofi to optimize growth.</p><p>Sanofi plans to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Brandicourt-reorganizes-Sanofi-359442" target="_new">reorganize</a> its business operations with the creation of five global business units: General Medicines and Emerging Markets, Specialty Care, Diabetes and Cardiovascular, Sanofi Pasteur and Merial. The new structure will be implemented beginning in January 2016.</p><p>
