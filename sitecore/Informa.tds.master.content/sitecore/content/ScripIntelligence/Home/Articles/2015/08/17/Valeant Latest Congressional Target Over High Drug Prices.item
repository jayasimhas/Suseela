<p>Valeant Pharmaceuticals became the latest drug maker targeted by lawmakers over high drug prices.</p><p>As part of their ongoing investigation, Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), ranking member on the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to Valeant asking it to explain why the Canadian firm significantly hiked the prices of Isuprel (isoprenaline) and Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) after acquiring the drugs from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February.</p><p>The lawmakers demanded to know why Nitropress' price jumped from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel's price rocketed from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, "when the only thing that has changed about the drugs is the company that owns them."</p><p>Valeant currently is the only company that sells the two cardiovascular medications. </p><p>During a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">30 July hearing</a> of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations focused on US tax code issues, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) called for an investigation by that committee, too, of Isuprel's and Nitropress' sharp price increases.</p><p>"It is astounding the acquisitions that's going on in pharma," she said. "How these drugs are being priced is a fascinating thing for us to understand."</p><p>In their letter, Sanders and Cummings told Valeant to provide the gross revenues from sales of the drugs since February, the prices paid for the medicines, any material changes in production of the products and the prices the firm charges for the same therapies in foreign markets.</p><p>Cummings and Sanders also sent a letter to Hospira requesting information about its role in continuing to manufacture and supply Isuprel and Nitropress.</p><p>Also as part of their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Forget-Sovaldi-generics-new-pricey-drugs-poster-child-355087" target="_new">investigation</a>, the two lawmakers last fall also sent a letter to Marathon Pharmaceuticals requesting information about the company's own pricing practices after it increased the prices of the two drugs by nearly 400% after acquiring them from Hospira in 2013.</p><p>Sanders convened a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Drug-price-yellow-signs-market-canaries-or-lemons-355217" target="_new">hearing</a> in November 2014 to examine why so many firms were raising the prices of older drugs.</p><p>The Vermont senator invited Lannette, Teva and Marathon to the hearing to provide their economic rationale for raising the prices of some of their products.</p><p>The firms, however, didn't show up.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
