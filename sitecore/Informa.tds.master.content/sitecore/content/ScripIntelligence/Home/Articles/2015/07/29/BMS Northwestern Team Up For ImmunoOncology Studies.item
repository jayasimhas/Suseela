<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb will provide <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab), <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab) and potentially other immuno-oncology (I-O) agents for Northwestern University cancer researchers and fund staff positions in the university's pharmaceutical testing labs under a partnership to evaluate therapies that harness the immune system to treat rare cancers.</p><p>I-O has become a key therapeutic category for Bristol-Myers following the approval of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-approves-BMS-melanoma-treatment-Yervoy-313147" target="_new">Yervoy for melanoma</a> in 2011 and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">Opdivo for melanoma</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)</a> in 2014 and 2015. US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-combo-gains-priority-review-358701" target="_new">approval is pending</a> for the two <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Scrips-Rough-Guide-to-Immuno-Oncology-358690" target="_new">blockbuster biologics</a> administered together as a treatment for melanoma. BMS will supply its approved therapies and may provide access to I-O agents in its pipeline to researchers at the Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern and the Northwestern Medicine Development Therapeutics Institute (NMDTI).</p><p>Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Sarah Koenig confirmed that, under its agreement with the Lurie Cancer Center and NMDTI, BMS may provide access to some of its therapeutic candidates at the company's discretion. Yervoy, Opdivo and possibly some investigational agents will be evaluated in early-stage clinical trials in combination with each other and with therapies developed outside of BMS to find effective treatments for rare population malignancies (RPM). </p><p>Studies will enroll high-risk, poor prognosis cancer patients &ndash; people with aggressive cancers that metastasize early at multiple sites, cancers that are refractory to conventional treatment regimens, and malignancies with early recurrences.</p><p>"We will provide funding for specific research projects to be planned and agreed upon, and carried out in collaboration with the I-O RPM institutions," Ms Koenig said. "We will also supply drug at no cost to the institutions and, in many cases, will support the training of young investigators at the participating institutions for the duration of the collaboration."</p><p>Bristol-Myers did not disclose how much money it will spend during the life of its partnership with Lurie Cancer Center and NMDTI, but the company will fund positions in the NMDTI Developmental Therapeutics Fellowship program.</p><p>"The ability to rapidly investigate the clinical utility of Bristol-Myers Squibb's immuno-oncology agents, as single agents or in combinations, including with therapies from other sources, is a powerful accelerant to our programs. The focus on malignancies that are otherwise relatively under-investigated in therapeutic terms is particularly important and satisfying for all involved in this collaboration," NMDTI director and Lurie Cancer Center deputy director Dr Francis Giles said in a statement from BMS.</p><p>Bristol-Myers has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-AZ-Roche-BMS-work-off-grid-for-mix-and-match-immuno-oncology-358916" target="_new">several partnerships</a> to test Opdivo in combination with I-O agents and targeted cancer therapies from Celldex Therapeutics, Five Prime Therapeutics, Rigel Pharmaceuticals and others.</p><p><p><p><p>
