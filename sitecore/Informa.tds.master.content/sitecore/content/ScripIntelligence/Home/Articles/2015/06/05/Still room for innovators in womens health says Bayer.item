<p> Women's health &ndash; a hot area at the moment for many generic companies &ndash; is one of Bayer Healthcare's key therapy areas of focus; and there is plenty of room for more innovation-based R&amp;D in this space, according to UK &amp; Ireland chief Dr Alexander Moscho. </p> <p> &quot;It is worrying that big women's health players appear to be vacating or cutting back in this development area,&quot; the UK-based CEO told <i>Scrip</i> in a recent interview. </p> <p> He highlighted that there has been a recent trend in companies backing away from women's health drug development. For example in a recent reorganization of its business <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Womens-health-and-oncology-out-as-Teva-realigns-pipeline-354333" target="_new">Teva decided to drop women's health</a> from its pipeline in favor of central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory disease programs. Also late in 2014, privately held French firm <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pierre-Fabre-restructures-ailing-pharma-business-355549" target="_new">Pierre Fabre also dropped women's health</a> from its strategic business plan. </p> <p> And while there has been a recent boost of generic-facing company's getting into the space or expanding their women's health offerings &ndash; such as the new <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Womens-Health-a-priority-for-new-Allergan-357922?refid=RSSLATEST" target="_new">Allergan/Actavis</a> unit and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-seeks-womens-health-power-with-800m-Famy-buy-356503?refid=RSSLATEST" target="_new">Mylan's $800m acquisition</a> of privately held, Mumbai-based Famy Care &ndash; Dr Moscho thinks more innovation-driven businesses are needed in this therapy area. </p> <p> &quot;We at Bayer have consciously decided to stay in the women's health space,&quot; he said. &quot;We are one of the market leaders in this area and we believe in the importance of this field. I hope that more innovation based companies will stay in this space.&quot; </p> <p> Dr Moscho thinks one of the reasons some companies are stepping out of women's health R&amp;D is because it's &quot;challenging&quot; in areas such as contraception, where pharmas are &quot;developing products for healthy people to manage their lives, which is completely different to treating diseases or helping to live with consequences of a disease.&quot; </p> <p> He said the onus lies with regulators, &quot;to ensure that women's health is an area that stays valuable from an industry perspective.&quot; </p> <p> Currently Bayer is focused on its pipeline in gynecological therapies where it has products in Phase I and II clinical trials and with a strong history in the development of contraception products and hormone replacement therapies, Bayer remains committed to this portfolio area. </p> <p> <b>Correction</b> </p> <p> <i>This article was updated on 20 May 2015. It previously stated that &quot;Bayer is focused on its pipeline of endometriosis treatments where it has products in Phase I and II clinical trials.&quot; This has been corrected to say Bayer is focused on &quot;gynecological therapies.&quot;</i> </p>
