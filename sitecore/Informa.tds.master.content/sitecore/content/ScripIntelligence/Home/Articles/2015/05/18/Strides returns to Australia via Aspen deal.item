<p>Strides Arcolab is making a comeback in Australia. The Indian firm, which had divested its Australian business to Actavis (then Watson) in 2012, is acquiring a portfolio of around 130 products from Aspen Australia for approximately A$265m.</p><p>Strides and Aspen have, in a separate transaction, also entered into a deal under which Aspen's arm in Mauritius will divest to Strides Singapore, a portfolio of six branded prescription products, for about US$92m.</p><p>The Australian deal includes a generic business and certain branded pharmaceutical assets. It reported revenues of A$106m and a "direct contribution" to profit before tax (PBT) of A$26m for the year ended 30 June 2014, a statement from Aspen said. The portfolio under the Singapore transaction reported revenues US$12m, with the contribution to PBT of US$10m during the same period. </p><p>Aspen said the divestment is in line with its intent to focus on areas where "most value can be added and to lessen complexity."</p><p>For Strides, the re-entry comes in very different scenario. Its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Watson-Strides-into-Australian-SE-Asian-generics-markets-with-393m-Ascent-326228%5d" target="_new">exit from Australia</a> was done at a time when the company was keen to pare non-strategic pharmaceutical businesses to focus on its injectables arm and prune significant debt on its books. The sale to Watson was then seen slicing debt by about $250m. In 2013, Strides went on to divest its injectables arm, Agila Specialties, to Mylan in a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/1.6bn-Agila-injects-strengths-into-Mylan-340413%5d" target="_new">landmark deal</a>. </p><p>Analysts appeared generally upbeat on Strides re-entry plan. Some indicated that Aspen had launched more than 35 products in Australia, mainly in the anti-infectives, oncology, respiratory and CVS segments. "We expect the acquisition to be EPS accretive from the first year of operation with major launches scheduled in next six months," a note from Reliance Securities said. </p><h2>Strides Australia</h2><p>For Strides, the comeback deal will catapult the Indian firm and its group entities as one of the top three generic pharmaceutical suppliers in Australia and among the top 10 pharmaceutical firms in the Australian pharma market.</p><p>The acquired business will operate under the Arrow Pharmaceuticals brand and be led by Dennis Bastas, previous founder and CEO of Ascent Pharmahealth.</p><p>In 2012, Strides had divested its 94% shareholding in Ascent Pharmahealth, then its subsidiary with operations in Australia and Southeast Asia, to Watson, with the US firm also picking up the balance 6% shareholding held by Ascent's CEO Bastas.</p><p>Arun Kumar, founder and group CEO of Strides said that the Aspen Australian generic pharmaceutical assets are a "valuable and unique" platform for Strides to re-build its business in Australia.</p><p>"Strong local management, a market leading product portfolio supported by our in-house cost effective manufacturing, will be the key ingredients of our strategy for Australia,&rdquo; Mr Kumar said.</p><p>The acquisition will include access to the product pipeline that was under development by Aspen and covers a number of major product launches in the next six months, the Indian firm added.</p><p>The transactions is expected to close by the end of Q2 FY16 subject to various approvals.</p>
