<p>Repligen will not remain a part of Pfizer's "underappreciated" research and development pipeline, since the big pharma has ended its partnership with the Waltham, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company.</p><p>In a 30 January disclosure filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Repligen said Pfizer sent the company a "notice of termination for convenience" on 26 January in regard to their license agreement signed on 28 December 2012 for the development of compounds to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The termination is effective 26 April.</p><p>Pfizer paid Repligen $5m up front 13 months ago with the promise of $65m in milestone fees plus royalties to license the small molecule enzyme inhibitor RG3039 and several backup compounds (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Non-profit-groups-support-helps-Repligen-win-Pfizer-deal-for-SMA-drug-338813" target="_new">7 January 2014</a>). The program had financial support from the nonprofit groups Families of SMA (FSMA) and the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA).</p><p>Pfizer recently described the value of assets in its R&D portfolio as underappreciated based on development and regulatory milestones coming up during the next few years for cancer, immuno-oncology, vaccine, cardiovascular and other programs in the company's pipeline (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-promotes-underappreciated-RandD-pipeline-356297" target="_new">22 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-about-that-RandD-base-Bristol-Myers-and-Pfizer-4Q-earnings-356412" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Since Pfizer ended its partnership with Repligen "for convenience" it appears that the big pharma is focusing its attention on other pipeline priorities.</p><p>Repligen closed down 2.7% at $24.29 per share on 30 January after the company disclosed the terminated deal. Repligen switched its focus from drug development to bioprocessing a few years ago, hence the late 2013 decision to license its SMA program to Pfizer.</p><p><b>Astellas licenses Immunomic vaccine for Japan</b></p><p>Astellas will pay Hershey, Pennsylvania-based Immunomic Therapeutics $15m up front, up to $55m in development and regulatory milestone fees and technology transfer payments, plus tiered double-digit royalties to license the vaccine JRC2-LAMP-vax for allergies induced by Japanese red cedar pollen. The partners plan to initiate a Phase I clinical trial in Japan as soon as the vaccine is ready for trials. </p><p>Immunomic also granted Astellas, which will fund all Japanese red cedar pollinosis studies, an exclusive option to negotiate a license for additional LAMP-vax DNA vaccines to treat other allergy indications in Japan.</p><p><b>BioDelivery reacquires North American rights to Onsolis from Meda</b></p><p>Since Meda's US focus in recent years has shifted to respiratory therapies, BioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI) has decided to reacquire the rights to Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film). BDSI will re-launch the breakthrough cancer pain drug in the US and seek regulatory approvals for Onsolis in Canada and Mexico. The drug was approved in the US in 2007 and launched in 2009 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioDelivery-gets-27-million-milestone-for-Onsolis-approval-from-Meda-172236" target="_new">23 July 2009</a>).</p><p>Meda will share in BDSI's proceeds from any partnerships negotiated to sell and distribute Onsolis in North America. BDSI will submit data to the US FDA during the first quarter of 2015 to support the drug's reintroduction to the US market.</p><p><b>RegenXBio and enGene raise $41.5m in venture capital</b></p><p>Washington, D.C.-based RegenXBio closed a $30m Series C venture capital funding round led by Venrock and Brookside Capital with participation from Deerfield Management and an unnamed new investor. Existing investors FoxKiser and Fidelity Biosciences also backed the Series C round. The capital will be used to advance its lead gene therapy program through clinical development, build out the company's manufacturing infrastructure and expand its team.</p><p>RegenXBio uses its NAV Technology platform to develop gene therapies delivered by adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. The company's internal programs focus on central nervous system diseases, such as Hurler syndrome (MPS I) and Hunter syndrome (MPS II). Its NAV Technology also has been licensed to various partners, including Audentes, Baxter and Dimension Therapeutics.</p><p><i>enGene raises $11.5m</i></p><p>Montreal, Quebec, Canada-based enGene raised Can$13.5m ($11.5m) in a Series B venture capital round led by Forbion Capital Partners with new investors Fonds de Solidarite FTQ of Quebec and Pharmstandard International. Prior investor Lumira Capital also participated in the Series B through its Merck Lumira Biosciences Fund, which was established in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/New-C50-venture-fund-gets-Merck-a-first-look-at-new-technologies-in-Quebec-328658" target="_new">28 March 2012</a>).</p><p>enGene is developing novel therapeutics that deliver DNA or RNA to the gut where proteins are manufactured in the body. The technology is being used to deliver immune-modulating biologics to the intestine, via oral or enema dosing, but it also has shown efficacy in animal models as a mucosal immunotherapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. </p><p>The company's financing will pay for a Phase I/II clinical trial in ulcerative colitis for lead therapeutic candidate EG-12, a carrier-DNA complex that provides gut-localized expression of IL-10. enGene also will finalize the oral formulation of its carrier to create an oral pill that induces endogenous production in the gut for a wide range of therapeutic proteins that currently are administered by injection or infusion.</p><p><b>Public company offerings: XenoPort, Omeros, Epirus, Mirati</b></p><p>Santa Clara, California-based XenoPort will net at least $96.8m from the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes due in 2022 with an aggregate principal value of $100m. The cash will fund ongoing commercialization of Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) in the US for restless leg syndrome and postherpetic neuralgia as well as the development of XP23829 for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. The company grossed $72m from a stock offering a year ago to finance both programs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Tonix-XenoPort-offerings-Ophthotech-royalty-financing-UniQure-Achaogen-IPOs-349582" target="_new">25 January 2014</a>).</p><p>Omeros of Seattle, Washington will gross $75m ($70.6m net) from the sale of 3m shares priced at $20.03. The offering includes pre-funded warrants to buy $15m worth of common stock at $20.02 per share. The proceeds will fund commercialization of Omidria (phenylephrine and ketorolac injection), which won FDA approval in June for use during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement, and preclinical and clinical development of additional assets (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Omeros-cataract-surgery-drug-Omidria-eyes-on-pricing-352115" target="_new">2 June 2014</a>).</p><p>Boston-based Epirus Pharmaceuticals will net $44.2m from the sale of 9.6m shares at $5 each to fund a Phase III clinical trial in the EU for its Remicade (infliximab) biosimilar BOW015, which is expected to get under way during the first half of 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Epirus-fixes-on-Europe-for-biosimilar-base-business-354243" target="_new">1 October 2014</a>). The company also wants to advance other biosimilars in its pipeline.</p><p>Mirati Therapeutics of San Diego priced 2.25m shares at $20 each for gross proceeds of $45m. The cash will be used for general corporate purposes, including ongoing clinical development of oncology programs, such as MGCD265. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which selectively targets MET and Axl, is in Phase I/II development for lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The company previously raised $53m in 2013 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Recro-Rigel-Mirati-Ziopharm-347599" target="_new">25 October 2013</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
