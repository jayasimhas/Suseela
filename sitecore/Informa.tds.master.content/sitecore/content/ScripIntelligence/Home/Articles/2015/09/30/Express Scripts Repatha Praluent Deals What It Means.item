<p>After all the handwringing about whether payers would cover the newly approved proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors Praluent (alirocumab), marketed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Repatha (evolocumab), from Amgen Inc., Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company in the US, said it has sealed deals for both drugs &ndash; declaring it has scored discounts on the medicines, which means neither will be excluded from its formulary.</p><p>Express Scripts said its agreements with the PCSK9 inhibitor makers to put Praluent and Repatha on the PBM's "national preferred formulary" &ndash; the nation's largest formulary covering about 25 million Americans &ndash; also calls for capping future cost increases and managing who gets the cholesterol-lowering medicines, which is aimed at lowering costs for its plan sponsors.</p><p>While Express Scripts said it has locked in reduced prices from Sanofi and Regeneron on Praluent, whose wholesale acquisition cost was set at $14,600, and Amgen on Repatha, whose WAC is slightly lower at $14,100, the PBM would not disclose what those markdowns came to under the agreements.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Innovative-Value-Based-Pricing-Strategies-Biopharmas-Savior-360173" target="_new">In August</a>, Steve Miller, senior vice president and chief medical officer at Express Scripts, said the PBM would "leverage" the competition between the two PCSK9 inhibitors "to achieve the greatest possible discounts for our clients and patients."</p><p>He and leaders from rival PBM CVS Health Corp. had both argued the PCSK9s had the potential to become the costliest therapies in the US &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">breaking the American health system's bank</a>.</p><p>Miller said it was Express Script's "preference" for the PCSK9 manufacturers to provide "favorable pricing so that it would make sense for our national formulary to cover both products," rather than excluding one or both drugs. </p><p><b>Caps On Future Cost Increases</b></p><p>In addition to the undisclosed discounts on Praluent, which was approved in the US on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">July 24</a>, and Repatha, which gained the FDA's nod on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">Aug. 27</a>, Express Scripts said it also intends to cap the entire plan cost in 2016 for the PCSK9 inhibitors for clients enrolled in its recently created Cholesterol Care Value program.</p><p>Express Scripts spokesman David Whitrap told <i>Scrip</i> the company has created "individualized" ceilings for amounts the plan sponsors in the national preferred formulary, which is mostly employers, will need to spend on the PCSK9s, "which is much lower than they were expecting."</p><p>"It's a novel approach we are bringing to the pharmacy space," Whitrap declared, noting the caps will be "customized" around the demographics of the plan sponsors.</p><p>Putting the caps on future costs of the medicines also provides predictability for the plan sponsors so they don't fall victim to the sudden price escalations that have been the talk of Wall Street and Washington alike in the past month, Whitrap said.</p><p>The move could put more pressure on the entire biopharmaceutical industry, which already is under attack after companies like <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">Turing Pharmaceuticals AG</a> increased the price of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine) by more than 5,000%, which the CEO has now <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">backed away from</a>, although it's unclear by how much, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., in a similar move, raised the costs of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel (isoprenaline) from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%.</p><p>Both firms have caught the attention of congressional leaders, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introduced legislation</a> last month aimed at reining in prescription drug costs and stopping price gouging. Cummings and 17 other Democrats have called for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pricing-Policy-Panic-Persists-Subpoena-Demands-Vex-Valeant-360715" target="_new">Valeant to be subpoenaed</a> to appear before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee &ndash; a hearing that has yet to be scheduled.</p><p>But with the PCSK9s, Whitrap said his company will be able to "provide some assurance to our clients that we are able to not only deliver immediate affordability but also long-term affordability. That's what interests our clients."</p><p>"We are able to keep things at a sustainable rate for our clients," he added.</p><p>Express Scripts estimated that its national preferred formulary clients collectively will spend about $750m on the PCSK9 inhibitors in 2016, which it said was "far lower than industry forecasts."</p><p>Whitrap said that figure is actually a "small percentage of the national spend on this," although he pointed out Express Scripts' clients represent about a quarter of the American population for the drugs.</p><p><b>Controlling Use</b></p><p>Express Scripts said its Cholesterol Care Value program relies on "rigorous clinical documentation" to ensure the PCSK9 inhibitors go to the "right patients, while minimizing unnecessary risks and wasteful spending."</p><p>Whitrap said the firm would require doctors to show their patients have tried and failed statins, rather than just claiming someone is statin-intolerant, before Express Scripts would cover the use of the PCSK9 inhibitors.</p><p>In managing who gets the PCSK9s inhibitors, he said Express Scripts is using the FDA's labeling and the protocols the manufacturers have laid out. </p><p>Express Scripts argued that for the large majority of the more than 70 million people with high cholesterol, "statins are the clinically appropriate, tried-and-true therapy."</p><p>"When older therapies are going to be just as effective, it's generally in the best interests of the country and the interests of those patients to be on those medications," Whitrap said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
