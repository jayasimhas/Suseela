<p><p>Depomed reiterated its opposition to the Horizon Pharma acquisition, reminding its shareholders in a letter that the company believes it is being undervalued and that the Nucynta franchise holds greater value than the deal. </p><p>Days after Horizon commenced its tender offer for the outstanding shares of Depomed -- taking its hostile offer straight to the target's shareholders &ndash; Depomed CEO Jim Schoeneck said in a letter to shareholders that the Horizon offer is disingenuous and opportunistic. </p><p>Based on current exchange rates, Depomed says the offer is worth $27.93 per share, while Horizon continues to say the value of the all-stock offer is $33 per share.</p><p>"It is clear to us, and should be to you, that such actions tell you everything you need to know about Horizon's objectives in this process, and the extent to which Horizon will go to put its own interests ahead of yours," wrote Schoeneck. </p><p>Depomed accused Horizon of using the proprietary information the company gained during the bidding process for Nucynta to inform its offer, in hopes of having the deal go through before Nucynta's full value was revealed. </p><p>"We believe that based on this information, Horizon quickly moved to attempt to acquire Depomed before we had the opportunity to (1) re-launch the franchise and (2) announce our record financial results for the second quarter of 2015," the exec added. </p><p>Schoeneck went on to criticize Horizon's management style and business model, calling the frequency and magnitude of Horizon's price increases unsustainable and noting that many of the company's drugs have been removed from the largest pharmacy benefit manager formularies. </p><p>"Due to Horizon's dramatic price increases and what, in our view, is a lack of meaningful product differentiation, many of Horizon's drugs have recently been removed from the largest PBM drug formularies and remain on the exclusion lists of the two largest PBMs through 2016," he said. </p><p>Ultimately, Depomed recommends that its shareholders do not tender their shares to Horizon and that they place their faith in Depomed's continued strength as a standalone company. </p><p>Horizon launched its tender offer on Sept. 8. The offer of 0.95 Horizon shares for each Depomed share equates to a takeover value of $1.7bn based on Horizon's share price of $29.72 before markets opened on Sept. 9. </p><p>Horizon put forth a slate of seven board members that it would like to get elected to the Depomed board of directors. The list, made public on Aug. 19, included former member of the NASDAQ Stock Market Review Council Robert Daines, current Chairman of the audit committee at Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Jack Kaye and SVP of business and corporate development at Flamel Technologies Steven Lisi.</p><p><p>
