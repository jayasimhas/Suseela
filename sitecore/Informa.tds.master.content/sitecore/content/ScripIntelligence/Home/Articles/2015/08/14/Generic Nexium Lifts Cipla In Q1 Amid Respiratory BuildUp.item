<p>Cipla has reported a 41.6% jump in revenues to INR38.53bn ($591.8m) for the first quarter ended June buoyed by a sharp increase in exports including supplies of generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) to Teva. Net profits for the quarter soared 120.9% to INR6.51bn.</p><p>In a late evening post-results investor call on Aug. 14, Cipla's global chief operating officer (COO), Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, said that the performance represented the highest revenue and profit quarter in Cipla's 80-year history.</p><p>Current year figures, however, include the relevant results of Cipla's subsidiaries from the date they became subsidiaries of the company and hence the corresponding figures for the previous period are not comparable.</p><p>Domestic sales grew by 8.4% INR13.97bn during the first quarter, while exports of formulations increased by 78.5% to INR21.74bn. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) exports were INR2.06bn (+47%).</p><p>The company explained that the impact of generic Nexium supplies "in terms of profit share" was seen in the first quarter.</p><p>Earlier this year, the FDA approved the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393" target="_new">first generic version</a> of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product. </p><p>Cipla said that it expected to maintain focus on "smooth" supplies of esomeprazole and budesonide respules for the US.</p><p>Cipla's partner Sandoz had in July announced the introduction in the US of its budesonide inhalation suspension, a generic version of AstraZeneca's Pulmicort Respules inhalation suspension 1mg. Sandoz expects 180-day generic drug marketing exclusivity for the 1mg strength.</p><p>Some analysts had earlier indicated that that they expect generic budesonide inhalation suspension 1 mg to generate annualized sales of around $30m assuming about 20% price erosion, 50% market share and Cipla's profit share of 30%, provided there's no other generic competitor for around a year.</p><p>Significantly, Cipla officials indicated that the company expected a tripling of the its respiratory business over the next five years from around $350m in 2014-15, with about 50% of the growth coming from India, South Africa and emerging markets. Of the balance 50% growth, about two third is likely to be from North America, with Europe accounting for the remaining one-third. </p><p>The company has launched salmeterol/fluticasone in Romania during the quarter and mometasone in Romania and Italy. Salmeterol/fluticasone had earlier been launched in certain European markets including Croatia, Germany, Sweden and Belgium.</p><p>Cipla said that its overall outlook for fiscal 2015-16 remains strong and that it expects 20% top-line growth.</p>
