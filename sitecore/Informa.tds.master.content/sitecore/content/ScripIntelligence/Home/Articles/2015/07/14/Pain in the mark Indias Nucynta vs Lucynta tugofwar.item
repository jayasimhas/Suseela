<p>An Indian court has stayed the operation of a restraining order against Lupin in a trademark suit over its version of Johnson & Johnson's pain drug, Nucynta (tapentadol). </p><p>Lupin's product is branded Lucynta and the Indian firm had argued that J&J neither manufactures nor sell Nucynta in India. In addition, it stated that J&J's case is not one of infringement but pertains to "passing off".</p><p>The Delhi High Court said that prima facie the impugned judgment of February this year "ought to be stayed" till the matter was heard "finally" primarily because J&J is "not in the market" in India. Lupin has been manufacturing and marketing Lucynta in India since October 2011.</p><p>"The suit was filed as far back as in July 2012 and although three years have passed, the respondent No. 1 [J&J] has not sought approval from the statutory authority for marketing its product. There shall be stay of operation of the impugned order," Judges Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva, said in an order dated 13 July.</p><p>Lupin had also argued that while its trade mark Lucynta has been registered in India, Nucynta has yet to be registered though J&J has applied for registration. </p><p>Lupin declined comment saying that it was in the silent period ahead of results, while J&J did not immediately respond to e-mail queries from <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>While the hearing may have gone Lupin's way for now, the court has ordered that Lupin keep "full account" of the manufacture and sale of Lucynta and also "not endeavour" to sell the product outside India.</p><p>"In the meanwhile, the parties may endeavour to amicably resolve the dispute," the order added. The case is expected to come up for hearing in September.</p><h2>Case developments</h2><p>Significantly, the suits concerning the Lucynta versus Nucynta trademarks appear to have seen a series of twists.</p><p>In the same year as J&J's passing off suit against Lupin in the Delhi High Court, Lupin moved the Bombay High Court seeking an injunction restraining J&J from using the Nucynta mark. Lupin claimed that Nucynta infringed its registered trademark Lucynta. The trade mark Lucynta was put on the Register of Trade Marks on 9 March 2012, case documents said.</p><p>In August 2012, a single judge bench of the Bombay High Court referred to the Full Bench of the same court for consideration whether the court can go into the question of the "validity of the registration" of the plaintiff's [Lupin's] trade mark at an interlocutory stage when the defendant [J&J] takes up the defence of invalidity of the registration of the plaintiff's trade mark in an infringement suit.</p><p>In December 2014, the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court held that in cases where the registration of trade mark is "ex facie illegal, fraudulent or shocks the conscience of the court", the court is "not powerless" to refuse to grant an injunction. It, though, said that for establishing these grounds, a "very high threshold" of prima facie proof is required.</p><p>"It is, therefore, open to the court to go into the question of validity of registration of plaintiff's trade mark for this limited purpose, to arrive at a prima facie finding," the Bench said in its order dated 23 December 2014.</p><p>J&J had previously underscored that it was the inventor of tapentadol, and was not only the first to coin and adopt a distinctive trade mark Nucynta but also that it had extensively used it in the international market since 2008. It also alleged that the adoption by Lupin of the Lucynta mark was "ex facie fraudulent" and the suit filed by the Indian firm was "mala fide." </p><p>"A pirator/copier was attempting to restrain the original adopter merely because he had secured registration of the mark wrongly and/or fraudulently," J&J then claimed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Depomed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-paying-1.05bn-for-Janssens-US-Nucynta-rights-356173" target="_new">acquired the US rights</a> for all approved formulations of Nucynta, which Janssen licensed in 2003 and co-developed with Grunenthal. </p>
