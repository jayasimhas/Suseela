<p>Eisai Inc., the US subsidiary of Eisai Co. Ltd., is teaming up with Purdue Pharma L.P. for the development and commercialization of the former firm's dual orexin receptor, lemborexant.</p><p>The initial indication for Eisai's candidate is insomnia and the two companies will share the costs of the drug's global clinical studies in this area. However, they may also seek to develop other indications in the future.</p><p>Purdue and Eisai will form a joint steering committee to manage development and pursue marketing authorizations for lemborexant worldwide. Once approved, Eisai and Purdue Pharma will co-promote the product and share costs and profits in the US and other territories (to be agreed by the parties).</p><p>Lemborexant is currently in Phase II studies for insomnia. Interim data released in late 2014 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in sleep initiation and sleep maintenance in patients given Eisai's drug without increased next-day residual sleepiness, when compared with placebo.</p><p>The most common treatment-emergent adverse events reported in patients treated with lemborexant were somnolence, headache and sleep paralysis. Analysts at Sagient Research, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, have given the drug a likelihood of approval rating of 19%, 2% above the average for a similar product at the same stage of development. </p><p>However, analysts are waiting for Phase III results to see how lemborexant will match up to its competition. Analysts at Sagient Research said Phase II results "are positive given the significant efficacy on wake after sleep onset (WASO) and latency to persistent sleep (LPS) endpoints at doses greater than 10 mg. However, we need more details on the magnitude of effect to compare this dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) to approved product, Merck & Co.'s Belsomra (suvorexant), another DORA."</p><p>On the signing of this collaboration, a Phase III trial for lemborexant will commence. The global trial program is designed to evaluate the efficacy of lemborexant on both objective and subjective measures of sleep. In addition, the development program will evaluate the impact of treatment of insomnia on daytime function. Safety and tolerability will also be evaluated.</p><p>Insomnia is common worldwide; according to Eisai, approximately 30% of adults report one or more symptoms of insomnia including difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep.</p>
