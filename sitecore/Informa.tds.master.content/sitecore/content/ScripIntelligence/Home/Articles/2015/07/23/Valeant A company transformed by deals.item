<p><p>Over the last five years Valeant Pharmaceuticals has gone from a small Canadian dermatology company to a large multi-national conglomerate. This transformation was due to CEO Michael Pearson's vision of acquiring growth instead of focusing on in-house R&D. </p><p>Valeant has become the poster child for growth-through-acquisition, and several other companies have modeled themselves after Valeant, trying to replicate its success.</p><p>Since Biovail bought Valeant in a reverse merger in June 2010, the new iteration of Valeant has been one of the most acquisitive companies in the industry, completing 21 full acquisitions in the last five years &ndash; that doesn't take into account Valeant's purchase of single assets or licensing agreements. </p><p>Most of the acquisitions have been small in scale &ndash; only three were larger than $1bn &ndash; but all of the deals have added to Valeant's geographic footprint and increased its scale in a number of product areas. </p><p>Most of the deals that the company conducted in 2011 and 2012 added dermatology, over-the-counter products and generics to the company's portfolio &ndash; all areas that legacy Valeant/Biovail already had a strong position. The $8.7bn acquisition of Bausch+Lomb in 2013 was a game-changer for the company, giving it a huge portfolio of eye care products; many of the acquisitions made since then have added further to its eye care offerings. </p><p>The $15.8bn purchase of Salix Pharmaceuticals earlier this year was another transformational moment, making Valeant more of a specialty pharma. </p><p>Expect further commentary from Valeant on its dealmaking strategy and the integration of Salix during its second quarter earnings call on 23 July. </p><p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">Valeant's Acquisition Spree&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Deal Date</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Deal Amount</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Deal Summary</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> July 2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$22.4m in cash + $5m in debt</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Valeant acquired contact lens maker Unilens Vision for $12.75 per share plus $5m in debt to complement the Bausch + Lomb business it bought in 2013. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p> July 2015</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$800m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The company bought Egypt's largest pharma company, the privately-held Amoun Pharmaceuticals.
