<p>AstraZeneca won approval from the FDA to market Iressa (gefitinib) as a targeted monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, as identified through a companion diagnostic test from Qiagen, which also gained the agency's nod.</p><p>Iressa, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, acts by blocking the transmission of signals involved in the growth and spread of tumors.</p><p>The new drug application (NDA) for Iressa was based on data from the Phase III IFUM trial and the results from the IPASS trial, in addition to other collaborative group studies.</p><p>Qiagen's therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic test rapidly identifies EGFR mutation status through a tumor tissue sample to guide the use of Iressa in treating patients with metastatic NSCLC, AstraZeneca said.</p><p>The FDA noted that Iressa previously was on the US market, but AstraZeneca <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-makes-it-official-AstraZenecas-Iressa-Sanofis-Oforta-NDAs-withdrawn-329700" target="_new">withdrew</a> the application in April 2012.</p><p>Iressa originally had been granted accelerated approval on 2 May 2003 as monotherapy after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies for the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.</p><p>The required postmarketing studies were completed but they failed to verify and confirm clinical benefit.</p><p>In August 2010, the FDA asked AstraZeneca to voluntarily withdraw Iressa from the US market.</p><p>AstraZeneca complied, but in a 1 February 2011 letter, told the FDA it was voluntarily withdrawing the NDA as a "business decision" &ndash; informing regulators the firm would take the drug off the US market by 30 September 2011. </p><p>The FDA noted that AstraZeneca waived any opportunity for a hearing on the agency's request.</p><p>Regulators emphasized that Iressa's new approval is in a very different patient population than the 2003 approval.</p><p>AstraZeneca said Iressa currently is approved in 91 countries as a treatment for adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating mutations of the EGFR tyrosine kinase.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
