<p>Lilly has launched a new database for tracking the progress in cancer research and development aimed at informing public policy decisions about the value of therapies and efforts to accelerate biomedical innovation.</p><p>The PACE Continuous Innovation Indicators (CII) is an evidence-based, customizable online tool intended to review the progress against cancer over time, explained Dr John Lechleiter, chairman, president and CEO at Lilly.</p><p>He said the PACE CII can help policymakers, health policy experts and patient advocates gain a better understanding of how value in cancer treatment evolves and consider the potential impacts of policy reforms on the speed of innovation, such as two legislative initiatives ongoing in the House and the Senate &ndash; 21st Century Cures and the Healthier Americans, respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">28 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">29 January 2015</a>).</p><p>During the launch period, Lilly said it intends to make the database available to other organizations by request.</p><p>The database, which is part of Lilly's three-year-old Patient Access to Cancer care Excellence (PACE) initiative &ndash; which Dr Lechleiter insisted is "not a lobbying effort," but a global collaboration &ndash; initially will cover 12 cancer types: breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, melanoma, stomach, rectum and testes.</p><p>The PACE CII includes "thousands of pieces" of evidence that are "curated and coded by trained analysts from authoritative, published sources," such as clinical trial records and meta-analyses, observational studies and historical references, according to Lilly.</p><p>The company said the tool provides a layered interface with a range of information and generates summary graphs from which a user can access supporting evidence and additional information. </p><p>"The more closely we look at the history of progress against cancer, the more we have to acknowledge grudgingly that progress almost never consists of someone coming down from the mountain with a cure, let alone the cure," Dr Lechleiter said. </p><p>But he said experts often are either over-selling the prospects of new treatment paradigms or are diminishing the significance of smaller breakthroughs.</p><p>"That worries those of us who want to improve the innovation environment for progress against cancer since the answers are just not that simple," Dr Lechleiter said.</p><p>So he said Lilly set out to contribute to a fuller understanding of progress against cancer by developing a tool that would "dig deeply" into the evidence of the last four decades to test assumptions about "how we got to where we are and how to move faster."</p><p>While "big stories" are arising from the database, many other smaller, "but important" ones also have emerged &ndash; "stories that center on subtypes of cancer or specific patient groups, how treatments combine to produce better results, why progress tends to cluster in certain areas and what policy changes might do to encourage progress in areas that have seen few steps forward," Dr Lechleiter declared. </p><p>He noted that PACE CII's "well-curated data, to be sure," will subject, like most data, to different perspectives and interpretations. </p><p>"Our goal is an honest and open grappling with the hard-core, evidence-based history of innovation against cancer, and we hope that some of you will want to be part of that grappling and part of helping to draw the appropriate conclusions for innovation policy," he said at a forum in Washington on 29 January.</p><p>The PACE CII's evidence helps blow away the assumptions that cancer progress "moves forward in large leaps and bounds and that there is likely to be a big breakthrough the cure that ultimately puts cancer behind us."</p><p>"The insights captured in this tool," he said, demonstrate that "step-wise, continuous innovation will continue to be the path forward against cancer," although he acknowledged the current rate of speed remains too slow. </p><p>Dr Lechleiter pointed to testicular cancer &ndash; a disease for which the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has said 95% of men diagnosed now can be cured &ndash; as one area where the PACE CII has demonstrated the value in not being too quick to dismiss small steps of progress over the past four decades. </p><p>The 1960s, there was intense research on chemotherapy going on, producing small steps forward, but no reliable remissions.</p><p>By 1977, the accumulation of evidence showed that a combination of three drugs &ndash; cisplatin, vinblastine and bleomycin &ndash; produced a cure in many patients with metastatic testicular cancer. </p><p>A decade later, vinblastine had been replaced by another drug that produced even better results in the triple combination, Dr Lechleiter explained. </p><p>"The key insight is that you would be hard pressed to remove any one of those steps and still be certain that research would have arrived at a lasting cure," he said. </p><p>But, he said, when bleomycin was approved by the FDA in 1974 as an antibiotic with anticancer effects, the drug "easily could have been slapped with the label, 'me-too drug,' since it was not the first in its class."</p><p>"Over the next three years, however, bleomycin proved itself to be unique in not suppressing the bone marrow's ability to produce fresh blood cells in the way that its competitors did and so it emerged as the best backbone of the combination cure for testicular cancer, which it remains to this day," Dr Lechleiter said.</p><p>The evidence captured by the PACE CII, he said, "shows that treatments often need time to demonstrate what they can do." </p><p>Dr Lechleiter condemned efforts by ASCO to "pass judgment at the launch of a new medicine on whether it is clinically meaningful or has value to patients" &ndash; insisting it "risks stifling the continuous-innovation process." </p><p>He was referring to ASCO's "Value Initiative," an algorithm-based conceptual framework intended to define and assess the relative value of different cancer options (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASCO-2014-High-cancer-costs-Not-victimless-for-anyone-352142" target="_new">4 June 2014</a>). </p><p>While Dr Lechleiter said he understood the motives behind ASCO's efforts and similar attempts by others to want to help doctors and patients determine whether a new treatment is worth its cost in relation to other options. </p><p>"But this is rarely a calculation that can be done before a new medicine has been widely vetted in clinical research and in practice," the Lilly chief argued. "The evidence tells us that progress against cancer invariably occurs in a stepwise climb, sometimes in bigger steps, sometimes in smaller steps, sometimes sideways for a bit, as we struggle to understand the terrain, but almost always onward and upward."</p><p>He acknowledged "the climb has been so darned slow" in making progress in cancer &ndash; pointing out it was 27 years to a durable cure in the case of testicular cancer, "which is one of the few cancers for which we can talk about a cure."</p><p>But, Dr Lechleiter asserted, "suppressing the small steps won't save money in the long run." </p><p>"When was the last time you heard a controversy about the cost of treating testicular cancer? The components of the treatment cocktail that cures testicular cancer now are generic medicines and the costs are completely manageable," he pointed out.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
