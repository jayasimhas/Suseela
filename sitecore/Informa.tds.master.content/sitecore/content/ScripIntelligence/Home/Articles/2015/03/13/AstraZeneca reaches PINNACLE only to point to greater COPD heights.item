<p>AstraZeneca will file for approval of its combination product for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) later this year on the back of positive top-line data from two studies in its Phase III PINNACLE program.</p><p>The product, which AstraZeneca gained through its 2013 acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics (now a wholly owned subsidiary), is a fixed-dose combination of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). It is the first to use Pearl's novel porous particle co-suspension technology to deliver the combination in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, and is one of a series of products based on the technology in AstraZeneca's development pipeline. </p><p>Combinations of LABA and LAMA products are the new mainstay of COPD treatment, and this twice-daily offering will need to compete with other similar once-daily offerings: GlaxoSmithKline/Theravance's marketed Anoro (umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol), Boehringer Ingelheim's olodaterol/tiotropium (awaiting EU approval) and Ultibro Breezhaler (QVA149 or indacaterol/glycopyrronium) marketed by Novartis. AstraZeneca also now has, through its acquisition of Almirall, LAS40464 (aclidinium bromide/formoterol), another launched twice-daily LABA/LAMA. </p><p>Analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare note that with the availability of once-daily combinations, PT003's twice-daily formulation means that it will need to offer a significant improvement in efficacy in order to be the combination of choice. "Launch timing will furthermore be crucial to success, as high brand loyalty exists with patients hesitant to switch between devices. The once-daily LABA/LAMA Anoro has reached the market ahead of PT003 in the US, and [the two other] once-daily LABA/LAMAs are expected to launch in this region, further lowering PT003's commercial attractiveness," they say.</p><p>AstraZeneca will be able to fall back on its established position in the respiratory market, which will put PT003 in a stronger position to compete with the rival LABA/LAMAs. Even so, demonstrating an efficacy advantage will be key for uptake.</p><p>But long-term, what the PINNACLE data really represent is a stepping stone to the ultimate objective of a triple COPD combination also including an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), in this case PT010 (budesonide + formoterol fumarate + glycopyrronium, in Phase II), although even here it is not the only company in the race. Chiesi already has a triple fixed dose combination of formoterol fumarate (LABA), glycopyrrolate (LAMA) and beclometasone dipropionate (ICS) in Phase III. AstraZeneca is playing catch-up with GSK (which has a fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium /vilanterol combo in Phase III) as well. </p><p>"Today's results are also encouraging for the development of our investigative triple-drug combination of LAMA/LABA and inhaled corticosteroids," said Briggs Morrison, AstraZeneca's executive vice-president, global medicines development and chief medical officer.</p><h2>studies</h2><p>The two 24-week studies, PINNACLE 1 and PINNACLE 2, both had the primary objective of benefits on lung function as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). PT003 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 versus the individual components glycopyrronium pMDI (PT001) and formoterol fumarate (PT005) pMDI, and placebo. Both PT001 and PT005 also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 compared to placebo, AstraZeneca said. In PINNACLE 1, open-label tiotropium was included as an active control, which should give a clear understanding of the product's relative efficacy.</p><p>The most common adverse events across all arms were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and dyspnea, with the incidence being generally similar. A 28-week extension study, PINNACLE 3, is underway but no safety information is yet available.</p><p>Overall the Phase III pivotal program enrolled over 3,700 COPD patients and the full data from all three studies will be presented at a scientific meeting later this year, AstraZeneca said.</p><p>
