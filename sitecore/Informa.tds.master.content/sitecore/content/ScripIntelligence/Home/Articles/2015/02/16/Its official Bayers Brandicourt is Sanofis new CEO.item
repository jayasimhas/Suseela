<p>It's been the subject of continuous biopharma industry chatter for a week or more and now the rumor has been confirmed: Bayer HealthCare chairman Olivier Brandicourt will be the next CEO of Sanofi.</p><p>Both companies denied media reports as recently as 17 February that Dr Brandicourt, a native of Sanofi's home country of France, would leave Bayer (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Brandicourt-to-abandon-Bayer-for-Sanofi-356797" target="_new">17 February 2015</a>). He will replace Chris Viehbacher, who was ousted in October for a myriad of reasons, including dubious prospects for Sanofi's diabetes franchise and a supposed disconnect with the company's board of directors (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-board-ousts-Viehbacher-354729" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>).</p><p>By announcing Dr Brandicourt's appointment on 19 February, Sanofi made good on its promise to name a replacement for Mr Viehbacher during the first quarter of this year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Euro-helps-Sanofi-deliver-as-CEO-hunt-nears-end-356574" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>). In agreement with Bayer, Dr Brandicourt will take on his new role at Sanofi on 2 April. His last day at Bayer will be 31 March.</p><p>"Sanofi undertook a rigorous selection process to identify the right person to lead Sanofi forward at an important time for our company," Sanofi chairman Serge Weinberg said in a company statement. "Olivier Brandicourt's strong experience combined with his international profile, deep knowledge of US and emerging health care markets, and his capability to unite teams will provide new dynamism to Sanofi's strategy of diversification and innovation."</p><p>Dr Brandicourt has been with Bayer since 1 November 2013. Previously, he was a member of Pfizer's executive leadership team beginning in 2010. A trained doctor educated in Paris, he began his industrial career with Parke-Davis/Warner Lambert in 1987.</p><p>Bayer HealthCare board of management member Werner Baumann will become chairman of the board when Dr Brandicourt leaves the company. Mr Baumann has been with Bayer since 2002, serving as head of central administration and organization then chief financial officer before joining the management board at the start of 2010. He was appointed chief strategy and portfolio officer on 1 October to oversee corporate development, including mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Marijn Dekkers, chairman of Bayer HealthCare's parent company Bayer AG, described Mr Baumann as "a highly experienced leader with extensive expertise" in an announcement about the health care business's executive changes.</p><p>Like Dr Brandicourt, who'll be charged with growing revenue at Sanofi as diabetes revenues flatten in 2015, Mr Baumann also will have his hands full at Bayer. He'll be expected to manage the strategic realignment of Bayer HealthCare as part of the parent company's plan, which was revealed last year, to focus on its life science and crop science businesses going forward and spin its plastics business out as a separate company (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bayer-to-shed-Material-Science-unit-via-IPO-354017" target="_new">18 September 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
