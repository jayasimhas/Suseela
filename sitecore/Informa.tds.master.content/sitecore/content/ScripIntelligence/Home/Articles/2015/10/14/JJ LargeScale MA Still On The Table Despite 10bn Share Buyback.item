<p><p>Johnson & Johnson&rsquo;s new $10bn share-buyback program will not impact the company&rsquo;s ability to complete large-scale M&A, Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during the company&rsquo;s third quarter sales and earnings call Oct. 13.</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t interpret the $10bn share buyback as impacting our appetite for scale of any size in M&A,&rdquo; he said in response to an analyst question. &ldquo;Our appetite for M&A in any scale has entirely to do with whether the acquisition is going to create value for shareholders.&rdquo;</p><p>Nonetheless, he acknowledged that large acquisitions have been few and far between for J&J and could remain that way. That&rsquo;s because tuck-in acquisitions and in-licensing deals &ndash; particularly within pharmaceuticals &ndash; provide the best value in the most capital-efficient manner, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t preclude us from then also looking for large-scale acquisitions,&rdquo; he added. The company&rsquo;s board of directors approved the repurchase of up to $10bn of the company&rsquo;s stock as a way to return value to shareholders while still continuing to invest in internal R&D and external business development.</p><p>The buyback was announced as the company reported that third quarter sales fell 7.4% versus the year-ago quarter to $17.1bn. Sales were negatively impacted by currency, which accounted for 8.2% of the decline while sales grew operationally 0.8%.</p><p>Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $7.7bn decreased 7.4%, representing a 0.3% operational decline and a negative impact from currency of 7.1%. Pharma sales reflected lower sales in hepatitis C, where the company&rsquo;s <i>Olysio</i> (simeprevir) faced new competitive entrants versus 2014.</p><p><b>J&J&rsquo;s Rising Stars: Invokana And Imbruvica</b></p><p>Newer drugs like the SGLT-2 inhibitor <i>Invokana</i> (canagliflozin) for type 2 diabetes and <i>Imbruvica</i> (ibrutinib) for certain blood cancers were among the top growth drivers.</p><p>Invokana has been performing well as the first drug to market in a new class for type 2 diabetes. It is on track to become a blockbuster this year, generating sales of $340 million in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 95.4% compared to the third quarter of 2014.</p><p>However, Invokana could face more pressure from Eli Lilly & Co./Boehringer Ingelheim GMBH&rsquo;s sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor <i>Jardiance</i> (empagliflozin) now that it has shown impressive data on cardiovascular outcomes. Invokana has led the market since it was approved by FDA, but Jardiance, which debuted in September 2014 as the third drug in the class, became the first type 2 diabetes drug to demonstrate a cardiovascular <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/9/17/Empagliflozins-CV-Benefit-Impresses-At-EASD-But-What-Will-FDA-Say?result=1&total=1&searchquery=%253fq%253d14150917005" target="_new">benefit</a> in a large clinical outcomes study in August.</p><p>Caruso said it is too early yet to say if the data are having an impact on Invokana. &ldquo;We do think that the positive benefits seen by the Lilly compound is most likely a class effect of SGLT-2s,&rdquo; he said. J&J is also running a large cardiovascular outcomes trial, CANVAS, but the study isn&rsquo;t expected to complete until June 2017, according to clinicaltrials.gov.</p><p>Sales of Imbruvica, the Bruton&rsquo;s tyrosine kinase inhibitor J&J developed with partner Pharmacyclics Inc., which was acquired by AbbVie Inc. in May for $21bn, were $184m. The figure includes $98m from the US and $86m from the rest of the world. US sales of Imbruvica ultimately will be higher since J&J splits global profits and sales 50/50 with AbbVie.</p><p>J&J books sales internationally, where it markets the drug independently, while AbbVie books revenue in the US, where it leads commercialization. AbbVie then pays J&J 50% minus cost of goods sold. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted in a same-day email alert that the US sales figure reported by J&J is also net of selling, general and administrative expenses; he estimated AbbVie will report US sales of Imbruvica of around $257m.</p><p>The companies expect Imbruvica to become a blockbuster through geographic and indication expansion. In September, the partners <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/9/14/AbbVieJampJs-Imbruvica-Marches-Toward-FrontLine-CLL-Indication-With-sNDA?result=1&total=1&searchquery=%253fq%253d14150914002" target="_new">announced</a> a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) filing for Imbruvica for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia aged 65 and older. The BTK inhibitor has been <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet/77/8/CLL-Market-Update-emImbruvicaem-Leads-Way-JumpStarted-By-Robust-Launch?result=1&total=1&searchquery=%253fq%253d00150216011%25255D" target="_new">approved</a> for relapsed/refractory CLL since February 2014.</p><p>J&J is also preparing for another oncology launch. With partner Genmab AS, it completed a rolling biologics license application (BLA) filing for the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab for the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma and was granted a priority review by FDA during the quarter.</p><p><b>J&J Defends Drug Prices</b></p><p>Caruso also defended pharmaceutical pricing during the call, as the issue has resurfaced as a hot-button area. </p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of rhetoric about pharmaceutical drug pricing, and despite significant media attention on drug pricing, there really isn&rsquo;t a consensus on policy solutions that would lower prices without negatively impacting innovation,&rdquo; he said. </p><p>&ldquo;The pharmaceutical industry has and continues to be a constructive partner in any of these policy debates, and we look for solutions to the issue along with policymakers,&rdquo; he added. </p><p>But industry and payers could work to explore new reimbursement models, he suggested. &ldquo;As the US health care system evolves, I think we&rsquo;ll have more of a focus on outcomes and value, and we&rsquo;re working with public and private payers to develop innovative outcomes-based contracts. We think the real answer to this dilemma is to monitor and provide outcomes-based metrics and not simply focus only on price,&rdquo; he said. </p><p><p>
