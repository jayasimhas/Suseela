<p> Portola Pharmaceuticals and Boehringer Ingelheim have reported strong late-stage data supporting the upcoming filings for their long-awaited anticoagulant antidotes, andexanet alfa and idarucizumab. </p> <p> At the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis meeting this week in Toronto, Portola presented the full results from the second part of its Phase III ANNEXA-A study of andexanet alfa as an iv bolus plus two-hour infusion to sustain the reversal of the anticoagulation activity of Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer's Factor Xa inhibitor Eliquis (apixaban). </p> <p> Boehringer, meanwhile, reported an interim analysis of the Phase III RE-VERSE AD study showing that 5g of idarucizumab immediately reversed the anticoagulant effect of its direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (Pradaxa) in patients requiring urgent anticoagulant reversal. These data were simultaneously published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p> <p> Antidotes to the anticoagulant effects of the newer blood thinners are much sought after. While the newer oral anticoagulants products were a welcome alternative to warfarin in reducing the risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes in a variety of clinical settings, doctors sometimes need urgently to reverse their effects in cases of hemorrhage or when emergency surgery is indicated. </p> <p> In the large stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF) market, Pradaxa was the first to market in late 2010, followed a year later by Xarelto, and then by Eliquis. However, the lack of antidotes to these products (as compared with warfarin, for which vitamin K is used), left prescribers cautious and uptake has been slower than hoped. For companies in this highly competitive anticoagulant market, also being able to offer a matching antidote would provide a marketing advantage. </p> <p> Boehringer's idarucizumab became the first specific reversal agent to the new oral anticoagulants to be filed when it was submitted under an accelerated approval pathway to the FDA, EMA and Health Canada earlier this year for use in patients who require urgent reversal of dabigatran. The FDA has granted it both orphan and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BIs-Pradaxa-antidote-idarucizumab-wins-US-priority-review-358036">breakthrough therapy designations</a>. </p> <p> Boehringer Ingelheim plans eventually to submit idarucizumab in all countries where dabigatran is licensed; further submissions are ongoing and accelerated processes will be pursued with where available, it says. </p> <p> For its part, Portola plans to submit data from the ANNEXA-A and ANNEXA-R (which looked at its activity against Bayer/J&amp;J's Factor Xa inhibitor Xarelto (rivaroxaban)) studies, as well as initial data from a Phase IV study, as part of its <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Portola-readies-Factor-Xa-antidote-for-approval-357723">BLA filing to the FDA</a> under an accelerated approval pathway by the end of 2015. It too has orphan drug status, and is being developed to work with the range of Factor Xa inhibitor products. </p> <p> Andexanet alfa is a modified human Factor Xa molecule that acts as a decoy to target and sequester both Factor Xa inhibitors in the blood. Once bound, the Factor Xa inhibitors are unable to bind to and inhibit native Factor Xa, restoring of normal hemostatic processes. Its effects can be short-acting through a bolus injection or longer acting when given via an extended infusion. </p> <h2> ANNEXA-A </h2> <p> In Part 2 of the ANNEXA-A study, 31 healthy volunteers were given apixaban 5 mg twice daily for four days and then randomized to andexanet alfa administered as a 400mg iv bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 4mg/min for 120 minutes or to placebo. </p> <p> The results show that following the bolus administration of andexanet alfa the anticoagulant activity of apixaban, as measured by anti-Factor Xa activity, was reversed by 93.5% (p&lt;0.0001). And after the two-hour continuous infusion, the anticoagulant activity of apixaban remained significantly reversed<i>, </i>by 92.7% (p&lt;0.0001). </p> <p> Additional secondary endpoints showed there was reversal of at least 80% of anti-Factor Xa activity occurred in all 23 subjects who received andexanet alfa (p&lt;0.0001). Also, plasma levels of free unbound apixaban were significantly reduced with andexanet alfa (p=0.0002), and thrombin generation was restored to baseline levels. </p> <p> There were no serious adverse events, thrombotic events, or antibodies to Factor X or Xa, but mild infusion reactions were reported in six subjects. </p> <p> Analysts at BioMedTracker said that the efficacy looked encouraging, as in other studies, with continued reduction in anti-Factor Xa during the dosing, but added, &quot;There were no thrombotic events, but these were healthy patients, so it will be interesting to see what they find in their study of patients with an acute bleed.&quot; </p> <h2> RE-VERSE AD </h2> <p> By contrast, Boehringer's RE-VERSE AD is an ongoing real-world study investigating idarucizumab in emergency settings in up to 300 patients either with uncontrollable or life-threatening bleeding deemed to require reversal, or patients who needed surgery or an invasive procedure within eight hours for which normal blood clotting were required. </p> <p> Idarucizumab is a humanized antibody fragment, or Fab, which was designed as a specific reversal agent to dabigatran. It binds specifically to dabigatran molecules to neutralize their anticoagulant effect without interfering with the coagulation cascade. </p> <p> In the trial, patients are receiving two 50ml bolus infusions of 2.5g of idarucizumab no more than 15 minutes apart, with blood taken to assess for anticoagulant effect at baseline, after the first bolus and then at intervals up to 24 hours after the second bolus. </p> <p> The primary endpoint of the study is the degree of reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within four hours measured by diluted thrombin time (dTT) and ecarin clotting time (ECT). </p> <p> The interim analysis includes data from 81 patients who presented with elevated anticoagulation levels at baseline as measured with ECT, results showed that the primary endpoint has been met, with the median maximum percentage reversal of 100%. </p> <p> Reversal was evident immediately after administration of the first vial of idarucizumab and was complete in all but one patient. After four and 12 hours, laboratory tests showed normal coagulation levels in almost 90% of patients, and normal blood clotting (haemostasis) during surgery was reported in 92% of the patients that required surgery or invasive procedures. </p> <p> There was no sign of a pro-coagulant effect after drug administration. Overall, however, there were 18 deaths in the study which the investigators said appeared to be related to the original reason for emergency hospital admission. </p> <h2> lack of control </h2> <p> In an editorial accompanying the <i>NEJM</i> paper, Dr Kenneth Bauer of Harvard Medical School was impressed with the drug's efficacy: &quot;The data are convincing that the antidote effectively and immediately neutralized the activity of dabigatran with a satisfactory safety profile. Normal hemostasis was reported in more than 90% of the patients who underwent procedures after the administration of idarucizumab.&quot; However, he noted that without a control group, &quot;it is difficult to assess the clinical benefit that is conferred by the administration of idarucizumab in patients with dabigatran-related bleeding.&quot; </p> <p> Analysts at BioMedTracker agreed: &quot;While it is quite unclear from the current interim analysis how effective idarucizumab is in terms of clinical outcomes, given its effectiveness in normalizing clotting measures, we think the perceived need for such a drug would be too strong for this to hold up approval.&quot; </p> <p> Overall Dr Bauer welcomed the development of the new antidotes saying that they are an &quot;important advance&quot;. But he concluded: &quot;Additional studies, however, will be required to determine in which situations the antidotes improve clinical outcomes.&quot; </p>
