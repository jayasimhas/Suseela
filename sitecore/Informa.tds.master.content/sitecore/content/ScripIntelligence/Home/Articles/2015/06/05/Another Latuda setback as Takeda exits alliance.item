<p>Takeda Pharmaceutical has ended an alliance with fellow Japanese firm Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma for Latuda (lurasidone), dealing the second major blow to the atypical antipsychotic in recent weeks.</p><p>Takeda said it had decided with Sumitomo Dainippon (SDP) to terminate a March 2011 license agreement under which Takeda had jointly developed and was exclusively commercializing Latuda and other lurasidone-containing products in Europe.</p><p>The alliance covered the 26 member states of the EU (excluding the UK, where SDP holds rights), Switzerland, Norway, Turkey and Russia &ndash; all of Takeda's rights in these territories will now revert to SDP. </p><p>An exact termination date has yet to be set, but the two firms said they are "starting discussions in an effort to finalize and execute a mutual agreement establishing a transition plan". Takeda stressed that the decision was taken strictly on the basis of its own "market and business considerations" and not related to any new safety of efficacy information for lurasidone.</p><p>SDP said recently that a new analysis of data from the Phase III PASTEL Japanese study with the drug in schizophrenia had shown that both doses of the drug in fact missed statistical significance against the primary endpoint of the 457-patient trial.</p><p>The revised conclusions have thrown into doubt the prospects in Japan for this main planned indication of the drug, which SDP views as a key mid-term growth driver of its international and domestic business.</p><p>Latuda was approved for use in adult schizophrenia by the European Commission in March 2014 and is currently marketed in five countries in Europe under the Takeda collaboration: Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and the Netherlands, as well in as the UK.</p><p>Neither Takeda nor SDP released European sales figures for the drug in their most recent results, but SDP said the financial impact in the current fiscal year ending March 2016 is expected to be minor. SDP shares closed down 1.23% in Tokyo on 8 May after the announcement.</p><h2>new partner?</h2><p>It is not yet clear whether SDP will seek another regional partner given its limited commercial infrastructure in Europe, where it has only a small R&D operation and regional base in the UK, but this would seem to be the obvious alternative.</p><p>"We will consider all options, including collaboration with a new partner, for the continued development and commercialization of Latuda in Europe," SDP president and CEO Masayo Tada said in a statement.</p><p>Both SDP and Takeda stressed they would work together in the meantime to ensure continued access to the drug and a smooth supply transition for patients.</p><p>Before the termination of the Takeda contract, Datamonitor was predicting sales for Latuda of a modest $100m in the five major EU markets in 2023, driven mainly by use in schizophrenia, where the drug has a favorable tolerability and metabolic side effect profile. But the main opportunity is seen in the second- and third-line settings after the failure of (or intolerance to) mainstay therapies, and as a maintenance treatment.</p><p>A Phase III European trial program is also underway for bipolar maintenance and major depressive disorder.</p><h2>Takeda cancer Aaliance</h2><p><p>Separately, Takeda said it had entered into an agreement with Japan's National Cancer Center (NCC) to conduct joint basic research into innovative anticancer agents, through the sharing of information, cancer cell lines, animal models and screening techniques.</p><p>The hope is to conduct studies on pathogenesis and tumor drug susceptibility and to accelerate candidates into the clinic. Takeda will also take part in the NCC-led "SCRUM-Japan" academic-industry consortium for genomic screening, which searches for disease-related oncogene abnormalities.</p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/EU-approval-for-TakedaDSPs-schizophrenia-drug-Latuda-350968" target="_new">EU approval for Takeda/DSP's schizophrenia drug Latuda</a> (Scrip)</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/29/takeda-offers-24bn-nofault-settlement-of-actos-suits" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
