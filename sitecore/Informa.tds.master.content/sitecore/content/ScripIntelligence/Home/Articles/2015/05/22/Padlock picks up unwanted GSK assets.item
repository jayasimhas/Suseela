<p><p>As GlaxoSmithKline continues to focus its resources on its main areas of interest like oncology, vaccines and respiratory drugs, the big pharma is selling off some of its unwanted assets. </p><p>Padlock Therapeutics announced 28 May that it is purchasing assets from GSK for an undisclosed equity investment and board observer rights. GSK will not have no future rights to milestone payments or royalties. </p><p>The Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech will get in return the intellectual property, selected compounds in several chemical series, assays, data and crystal structures for a package of assets that target protein arginine-deiminases (PADs), a group of enzymes that modify arginine-related side chains and cause immunogenic effects in patients. </p><p>Padlock is hoping to inhibit these enzymes to create treatments for autoimmune diseases without suppressing the immune system. </p><p>"Since our founding just over a year ago, the Padlock team has achieved numerous research milestones as we build our PAD enzyme chemistry engine," said Padlock CEO Dr Michael Gilman. "We are thrilled to add GSK&rsquo;s assets and know-how to our platform. We believe that the compounds, methods, and data obtained from GSK, combined with our own internal expertise and proprietary chemistry, create an industry-leading R&D effort focused on the PAD enzymes and will expedite getting PAD-directed medicines to patients with serious autoimmune diseases."</p><p>The company closed a $23m Series A funding in December that included investments from Atlas Ventures, Johnson & Johnson's venture arm JJDC, MS Ventures and Index Ventures. Padlock is planning to develop treatments for multiple sclerosis and lupus and hopes that the money will carry it through preclinical stages for its first compound. </p><p>Meanwhile, GSK has been focusing its resources on its key areas of interest after swapping several large assets with Novartis last year. The company has been shedding smaller, unwanted assets, as well as cutting employees. </p><p><p><p>
