<p>Too often, biopharmaceutical firms put their investment and attention mostly on research and development and gaining regulatory approval and fail to provide equal support to the commercial market access side of their businesses &ndash; which can ultimately result in a successfully approved drug being a flop in the marketplace, three expert consultants said during a 16 June session at the annual Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) International Conference in Philadelphia. </p><p>Indeed, it's not all about just getting a drug on the market, they said. To be successful, firms must ensure those products are paid for by insurers and government reimbursement agencies &ndash; a fact some companies have learned too late and to their detriment. </p><p>Companies make mistakes by designing their programs for regulatory approval but not market access success, said Dr Laurie Smaldone, president and chief scientific officer at PharmApprove, a regulatory and scientific communications consultancy firm, which helps drug makers prepare for regulatory and payer negotiation meetings.</p><p>Drug manufacturers must not only engage with regulators, like the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, but also with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, such as National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco in Europe, US government payers, like Medicare and Medicaid, along with private insurers, she said.</p><p>Dr Smaldone noted, however, those interactions with government reimbursement bodies currently occur more in Europe than in the US.</p><p>But, Dr Steffen Thirstrup, director of the NDA Regulatory Advisory Board at the NDA Group, a regulatory and HTA consultancy, told <i>Scrip</i>, "it's coming" more to the US. "It has to," he said.</p><p>Firms must identify common opportunities for payers and regulators, such as patient-reported outcomes instruments, analysis and primary and secondary endpoints, Dr Smaldone said. </p><p>While regulators demand safety, efficacy and quality to approve medicines, payers have additional priorities, like wanting to know the long-term effectiveness of a drug and how it compares with other products on the market, Dr Thirstrup told attendees at the BIO 2015 session &ndash; Approval Doesn't Equal Commercial Success: Start Thinking Like a Payer.</p><p>In dealing with the market access side of the equation, Dr Thirstrup also pointed out that companies developing orphan drugs especially may run into troubles others might not face, such as the number of patients in a certain geographic location.</p><p>For instance, he said, one particular community in Italy had a high prevalence of a certain rare disease, which presented certain questions for the HTA in assessing whether to cover the high costs a particular medication for the condition &ndash; something that would not necessarily arise in other geographic locations where there were fewer patients.</p><p>Dr Thirstrup also noted that while regulators might agree that it's OK to use a surrogate biomarker on which to gain approval, that may not play well with payers.</p><p>"Just visiting FDA or EMA and having regulatory advice and agreeing on something and going back home and feeling comfortable and sleeping good at night is not advisable," he declared. </p><p>"You have to go the step further" and seek advice on the market access side as well, Dr Thirstrup insisted. </p><p><b>Reimbursement in due diligence</b></p><p>The consultants also urged drug makers to consider the potential of a drug to get reimbursed as part of their due diligence when looking at assets to acquire or for which to collaborate under partnership deals.</p><p>Session attendee Patrick Gallagher, vice president of business development at Noven Pharmaceuticals, noted that several licensing deals lately are including "payer milestones."</p><p>"You have to get to a certain level of reimbursement before milestones kick in," he said.</p><p>When considering deals, Mr Gallagher said Noven first tries to determine how well a product is differentiated from other medicines already on the market or in potential competitors' pipelines, or even how quickly a generic may be on available &ndash; the vulnerabilities that could lead to the loss of payer support.</p><p>He also cautioned that the assumptions made based on market research are not always correct, because sometimes "payers can tell you one thing but when it's time to get to real world, they often behave differently."</p><p>"That's come back to bite us a couple of times," Mr Gallagher said. </p><p><b>Harmful silos</b></p><p>But problems that have led to a successfully approved drug dying on the market can't just be blamed on lack of engagement with regulators and payers alone, said Coos de Graaf, managing director DVG Life Sciences Consulting. </p><p>Often, it's the internal silos and deep rivalries that occur between the research and development departments and the marketing access side of companies, he said, noting that those squabbles usually are over trying to protect turfs and individual budgets.</p><p>But the result, Mr de Graaf lamented, is the loss of millions, if not billions, of dollars in investment.</p><p>Protective of "their babies," he said, R&D teams in Europe often are reluctant to work with the market access teams in seeking the so-called parallel advice from the HTAs "because there's a risk they will hear that their baby is ugly, and they don't want to hear that."</p><p>With many biopharmaceutical firms, Mr de Graaf said there is no single focused leadership, a lack of shared responsibilities and different objectives between the R&D and market access teams.</p><p>So when the two teams get together, "a big fight" often erupts, he said.</p><p>Mr de Graaf insisted everybody on a project team &ndash; R&D and market access &ndash; "needs to have the same status."</p><p>"A project team is not an R&D team where the marketing and market access people are invited," he said, insisting the latter groups need to be "a member right from the start."</p><p>Mr de Graaf said the risk management and pharmacovigilance teams also must be engaged and be part of the overall project team from the get-go.</p><p>"The pharmacovigilance was always seen as the fire brigade," he said. </p><p>"If the [expletive] hits the fan, you pick up the phone and you ask pharmacovigilance to scramble," Mr de Graaf said.</p><p>But, he said, nowadays, "they should be responsible and accountable for developing risk management programs before the first adverse reactions come to your desk."</p><p><i>Our daily &ldquo;BIO 2015 Dispatches&rdquo;
