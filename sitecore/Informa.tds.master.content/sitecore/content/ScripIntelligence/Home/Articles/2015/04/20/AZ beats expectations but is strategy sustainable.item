<p>AstraZeneca has beaten consensus expectations for the first quarter of 2015 but analysts are questioning the big pharma's methods to meet targets and the sustainability of its strategies. </p><p>The company though has reiterated its guidance for the rest of the year on the back of 1Q results: total revenue is expected to decline by mid- single-digit percent and core EPS is expected to increase by low single-digit percent. </p><p><b>Key figures for 1Q 2015: </b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>1Q 2015</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>1Q 2014 </b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Total revenue</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6,057m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6,460m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Core EPS</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.08</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.17</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Operating profit </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$933m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$836m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p>1Q 2015 sales and EPS beat consensus by 4% and 1% respectively but analysts at Deutsche Bank said "the beat was driven by 'externalization revenues' ($309m reported), and 'other income' which is of questionable sustainability." They added that most growth products, including Brilinta, Symbicort and Onglyza, produced sales slightly below expectations in the quarter, while the figures were helped by slower than expected genericization of the blockbuster proton pump inhibitor Nexium. </p><p>Brilinta (ticagrelor) sales were $131m in 1Q 2015, missing analyst estimates of $137m, but up from $99m in 1Q 2014. Symbicort (budesonide and formoterol) reached sales of $845m, missing 1Q expectations of $873m. And Onglyza (saxagliptin) sales reached $183m (consensus forecast: $194m). However, higher than expected sales of Nexium (esomeprazole) offset misses by other products: Nexium sales in 1Q were $644m (cons: $589m).</p><p>For the rest of this year, Deutsche Bank analysts said: "We expect consensus EPS forecasts and the pipeline-based investment case to be unchanged but expect further question marks to be raised over the quality of earnings from the base business."</p><p>Meanwhile, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot focused on pipeline progress in his comments. "[R&D] highlights included the positive top-line results from the Phase III PINNACLE program for our respiratory medicine PT003 and data from the PEGASUS study for Brilinta/Brilique in cardiovascular disease. We received two submission acceptances for new medicines, two FDA Orphan-Drug and two Fast-Track designations. We look forward to presenting data through the year," he said in the company's 1Q statement. </p><p>AstraZeneca reiterated that it is on track to deliver seven to eight NME submissions in 2015-16. </p><p>Focus also lay on lung cancer product AZD9291, which the company said is still on track for regulatory filings in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the second quarter of this year. In 1Q 2014, AstraZeneca received breakthrough therapy status for AZD9291 from the US FDA. In the NSCLC space, AstraZeneca also highlighted that its other late-stage product, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736, has been granted fast-track designation in the US for certain patients. It noted that data from the Phase II ATLANTIC study are expected later this year, which could support a regulatory filing for MEDI4736 in third-line NSCLC.</p><p>Mr Soriot also noted AstraZeneca was heavily reinforcing its oncology pipeline at all stages: "We now have 72 trials underway, including 31 in immuno-oncology," he said. This was backed up by the news on 24 April, the same day as the company reported its 1Q 2015 figures, that AstraZeneca had struck two new collaborations with Celgene (for MED14736 in blood cancers) and Innate Pharma in the immune-oncology area. </p><p>The firm's latest deals follow a partnering spree for AstraZeneca that has so far in 2015 included:</p><ul><li>On 16 April 2015 AstraZeneca announced that MedImmune had entered into a collaboration to conduct clinical trials in immuno-oncology with Immunocore, a privately held UK-based biotechnology company. Under the terms of the agreement, Immunocore will conduct a Phase Ib/II clinical trial combining MedImmune's investigational checkpoint inhibitors MEDI4736 and tremelimumab, with IMCgp100, Immunocore's lead T-cell receptor based therapeutic, for the potential treatment of patients with late-stage metastatic melanoma.</li><li>AstraZeneca also entered an agreement with Janssen to conduct a Phase I/IIa study to explore the combination of AstraZeneca's AZD8186 (PI3 kinase beta inhibitor) together with Janssen's Zytiga (abiraterone acetate).</li><li>The company made a deal with Gilead Sciences to conduct a Phase I/II study to explore AstraZeneca's MEDI4736 in combination with Gilead's Zydelig (idelalisib), an oral phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta inhibitor.</li><li>AstraZeneca is also partnering with Juno Therapeutics to test MEDI4736 in combination with one of Juno's investigational chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell candidates in non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma. </li><li>On 19 March 2015 AstraZeneca announced a co-commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for Movantik (naloxegol) in the US. </li></ul>
