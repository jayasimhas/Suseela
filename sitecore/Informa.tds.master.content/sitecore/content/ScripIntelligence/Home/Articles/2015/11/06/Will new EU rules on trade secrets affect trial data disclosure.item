<p>Companies operating in the EU will have better protection against the theft or misuse of trade secrets such as manufacturing processes and specific technology, together with a new EU-wide definition of a trade secret, under draft rules passed yesterday by the European Parliament's legal affairs committee.</p><p>The committee said that the draft trade secrets directive would allow companies to obtain legal redress against the theft or misuse of their know-how and professional information, thereby boosting business confidence and increasing incentives to innovate, while offering safeguards on media freedom and the protection of whistleblowers. </p><p>MEPs also made clear that the new rules will not affect the disclosure of business-related information by the EU institutions or national authorities. On the face of it, this would preclude any interference with the clinical trial data disclosure provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR), whose provisions will come into effect in mid-2016, and the European Medicines Agency's proactive disclosure policy. </p><p>However, the NGO Health Action International said that despite some "minor improvements", the draft directive was "still bad news for access to information". It said it feared pharmaceutical companies would "use the Trade Secrets Directive as justification to withhold the release of clinical trial and other medicines safety and efficacy data".</p><p>The European industry federation EFPIA, by contrast, said it had stated from the outset that the question of how EU and national institutions should deal with the know-how and business information entrusted to them was not within the scope of the proposed legislation. </p><h2>Aligning national laws</h2><p>The new directive on the protection of trade secrets against unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure was first proposed by the European Commission in November 2013. The aim is to align existing national laws on the misappropriation of trade secrets because some of these laws do not provide a legal definition of a trade secret and the available remedies are inconsistent and sometimes ineffective.</p><p>At the time the commission said the directive was intended to stop the unlawful use and further disclosure of misappropriated trade secrets, remove from the market goods that have been manufactured on the basis of an illegally acquired trade secret, and offer the right to compensation for damages caused by unlawful use or disclosure. </p><p>It also stressed that the directive would not alter the current legal obligations on companies to divulge information for public policy objectives, for example in the area of health or consumer safety, and that it would not have any impact on regulations on access to documents in the possession of public authorities, including documents submitted by third parties such as companies and business organizations.</p><p>A revised proposal was adopted by the Council of the EU in May 2014, and following a hearing in January this year, a report on the draft directive was discussed and passed by the legal affairs committee on 16 June. </p><p>During that debate the committee inserted a clause specifically providing that, in order to ensure transparency, "the rules do not affect the disclosure of business-related information by the EU institutions and national public authorities". </p><p>But HAI is not convinced that this will stop companies trying to prevent the release of some clinical trial data, despite the data disclosure requirements of the CTR and the EMA policy (which applies from 1 January this year). </p><p>For example, it says the text of the draft directive does not contain general exceptions and safeguards on the release of information where this is in the public interest, which is often the case for clinical trial data. Moreover, while the CTR and the EMA policy provide for wide disclosure, they also allow commercially confidential information (CCI) to be redacted in some limited cases.</p><p>"The Clinical Trials Regulation states that, in general, clinical trial data cannot be considered commercially confidential and has to be made public," said Tessel Mellema, policy and advocacy advisor at HAI. "It provides an exception, however, and we are very concerned that companies will use the trade secrets directive to fill in that loophole, to claim trade secret protection and then claim redaction of data on that basis." </p><p>"Companies are not happy with the CTR, but they will be very happy with any opportunity that gives them increased legal means to claim protection of what they consider to be CCI, whereas the Clinical Trials Regulation and the European Ombudsman are quite clear that, in principle, clinical trial data should not be considered CCI," Ms Mellema told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><h2>EFPIA sceptical</h2><p>EFPIA was sceptical of claims that the new directive would in any way override these legislative provisions. "The trade secrets directive should and will have no impact on companies' obligations under the CTR or EMA policy," it said. The text adopted by the legal affairs committee includes further amendments to this effect, it added.</p><p>In April, in an entry on the Pharmaviews blog, the federation had said there was no conflict between the protection of trade secrets and the disclosure of information to and by EU or national regulatory authorities. </p><p>"This directive will not be a basis for obstructing disclosure and transparency obligations," it said. "Moreover, it is clear and agreed that this directive will have absolutely no bearing on existing legislation on public access to information, on pharmaceutical companies&rsquo; obligations under the new Clinical Trials Regulation, or on the European Medicines Agency&rsquo;s policy on publication of clinical data."</p><p>The question of whether there are commercially confidential elements within the data submitted or disclosed, and how public authorities deal with these elements, "is of course of critical importance", EFPIA declared. This is, however, "distinct from the trade secrets directive and subject to its own calibration within the relevant regulations. It is not for the trade secrets directive to legislate on that matter."</p><h2>TTIP effect?</h2><p>HAI is also concerned that the TSD is being fast-tracked so that its provisions can be incorporated into the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being negotiated by the EU and the US. </p><p>"Our fear and expectation is that the EU Commission wants to push this directive quickly so trade secret protection can be harmonised in the EU and then included in TTIP talks,&rdquo; Ms Mellema said. "This harmonisation is quite new, and the possible negative effects, like the ones we foresee for access to trial data, might only become visible in a couple of years. But then if it is already included in TTIP, it will be quite difficult to repair the possible negative effects of this legislation."</p><p>The legal affairs committee will now begin informal talks on the draft directive with the Council of the EU, after which it will go to the full parliament for a debate, probably in the autumn.</p>
