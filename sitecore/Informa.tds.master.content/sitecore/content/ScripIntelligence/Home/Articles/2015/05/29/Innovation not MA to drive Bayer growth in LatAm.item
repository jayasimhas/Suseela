<p>Laura Gonz�lez-Molero will be celebrating her first anniversary as President of Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Latin America this month. With Bayer posting total sales of &euro;1.05bnin Latin America in 2014, up 13% over 2013, Ms Gonz�lez-Molero should be pleased with a successful inaugural year. Resolute in her belief that innovation, "part of Bayer's DNA," will determine the company's long-term success in Latin America, rather than growth through acquisition, Ms Gonz�lez-Molero talks to <i>Scrip</i> about her personal ambitions for the company and the region. </p><p>Ms Gonz�lez-Molero may be new to her role at Bayer but she is no stranger to leading large pharmaceutical divisions. Her CV includes senior management positions such as President LatAm of the Merck Group and CEO of Merck SL. However, Bayer "has stolen my heart. I'm in love with it and I'm very happy and proud to be at Bayer."</p><p>That's reassuring because Bayer has made some important changes to its global business over the past 12-18 months. The company announced plans earlier this year to become a "pure life sciences company," driven by innovation and new product launches. </p><p>Ms Gonz�lez-Molero shares this vision wholeheartedly. As the leader of 2,400-odd employees within the Bayer Latinoamérica "family," she hopes to make a real difference in the socioeconomic development of the region, through access for patients and continued education for healthcare professionals. </p><p>"I'm totally conscious of my responsibility for generating value. I would like Bayer to be known as being a quality employer. I want the employees to be proud of what they do, and be aware that their work can help bring about gains in healthcare and in the communities that we represent."</p><p>Bayer's well-established presence in the region, spanning more than 100 years, provides a good platform for implementing its innovation-centric strategy. "We have a strong reputation in Latin America and are solidly committed to the region. It is a priority area for us."</p><h2>No. 6 in value</h2><p>In 2014, Bayer ranked sixth in Latin America's ethical pharmaceutical market by value and fourth by volume, according to figures from IMS Health, a healthcare consultancy service. </p><p>However, Bayer's overall share of the Latin American market fell to 3.9%, based on IMS Health's MAT February 2014 US dollar list price. This loss of market share was seen across the top multinational companies operating in the region. </p><p>Taking the case of Argentina, most of the top multinational companies saw at least a two-point drop in market share, according to IMS Health's December 2014 MAT pharmacy sales (in Argentine pesos). </p><p>"Most of the multinational companies have been focusing on specialty products, commercialized through non-retail channels (institutions and the social security system), so they are divesting in primary care promotion," says Juan Manuel Santamaria, Consulting and Services Director at IMS Health. </p><p>Consequently, domestic companies are filling this gap and increasing their market share by focusing "their commercial model on a strong share of voice, heavy detailing and large sales forces," he added.</p><p>Nonetheless, looking at the sales of specialty products, the figures paint a brighter picture. </p><p>Sales of Bayer's specialty medicines segment rose by 32% in 2014 versus 2013, compared with 13% growth in general medicine and a 6% rise in women's health.</p><h2>Inflationist&#8230; but still a land of opportunity</h2><p>In 2015, pharmaceutical growth in Latin America is forecast at 11%, in US dollars, according to IMS Health data. This is slightly lower than 2014, partly because countries with high inflation, such as Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela, counteracted the effects by increasing prices dramatically. </p><p>In Argentina, for example, official inflation in 2014 was reported at just over 20%, but private estimates put the figure at closer to 40%, reports <i>Bloomberg</i>, a news agency. Total pharmaceutical unit sales actually decreased by 3% in 2014, but prices were allowed to increase by 34.9%, according to IMS Health data. Bayer Argentina said it recorded a 31% increase in sales in 2014, in euros at adjusted foreign exchange, despite a 3% drop in unit sales. </p><p>2014 was an atypical year in Argentina, Mr Santamaria noted. This year, the Secretary of Commerce has implemented tough price controls, so the rate of price increases in 2015 is expected to be half of that in 2014, at around 15-19%, estimates IMS Health. </p><p>Nevertheless, forecasts of 11% growth in Latin America compare favorably vis-&agrave;-vis global growth, which is estimated at around 6%. Furthermore, growth in areas such as Europe and Japan is slated at just 3% and 1.5% respectively.</p><p>Latin America, therefore, presents a large opportunity to introduce new products to help address the unmet needs of millions of patients, Ms Gonz�lez-Molero indicated. "This is our vision &ndash; to ensure that patients who need treatment are able to access these products, to help cure them or improve their quality of life." </p><h2>In with the new</h2><p>Bayer Latinoamérica recently introduced new products in cardiology and ophthalmology, two of its core therapeutic areas. These include the group's best-selling drug, the oral anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban), and the eye care drug Eylia (aflibercept injection). </p><p><i>Bayer's top growth products in Latin America in 2014 (adjusted for foreign exchange rates)</i></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Growth %</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Eylia</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Wet aged-related macular degeneration</p><p>Also approved for diabetic macular edema (DME) and central retinal vein occlusion in some markets </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>181</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Xarelto</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in people with atrial fibrillation </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>74.9</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Kogenate</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hemophilia A</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>35.4</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Nexavar</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Advanced liver cancer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>21.8</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cardioaspirina</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Prevention of cardiovascular events</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>20.9</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p>This year, Bayer is targeting the introduction of other new molecules and indications in the region including:</p><ul><li>Xofigo for patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer </li><li>Stivarga for the treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)</li><li>Nexavar &ndash; new indication for differentiated thyroid cancer</li><li>Adempas for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension </li><li>Continued approvals of new indications of Eylia for DME and central retinal vein occlusion </li><li>Jaydess, intrauterine low-dose levonorgestrel-releasing contraceptive system</li><li>Xarelto &ndash; new indication for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome </li></ul><p>Eylia, for example, could become an important therapy for DME; 33 million people in the region are thought to suffer from diabetes and the number is expected to rise to 54 million patients by 2035.</p><h2>Significant investment in innovation</h2><p>In the past nine years, Bayer's global investment in R&D has increased by 70% from &euro;1.9bn in 2005 to &euro;3.6bn in 2014, the company told <i>Scrip</i>. This year alone, the company announced an investment of &euro;4bn in R&D, half of which is intended for the pharmaceuticals division. </p><p>"We distribute the funds according to the areas of highest unmet needs and in therapeutic areas where we have the greatest knowledge and experience," Ms Gonz�lez-Molero said. Funding is given to research centers worldwide with designated Good Clinical Practices and where there is an adequate patient population, rather than split by geography.</p><p>There are more than 400 health centers, hospitals or clinics in Latin America which participate in Bayer's clinical studies, and this year, the company is working to incorporate more centers globally, Ms Gonz�lez-Molero said.</p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>Despite Bayer's long history in Latin America, there is still a lot more to be done, Ms Gonz�lez-Molero noted. </p><p>Latin America is composed of several markets with different cultures and different health authorities. Success, therefore, depends on a real understanding of healthcare models and the local characteristics of each market. </p><p>At the mention of potential M&A and acquiring local firms, as so many other multinational companies have done in the region, there was a resounding no &ndash; certainly not at the moment. Bayer's strategy in Latin America is innovation and the strength of its portfolio. </p><p>"In five years' time, I hope that these new products will be on the market and serve as the reference for important pathologies." </p><p>If Ms Gonz�lez-Molero's love affair with Bayer, innovation and Latin America is anything to go by, it could be a mission accomplished.</p><p>
