<p>Bayer Yakuhin in Japan is aiming to grow three times faster than the overall pharma market in the country in 2015, mainly on the back of strong growth for Xarelto, Eylea and other new drugs.</p><p>TOKYO - Unveiling a calligraphy scroll with his own hand-written Japanese characters for "innovation", Bayer Yakuhin president Dr Carsten Brunn made it clear at the start of a media briefing in Tokyo what the focus of the operation he manages would continue to be. </p><p>The local pharma business of the German group made a record 11 regulatory submissions last year and gained six approvals (both including line extensions) in calendar 2014, and Dr Brunn said that &ndash; despite strong growth in Japan's generic sector &ndash; innovation is where its fortunes lie.</p><p>"Sales of [patent] protected products accounted for 71% of the total portfolio last year and the plan is to increase the proportion to 75% this year," he said, helped by the expected continued strength of Xarelto (rivaroxaban), a novel oral anticoagulant, and Eylea (aflibercept) for macular degeneration and other eye disorders, both of which performed "tremendously well" last year. </p><p>Xarelto is the market leader in Japan's ischemic stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation segment, with a value share of around 40% last year, when sales surged by 115% to JPY40.3bn ($330m) at reimbursement prices, making it Bayer Yakuhin's top product.</p><p>The Factor Xa inhibitor was been filed for the treatment and secondary prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in May. </p><p>"Although it is a competitive market [for novel anticoagulants], there is still large unmet need in Japan and we are confident the product will grow," Dr Brunn said. Among the benefits that have helped carve its position, he added, is a specific dosing regimen for Japan, assessed in clinical trials, along with clinical data in the elderly and renal-impaired patients.</p><p>Eylea, which inhibits VEGF, sold JPY27.5bn in 2014 and held a 55% unit share in the first few months of this year. The drug is already approved in four indications, including wet age-related macular degeneration and macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion, and was filed last August for macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion.</p><h2>Beating Generics</h2><p>Both Eylea and Xarelto more than offset declines for some older products in Japan, meaning that Bayer Yakuhin's overall business grew by 12% to JPY249.1bn last year, accounting for around 75% of Bayer Japan's total business. Dr Brunn said the operation was the fastest growing in the pharma top 20 in Japan, logging double-digit growth for the second consecutive year.</p><p>"I think growth versus the market in the areas we operate in is actually a better metric, but in ranking terms we are number 15 now," he noted. Other mainstay growth products included Fosrenol (lanthanum carbonate; licensed from Shire) for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease, while Adempas (riociguat) has now been approved in Japan for pulmonary arterial hypertension in addition to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. </p><p>The overall pharma market in Japan "is changing significantly," Dr Brunn said, and Bayer's high ratio of protected products is seen as its best defense against generics, which are growing strongly but for which it is hard to predict the acceleration. "We expect the [total] Japan pharma market to grow by 1-2% this year," he told the briefing.</p><p>In common with some other foreign pharma firms in Japan, such as Lilly, Bayer Yakuhin is aiming to increase the ratio of female managers, in its case from 16% to at least 25% by 2020, and already has five women on its executive team. </p><h2>Attractive R&D Environment</h2><p>Touching on the positive impact of recent pharma policies in Japan, Dr Brunn &ndash; who also heads up the local chapter of European industry association EFPIA &ndash; said that "We firmly believe that the current reimbursement pricing system in Japan is working well while controlling costs.</p><p>"Continuing the innovation premium system is very important to encouraging innovation, and makes Japan attractive for investments. We are planning to JPY60 billion in R&D investments over the 2014 to 2017 period."</p><p>The system exempts innovative drugs from Japan's regular biennial price cuts for their patent life in return for companies agreeing to develop other high-need but unapproved products.</p><p>Bayer Yakuhin currently has 52 projects in Phase II/III development in Japan, which are seen as driving sustainable growth. Highlighted molecules included molidustat for anaemia in chronic kidney disease and finerenone for chronic heart failure and diabetic kidney disease, which are both in Phase II in Japan as part of global trials.</p><p>"Japan has been involved in these international programs from the very beginning," Dr Brunn noted.</p><p>In line with EFPIA's views, the executive also pointed to the need to avoid the idea of annual price reductions (being discussed in some quarters), and said that &ndash; amid ongoing policy discussions in this area &ndash; health technology assessment is already built into current system and shouldn't be used to restrict innovation.</p><h2>Open Innovation</h2><p>In line with a general trend in Japan towards more open innovation, Bayer Yakuhin inaugurated a new open innovation center in Osaka last June, which started full operations in September and aims to strengthen basic and translational research programs with universities and other non-corporate facilities.</p><p>Center head Dr Shunichi Takahashi said the hope is to explore novel disease mechanisms in a collaborative way to develop ideas into drug candidates, noting that a two-year deal had already been signed with Kyoto University for basic research in various therapeutic areas.</p><p>Bayer also runs its global Grants4 Targets scheme in Japan to identify for drug targets and biomarkers, with the country accounting for around 10% of global submissions to the initiative.</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p><p><b>Correction</b></p><p>This article was amended on 13 April 2015. The earlier version said Xarelto "would be launched soon for several new indications including the treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism". It also described copanlisib for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as being one of the highlighted molecules in Phase II/III development, when it is actually in Phase Ib in Japan. The new version removes copanlisib and adds molidustat for anemia in chronic kidney disease in its place. </p><p>
