<p> Merck &amp; Co and Eisai have signed a deal to test various combinations of their immuno-oncology drugs in clinical trials. Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is to be tested in combination with Eisai's lenvatinib (Lenvima) and eribulin (Halaven) in multiple clinical studies. </p><p> Combination therapies are widely seen as the future of successful cancer immunotherapy. Earlier this week, Bristol-Myers Squibb signed a deal that could be worth up to $975m to Bavarian Nordic for an option on its prostate cancer vaccine Prostvac, which is currently in Phase III. BMS is keen to explore the potential of Prostvac in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) in prostate cancer and also other agents in BMS's immune-oncology portfolio (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-explores-OS-potential-of-prostate-cancer-vaccine-with-975m-deal-357074" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 March 2015</a>). </p><p> The planned studies between Merck and Eisai include a multicenter, open-label Phase Ib/II study of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in select solid tumors and an open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase Ib/II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eribulin in combination with pembrolizumab in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. </p><p> Eisai and Merck will establish a joint development committee to oversee clinical development activities. The studies are expected to begin in the second half of 2015. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. </p><p> Eisai's Lenvima is a multi-targeting receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was approved and launched in the US in for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. It is currently undergoing regulatory review in other territories and Eisai is also conducting clinical studies of Lenvima in several other types of cancer. </p><p> Eisai's Halaven is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor marketed in nearly 60 countries. It was first approved as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer in the US in November 2010. </p> <p>
