<p>The FDA has given its blessing to Emergent BioSolutions' intravenous immune globulin drug Anthrasil as a treatment in combination with appropriate antibacterials for inhalational anthrax, which is caused by breathing in the spores of the bacterium <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>. </p><p>When inhaled, the anthrax bacteria replicate in the body and produce toxins that can cause massive and irreversible tissue injury and death.</p><p>In 2001, 22 people in the US were sickened &ndash; 11 of them seriously &ndash; with five dying, after letters containing anthrax spores were mailed through the US postal system to Capitol Hill, New York and Boca Raton, Florida. </p><p>Anthrasil was developed under a $160m contract with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) sealed in 2005 &ndash; a deal that also led to the agency procuring a supply of the medicine for the Strategic National Stockpile, which is a cache of medical and other supplies intended for use in the event of large-scale national emergencies, natural or manmade. </p><p>Prior to Anthrasil's approval, the FDA would have had to issue an emergency use authorization for the drug's use.</p><p>Anthrasil was approved under the FDA's so-called animal rule, which was created in 2002 to permit a medicine's effectiveness to be demonstrated in animals when it is unethical or not feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans.</p><p>Under the rule, a drug may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled animal studies when the results establish the product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans.</p><p>The animal rule has only been used a handful of times since it was established, such as in 2003 for the approval of pyridostigmine bromide to treat exposure to the nerve gas Soman and for EMD Pharmaceuticals' cyanide-poisoning treatment Cyanokit, which contains the drug hydroxocobalamin, intravenous tubing and a sterile spike for reconstituting the drug product with saline.</p><p>In 2012, the FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's antibiotic Levaquin (levofloxacin) to treat patients with plague.</p><p>That same year, GlaxoSmithKline's anthrax antitoxin raxibacumab became the first monoclonal antibody approved under the FDA's animal efficacy rule.</p><p>The FDA has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Wheres-FDAs-past-due-animal-rule-final-guidance-356972" target="_new">criticized recently</a> by Congress for not issuing its long-past-due guidance on the animal rule.</p><p>Anthrasil is a sterile solution of purified human immune globulin G containing polyclonal antibodies that targets the anthrax toxins of <i>B anthracis</i>. The product is prepared using plasma collected from healthy, screened donors who have been immunized with Emergent's BioThrax, the only vaccine licensed by the FDA to prevent anthrax disease.</p><p>Emergent said it continues to perform under a $63m BARDA contract awarded in 2013 for the collection and storage of anti-anthrax human plasma, which is necessary for the potential future manufacture of bulk drug substance and final product.</p><p>Investors only gave Emergent a 64-cent boost on 25 March, with the shares actually taking a 6% dive after that, to close at $27.61, down $1.69, or 5.8%.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Emergent snagged a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BARDA-awards-Emergent-31m-to-pursue-improved-anthrax-vax-357470" target="_new">$31m contract</a> from BARDA aimed at advancing the development of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation anthrax vaccine, NuThrax (AV7909), a modified formulation of BioThrax.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
