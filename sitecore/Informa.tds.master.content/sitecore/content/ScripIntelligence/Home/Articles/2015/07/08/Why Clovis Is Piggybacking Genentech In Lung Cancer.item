<p><p>In an effort to boost the potential of its likely blockbuster, Clovis Oncology is pairing its lung cancer drug with a closely-watched offering from Roche's Genentech.</p><p>The biotech announced Aug. 11 that it will test its next-gen epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor rociletinib (CO-1686) with Genentech's atezolizumab, the big pharma's PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor.</p><p>The drugs will be combined in a Phase Ib/II trial in patients with activating EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm) advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The trial, sponsored by Clovis, will begin enrolling patients before the end of the year and will test the safety and tolerability of the combination, as well as its level of activity. </p><p>Patients in the trial will be divided by two subgroups &ndash; those that have not received EGFR TKIs or chemotherapy previously and those that have been treated with the therapies. Both T790M positive and negative patients will be enrolled in the trial, but only those that have been treated with prior treatments. Patients will not be required to express PD-L1, but expression of the checkpoint will be assessed during the study. </p><p>Genentech's PD-L1 inhibitor is far behind the already marketed offerings from Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb, but Roche claims the drug has best-in-class potential. The PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have created quite the stir amongst investors and the industry, making immuno-oncology the hottest area in drug development at the moment. All three companies have been testing their respective offerings in combination with other therapies in hopes of finding the holy grail of oncology treatments. </p><p><b>Why It Matters</b></p><p>Clovis is betting a lot on the success of rociletinib and investors are keeping a close eye on the development of the drug. The biotech scored in May 2014 when FDA dubbed the treatment a Breakthrough Therapy and Clovis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Clovis-rolls-with-rociletinib-NDA-in-lung-cancer-359237" target="_new">completed a submission</a> of rociletinib for approval in the US and EU on Aug. 3 for the treatment of patients who were previously treated with EGFR drugs and who are positive for the T790M mutation. </p><p>While analysts agree that the drug has a strong shot at approval and will likely become a blockbuster, there are a few sticking points. Rociletinib hasn't always lived up to investor expectations and had some mixed results in mid-stage trials. The drug showed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASCO-2015-Clovis-competes-with-AZ-on-two-fronts-358676" target="_new">strong efficacy</a> results in previously treated patients who were positive for the T790M mutation, but its overall response rate was cut in half in those patients that were T790M negative. Patients on the drug also showed signs of dose-dependent hyperglycemia &ndash; an issue that the company contends is easily manageable, but one that could give some doctors pause. </p><p>Yet, an approval in only T790M positive patients isn't necessarily a bad thing &ndash; the market is worth about $2bn &ndash; and could be as high as $6bn if Clovis could gain approval in both positive and negative patients. </p><p>The only other obstacle will be competing with AstraZeneca's AZD9291. While the big pharma hasn't announced a completed submission to the FDA yet, it is expected soon and both drugs have shown similar results in clinical trials. </p><p>The good news: analysts say there is enough room in this market for both drugs to perform well. </p><p><p>
