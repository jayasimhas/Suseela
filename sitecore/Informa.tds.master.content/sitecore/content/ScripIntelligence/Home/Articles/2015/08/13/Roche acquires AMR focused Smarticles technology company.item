<p>Roche Holding AG has acquired GeneWEAVE BioSciences for up to $425m in order to get its hands on the latter''s "Smarticles" technology, which is being developed to help tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance. </p><p>Privately held GeneWEAVE, based in Los Gatos, California, is the developer of an innovative class of molecular diagnostics, which it calls Smarticles technology, that quickly identify multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and assesses antibiotic susceptibility directly from clinical samples, without the need for traditional enrichment, culture or sample preparation processes. Its first system, vivoDx, is a fully automated, random-access system designed to meet the needs of laboratories addressing MDRO detection and antibiotic therapy guidance.</p><p>Roche will pay GeneWEAVE shareholders $190m upfront and up to $235m in contingent product related milestones. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions but once completed GeneWEAVE will be integrated into Roche Molecular Diagnostics.</p><p>"This technology has the potential to provide healthcare professionals access to quick and accurate diagnoses that can lead to rapid, informed treatment decisions,&rdquo; said Roland Diggelmann, chief operating officer of Roche Diagnostics.</p><p>Steve Tablak, CEO of GeneWEAVE commented that, "Roche is the ideal company to deliver on the promise of our Smarticles technology." </p><p>The problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has come to the foreover the past couple of years with many pharmaceutical companies being called upon to invest in antibiotic research amid concerns of drug resistance becoming a global crisis. </p><p>And Roche, which has been a key player in the field of antibiotic drug development for many years, reignited its push for new antibiotic products in 2014. Early last year Roche signed two deals with small antibiotic drug discovery companies in the space of four months &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-in-548m-macrocycle-antibiotic-deal-347801" target="_new">Polyphor</a>, for its investigational antibiotic POL7080, which targets <i>Pseudomonas</i> species with a novel mode of action; and UK-based biotech <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-signs-another-antibiotic-deal-350310" target="_new">Discuva</a>. At that time, Janet Hammond, head of infectious diseases discovery and translational area at Roche, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-aims-to-lead-big-pharma-in-21st-century-antibiotic-discovery-challenge-350420" target="_new">told Scrip</a> antibiotic R&D was an area "ripe for the use of the many new technologies that have emerged in the past 10-20 years".</p><p>She noted that Roche Molecular Diagnostics was an advantage other big pharma rivals don't have. "Roche also has a diagnostics arm and we believe that this will allow us to bring more targeted and specific therapies to infections and make more accurate diagnoses at earlier time points," Hammond said. </p><p>As well as pharmas making waves in the antibiotic space, initiatives such as the Longitude Prize, which was resurrected last summer by innovation charity Nesta, have also highlighted the problem of AMR. In fact, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antimicrobial-resistance-prize-industry-reaction-352844" target="_new">in 2014</a> the Longitude Prize chose the development of a "cost-effective, accurate, rapid and easy-to-use test for bacterial infections that will allow health professionals worldwide to administer the right antibiotics at the right time," as its focus. The Longitude AMR challenge, the prize of which is &pound;10m in funding, will run until 2019, or until a winning idea is chosen.</p>
