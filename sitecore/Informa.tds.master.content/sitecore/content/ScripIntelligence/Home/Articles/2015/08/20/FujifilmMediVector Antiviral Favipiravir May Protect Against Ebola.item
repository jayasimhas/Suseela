<p>The antivirval favipiravir (T-705), which is being developed by Fujifilm and its US subsidiary MediVector, may provide post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) protection against Ebola, researchers reported in the British medical journal <i>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</i>.</p><p>A small study in which four British health care workers who experienced needle sticks while providing care to Ebola patients in Sierra Leone were given favipiravir, either alone or with an monoclonal antibody cocktail similar to Mapp Biopharmaceuticals' ZMapp, as PEP therapy.</p><p>After 42 days, none of the four developed Ebola, although it's unclear whether they were actually ever infected.</p><p>The treatment regimen was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported, the researchers said. </p><p>The study compared the results of the four health care workers with those of four others, who also were from the UK and had been serving in Sierra Leone.</p><p>The latter four, however, were potentially exposed in circumstances other than needle sticks, so were therefore considered to be at a lower risk. That group was not given drug treatment but was instead closely monitored over the 42-day period. </p><p>They also did not develop Ebola, which has infected more than 28,000 people in West Africa during the current, but waning outbreak, killing nearly 11,300.</p><p>Favipiravir inhibits the enzyme viral RNA polymerase, whose function is to make copies of the viral RNA segments and to synthesize mRNAs which produce the proteins that will form new viruses.</p><p>The drug has been provided to other patients exposed to Ebola and has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/West-Africa-Ebola-trials-to-test-brincidofovir-favipiravir-355056" target="_new">studied</a> in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/FujifilmMediVector-antivirual-favipiravir-advances-in-Ebola-354977" target="_new">other trials</a>, including a West African study being run by the international humanitarian medical group MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/Doctors Without Borders.</p><p>Favipiravir is approved in Japan as an anti-flu medicine under the brand name Avigan.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
