<p>Patient advocates lavished quick praise on lawmakers for including a measure in the latest version of the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, unveiled on 13 May, which would extend by six months the exclusivity protection for marketed drugs that seek and gain new indications aimed at preventing, diagnosing or treating rare diseases or conditions.</p><p>The measure, dubbed the <i>Orphan Product Extensions Now (OPEN) Act</i>, which vanished in the second edition of Cures, has been revived in the third revision, which the House Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee is scheduled to start marking up on 14 May &ndash; meaning there are likely more changes to the language to come through amendments.</p><p>The <i>OPEN Act</i> and other exclusivity provisions were at the heart of the contention over the first version of Cures, which was released in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">January</a> by Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House E&C Committee, and the reason his colleague, Congresswoman Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), said she could not endorse the legislative package. </p><p>But a spokesman for Ms DeGette told <i>Scrip</i> the Colorado Democrat fully supports the latest revised draft.</p><p>&ldquo;We continue to make substantial progress towards a complete bipartisan <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>,&rdquo; Representative DeGette said in a statement to <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was thrilled over inclusion in Cures of the <i>OPEN Act</i> provision.</p><p>"The entire rare disease community has rallied around this piece of legislation that could lead to an increase the number of rare disease therapies and has the potential to address many off-label reimbursement problems faced by rare disease patients," said NORD CEO Peter Saltonstall.</p><p><b>Let down</b></p><p>But other patient advocates were let down when the Cures authors failed to resurrect a provision included in the original January draft, but stripped from the bill in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-10bn-NIH-boost-nice-wish-no-granting-power-358130" target="_new">29 April revision</a>, which would have provided 15 years of data protection for so-called "dormant therapies" &ndash; abandoned drugs that have the potential to be developed for unmet medical needs, but have been left on the shelf because of insufficient patent protection. </p><p>The now-rejected measure was based on legislation introduced in the Senate by Senators Orrin Hatch (Republican-Utah) and Michael Bennet (Democrat-Colorado) and in the House by Representative Leonard Lance (Republican-New Jersey).</p><p>"We believe the committee has missed a huge opportunity to include a game-changing dormant therapies provision that could have revolutionized the development of treatments desperately needed by people with long-term, life-threatening conditions," said Marc Boutin, CEO of the National Health Council (NHC), whose membership consists of 100 national patient advocacy groups and other healthcare-related organizations and businesses.</p><p>NHC said it was "extremely disappointed" the Cures authors could not reach a workable compromise on the dormant therapies provision, which the group said could help speed treatments for diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and lupus.</p><p><b>Voucher reauthorization</b></p><p>While lawmakers snubbed the dormant therapies measure, they added into the latest rendition of Cures a provision that would reauthorize the FDA's rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers (PRV), an incentive program created by Congress under the <i>Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act</i>.</p><p>The FDA grants the PRVs to firms that develop a rare disease medicine for pediatric patients and meet the criteria. Companies can use the vouchers for a priority review on a subsequent application that would not have otherwise qualified for priority review.</p><p>The vouchers are transferable, with the law permitting the holder to sell it to fund its development programs, allowing the buyer to then have a priority review for a product that may otherwise have been examined under a standard review.</p><p>The PRVs have turned out to be quite lucrative for those that have won them.</p><p>Indeed, BioMarin Pharmaceuticals actually <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Golden-ticket-Regeneron-Sanofi-buy-priority-review-voucher-for-alirocumab-353119" target="_new">sold</a> its rare pediatric disease voucher &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-OKs-Vimizim-BioMarin-wins-1st-rare-peds-disease-voucher-350063" target="_new">first ever granted</a> &ndash; this past July for $67.5m to Regeneron and Sanofi.</p><p>Asklepion Pharmaceuticals' PRV, which the FDA granted when it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Asklepion-secures-US-OK-for-Cholbam-wins-peds-voucher-357344" target="_new">approved Cholbam</a> (cholic acid) as treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and for patients with peroxisomal disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, was a likely lure for Retrophin to exercise its rights to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Voucher-FDA-approval-lure-Retrophin-to-buy-Cholbam-357371" target="_new">buy the drug</a>.</p><p>United Therapeutics also gained one of the vouchers on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Unituxin-United-Therapeutics-wins-pediatric-voucher-357213" target="_new">10 March</a> when the FDA approved the firm's drug Unituxin (dinutuximab).</p><p>But if Congress fails to reauthorize the rare pediatric disease PRV program, it will sunset in March 2017, NORD&rsquo;s Mr Saltonstall pointed out, adding that his group has been actively advocating for lawmakers to pass a measure renewing the program. </p><p>Section 2151 of the Cures bill, as it currently stands, would so just that.</p><p>The legislative package, however, must first endure the markup, consideration by the E&C Committee and then be adopted by the full House.</p><p>After that, Cures must be reconciled with whatever legislative package that comes out of the Senate, whose health leaders have insisted they plan to have their own bill &ndash; where the dormant therapies measure and other provisions rejected by the House may find new life. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
