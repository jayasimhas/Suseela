<p>Well over a year after the $10.4bn acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Amgen still is consolidating operations and cutting Onyx jobs, according to a recent memo from chairman and CEO Robert Bradway to Amgen and Onyx employees, which warned of 300 upcoming job cuts.</p><p>"To build on our competitive presence in the rapidly evolving oncology field, and as part of our ongoing transformation across the company, we have decided to combine Amgen's scale and immuno-oncology expertise with Onyx's highly successful approach to hematologic malignancies," Mr Bradway wrote in the memo dated 9 March.</p><p>The layoffs are on top of a 2,400- to 2,900-person workforce reduction that Amgen revealed in July so that the company could reinvest capital in soon-to-be approved products (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2Q-EARNINGS-Amgen-cutting-up-to-2900-jobs-to-reinvest-in-pipeline-353095" target="_new">30 July 2014</a>). Pending regulatory actions include the first EU approval for Kyprolis (carfilizomib), which Amgen purchased in its $10.4bn acquisition of Onyx that closed in October 2013, plus expansion of the multiple myeloma drug's US label and conversion of its US FDA accelerated approval to full approval (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-buying-Onyx-for-10.4-billion-to-be-bigger-player-in-cancer-therapies-346032" target="_new">26 August 2013</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASH-2014-AmgenOnyxs-Kyprolis-improves-survival-quality-of-life-355471" target="_new">6 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Bradway based Amgen's oncology strength on recent clinical trial successes for Kyprolis, including recent head-to-head data versus Takeda's Velcade (bortezomib), as well as new indications for Vectibix (panitumumab), FDA approval for Blincyto (blinatumomab) and potential US and EU approvals for the melanoma immunotherapy T-VEC (talimogene laherparepvec), among other product milestones (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgens-Kyprolis-bests-Velcade-in-new-Phase-III-myeloma-trial-357016" target="_new">2 March 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amgen-wins-broader-Vectibix-use-with-Qiagen-Dx-in-mCRC-351987" target="_new">24 May</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-early-US-win-for-BiTE-antibody-Blincyto-355400" target="_new">3 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Amgen-submits-first-in-class-melanoma-immunotherapy-in-Europe-353673" target="_new">2 September 2014</a>).</p><p>"At the same time, the payer, provider and clinical practice environment for oncology is changing dramatically," Amgen's CEO wrote.</p><p>With the Amgen and Onyx cancer teams working as one group, commercial and development functions for oncology with be consolidated in Amgen's headquarters city of Thousand Oaks, California, but some Onyx research and development will move to Amgen's South San Francisco R&D facility, which will grow as needed. Onyx sales and medical staff will become part of Amgen's commercial organization.</p><p>"We anticipate reducing our Onyx workforce by approximately 300 [R&D and commercial] home office and remote worker positions. To ensure our ability to continue delivering for patients, all Onyx home office staff and remote workers will be retained through December 31, 2015 and will be informed of their longer-term employment status by late April," Mr Bradway wrote.</p><p>However, he noted that the consolidation of Amgen and Onyx oncology operations will begin immediately.</p><p><p><p><p>
