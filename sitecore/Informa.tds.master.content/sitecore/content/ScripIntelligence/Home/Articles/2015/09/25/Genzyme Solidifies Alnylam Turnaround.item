<p><p>Alnylam's turnaround plans are finally bearing fruit now that Sanofi's Genzyme has opted into the first drug since the pair expanded their deal in early 2014, furthering validating the biotech's RNAi technology. </p><p>The pair announced Oct. 1 that Genzyme will option the development and commercialization rights to Alnylam's ALN-AT3 hemophilia program for the rest of the world; the biotech has maintained rights within North American and Western Europe. </p><p>For now, Genzyme is on the hook for 20% of development costs of the program, which recently completed Phase I and showed promising results. The cost to Genzyme could be upped to 50% based on whether Genzyme ends up co-promoting in North America and Western Europe. </p><p>This is the third drug from Alnylam that Genzyme has opted to bring into its pipeline &ndash; the other two, patisiran and revusiran &ndash; were part of an initial deal inked in 2012. </p><p>Genzyme's interest in Alnylam has really been the big turnaround story for the company, which hit hard times earlier in the decade when Roche and Novartis broke off partnerships with the company. Losing its big pharma partnerships meant laying off employees, cutting costs, and shifting directions to focus more on individual products and less on its platform technology. </p><p>During a major announcement at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, a closely watched industry event, in January 2014, Genzyme expanded its collaboration with Alnylam and gave the company a strong future. </p><p>That partnership expansion included opting into the first two RNAi-based drugs &ndash; both for rare diseases &ndash; and taking a 12% equity stake in the biotech. At the time, Sanofi paid $700m, or $80 per share. The biotech's stock is currently trading around that price, but has traded as high as $140 per share over the last year. </p><p>The deal offers Alnylam a unique opportunity &ndash; it's structured so that the smaller company retains the rights in what are typically the two largest and most lucrative markets, while gaining cash and expertise from Genzyme. </p><p>Former Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher said at the time of the deal that he was willing to leave much of the value in the hands of the biotech because he wanted to retain the human talent that had created these products and felt the drugs would make the most progress in their hands. </p><p>Genzyme is an ideal partner for Alnylam &ndash; it typically has 30% of sales outside of North American and Western Europe, as well as expertise in emerging market patient recruitment, government relations and market access. </p><p><p>
