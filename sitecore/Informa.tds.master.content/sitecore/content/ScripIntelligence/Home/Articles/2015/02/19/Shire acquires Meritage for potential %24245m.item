<p>Shire is continuing its 2015 M&A shopping spree by acquiring Meritage Pharma for $70m upfront in order to boost its late-stage rare disease pipeline. </p><p>Shire was one of a handful of names suspected to be interested in buying gastrointestinal drug developer Salix Pharmaceuticals &ndash; which was finally snapped up by Valeant earlier this week (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-confirms-10.1bn-acquisition-deal-for-Salix-356886" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 February 2015</a>). And back in mid-January the Irish specialty pharma paid $5.2bn for rare disease company NPS Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Now Shire has picked up Meritage for $70m upfront and additional contingent payments of up to $175m based on the achievement of development and regulatory milestones for the firm's lead product, oral budesonide suspension (OBS) for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). Shire obtained the rights to acquire Meritage in connection with its acquisition of ViroPharma in 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shire-extends-ViroPharma-offer-while-OFT-deliberates-349236" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 January 2014</a>). </p><p>Meritage's "Phase III-ready" product was the first medication to significantly reduce eosinophilic inflammation and related symptom endpoints in patients with EoE in a Phase II clinical trial, the firm noted. It hopes the product will become the first approved treatment in the US indicated for EoE &ndash; a rare, chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disease which can cause patients to have persistent or relapsing symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction, including dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction.</p><p>OBS is a viscous oral formulation of budesonide that is designed to coat the esophagus where the drug can act locally. Budesonide is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in several products approved by the FDA, including products for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn&rsquo;s disease. But it has been granted orphan drug status by the US FDA for the treatment of EoE. </p><p>According to Sagient Research's BioMedTrack, and affiliate of Scrip, five other products are in development for esophagitis from Novartis (QAX-576); Regeneron (Dupilumab); Atopix Therapeutics (OC459); Receptos (RPC4046); and Actavis (EUR-1100). </p><p>In a Phase II double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 16-week study in 119 patients aged 11 to 40 with confirmed EoE, OBS achieved the co-primary endpoints of reduction in inflammation (p< 0.0001)="" and="" symptom="" of="" dysphagia="" (p="0.0096)" with="" statistical="" significance.="" in="" addition,="" statistical="" significance="" was="" demonstrated="" for="" other="" secondary="" endpoints="" including="" histopathologic="" score,="" endoscopic="" score="" and="" physician="" global="" impression="" of="" disease=""></p><p>BioMedTracker has given the product a likelihood of approval rating of 20%, the same as average for a product at the same stage of development in this indication. </p><p>Meritage, founded in 2008, is led by CEO Dr Elaine Phillips and chaired by biotech entrepreneur Cam Garner. Its past investors include: Domain Associates, Latterell Venture Partners and the Vertical Group. </p>
