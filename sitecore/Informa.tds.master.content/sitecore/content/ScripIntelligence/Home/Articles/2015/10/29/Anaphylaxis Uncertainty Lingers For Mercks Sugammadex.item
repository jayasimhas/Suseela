<p>Merck & Co.'s modified gamma-cyclodextrin agent sugammadex, which is under review at the FDA for the fourth time, is headed back to the agency's advisory committee on Nov. 6 for another go-around on whether the experts think the product is finally ready for the market.</p><p>But in briefing documents released on Nov. 4 ahead of the meeting, reviewers in the FDA's Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products said anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity events remain a concern with sugammadex, an injectable drug intended to reverse neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium &ndash; drugs that are employed during surgical procedures.</p><p>Although sugammadex currently is marketed in about 60 foreign countries under the brand name Bridion, Merck has struggled in the US to bring the drug to the market &ndash; getting snubbed three times.</p><p>Sugammadex was developed by Dutch drug maker Organon, which was acquired in 2007 by New Jersey pharma Schering-Plough &ndash; a company Merck bought in 2009.</p><p>Organon submitted the original new drug application (NDA) for sugammadex in October 2007. </p><p>The FDA's advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of sugammadex at a March 11, 2008 meeting.</p><p>But regulators pointed out that a detailed review of the drug's hypersensitivity data was not available for discussion at the time of that meeting.</p><p>"The preliminary nature of the available data analysis limited our ability to engage the panel members in a more detailed discussion of the spectrum of anaphylaxis and the resultant clinical implications of this safety signal," the FDA said.</p><p>After two "consultative" reviews, the FDA rejected the sugammadex NDA in July 2008, declaring the company needed to characterize the safety of the drug on repeat exposure, specifically the nature and frequency of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions, and to define the frequency and time course of events related to the agent's administration and other characteristics of the adverse reactions. </p><p>Regulators said the firm also needed to attempt to define the immunological basis or other pathophysiology of these adverse events by appropriate tests, including but not limited to the skin test and laboratory tests to evaluate for the production of Immunoglobulin E against sugammadex.</p><p>Merck submitted a response to the FDA in December 2012 and provided the results of a repeat-dose clinical study, which the agency had requested.</p><p>But due to concerns that investigators may have been unblinded to treatment assignment, the data were deemed to be of limited utility in defining the frequency of anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity events associated with sugammadex administration, regulators said. </p><p>So the FDA again <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/REJECTED-FDA-snub-of-sugammadex-another-setback-for-Merck-346783" target="_new">rejected</a> the NDA, issuing a complete response letter (CRL) in September 2013, outlining the same deficiencies as in the first CRL.</p><p>Merck conducted a new study, known as P101, submitting those data in October 2014. </p><p>The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluated the incidence of hypersensitivity after repeated single-dose administration of sugammadex in healthy participants. </p><p>But the FDA for a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-expects-3rd-sugammadex-rejection-FDA-cancels-adcomm-357296" target="_new">third time</a> issued a CRL this past April &ndash; something the company had told investors a month earlier to expect, which was evident by the fact regulators had canceled a scheduled March 18 meeting of the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee (AADPAC).</p><p>The FDA noted that anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions were observed in the original sugammadex development program.</p><p>But in P101 &ndash; the new study &ndash; the frequency of anaphylaxis was 0.33%, or 1 in 299, regulators said.</p><p>They noted the case of anaphylaxis occurred on the first dose in the sugammadex 16mg/kg group.</p><p>Among the hypersensitivity cases that did not meet diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis, the most common symptoms were nausea, pruritus and urticaria. </p><p>Several hypersensitivity symptoms, including erythema, eye disorders, nausea, sneezing,</p><p>urticaria and vomiting showed a dose-response, more frequently in the high-dose group, versus the low-dose group and placebo. </p><p>Hypersensitivity reactions were more frequently noted in the 16mg/kg dose group, occurring about 35 minutes or less of dosing and with the first dose of sugammadex, the FDA said.</p><p>The FDA said review of postmarketing reports, in the context of the data from controlled trials, revealed the presence of a consistent constellation of symptoms, including rash, erythema, urticaria, hypotension and response to standard treatment for anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions.</p><p>But, regulators said, "Mechanistic data submitted do not elucidate a clear causal mechanism leading to anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity." </p><p>The reviewers concluded sugammadex causes anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity events &ndash; a risk they said appears to increase with higher doses and does not appear to increase with repeated exposure. "Whether this risk is greater than the risk for other drug products commonly used in the perioperative setting is difficult to determine," regulators said.</p><p>With changes in medical and surgical practices over time, obtaining an accurate estimate of the frequency of perioperative anaphylaxis in the context of current standards of care "is challenging," the FDA said. </p><p>Therefore, regulators said, there is no predetermined level of acceptable or unacceptable risk for anaphylaxis for new drugs. </p><p>Ultimately, they said, the risk-benefit assessment for sugammadex will depend primarily on the efficacy and safety data specific to the drug and its expected use in a real-world setting.</p><p>At the Nov. 6 meeting of the AADPAC, the FDA is expected to ask its panel of outside advisers to vote on whether Merck presented sufficient information to characterize the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis with sugammadex. </p><p>The agency also wants to know if there has been sufficient information to characterize the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias &ndash; a concern that emerged during the first cycle review of the sugammadex NDA.</p><p>The FDA also wants the AADPAC to mull over whether there are any issues that were not addressed in the supportive data that warrant the need for additional studies and, if so, if they should be conducted before or after approval.</p><p>Then the agency will ask the panel to vote on whether the efficacy, safety and overall risk-benefit profile of sugammadex supports the approval of Merck's NDA.</p><p><i>[</i><b><i>Update</i></b><i>: On Nov. 6, the AADPAC unanimously voted to back approval of sugammadex. It declared in a 13-1 vote that Merck had provided sufficient data to characterize the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. The committee also unanimously voted the firm's data were sufficient to characterize the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. The FDA is expected to make a decision by Dec. 19]. </i></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
