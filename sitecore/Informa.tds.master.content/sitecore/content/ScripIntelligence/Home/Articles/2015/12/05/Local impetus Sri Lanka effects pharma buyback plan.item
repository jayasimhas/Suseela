<p>Sri Lanka has implemented plans to encourage local production, with the government undertaking to "buy back" supplies for a number of specified pharmaceutical products.</p><p>The provisions cover more than a dozen products including paracetamol and metformin with local manufacturers getting "priority", according to top officials from the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation of Sri Lanka, which procures and supplies drugs to Sri Lanka's health ministry and to the private sector market through an open competitive tender procedure.</p><p>"For 18 identified products for government supplies, the government is giving a buyback guarantee to local manufacturers. We are not going for the tender process or the global market. We are purchasing whatever the government requirement is from local manufacturers and the Sri Lankan government is willing to expand this," Dinusha Dassanayake, general manager, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) of Sri Lanka, told <i>Scrip</i> in an interaction in Mumbai.</p><p>Mr Dassanayake and SPC's managing director, Dr MHM Rumie, were in Mumbai to participate in iPhex 2015, a pharma and healthcare exhibition organized by Pharmexcil, the Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India. The event is supported by India's ministry of commerce and industry.</p><p>For the 18 products excluded from the tender procedure, an "agreed price" is arrived at based on negotiations, the SPC officials indicated, adding that the buyback plan was set into motion sometime last year. </p><p>Mr Dassanayake explained that until recently surgical and examination gloves were being imported, despite Sri Lanka being "rich in rubber", . "But now the requirement is supplied by local manufacturers". </p><p>The Sri Lankan government hopes that such initiatives will goad local manufacturers to expand capacities to cater to demand, while foreign firms will consider collaborations with local players &ndash; all-in-all leading to the development of the Sri Lankan pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Market participants such as Bangladesh's Beximco Pharma said that the buyback guarantee would encourage many foreign drug companies to explore the joint venture (JV) route. </p><p>"Beximco has already been approached by a couple of companies from Sri Lanka for JV and we are actively working on those. We are also carefully reviewing the recent regulatory changes and its impact on medicine prices in Sri Lanka," Dr Shawkat Haider, general manager (business development), Bangladesh's Beximco Pharma, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Such partnerships, he added, would depend on whether Beximco sees "positive developments or a favourable environment in terms of making investment in setting up plants in Sri Lanka." Sri Lanka accounts for around 10% of Beximco's export sales.</p><p>While the 18-product list does not currently include products such as complex injectables, Dr Rumie indicated that some Indian firms had previously evinced an interest to manufacture certain cancer drugs in Sri Lanka. </p><p>"The government encourages such activity, gives tax reliefs, land, other facilities," he added. </p><h2>New Bill</h2><p>The initiatives to boost domestic promotion comes alongside the passage of Sri Lanka's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sri-Lanka-medicines-bill-to-trigger-price-import-cutbacks-357570" target="_new">new National Medicines Regulatory Authority Bill</a> that sets out a clutch of rules pertaining to the prescription, pricing and registration of medicines in the island nation. </p><p>The SPC officials indicated that the new bill will require to be gazetted and in the interim the government is initiating awareness programs.</p><p>The bill will probably be implemented only after six months to a year and the government was in the process of making regulations, getting stakeholder opinions etc, they said.</p><p>The bill also stipulates the setting up of a pricing committee, which the new regulatory authority would consult to determine the "introductory price" of medicines, medical devices and borderline products at the time of registration, based on certain criteria.</p><p>The regulator is expected to consider, among others, factors such as the prevailing market prices of similar products within the same therapeutic class and international reference prices. In the case of NCEs, prices in the "region" and the benefits and the cost effectiveness are to be weighed.</p><p>Asked whether the reference prices would probably essentially mean prices in Asia, including markets like India, Mr Dassanayake said that while things had not been finalised, it probably "can't go beyond prices in the region" as the Sri Lankan government is trying to lower prices.</p>
