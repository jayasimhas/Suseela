<p>The FDA has accepted for review Pfizer's supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for its Janus kinase inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib citrate) as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. </p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision sometime in October, Pfizer said, not giving away the actual <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date.</p><p>Xeljanz initially was approved for the US market in November 2012 as a treatment for moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to methotrexate (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizers-Xeljanz-elected-in-US-as-1st-JAK-in-RA-336912" target="_new">7 November 2012</a>). </p><p>The small molecule medicine targets the JAK pathway, a signaling pathway inside the cells, thought to play a role in chronic inflammatory responses.</p><p>The sNDA in the plaque psoriasis indication was based on data from the firm's comprehensive Phase III "OPT" clinical development program, which consisted of five trials, including an ongoing long-term extension study, designed to evaluate oral Xeljanz 5mg and 10mg twice daily.</p><p>With more than 3,600 adults with psoriasis enrolled across 36 countries, the OPT program has yielded one of the largest databases for a potential psoriasis indication at the time of registration, Pfizer said.</p><p>Xeljanz is approved in 37 countries around the world for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p>Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, affecting the skin and other parts of the body, such as nails. It affects about 7.4 million people in the US.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
