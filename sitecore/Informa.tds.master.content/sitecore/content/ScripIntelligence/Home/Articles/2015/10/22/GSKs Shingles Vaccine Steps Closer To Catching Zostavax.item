<p>GlaxoSmithKline is preparing for major filings next year for its challenger to Sanofi Pasteur MSD's Zostavax shingles vaccine, now named Shingrix (HZ/su vaccine), after promising top-line data in a second Phase III trial confirmed its benefits in an older patient population.</p><p>The ZOE-70 study in 14,800 adults aged 70 years and over met its primary objective, demonstrating 90% (95% confidence interval: 84&ndash;94) efficacy against shingles compared with placebo. </p><p>This efficacy rate is in line with that reported earlier this year from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/GSK-pushes-more-data-for-shingles-vaccine-but-no-filing-yet-358116" target="_new">ZOE-50 study</a> in 16,000 adults aged 50 years and over, where it reduced the risk of shingles by 97.2% compared with placebo.</p><p>GSK plans to file Shingrix for the prevention of shingles in people over 50 years in the US, EU and Japan in the second half of 2016. </p><p>The strength of Shingrix's data in older people is likely to prove key to the product muscling its way into a market that Zostavax currently enjoys to itself, and the data appear good enough to allay any concerns of its relative lack of convenience (it is given intramuscularly in a two-dose schedule two months apart to Zostavax's one subcutaneous dose). The shingles vaccine market may not be huge, but it is still growing. Latest Zostavax sales figures just released by Merck show that its sales were a little over $500m for the first three quarters, up 5% on this time in 2014. GSK's entry will also buttress its own position in vaccines, an area where it recently overtook Merck following last year's asset-swapping mega-deal with Novartis.</p><p>While, the efficacy rates for the two vaccines cannot be directly compared without a head-to-head study, in the US label for Zostavax details of its two pivotal trials (ZEST and SPS) show lower efficacy rates than GSK's newcomer. In ZEST in the 50-59 age group, vaccine efficacy was 69.8%, while in the SPS study, the efficacy rates were 64% for adults aged 60-69 years and 41% for those aged between 70 and 79 years.</p><h2>Post-Herpetic Neuralgia</h2><p>Early signs are that Shingrix also reduces rates of post-herpetic neuralgia, the most common severe complication of shingles. GSK added that a pre-specified pooled analysis of the ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 data demonstrated that Shingrix effectively prevents postherpetic neuralgia: it showed 89% (95% confidence interval: 69&ndash; 97) efficacy in preventing PHN in people aged 70 years and over, and 91% (95% confidence interval: 76&ndash; 98) in people aged 50 years and over. </p><p>GSK noted that a co-primary objective of ZOE-70 was the assessment of overall vaccine efficacy in reducing the risk of developing shingles and PHN in people aged 70 years and over using the pooled shingles and PHN cases from both ZOE-70 and ZOE-50 studies.</p><p>"Together, these remarkable results underscore the potential of the candidate vaccine to prevent both shingles and PHN in older adults," said Dr Alain Brecx, Vaccine Development Leader at GSK.</p><p>The full safety data from ZOE-70 are still being analyzed, but no concerns were raised by the study's independent data monitoring committee in its ongoing review of the safety data up to April 2015, GSK said.</p><p>GSK's vaccine combines gE, a protein found on the virus that causes shingles, with its adjuvant system, AS01, which is intended to enhance the immunological response. Zostavax, on the other hand, is a live attenuated vaccine, with all the attendant storage problems of a live vaccine. Sanofi-Pasteur MSD has in the past suffered multiple manufacturing, scale up and formulation setbacks since Zostavax was approved in 2006, causing supply issues and ultimately costing SPMSD sales (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Formulation-and-manufacturing-delayed-SanofiMercks-European-shingles-vaccine-until-now-339289" target="_new">23 January 2013</a> & <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/US-expanded-indication-for-Merck-and-Co-shingles-vaccine-313134" target="_new">25 March 2011</a>). </p><p><p>
