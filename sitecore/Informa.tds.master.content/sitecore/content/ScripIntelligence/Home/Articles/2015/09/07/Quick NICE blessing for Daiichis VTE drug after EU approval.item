<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales, has recommended Daiichi Sankyo's venous thromboembolism (VTE) therapy Lixiana (edoxaban) less than a month after European regulatory approval was granted for the product. </p><p>NICE concluded in draft guidance that Lixiana, an oral, once-daily, direct factor Xa inhibitor, could be recommended as a "cost-effective use of NHS resources," as a treatment for recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in adults. </p><p>Daily treatment with the drug will cost &pound;2.10 per patient (excluding locally negotiated discounts), a similar cost to other oral anticoagulants.</p><p>Lixiana is a non-VKA oral anti-coagulant (NOAC). It is used as an alternative to warfarin, which has been widely used for over 50 years but requires frequent monitoring to ensure the drug is working properly and is also associated with many food or drug interactions.</p><p>Figures from NICE say there are around 83,500 new cases of VTE each year in England. In addition to new annual cases, there is another group of patients needing long-term treatment, approximately 42,000 people.</p><p>Dr Simon Clough, UK general manager for Daiichi Sankyo , said, "It is gratifying that NICE has found our therapy to be clinically effective and cost effective within just weeks of receiving our European authorization." The drug, known in the US as Savaysa, was approved for use in European markets for stroke and systematic embolism (covering both DVT and PE) in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Late-to-market-edoxaban-approved-in-Europe-359120" target="_new">June this year</a>. </p><p>The key clinical evidence for Lixiana in VTE came from a global phase III study, called Hokusai VTE, which investigated the efficacy and safety of the drug compared with warfarin in 8,292 patients with either acute symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both. This represents the largest single study carried out to date with a NOAC in this indication.</p>
