<p>The US industry association PhRMA has described as "remarkable" the continuing improvements in the performance of Japan's regulatory agency, the PMDA, but still would like to see further progress in drug pricing and other reforms.</p><p>"I have never seen the opportunities that I see in Japan this year and into the future," declared Tony Alvarez, chairman of the Japan-based executive committee of PhRMA at a media briefing in Tokyo.</p><p>He was referring to the mix of concrete reforms, recent policy changes and remaining challenges that make up the current operating environment for the pharma industry in Japan, where the US group has long been an advocate for change but has now seen many of its main wishes granted.</p><p>For instance, Mr Alvarez noted that the standard review time for drugs in Japan has now been cut by more than half to 11 months, from 23.2 months a few years ago, while priority reviews are now down to 8.5 months.</p><p>Meanwhile, the delay between the submission of NDAs in other major markets and Japan has been cut from 30 months to 17 months, with industry seeing this coming down to as little as four months in the next few years, helped in part by increased acceptance of foreign clinical data.</p><p>"The professionalism of the staff at PMDA improves every year and PMDA will continue to expand its review and safety staff numbers," said Mr Alvarez, who is Japan country president for Merck Sharp & Dohme (Merck & Co). </p><p>He also praised the agency's initiatives to support smaller companies moving through the regulatory process and to help universities conducting drug development programs, and pointed to the PMDA's increased acceptance of foreign clinical data and support for multiregional clinical trials.</p><p>But PhRMA said it would continue to work with the regulator to address outstanding issues in areas such as multiregional clinical trial guidelines for Phase I data, enhancing priority reviews and introducing rolling submissions.</p><p>The proposed "sakigake" system of designation for breakthrough drugs should also be applied equally to non-Japanese firms pursuing global simultaneous development, he proposed.</p><h2>bringing benefits</h2><p>In line with PhRMA's broader general position, Alvarez stressed the pharma industry's role in improving general economic growth and predicted that 2015 would be a "key year for innovation in the pharmaceutical sector in Japan," based on developments last year.</p><p>PhRMA chairman and Pfizer chairman and CEO Ian Read projected a similar view on the societal and economic value of pharma innovation in meetings with stakeholders during a visit to Japan last November, in which Alvarez said "a clear consensus" emerged that Japan "needs to make significant changes in its policies to promote innovation."</p><p>The strategic importance of the pharma sector and innovative medicines appears to have been recognized at the highest levels in Japan, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently stating in parliament that the industry is a key driver of economic growth and public health, and hinted that further steps would be taken to improve Japan's clinical trial environment and the drug approval/regulatory system.</p><p>But while much has been achieved, PhRMA still has a few items on its wish list.</p><p>Among the positive changes highlighted by Alvarez is the creation (this April) of the new Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under leader Dr Makoto Suematsu. The new body will also support translational research, where PhRMA is already supporting exchange programs to bolster the transition from academic and basic research to the clinic and market. </p><p>In common with its European counterpart, EFPIA the US association praised the positive impact of the new price premiums introduced in Japan in 2010, saying these had encouraged R&D investment and faster approvals. </p><p>"As a result, the [total] number of drugs developed in Japan has increased from 231 in 2010 to an expected 395 drugs in 2017," the executive observed.</p><p>PhRMA is currently conducting a survey to update these figures, which it expects to show further improvements and will be submitted to official drug pricing policy discussions later this year.</p><p>Other positive policy reforms cited by the US group included Japan's revised legislation to encourage regenerative medicines, and a broadening of the definition of orphan diseases to include new intractable disorders.</p><p>"Our experience in the United States is that a change in the scope of orphan drugs can have a dramatic impact on public health and in investment in R&D," Alvarez told the meeting. "The opportunities in Japan with these regulatory changes are enormous."</p><p>Finally, he drew attention are clear targets within the Japanese government's Health and Medical Strategy for several areas of drug development and translational research.</p><h2>Policy Support</h2><p>A joint PhRMA/EFPIA study last year found that member firms of the groups conducted 682 trials at 11,653 sites in Japan, with total clinical-related spending of JPY88bn ($741m), out of JPY247bn for all pharma companies in the country combined.</p><p>But to continue to support the economic, knowledge and expertise benefits such investment brings, PhRMA sees it necessary to have "supportive government policies in the areas of pricing and reimbursement, drug approval, vaccine development, and translational research."</p><p>To this end, and in common with EFPIA, the US group wants the trial system of pricing premiums to be made permanent, and is "strongly opposed" to annual (rather than biennial) regular reimbursement price revisions and a possible special price cut in 2017 (together with the next consumption tax hike), given the negative effect and logistical challenges.</p><p>The group again called for the scrapping of a re-pricing for drugs for which sales have exceeded initial official forecasts, and also of the 14-day limit in prescriptions during the first year after product launch.</p><p>While in general "PhRMA supports the [Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe Administration's policies to promote healthcare innovation," Alvarez cautioned that: "progress and success will depend on the right mix of public policy, support and encouragement of the industry, involvement of all stakeholders in decision-making, and cooperation among those stakeholders."</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p><p>
