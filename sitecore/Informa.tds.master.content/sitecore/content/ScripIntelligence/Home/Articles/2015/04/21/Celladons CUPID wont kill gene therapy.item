<p><p>Celladon stock tanked on 27 April after the gene therapy announced negative results for their lead drug candidate; now the company is scrambling and investors in the hot gene therapy space are wondering what implications this could have on the field overall. </p><p>The biotech announced Sunday, 26 April that Mydicar failed to meet its primary and secondary endpoints in the Phase IIb CUPID2 trial, failing to show any efficacy over placebo. </p><p>"We of course are extremely disappointed with this outcome, particularly in light of our previous preclinical and clinical results," said Celladon CEO Krisztina Zsebo on a 27 April conference call.</p><p>CUPID2 included 250 patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV ischemic or non-ischemic heart failure. The main goal of the study was time to recurring heart failure event like hospitalization or worsening heart failure, while the secondary goals were time to first terminal like all-cause fatality or heart transplant. </p><p>Mydicar is a gene therapy that is injected near the heart and uses an adeno-associated virus to insert a gene that makes the protein SERCA2a. The protein is responsible for the heart contracting and pumping the blood to the rest of the body. Heart failure patients often have a low level of this protein and therefore their heart doesn&rsquo;t pump blood efficiently. Celladon's Mydicar is a one-time infusion that was hoped could improve SERCA2a levels and give patients better heart function. </p><p>Mydicar held a lot of promise; even being the first gene therapy to earn the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation early last year. Yet, the hopes of its success were thrown out with the results of CUPID2, which showed the drug only reduced the likelihood of another heart failure related event by 6% compared to placebo &ndash; a result that was no statistically significant. </p><p>The company is analyzing the data further to see if the lack of treatment effect was due to the drug simply not working or whether they failed to get the gene into the heart. The full results of the study will be presented later this year. At this time, the company revealed no other details about the study. </p><p>This puts Celladon in a rather precarious position &ndash; its stock fell 80.7%, or $11.04, to close at $2.64 on Monday. Other than Mydicar, the company has two other programs &ndash; both preclinical, and only $85m in cash and equivalents. "We are evaluating all of our expenses and programs in light of the CUPID2 result, and we do anticipate layoffs and other cost-cutting measures," said Celladon President and CFO Paul Cleveland on a conference call with investors. </p><p>The future doesn't look bright for Celladon, but that doesn't mean CUPID killed gene therapy. The space hit a wall several years ago as first generation gene therapies failed or faced delivery issues, but the area has become of interest again to investors as the next-gen wave of gene therapies are starting to produce more solid data. There is plenty of variation in how genes are delivered and how gene therapies work. Analysts point out that other disease areas may be more amenable to gene therapy. </p><p>"Extrapolation of failure to other gene therapy players is misplaced, however, given complexity heart failure and more clear-cut etiology for other gene therapy targets," wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Dr Jim Birchenough in a same day note. He added that stocks like UniQure, bluebird bio and Sangamo remain good to buy.</p><p><p>
