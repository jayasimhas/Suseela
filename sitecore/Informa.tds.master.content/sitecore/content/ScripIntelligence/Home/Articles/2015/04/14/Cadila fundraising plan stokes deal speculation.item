<p>India's Cadila Healthcare is seeking shareholder approval to raise up to INR100bn ($1.6bn), fuelling some speculation that it may be prepping for a small-to-medium sized acquisition in the future.</p><p>In a notice to the firm's shareholders uploaded on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 13 April, the Ahmedabad-based firm said that it has been pursuing both organic and inorganic growth and this would require sufficient resources including funds to be available and to be allocated, from time to time. Internal accruals may not suffice to meet all the requirements, it said.</p><p>"It would be, therefore, prudent for the company to have requisite enabling approvals in place for meeting the fund requirements of its organic and inorganic growth, capital expenditure, long term working capital, refinancing the existing borrowings and also such other corporate purposes as may be permitted under the applicable laws," the firm said.</p><p>The company expects to raise funds through issuance of equity shares including convertible bonds /debentures through qualified institutional placement (QIP) and/or depository receipts or any other modes for an amount not exceeding INR100bn. The board may also consider offering a discount of not more than 5% on the price calculated for the QIP or as might be permitted under the rules of India's Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</p><p>Analysts tracking the development did not appear too enthused, though, with some suggesting that the firm must be extra cautious about the asset quality so as to ensure sustained value creation, if indeed an acquisition was on the cards. </p><p>Investment banking experts also cautioned that enabling resolutions were meant to fore-arm a firm should a great opportunity come by.</p><p>Others like Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that should Zydus Cadila go through with an acquisition, it should logically be geared towards boosting its US business.</p><p>"To add meaningfully to the current base, the acquisition should ideally be targeted at the US market &ndash; probably a firm with requisite regulatory approvals for the US," Mr Mehta suggested. </p><p>Cadila has in the past maintained that it aspires to be among the top 10 generic companies in the US with a continued strong focus on customer needs. </p><p>Mr Mehta, however, expressed some concern at the proposed use of funds for capital expenditure, given that investors have been keen to see previous capex "deliver". </p><p>It's not immediately clear if any of the proposed expenditure may concern plant-related improvements. </p><p>Zydus Cadila's Moraiya facility had previously been under <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Non-compliance-pattern-at-Zydus-site-stokes-concern-356493%5d" target="_new">regulatory scrutiny</a>, with the FDA referring to what it then claimed was a "pattern" of non-compliance and failure to document a ''justifiable root cause''. </p><p>Cadila is also seeking shareholder clearance to issue unsecured/secured redeemable non-convertible debentures /bonds on private placement basis.</p>
