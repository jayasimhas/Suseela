<p>Actelion Pharmaceuticals confirmed on Sept. 10 that it is considering a purchase of hyperkalemia drug developer ZS Pharma, which would diversify the Swiss company's portfolio beyond its dominant disease area of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and meet Actelion's goal of acquiring assets in new areas with high unmet needs.</p><p>Both Actelion and San Mateo, California-based ZS Pharma released statements after the US stock market closed noting that the companies are discussing a potential acquisition of the former by the latter, but they said neither party has committed to a deal. In fact, ZS Pharma noted that it "regularly and routinely explores opportunities with various strategic partners and will continue to do so. These discussions may or may not lead to any transaction."</p><p>Before the separate announcements, rumors of a potential transaction sent ZS Pharma's stock up 28.4% to close at $74.73 and the share price surged 4.8% to $78.28 in after-hours trading. Actelion's US share price gained 3.1% to close at $142.12.</p><p><b>What's At Stake?</b></p><p>Hyperkalemia &ndash; a high level of serum potassium &ndash; has no approved treatments, but the US FDA is considering approval of two drug candidates: ZS Pharma's ZS-9 and Relypsa's patiromer. </p><p>Actelion's interest in ZS Pharma may shed light on the potential buyer's opinion of the Relypsa drug, which the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Relypsas-patiromer-under-FDA-review-shares-jump-355668" target="_new">FDA is scheduled to approve</a> or deny by Oct. 21 &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ZS-Pharma-readies-NDA-as-competitor-Relypsas-filing-nears-354095" target="_new">six months before</a> the May 26 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for ZS-9. Its focus on the company with a second-to-market hyperkalemia product seems to suggest that Actelion sees ZS-9 as a higher quality asset.</p><p>Sagient Research noted in a Nov. 21 comparison of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ZS-Pharmas-PhIII-ZS-9-results-positive-but-raise-safety-concerns-355126" target="_new">Phase III data</a> for the two drugs that ZS-9 had a much more rapid onset of action than <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Positive-top-line-Phase-III-for-ZS-Pharmas-hyperkalemia-drug-348036" target="_new">patiromer</a>. Sagient noted in a BioMedTracker report that 98% of patients treated with ZS-9 achieved normal potassium levels within 48 hours of starting treatment while 76% of patiromer-treated patients achieved normokalemia at four weeks. </p><p>The more rapid onset could make ZS-9 the preferred treatment in emergency room settings where 50% of hyperkalemia patients are treated initially, Sagient's BioMedTracker report said.</p><p>Even so, it seems Relypsa investors are hopeful that Actelion or another buyer is considering a purchase of the company. Relypsa's stock price spiked late in the day on Sept. 10 to close up 8% at $25.54 and rose 5.3% to $26.88 in after-hours trading.</p><p>Either company would fit into the acquisition priority that an Actelion spokesperson described to <i>Scrip</i> in April: "new markets in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actelion-raises-guidance-is-not-for-sale-357983" target="_new">high unmet need areas</a>."</p><p><b>Actelion's Unmet Diversity Need</b></p><p>Actelion's portfolio is dominated by PAH drugs, including top-seller <i>Tracleer</i> (bosentan), which will lose patent protection in the US in November. The drug generated $662.2m in sales for the first half of 2015, which was down from $760.7m in the first half of 2014, but the company's follow-on PAH drug <i>Opsumit</i> (macitentan) made up the difference with $213.6m in sales for the first six months of this year.</p><p>In addition to continuing to boost Opsumit sales in 2015, one of Actelion's goals for its PAH portfolio is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Actelion-boosted-by-selexipag-data-357322" target="_new">US and EU approvals</a> for <i>Uptravi</i> (selexipag) later this year or early in 2016.</p><p>Despite Actelion's insistence in April that the company is not for sale, Shire was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ShireActelion-rumors-highlight-MandA-buzz-in-orphan-space-358852" target="_new">rumored to be an interested buyer</a> in June. PAH would be a new indication for Shire, but both companies' portfolios include treatments for lysosomal storage disorders.</p><p><p><p><p>
