<p>Heading into a crucial vote later this week by the full House, the authors of a massive bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; tried to get in front of expected criticism by fiscal conservatives on 6 July by insisting the legislation, which would give the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) added funding, ultimately would save the nation billions of dollars.</p><p>"Not only will this bill help save and improve lives, streamline and modernize regulations, and keep good jobs here in the United States, it will also save money by developing cures rather than continuing to shoulder the heavy cost of chronic illness, so much of which is borne by taxpayers," leaders of the House Energy & Commerce Committee argued, in trying to make the spending case for their legislation. </p><p>Using bolded underlining throughout their 6 July statement, the lawmakers, led by Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), the E&C chairman, contended the "temporary" added dollars that will be allotted to the NIH and the FDA under the bill, known as the "Innovation Fund," is "fully offset and retains the critical role of the Appropriations Committee to determine the specific biomedical spending priorities through the regular appropriations process each year of its five-year life." </p><p>The fund initially was to have $10bn in the pot for the NIH. But last-minute <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">revisions made last week</a> when the bill showed up at the Rules Committee trimmed the NIH's added dollars to $8.75bn &ndash; a cut of $1.25bn, which had some lawmakers who had backed the bill upset.</p><p>"We are disappointed that after careful consideration and countless hours of working closely together to strengthen this bill and ensure the NIH receives a full $10bn, this amendment falls short," said Democratic Representatives Diana DeGette (Colorado) &ndash; who has been Mr Upton's partner throughout the creation of the Cures bill &ndash; Frank Pallone (New Jersey), the ranking member on the E&C, and Gene Green (Texas), the E&C Health Subcommittee's ranking member.</p><p>But they said they would work with their Republican colleagues to try to find a "new method to pay for the funding hole that unfortunately remains for NIH research." </p><p>Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research!America &ndash; which has strongly advocated for the NIH to get a funding boost &ndash; took the $1.25bn cut in stride &ndash; declaring that given what Representatives Upton and DeGette have been up against in securing the supplemental funding stream and "thinking about what these dollars could mean for medical progress," the end result would nonetheless be a "huge victory."</p><p>The proposed $<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">550m for the FDA</a> over five years, which passed the E&C on 21 May in a unanimous vote, went untouched in last week's revisions. </p><p>But some of the offsets to pay for the legislation also changed, which triggered an updated estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan organization that provides budgetary advice to House and Senate members.</p><p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-to-cost-106.4bn-exclusivity-ups-health-costs-359093" target="_new">CBO estimated</a> that implementing the Cures legislation would cost $106.4bn over five years, with the reauthorization of the NIH accounting for most of that amount, or $105.1bn.</p><p>In its 23 June report, the CBO said the bill also would reduce direct spending, on net, by $11.9bn over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period. </p><p>In its 2 July report, the CBO said the legislation would reduce the US deficit by more than $500m over the first decade.</p><p>The E&C lawmakers said a "conservative estimate" calculated the committee's staff indicated permanent "reforms" to entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, in the Cures bill would cut federal spending an additional $7bn in the second decade.</p><p>The E&C also clarified that while the Innovation Fund was "technically" characterized by the CBO as "mandatory" spending, the lawmakers said there are differences between the new NIH and FDA dollars and the "typical mandatory spending" that occurs through many of the nation&rsquo;s entitlement programs.</p><p>For instances, they said, under the traditional mandatory entitlements, law sets eligibility rules and any eligible individual receives benefit, whereas that's not the case for the Innovation Fund.</p><p>The NIH and FDA fund also is not on auto-pilot with no expiration, unlike traditional mandatory entitlements.</p><p>There also is a funding cap at a set amount each year for the Innovation fund.</p><p>The House Committee on Rules is scheduled to meet on 8 July to consider the rule for the changed Cures bill before it proceeds to the House floor for a vote, which is anticipated to occur later this week.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
