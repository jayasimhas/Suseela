<p>Stock price gains for AstraZeneca, Amgen, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Portola Pharmaceuticals and Esperion Therapeutics showed that there were no biopharma losers based on data presented during the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session & Expo despite unanswered questions about therapies in development.</p><p>Clinical trial investigators, cardiologists and analysts had a final chance to sound off on the companies' ACC data presentations on 16 March, the final day of the meeting, which began on 14 March in San Diego. Additional commentary on AstraZeneca's Brilinta (ticagrelor), PCSK9 inhibitors Praluent (alirocumab) from Regeneron with partner Sanofi and Repatha (evolocumab) from Amgen, and other novel therapies put the drugs' potential real world use into perspective.</p><p><b>Cardiologists weigh Brilinta benefits, risks</b></p><p>Marc Sabatine of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, principal investigator for AstraZeneca's Phase III PEGASUS clinical trial, presented the company's results for Brilinta (ticagrelor) plus aspirin versus placebo and aspirin in 21,000 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated for one to three years following a heart attack in a late-breaker deep dive session at ACC on 16 March. The twice-daily oral drug is approved only to treat ACS patients during the year after a heart attack.</p><p>The data were viewed critically by cardiologists and analysts over the weekend due to bleeding risks associated with the platelet inhibitor when the results were published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> on Saturday, 14 March (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-AstraZeneca-optimistic-on-Brilinta-after-PEGASUS-others-less-so-357300" target="_new">16 March 2015</a>). </p><p>However, the company's stock rose 2% on Monday to $68.72 per share, perhaps as doctors weighed the 15% decrease in cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in PEGASUS versus the doubling of bleeding risk versus aspirin alone with a small incidence of fatal and intracranial bleeds.</p><p>During the deep-dive session's question-and-answer period on 16 March, Dr Sabatine said that based on the PEGASUS results he would keep his ACS patients on Brilinta plus aspirin beyond the one-year FDA-approved treatment period as long as they were tolerating the drug well.</p><p>Similarly, cardiologist Steven Nissen, chair of the cardiovascular department at the Cleveland Clinic and a frequent critic of drug safety, said during the same session that doctors will have to prescribe treatment with Brilinta plus aspirin over the long term based on the risk for each patient.</p><p>"When you prevent things like stroke at the cost of some bleeding, you can't weight those things evenly," Dr Nissen said.</p><p>He and Duke University School of Medicine professor and cardiologist Magnus Ohman noted the high financial cost and physical toll of a stroke or heart attack versus the largely reversible effect of bleeding events caused by platelet inhibitors, especially for relatively healthy patients. </p><p>Dr Ohman said he hoped that future PEGASUS analyses will include evaluations of the cost of Brilinta treatment versus the expense of stroke and heart attack that may be prevented by the drug.</p><p><b>PCSK9 inhibitor efficacy confirmed, safety still uncertain</b></p><p>The efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors seems to be well established with dozens of clinical trials for Praluent and Repatha showing substantial LDL cholesterol-lowering capabilities for patients who can't reach goals with statins or can't tolerate the older oral drugs. But even with one- and two-year safety results that show fairly low levels of side effects, doctors agree that the positive impact on cardiovascular events emerging in completed clinical trials must be confirmed in large outcomes studies.</p><p>Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron plan to report results from the FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes trial for Repatha and the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial for Praluent in 2017. But since those data won't be available until two years after the monoclonal antibodies win FDA approval, which is expected later this year, the competitors released safety data at the ACC meeting which show the LDL-cholesterol-lowering effects of their therapies cut cardiovascular events by more than half (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">16 March 2015</a>).</p><p>Regeneron reached a new stock price high, closing up 5.2% at $451.77 per share on 16 March, while Sanofi rose 3.3% to $48.62. Amgen's stock climbed 5.7% to close at $163.03. </p><p>Dr Nissen warned in the 16 March late-breaker deep-dive session against over-interpreting the OSLER-1 and OSLER-2 results for Repatha and the ODYSSEY LONG TERM data for Praluent as definite signs that cholesterol-lowering caused by PCSK9 inhibitors will translate to long-term cardiovascular benefits, including reduction in death, heart attacks and strokes. He and other cardiologists on the panel agreed that more data from many more patients is needed from the ongoing outcomes studies.</p><p>"I think everybody thinks [PCSK9 inhibition] is going to be a big blockbuster, but let's get the trials done and understand" the long-term safety, said Dr Nissen, a staunch advocate for cardiovascular outcomes trials (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Disclosing-interim-CV-data-Nissens-got-a-plan-353337" target="_new">12 August 2014</a>).</p><p><b>Factor Xa reversal raises Portola stock</b></p><p>Portola's stock rose as well on 16 March when data were presented during an ACC session called "Highlighted Original Research: Acute Coronary Syndromes and the Year in Review." The presentation did not differ from previously reported results from the Phase III pivotal study for andexanet alfa, which is designed to reverse the anticoagulation effect of Factor Xa inhibitors. </p><p>The data showed the drug's ability to rapidly stop the activity of the blood thinner Xarelto (rivaroxaban), which is marketed by Bayer Healthcare and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen subsidiary. South San Francisco-based Portola recently priced a $100m stock offering to support potential US FDA approval of andexanet alfa for which the company plans to submit a biologic license application (BLA) to the FDA by the end of 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Portola-to-raise-100m-for-final-Factor-Xa-inhibitor-antidote-push-357230" target="_new">11 March 2015</a>). </p><p>Mark Crowther, a medical professor at McMaster University in Canada and an investigator on the andexanet alfa pivotal study, said during his ACC presentation that an intravenous bolus of the agent reversed anticoagulation caused by Xarelto within two to five minutes of administration. The mean percent change in Factor Xa inhibition was 92%. </p><p>Janssen vice president of medical affairs Paul Burton said in a statement from the J&J company that "andexanet alfa may add to current reversal strategies for Xarelto." </p><p>Dr Burton noted that: "Stopping treatment with Xarelto may allow for patients to return to near-normal levels of coagulation within 24 hours. In addition, the use of prothombin complex concentrate, or PCC, has been observed to partially reverse the anticoagulant or blood thinning activity of Xarelto in healthy people."</p><p>In response to a question at ACC about the unmet medical need for an anticoagulation reversal agent, Dr Crowther said life-threatening bleeding events for Factor Xa inhibitors &ndash; a class that includes Xarelto, Eliquis (apixaban) from Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Daiichi Sankyo's edoxaban &ndash; occur in roughly 1% to 3% of patients, which is the same as the bleed rate for commonly used warfarin. </p><p><b>Esperion hits new high on ETC-1002 update</b></p><p>Esperion reported top-line Phase IIb results for its oral LDL-cholesterol-lowering drug ETC-1002 in October, but the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company's stock reached a new high on 16 March based on a 14 March update from the clinical trial at ACC (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Esperions-ETC-1002-succeeds-in-Phase-IIb-but-Zetia-combo-could-be-key-354250" target="_new">2 October 2014</a>). Esperion closed up 3.6% higher at $77.10, bringing the company's market cap to almost $1.6bn.</p><p>Esperion previously reported that ETC-1002 monotherapy reduced LDL-cholesterol by up to 30% at 12 weeks versus 21% for Merck & Co's Zetia (ezetimibe), but cholesterol was reduced by as much as 48% for patients treated with the combination therapy. The company reported at ACC that once-daily treatment with 120mg or 180mg of ETC-1002 lowered LDL-cholesterol by 27% and 30%, respectively, at 12 weeks. The two doses combined with Zetia lowered LDL by 43% and 48%.</p><p>The effect of the highest dose of ETC-1002 in combination with Zetia was "similar to the effect of a high-dose statin or monotherapy PCSK9" Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a 16 March research note.</p><p>Mr Messer also noted that ETC-1002 "achieved significant reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) of nearly 40% compared to Zetia. CRP is a key inflammatory biomarker and an independent risk factor for heart disease. Statins have been shown to variably reduce CRP levels, but in the range of low single digits to as much as 50%."</p><p>Esperion is developing a fixed-dose combination of ETC-1002 with Zetia, which could be "a convenient and effective once-a-day pill [that] would become the treatment of choice," he said. </p><p>Results from additional ETC-1002 clinical trials are expected in March and in the second quarter of 2015 with the initiation of Phase III studies anticipated by the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
