<p><p>On the heels of getting a second grant from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Visterra Inc. is ready to advance its broad spectrum flu treatment &ndash; a drug that could have particular uses in hospitals and during potential pandemics. </p><p>The Massachusetts biotech announced Oct. 5 that BARDA is contributing another $29.1m to the development of its flu treatments, with the potential to bring in as much as $204.5m should VIS410 should BARDA decide to move forward with the option. The full funding would span five years and would allow Visterra to pay for the submission of its Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) with the FDA. </p><p>VIS410 is a monoclonal antibody meant to treat all strain of influenza A, including the seasonal strands of the flu and the highly-mutated forms that have emerged over the last few years. </p><p>This could be a major seller for the biotech due to increases in the incidence of the flu in recent years. Companies have struggled to get patients to take their preventative vaccines, but also have not always been successful with those vaccines for those patients that are compliant. Flu vaccines typically prevent three to four of the most common strains of the seasonal flu, but can be completely ineffective against preventing the infection when other strains become more prevalent during a season or highly mutated strains emerge like the H1N1 virus that devastated the US a few years ago. </p><p>Visterra intends to position VIS410 as a treatment for patients in the hospital &ndash; where influenza spreads more easily and where patients with a more severe case usually end up. </p><p>The company also announced Oct. 5 that VIS410 achieved its primary endpoint of reducing viral shedding when assessed at an interim analysis of a Phase IIa trial. The drug reduced viral shedding by 92% compared with placebo and resolved upper respiratory symptoms two days earlier. Based on the results, Visterra chose to end the comparative arm of the study. The trial was originally meant to enroll 60 patients, randomized 50:50 to drug vs. placebo. The strong results mean Visterra intends to push the compound forward into other clinical trials. </p><p>Visterra is a unique story; the company is funded by a variety of sources, including the government grants from BARDA, as well as traditional venture funds and corporate venture investors. It completed a Series B financing in October 2014 that included contributions from Merck Research Labs Venture Fund, Temasek and Vertex Venture Holdings. </p><p><p>
