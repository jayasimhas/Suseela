<p>Will India's Cipla and Serum Institute progress their current alliance for vaccines into a potential combination?</p><p>That's a tough question, at least for now, say a clutch of investment bankers. They point to potential valuation roadblocks and some even refer to cultural ''incongruence'' beyond the shared visions of the ''maverick'' chairmen of the two firms, Cipla's Dr Yusuf Hamied and Serum's Dr Cyrus Poonawalla.</p><p>Whether or not a deal materialises, it certainly puts the spotlight on consolidation opportunities in the domestic market and also potentially on how the young scions at both large firms &ndash; Cipla's Kamil Hamied and Samina Vaziralli and Serum's Adar Poonawalla - look at future prospects. Mr Kamil Hamied and Ms Samina Vaziralli, who are part of the core management team in Cipla, are the children of MK Hamied, brother of chairman Dr Yusuf Hamied.</p><p>Frenzy over a potential combine began with a television interview in India, where Dr Poonawalla underscored that while Serum would never be up for sale, there could be a small chance that the firm could merge with a company like Cipla. </p><p>On whether talks had been held with Cipla, Dr Poonawalla went on to say ''a little bit'', but also referred to the fact that that companies would see ''how their initial partnership bears fruit'' and that if it moved in the right direction ''maybe we will take it to the next stage".</p><p>Asked by <i>Scrip</i> about the prospects of a combination, Dr Hamied referred to his long-standing friendship with Dr Poonawalla, how products of both firms save lives and their alliance for Europe. </p><p>''We are too big and his firm is too big, independently,'' Dr Hamied said.</p><p>An email statement from Cipla only referred to how both companies were committed to ''a long-term partnership'' for the distribution of vaccines in Europe. There are, however, some indications now that Cipla may also consider marketing one of Serum's vaccines in India. </p><p>Cipla and Serum Institute partnered to provide affordable paediatric vaccines in Europe &ndash; a deal which marked the Mumbai-based Cipla's broad indirect interest in vaccines though it was previously said to have had an alliance with Solvay Pharmaceuticals to market an influenza vaccine. </p><p>Under the alliance for Europe, Serum is responsible for developing and manufacturing the vaccines, while Cipla will seek European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval and market the products there. Product registration is part of Cipla's responsibilities <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-Serum-ally-for-Europe-vaccine-push-355169%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 November 2014)</a>. </p><h2>Valuation</h2><p>But investment bankers and analysts appeared sceptical about the prospects of an early deal, given potential valuation expectations and generally diverse product focuses.</p><p>''They are a decent fit, with no real overlaps, large tender-based overseas supplies and both chairs known for their leaning towards corporate social responsibility. But valuations are a hurdle,'' the head of an investment banking firm told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He referred to ''biotech-like valuations'' that Serum may be eyeing, with Cipla too being a very large listed company. Cipla, with more than 1,500 products in various therapeutic categories in its portfolio, reported a turnover of $1.7bn in 2013-14.</p><p>Others were more emphatic. Tarun Shah, founder of MP Advisors, a strategic business advisory firm based in Baroda, ruled out the progression of the Serum-Cipla relationship to a potential combination of sorts. </p><p>''If the market is interpreting the statement of taking the alliance to the next stage as a merger, then I believe that is very unlikely. A valuation match will not be easy and nor are the two firms culturally very similar currently,'' Mr Shah told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Some analysts also referred to limited synergies given that vaccines and Cipla's mainstay respiratory business required very different efforts, though they admitted that any potential deal would be earnings per share (EPS) accretive almost immediately for Cipla.</p><p>Both Cipla and Serum have not traditionally been involved in very large M&A (merger and acquisition) deals. Cipla has, however, over the recent past made a clutch of small buys including that of a pharmaceuticals manufacturing and distribution business in Yemen, in addition to the larger acquisition of Cipla Medpro in South Africa <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-ascends-value-chain-with-512m-Medpro-acquisition-340409%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 28 February 2013)</a>. </p><p>Serum, which is the world's largest manufacturer of measles vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines and exports products to 150 countries, in 2012 acquired the government-owned Dutch manufacturer of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, Bilthoven Biologicals <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Serums-Bilthoven-acquisition-opens-door-to-cut-price-polio-vaccine-in-Europe-and-US-332494%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 5 July 2012)</a>.</p>
