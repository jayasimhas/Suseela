<p>The UK-based tech transfer firm IP Group wants to raise around &pound;128m (or &pound;124.7m net of expenses) through the issue of 56,888,888 shares through a capital raising at 225.0 pence per share. The issue price represents a discount of 6.6% on the closing middle-market price of 240.9 pence per share on 9 March. The capital raising, scheduled to start on 27 March, is fully underwritten by Numis. IP plans to use the funds to accelerate its growth via increasing its investment both in its current portfolio and in new opportunities in the UK and US that progress to the post-seed stage. The capital raising will also allow it to expand its access to, and provide money to enable the development of, technology from universities and research institutions in both markets, it says. It will also fund the growth of its US business. "We believe there is a significant opportunity to continue to accelerate the group's growth by increasing our overall rate of capital deployment into our existing portfolio as well as into new early stage opportunities, both in the UK and the US," said CEO Alan Aubrey.</p><p>
