<p> <b>MAbxience, a biosimilar R&amp;D company founded in 2009 as the biotechnology arm of CHEMO group, has opened a new manufacturing plant in Leon, Spain at which it hopes to produce up to six new monoclonal antibody biosimilars for its target markets of Europe and Latin America. </b> </p> <p> <b>At a launch event for the new site, on Oct. 15, MAbxience's managing director Carlos Ba&ntilde;ado spoke to Lucie Ellis about why his company is different from its competitors; how the biosimilar sector will grow rapidly in the current climate of ever increasing drug costs for innovative products; and what biosimilar-only companies need to do to balance their production costs against discounted product prices. </b> </p> <p> <p> <img border="0" refid="251133" alt="Carlos Ba&ntilde;ado, managing director of MAbxience" src="-/media/3E94EE2A46DB45038B3CDE50FFA20F43.ashx" version="c"> </p> <p> <i>Carlos Ba&ntilde;ado, managing director of MAbxience </i> </p> <p> <p> <b>Lucie Ellis: What is MAbxience's business model as a biosimilar drug developer?</b> </p> <p> <b>Carlos Ba&ntilde;ado:</b> We have been styling and adjusting our business model as the company has evolved over the last six years. Basically MAbxience will do the clinical trials, all the development, we scale and manufacture, and then at a certain point license out the product. This licensing moment can occur at different times for different programs, for example sometimes our partners might help with the clinical trial process. But always at the end we license out to pharmaceutical companies that are normally local or regional. They then handle local registration and marketing and sales. </p> <p> <b>LE: What are your predictions for the growth of biosimilars in Europe and further afield?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> I believe a lot in biosimilars and this idea. MAbxience is an independent company but we belong to a group that has been working in generics for many years. So we have the capacity to have independent people working here but at the same time we have this generic development philosophy from our wider group. I believe that biosimilars in the long run will develop in a similar way to the generic market. There will be a very important price erosion stage, followed by increased uptake. More importantly there is more need today to control the cost of specialized drugs than there was 20 years ago, so the time is right for biosimilars and I expect uptake to eventually be even higher than that of generic products. This will be the case in Spain and in other European countries. In the future I see all the markets moving towards healthcare models that widely incorporate generics and biosimilars as standard. </p> <p> <b>LE: How will MAbxience manage increasing competition in the biosimilars space?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> There are two groups of companies in biosimilars in my view: there are some local companies where biosimilars are just a tiny piece of their development programs and these companies never took the risk to develop the products on a global scale. You see a lot of this type of company in India and China. Then there are companies like us that look at biosimilars on a more global perspective. The companies in this group though tend to be big multinationals &ndash; we're talking about Amgen Inc., Pfizer Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim and more &ndash; so we are one of the smallest companies in this group. This means we have to be very smart in the way in the way we work, the way we develop, and the way we use our resources. </p> <p> <b>LE: What are the key therapy areas attractive for biosimilar developers? And what regions are you targeting?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> Clearly arthritis and oncology are the top indications where biosimilars will be widely used but there are some others; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a good example &ndash; there is currently only one treatment [palivizumab] and the cost is $10,000 per course. So biosimilar versions of this product would be widely adopted if available. </p> <p> Geographically I see opportunities everywhere. For MAbxience though, we belong to Europe and also Latin America, we have a factory in Buenos Aires, so these two areas are where we will focus right now. But then there is the US market, the biggest but more difficult market, eventually we would like to be active there. </p> <p> <b>LE: How will biosimilars fit into the US healthcare system?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> I'm not sure I have the full answer yet on how biosimilars will fit into the US model. The problem today is that new products enter at such a high price. For the health system to be able to pay that and give it to all the patients at such a cost they need to release old or current therapies. They need to have biosimilars or they will not be able to keep incorporating new products into the system &ndash; it would be unsustainable and the healthcare structure would collapse. Biosimilars will play a key role in keeping health systems working and this is the case not only in the US but other established and emerging markets. </p> <p> Biosimilars are needed in the current R&amp;D chain and for me nothing is as big a force for innovation as competition. If you have a monopoly forever, you are not motivated to do something new. When biosimilars really start to infiltrate the market, pharma companies will have to look at their innovative new technologies because they will lose other areas of the market. Biosimilars will push forward more innovation in the industry. </p> <p> <b>LE: What is different about MAbxience?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> I would highlight three things. Firstly we are different because of the business to business model we have, we license out our programs. Secondly, MAbxience believes strongly in what we call &quot;finger printing&quot; biosimilars, which means we create drugs that are extremely similar to the original products. When you spend more time trying to reach this high level of biosimilarity then you can save time and resource on the clinical trial processes. This is probably the most unique part of MAbxience. When you achieve this fingerprint in a new biosimilar you are able to prove its use in a clinical trial and then extrapolate into other indications that originator product is approved for. The final thing is, as an independent company we have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of the market. </p> <p> <b>LE: You have six biosimilar products in the pipeline, two of which are more advanced. What is the development timeline for these products?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> Of our two more advanced biosimilar products we have launched the first one, a version of Roche Holding AG's rituximab, just a few months ago in Latin America. We won't be launching everywhere at the same time but we have filed this product in lots of countries. They will be staggered launches. It depends of these different countries, the speed of their authorities, their requirements etc. But we expect it to take around three years until we have the last launch of this product in a country we have already planned to file in. So it is really just starting. We are filing in 10 markets at the moment, but hope to keep expanding and we have agreements for this product in more than 50 individual countries, so there is still a lot of work ahead. </p> <p> Our second product down the line, [a version of Roche's <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab)] has already completed a clinical trial in colorectal cancer, which is a good milestone. Data from this study are expected to be reported by the end of the first quarter next year. With this study we hope to start registering the product in several countries and we are working with European authorities to see if we can register the product without any further clinical trials. </p> <p> [MAbxience's other biosimilars in development include preclinical programs for biosimilars of AstraZeneca PLC.'s RSV treatment <i>Synagis</i> (palivizumab); Amgen Inc.'s <i>Enbrel </i>(etanercept); AbbVie Inc.'s <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab); and an rFVIII product.] </p> <p> <b>LE: What sort of discounts do you expect to put on your biosimilar products?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> No less than 30% to begin with but this will increase to more. You can see in Norway, for example, that an infliximab biosimilar was launched at a 70% discount over the originator product (Merck &amp; Co.'s <i>Remicade</i>). This is a clear sign that biosimilars will be leaning more towards a generic model. It won't be only a 25% or 30% discount expected forever. I see the possibility that discounts could reach as high as 90%. So to balance this we need to be very efficient on the development of our products and on the production. That is why we built this new factory: as a company we need to be in control of production and not rely on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). </p> <p> <b>LE: How do you intend to grow MAbxience as a company?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> Biosimilar development has been like running a marathon; it has been a long process to get to where we are now and MAbxience has been investing for many years in this area. But we expect in the next couple of years to move into the black and from this year we are starting to generate revenue. The growth will come year after year; I believe with only biosimilar products you can have a strong business. </p> <p> <b>LE: What are the biggest benefits to having your own development plant over using CMOs?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> First you need to have control of your costs. It would be very difficult to use a CMO if you want to be able to compete on cost for the final product. But also you have a lot of flexibility. CMOs usually give you a slot in which to produce your product but say demand goes up very quickly, they are not always equipped to react and you cannot launch a product and then not supply your customers. Having our own factory is essential to offer a good price and the best service to customers. </p> <p> I don't think this move or more companies making simple actions to in-house manufacturing will affect CMOs. I have worked with CMOs for a long time and have seen these businesses growing. If you look at the pipelines of bigger pharmas and biotechs there are hundreds and hundreds of products in Phase II and Phase III &ndash; the CMO route for me makes more sense for originator products than for biosimilars. </p> <p> <b>LE: What are the biggest challenges ahead for MAbxience and the biosimilar R&amp;D sector?</b> </p> <p> <b>CB:</b> In biosimilars you have to do everything well. When you are creating an originator product you can afford to be a bit more inefficient on cost, you can spend a lot on production but you can price your final product much higher. In biosimilars you have to be good at everything: you need to be good at development because it is very difficult to develop a biosimilar and match up to another product; you need to be able to do clinical trials with large numbers of patients; you also need to be able to do production and marketing; and then be efficient in all of these areas. </p>
