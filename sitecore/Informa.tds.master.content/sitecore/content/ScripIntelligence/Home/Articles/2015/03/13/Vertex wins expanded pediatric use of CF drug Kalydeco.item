<p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals said on 18 March the FDA had expanded the use of the company's cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in children 2-5 years who have one of 10 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R and R117H.</p><p>This past December, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kalydeco-expanded-in-CF-patients-with-R117H-mutation-355875" target="_new">FDA granted use</a> of the drug in CF patients six years or older with the R117H mutation &ndash; a decision that followed the advice of its Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-panel-backs-Kalydeco-in-CF-with-R117H-mutation-354598" target="_new">voted 13-2</a> at a 21 October 2014 meeting to support the new indication.</p><p>Kalydeco <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">initially was approved</a> in the US in January 2012 for CF patients 6 years or older with at least one copy of the G551D mutation.</p><p>The drug was the first medicine approved in the US to treat the underlying cause of CF, a rare, life-threatening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, which causes poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs.</p><p>The disease causes a buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, which can cause chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage.</p><p>The company in February 2014 also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-broader-use-of-Kalydeco-in-CF-350192" target="_new">won approval</a> to market Kalydeco for use in eight additional mutations that cause CF: G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P and G1349D.</p><p>Shares of Vertex gained 1.4% on 18 March, before closing at $129.79, up 64 cents.</p><p><b>Related articles:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Kalydeco-expanded-in-CF-patients-with-R117H-mutation-355875" target="_new">Kalydeco expanded in CF patients with R117H mutation</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-panel-backs-Kalydeco-in-CF-with-R117H-mutation-354598" target="_new">FDA panel backs Kalydeco in CF with R117H mutation</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-broader-use-of-Kalydeco-in-CF-350192" target="_new">Vertex wins broader use of Kalydeco in CF</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">First drug to treat underlying cause of cystic fibrosis approved in the US</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vertex-snags-1st-US-FDA-breakthrough-therapy-designations-338853" target="_new">Vertex snags 1st US FDA 'breakthrough therapy' designations</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
