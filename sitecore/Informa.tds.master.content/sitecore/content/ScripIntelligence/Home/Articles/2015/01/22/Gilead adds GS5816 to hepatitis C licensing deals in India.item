<p>Gilead Sciences added a third drug, GS-5816, to its licensing agreements with eight pharmaceutical manufacturers in India who have contracted to produce low-cost versions of the Foster City, California-based company's medicines for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in developing countries.</p><p>Gilead recently said the generic licensing agreements announced in September for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) would continue as planned despite ongoing intellectual property concerns and the rejection of the first of two major patent applications in India (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-Sovaldi-patent-rejection-what-now-and-next-356154" target="_new">15</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-reconfirms-India-Sovaldi-plans-despite-patent-challenge-356180" target="_new">16 January 2015</a>). GS-5816 is Gilead's next-generation NS5A inhibitor, which is being developed in a single-pill, fixed-dose combination with Sovaldi to treat more HCV genotypes than Harvoni.</p><p>The eight manufacturers in India who have signed on to the licensing agreements for Gilead's oral HCV drugs may produce Sovaldi and Harvoni generics that could sell for about $900 for a three-month treatment course versus the $84,000 and $94,500 US price tags for the products. Seven firms agreed to Gilead's licensing terms in 91 developing countries in September with Biocon joining the group only recently (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">16 September 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Biocon-firms-up-plans-to-list-Syngene-licenses-Sovaldi-356330" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Sovaldi was approved in India in January and regulatory submissions have been completed in several other emerging markets, including Pakistan, Thailand, Brazil, Uganda, South Africa and Nigeria. And when the GS-5816 and Sovaldi combination pill wins approval in those regions, HCV drug costs in India and other countries could fall further. </p><p>Gilead has shown in a Phase II clinical trial that Sovaldi plus GS-5816 may be effective in some genotype 1 and genotype 3 HCV patients in as little as eight weeks, but the company may seek approvals for the combination pill with one of its other investigational agents to effectively treat more patients in just six to eight weeks (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AASLD-data-confirm-Gilead-as-ultimate-hep-C-champion-355054" target="_new">13 November 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Are-there-any-early-phase-opportunities-left-in-hepatitis-C-356222" target="_new">20 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Gilead also noted that the cost of HCV treatment could fall for patients treated with its next-generation combo pill, because the Sovaldi plus GS-5816 appears to be pan-genotypic. That means it can be prescribed without the need for costly and onerous testing to determine the genotype of hepatitis C with which a person has been infected.</p><p>"Even if testing facilities are available, their cost is a barrier to treatment access, so a regimen that can be used for any genotype is going to be a real attribute in tackling this disease on a global level," professor Abhijit Chowdhury, head of hepatology at the Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research in Kolkata, India, noted in a statement from Gilead. </p><p>Data from Phase III studies for the Sovaldi/GS-5816 combination pill are expected in the second half of 2015.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
