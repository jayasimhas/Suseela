<p><p>It seems Allergan has a more durable franchise in Restasis than some biotech investors would like to believe. A competitor to the dry eye drug from Eleven Biotherapeutics failed a Phase III pivotal trial, pushing the company to change focus. </p><p>Eleven Bio announced early 18 May that EBI-005 failed to reduce pain or damage to the cornea compared to a control in a 12-week study. Progress in the study was measured by the total corneal fluorescein staining score and by patient-reported outcomes related to pain. Both patients in the control group and those on the drug showed statistically significant improvement from baseline, but improvement was actually better in the control group. </p><p>The trial failure shouldn't have come as a surprise to investors; EBI-005 didn't perform better than placebo in mid-stage trials either. Yet, Eleven Bio's stock tanked on the news. Shares of the stock dropped 69.17%, or $8.28, to $3.69 apiece. </p><p>Dry eye disease is an ocular surface inflammatory condition induced by desiccating stress and mediated by an inflammatory cascade regulated by IL-1. The condition affects about 10% of people between the ages of 30 and 60, and up to 15% over the age of 65, according to Eleven.</p><p>About 8.3 million women and 4.1 million men in the US have moderate to severe symptoms of dry eye, according to BioMedTracker. Currently, Allergan's Restasis is currently the only FDA approved therapy to treat the condition, but Shire filed for approval of its lifitegrast in March in hopes of bringing a competitor to market &ndash; that decision is expected in October. Restasis brings in roughly $1bn annually, but analysts estimate that the market could be worth $3bn to $4bn with more effective treatments. </p><h2>Changing directions</h2><p>Based on the poor trial results, Eleven Bio is switching gears with the drug to concentrate instead on allergic conjunctivitis, or the condition more commonly known as pink eye. The first-in-class topical interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling inhibitor had mixed results in Phase II for that program &ndash; the drug didn't show a statistically significant benefit in its primary endpoint, but did show a reduction in ocular itching. Analysts believe that benefit was positive. Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry believes the drug could have a $500m market opportunity in allergic conjunctivitis. </p><p>The new Phase III trial in allergic conjunctivitis will begin in the second half of this year. Eleven Bio currently has about $59m in cash on hand and expects that money to last through the second half of 2016. </p><p><p>
