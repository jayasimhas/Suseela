<p>Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is set to introduce its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster asthma/COPD product Advair/Seretide (salmeterol/fluticasone) in Russia marking its entry into the respiratory space there.</p><p>The Indian company said that it had received approval from the Russian ministry of health for its Salmecort metered-dose inhaler (MDI) inhaler and that the product will be available on the market in the second quarter of fiscal 2015-16. </p><p>Salmecort, which is expected to be priced at a discount of about 25-30% to the innovator product, is probably the second Indian Seretide generic there after Cipla's Seroflo MDI.</p><p>The Russian inhaler market is estimated at around $283m, of which the total MDI market is valued at around $107m.</p><p>The Russian roll-out plans are part of Glenmark's efforts to develop a strong respiratory franchise in emerging markets &ndash; Brazil is another market where filings are said to have been made. ''We hope to have a big play in the respiratory space&#8230; it will include all types of devices, MDIs, different technologies," Glenmark's chairman and managing director, Glenn Saldanha, previously told <i>Scrip</i><a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-gets-first-generic-approvals-for-Advair-MDI-349093%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 3 January 2014)</a>. Dermatology, oncology and the respiratory segment are Glenmark's core foci in emerging markets.</p><p>Glenmark has already received approval for its generic Advair MDI in Mexico and the Philippines and indications are the products have managed to garner around 5-10% share in these markets. </p><p>Glenmark, however, declined to comment on plans for filings in Europe.</p><p>Generic competition for Advair has been building up in Europe.</p><p>Sandoz's salmeterol/fluticasone product, AirFluSal Forspiro, has been approved in about 13 European countries, as well as South Korea and Mexico. The product has been launched in five nations, including South Korea, the company said last November.</p><p>Last year, Cipla launched its generic Advair MDI in Germany and Sweden <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ciplas-Advair-generic-hits-Europe-eyes-Breo-version-353665%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 2 September 2014)</a> and the firm recently indicated ''good traction'' for its generic in markets like Czech, Slovakia and Croatia. Cipla also bagged its first tender for the product in Germany. </p><p>GSK, at the time of its 4Q results last month, said that it expects global Seretide/Advair sales to continue to decline in 2015 given sustained price pressure in the US and Europe, generic competition in Europe and continued uptake of its new respiratory portfolio.</p>
