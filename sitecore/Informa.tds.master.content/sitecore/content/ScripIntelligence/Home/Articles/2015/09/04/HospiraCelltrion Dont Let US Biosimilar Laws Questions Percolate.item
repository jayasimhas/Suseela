<p>Questions raised in an ongoing lawsuit filed by Amgen involving Novartis unit Sandoz's Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) about the notice of commercial marketing provision in the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA) are vital to the competition and functioning of the multibillion dollar biosimilars industry and should not be allowed to "percolate" and must be answered now, Hospira and Celltrion said in a brief filed on Sept. 3.</p><p>"Further percolation will not advance the law," Hospira and Celltrion said, insisting that "settling the issue will spur competition."</p><p>The two firms, which are involved in their own lawsuit filed by Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen, called for an immediate review by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">July 21 decision</a> by a three-judge panel in Amgen v Sandoz, in which both of those companies gained a win, but also experienced a loss.</p><p>Specifically, the panel, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">heard oral arguments in June</a>, ruled 2-1 that Sandoz and other biosimilar makers could opt out of the so-called patent dance and would not have to disclose their applications and manufacturing details if they chose to do so.</p><p>But in a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled in Amgen's favor, declaring that when a firm opts out of the patent dance, 180-day notice of commercial marketing under the BPCIA is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval, telling Sandoz it could not market Zarxio until after Sept. 2.</p><p>Sandoz did indeed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">launch Zarxio on Sept. 3</a> &ndash; pricing the drug, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">approved on March 6</a> as the first biosimilar in the U.S., at a 15% discount to Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim), the innovator product on which the biosimilar was referenced.</p><p>Amgen and Sandoz each have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">filed petitions seeking a rehearing</a> by the full Federal Circuit, or an <i>en banc</i> review.</p><p>Hospira and Celltrion noted their interest in the suit is "not academic," given their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-seeks-to-block-Celltrions-infliximab-biosimilar-357239" target="_new">current battle</a> at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts brought by Janssen, which is trying to force the biosimilar makers to engage in the patent dance over their infliximab biosimilar, referenced on the J&J unit's Remicade.</p><p>"What's interesting about the Hospira/Celltrion brief is that it emphasizes the fact that additional litigation over the meaning of the 180-day period is going on right now, and thus the industry would benefit from the Federal Circuit's review now," said New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter.</p><p>Cerwinski pointed out that in a footnote in the Sept. 3 amicus brief, Hospira and Celltrion emphasized they timely provided their biosimilar application to Janssen and there will be no second wave patent action, since all of the patents that can be asserted are being litigated in the first wave. </p><p>Hospira and Celltrion argued that under those circumstances, an injunction barring launch for 180 days after approval "amounts to a windfall for the reference product sponsor that serves no statutory policy, and illustrates why the Federal Circuit needs to reverse the panel&rsquo;s holding now," Cerwinski explained.</p><p>The notice of commercial marketing, which triggers such litigation, "serves no purpose," since Janssen was aware of the underlying application and already has asserted all identified patents, Hospira and Celltrion said. </p><p>They contended the Janssen litigation illustrates, in part, why, as the Federal Circuit panel recognized, "notice is not mandatory" unless the applicant completely fails to provide its 351(k) biosimilar application and the required manufacturing information to the innovator by the statutory deadline. </p><p>After all, Hospira and Celltrion insisted, why should they be required to provide a notice "that serves no statutory purpose?" </p><p>"But even if the notice is mandatory in certain cases, it should not have to await FDA approval," they said.</p><p>Hospira and Celltrion also asserted the Federal Circuit panel's ruling on the commercial marketing notice "flouts" the BPCIA's text and Congress' purpose in passing it. </p><p>They said that in the panel's view, a potential second phase of litigation, which involves patents that only the sponsor deems relevant, cannot even begin until after FDA approval.</p><p>But they said the BPCIA was designed "to identify and resolve patent issues before a biosimilar is approved" &ndash; something Hospira and Celltrion said even the Biotechnology Industry Organization has indeed said.</p><p>Hospira and Celltrion also asserted the Federal Circuit panel's ruling conflicts with a "host of cases" governing when courts may recognize a private right of action or extra statutory remedy. </p><p>"That precedent bars the automatic, bondless injunction entered here &ndash; one that not only was granted without any findings that satisfy the tradition-al requirements for equitable relief, but is unmoored from any patent rights," they said.</p><p>Celltrion also filed another brief jointly with the Biosimilars Council, a division of the Washington lobbying group the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, in which they argued the BPCIA's plain language permits notice before licensure and that "Congress did not intend for notice to trigger an automatic six-month injunction against marketing of FDA-licensed biosimilars." </p><p><p><p><p><p>
