<p> England's Cancer Drug Fund (CDF) seems to have contributed to the use of innovative drugs in the UK but its actual impact on patient outcomes is unclear, due to lack of evidence, according to a study by Britain's National Audit Office (NAO). </p> <p> The report also found that the UK remains much more reliant on older cancer drugs than the international average, and concludes that the Fund, which was established five years ago, is not sustainable in its current form, an assessment the pharma industry again echoed after reading the report. </p> <p> The CDF was set up by the British government in 2010 as a makeshift answer to the widespread view that not enough innovative cancer drugs were gaining access in the UK market. The National Audit Office, which scrutinizes public spending for the British Parliament and is independent of government, released its findings from an investigation into the Fund on Sept. 17, noting that from its inception in October 2010 to March 2015 the CDF enabled 74,380 patients to receive drugs that had either been rejected for use on the publicly-funded National Health Service or which hadn't yet been through an appraisal by the cost-effectiveness watchdog, NICE, at a total cost of &pound;968m. </p> <p> The NAO report said that although there is no direct evidence, the CDF probably enhanced patient access to novel oncology drugs not routinely available on the NHS. </p> <p> As illustration it noted that between 2009 and 2013, use in the UK of new cancer drugs on the market for five years or less rose from just 45% of the average recorded in other comparable countries, to 92%. At the same time, use of older cancer drugs which had been on the market for 6 to 10 years fell in the period, from 94% of the average in comparable countries, to 54%. </p> <p> <b>The UK's Use Of Cancer Drugs Compared With 13 Other Countries, 2009 And 2013</b> </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00250/cancer_drugs_chart_250809a.PNG"> <img src="-/media/DF0A6E7C1C3F4657947A6C81026E6368.ashx"></a> </p> <p> <i>Notes: The 13 other countries are: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the US. </i> </p> <p> <i>Source: National Audit Office analysis of data presented in Professor Sir Mike Richards CBE, Extent and causes of international variations in drug usage: A report to the Secretary of State for Health, July 2010 and the Office of Health Economics, International Comparison</i> </p> <p> Crucially for patients and the pharma industry, use in the UK of therapies ten years and older still rose from 87% of the average in 2009 to 124% in 2013, showing that Britain is much more reliant on older cancer drugs than the international average based on 13 countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the US. </p> <p> In response, Richard Torbett, executive director, commercial, at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Association (ABPI) in a statement said that &quot;whilst the Cancer Drugs Fund improved patient access to cancer medicines that are not routinely available on the NHS, the report makes clear that the use of new cancer drugs in the UK still remains below the average in other comparable countries. We remain adamant that this needs to change.&quot; </p> <p> The NAO said its study indicates that the CDF promoted use of newer cancer drugs, but said it couldn't discern whether the newer therapies had their intended effect on patients by extending life, because the data hadn't been properly collected. </p> <p> &quot;Data on patient outcomes to evaluate the impact of the Fund are not available,&quot; it said. &quot;The UK Department of Health recognised the importance of outcomes data when it set up the Fund. However, hospital trusts were not mandated to submit data to the national chemotherapy dataset until April 2014 and there are still significant gaps in the data. For example, in 2014?15 only 7% of records had an outcome summary. So the dataset has not been able to distinguish treatments paid for by the Fund from those paid for through routine NHS commissioning,&quot; the NAO report said. </p> <p> In conclusion, the audit body said the CDF is not a viable long-term solution and noted that the Fund's budget is already heavily over-spent. </p> <p> &quot;In this report we're highlighting the inadequacies of the data that the Department of Health and NHS England have,&quot; an NAO spokesperson said. &quot;So the effectiveness of the Fund is unclear. The Fund did improve access to cancer drugs, including new drugs, but NHS England has overspent the budget. Everyone agrees that the Fund needs to change. NHS England has stated its plans to reform the Fund, so we shall see whether that works.&quot; </p> <p> In July 2015, NHS England proposed that the CDF should become a managed access fund that would pay for promising new drugs for a set period before the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) decides whether the drugs should be recommended for routine commissioning. </p> <p> The implication of NHS England's proposals is that the Fund would no longer support the provision of drugs that have been appraised but not recommended by NICE. NHS England plans to consult on its proposals in autumn 2015, with the aim of implementing the new arrangements from April 2016. </p> <p> Pharma executives said the sooner that change happens, the better - and they seized upon the NAO report to underscore that point yet again. </p> <p> &quot;We have long voiced the view that the Cancer Drugs Fund is not sustainable in its current form, as the NAO report highlights. What is needed is a wholesale reform of NICE, which, along with NHS England, needs to develop a longer-term sustainable solution to the evaluation and commissioning of cancer medicines,&quot; ABPI's Torbett said, adding that the organization remains committed to working with all parties to achieve a more joined-up system, &quot;which allows many more NHS patients to benefit from life-enhancing medicines.&quot; </p> <p> His view was echoed by Richard Bergström, director general of the Brussels-based European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). </p> <p> &quot;We suggested from the beginning that the establishment of the CDF might not work in the long run,&quot; Bergström told Scrip in an emailed response. </p> <p> &quot;What all actors in the UK now seem to agree is very much the same as what's seen in other European countries: You cannot apply strict hurdles of health economic formula, such as cost/QALY, without involving the health system, and considering the budget impact. The trend across Europe is to rely less on health economics and more on negotiated agreements, called managed entry agreements, between companies and the people that manage the actual medicines budgets,&quot; he added. </p>
