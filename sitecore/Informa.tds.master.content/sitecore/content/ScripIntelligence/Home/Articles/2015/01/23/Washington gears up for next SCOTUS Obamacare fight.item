<p>Washington is gearing up for the next big US Supreme Court fight over the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) &ndash; a law that was enacted nearly five years ago and has had at least two major decisions come down from the justices since 2012. </p><p>The outcome of the case will impact the biopharmaceutical industry, which stands to potentially lose many of the new customers it gained under the ACA if the court rules in the challengers&rsquo; favor.</p><p>There is no question on which sides the majority of Republicans and Democrats stand on the challenge before the court, which will hear oral arguments on 4 March.</p><p>But each side was digging its trenches deeper on 28 January, with amicus briefs being filed and legislative plans being drawn up.</p><p>Republican leaders of the House Energy & Commerce Committee also issued a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell demanding to know if she was working on a contingency plan if the administration should lose at the Supreme Court, which agreed this past November to take up the case, even though there was not yet competing decisions at the federal appeals courts (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Rx-could-be-hit-in-Supreme-Court-ACA-challenge-354943" target="_new">10 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The high court's decision likely will be delivered in June, near the end of the justices' term.</p><p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling will follow two others by the justices involving the ACA &ndash; one win and one loss for the Obama administration.</p><p>In June 2012, the high court ruled that the ACA&rsquo;s individual mandate &ndash; the heart of the law &ndash; was constitutional (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Affordable-Care-Act-constitutional-under-Congress-taxing-powers-332248" target="_new">28 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Constitutionality-declared-Surgery-or-hammer-time-next-for-health-reform-332278" target="_new">29 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Post-SCOTUS-HHS-moves-forward-with-ACA-but-Republicans-push-back-332329" target="_new">2 July 2012</a>).</p><p>In a 5-4 vote this past June, however, the justices declared in <i>Burwell v Hobby Lobby</i> the ACA&rsquo;s mandate for employers to cover all 20 forms of US-approved birth control impeded two closely held companies&rsquo; exercise of their religions (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hobby-Lobby-Narrow-ruling-or-new-can-of-worms-352590" target="_new">1 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-When-sincerity-trumps-science-Implications-for-FDA-352675" target="_new">7 July 2014</a>). </p><p>The new quarrel at the court comes down to four words in the law: "established by the state."</p><p>Republicans at large are backing the law's challengers, which are arguing that four-word phrase expressly limits the subsidy eligibility to only those Americans who purchase insurance through online marketplaces, or "exchanges," operated by the states.</p><p>Republicans are insisting Democrats had used the subsidies to "induce" the states to build their own exchanges &ndash; something most failed to do.</p><p>Indeed, only 14 marketplaces were set up by the states and the District of Columbia. The federal government set up about three dozen exchanges on behalf of the states under federal regulations.</p><p>But a majority of the Democrats &ndash; the party that authored the 2010 law &ndash; are insisting Congress meant for all Americans who qualify for the ACA subsidies to obtain them, no matter whether they buy their health insurance on a state-based exchange or a federally run marketplace.</p><p>If the challengers prevail in the case, known as <i>King v Burwell</i>, nearly 5 million Americans will lose their ACA "premium" tax credits, making it likely those people would not be able to afford their insurance plans, leaving them without coverage for care or prescriptions.</p><p>The nonprofit Urban Institute has estimated that a decision against the Obama administration would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 8.2 million, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Democrat-California) pointed out.</p><p>"A ruling for these ACA opponents would strip millions of Americans of health coverage, throw insurance markets into turmoil and have widespread ripple effects," said Representative Pelosi, one of the key lawmakers who shepherded the ACA bill through Congress when she was Speaker of the House.</p><p>Nonetheless, Ms Pelosi said she was confident the Supreme Court would continue to allow anyone who purchased health insurance &ndash; whether through state or federal marketplaces &ndash; and met the eligibility test for the tax credit subsidies to receive them. </p><p>Optimistic the court will take their side, Republicans in the Senate already are working on a bill that would make awarding subsidies illegal for anyone who purchased an ACA plan on a federally run exchange.</p><p>Meanwhile, another vote is expected next week on Capitol Hill on full repeal of the law &ndash; the 56th time Republicans have tried to kill all or part of the law. </p><p>In an amicus brief filed on 28 January with the Supreme Court, several Democratic members of Congress involved in crafting the ACA, including Representative Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nevada), who were joined by several state legislators, contended the challengers' arguments were "weak," and that "even in isolation," the four-word phrase on which the plaintiffs are basing their assertions "provides, at best, ambiguous support for their interpretation, but read in the context of the remainder of the provision, not to mention the statute as a whole, it is clear that the provisions at issue plainly prescribe tax credits and subsidies for participants in all exchanges, federally facilitated and state-run."</p><p>They argued US lawmakers never sent states "the message that they needed to set up their own exchanges for their citizens to qualify for the tax credits," and the state legislators "never understood Congress to be sending that message based on their review of the statute and the legislative record." </p><p>"To the contrary," the parties of the brief declared, insisting the state legislators understood that tax credits would be available to their citizens regardless of whether their states set up their own exchanges.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
