<p>Johnson & Johnson emphasized its 2014 sales growth and investments in innovation to boost revenue further in 2015 and beyond, but the company's stock took a hit based on projections that this year's sales increases will be offset by foreign currency impacts.</p><p>J&J chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky said during the company's fourth quarter earnings conference call that the diabetes, cardiovascular and arthritis treatments Invokana (canagliflozin), Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Remicade (infliximab), Simponi (golimumab) and Stelara (ustekinumab) have not been impacted by pricing pressure that has plagued the makers of hepatitis C drugs. However, Mr Gorsky was less clear about J&J's strategy for acquiring new pharma products, leaving open the question of whether the company will make a major purchase in 2015 or continue executing smaller deals.</p><p>"We've had about an 8% [compound annual growth rate (CAGR)] over the last 20 years and we've invested almost $200bn in innovation over that span. About $109bn of that has been internal and about $85bn has been external," he said during the conference call. "With that external spend we've done over 120 deals and well over 100 of those are under $1bn."</p><p>J&J closed the $1.75bn acquisition of Alios BioPharma during the fourth quarter of 2014, which was executed with the intention of boosting the big pharma company's hepatitis C position and its infectious disease portfolio (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Reading-between-the-lines-of-JandJs-1.75bn-Alios-buy-354222" target="_new">1 October 2014</a>).</p><p><b>Sales performance</b></p><p>J&J chief financial officer Dominic Caruso noted during the company's earnings conference call that "currency headwinds have increased quite substantially since we last spoke with you in October of 2014, negatively impacting both sales and earnings and our guidance for 2015 to a greater extent than we had anticipated."</p><p>On a year-over-year basis J&J's sales rose 3.9% to $18.3bn in the fourth quarter of 2014 and jumped 6.1% to $74.3bn for the full year, but that's before the company made foreign currency adjustments. Fourth quarter sales fell 0.6% from the same period in 2013 and full-year 2014 sales increased by just 4.2% versus the prior year after J&J factored in currency impacts. </p><p>"The pharma segment posted a slight miss (-$231m). Within the pharma division, Simponi, Zytiga (abiraterone), Procrit/Eprex (epoetin alfa) and the schizophrenia [long-acting injectable] franchise came in above expectations. However, Olysio (simeprevir), Remicade, Velcade (bortezomib) and Prezista (darunavir) posted a noteworthy miss," Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a 20 January report.</p><p>Worldwide pharma sales increased 14.9%, including currency impacts, to $32.3bn in 2014. The business segment's revenue gains outperformed consumer product sales, which declined 1.4% to $14.5bn, and medical device sales, which dropped 3.4% to $27.5bn. </p><p>Within pharma Remicade sales increased 2.9% from $6.7bn in 2013 to $6.9bn in 2014 despite a 2.3% decline during the fourth quarter as the arthritis medicine faced both currency impacts and future biosimilar competition in Europe. Last year's sales jumped 27.4% to $1.2bn for Simponi and 37.8% to $2.1bn for Stelara. </p><p>The hepatitis C drug Olysio launched in late 2013 and generated just $23m in sales that year, but the product produced $2.3bn in 2014 sales &ndash; a rate of growth that's expected to slow considerably in 2015 given competition from oral hepatitis C therapies from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie. </p><p>"We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will replace the lower level of income from Olysio in 2015 as compared to 2014, allowing for continued investment in the business, particularly in research and development as we continue to build our pipeline," Mr Caruso said.</p><p>Sales gainers in 2015 most likely will include the prostate cancer drug Zytiga for which sales jumped 31.7% from $1.7bn in 2013 to $2.2bn in 2014 and the long-acting injectable schizophrenia therapy Invega Sustenna, which saw 2014 sales spike 27.2% to $1.6bn from $1.2bn in 2013.</p><p><b>2015 guidance</b></p><p>J&J's guidance for 2015 is a 1% to 2% increase to $75bn to $76bn in total pharma, device and consumer product sales. But with foreign currency factored in at current exchange rates, this year's sales could come in at $71bn to $72bn &ndash; a 3.5% to 4.5% drop from 2014.</p><p>The company's 2014 earnings and earnings per share (EPS) in the fourth quarter and for full-year 2014 increased due in large part to a lower than expected 8% tax rate, but earnings guidance for 2015 is lower than current forecasts. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings rose 1.4% to $3.6bn and EPS gained 2.4 to reach $1.27, while full-year 2014 adjusted earnings rose 7.7% to $17.1bn and adjusted EPS spiked 8.2% versus 2013 to $5.97.</p><p>Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford noted on 20 January that J&J's 2014 adjusted EPS was $0.02 ahead of analyst consensus estimates, but the company's adjusted EPS guidance of $6.12 to $6.27 for 2015 fell below consensus forecasts for this year.</p><p>J&J's stock closed down 2.6% at $101.29 per share on 20 January based on the 2014 sales miss and 2015 guidance disappointment versus analyst consensus. However, shares are still trading toward the high end of their one-year range of $86.09 to $109.49 and the company's market cap is $283.5bn.</p><p><b>Investor concerns: deals and drug pricing</b></p><p>Mr Gorsky highlighted oncology as an area where J&J has increased value to shareholders through acquisitions that yielded profitable therapies.</p><p>"The partnerships we have built since 2008 have helped us grow from a $1bn franchise to over $4.5bn today, and we have earned four breakthrough [therapy] designations in this portfolio [from the US FDA], demonstrating our ability to identify and develop products that can revolutionize the care of cancer patients," he said during the company's conference call.</p><p>In terms of J&J's broader investments in external innovation, Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation (JJDC) has invested more than $1bn in venture capital in start-up companies, including 43 investments worth almost $200m in 2014; J&J has negotiated more than 200 collaborations with local biotechnology companies around its innovation centers in San Francisco, Boston, London and Shanghai during the past two years; and J&J's Janssen Labs &ndash; no strings attached incubators for biotech startups in San Diego, San Francisco, Texas and Boston &ndash; are home to 70 young companies.</p><p>J&J has licensed various products through its innovation centers, including a recent transaction worth up to $241m plus royalties with Vedanta Biosciences for the irritable bowel disease treatment VE202 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Vedanta-strikes-deal-with-Janssen-for-IBD-therapy-356145" target="_new">14 January 2015</a>). Previously, the company announced 12 new collaborations in June that the company negotiated through its innovation centers with drug developers and others (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJ-Innovation-Centers-report-12-new-partners-investments-352430" target="_new">19 June 2014</a>).</p><p>"About six years ago, we lost $8.5bn of sales to patent expiry, and this was out of a $24bn portfolio in our pharmaceutical business. A lot of companies have chosen different strategies but what we've said is, first of all is, we want to be very focused on innovation and on developing differentiated products that will ultimately help fulfill unmet medical needs," Mr Gorsky said.</p><p>J&J's focus on both internal development and externally-developed programs has led to 14 new product launches since 2009 with cumulative sales of more than $27bn, including six products with more than $1bn in sales. The company won more than 20 line extensions in 2014 to broaden the labels of its approved drugs and filed applications to seek 20 additional label expansions. </p><p>"We also started 23 Phase III trials and initiated 11 Phase II trials and, as currently constituted, our pipeline is poised to yield 10 potential new product filings between 2013 and 2017," Mr Gorsky said.</p><p>J&J's focus on innovation helps the company identify products that are differentiated enough to garner broad payer reimbursement and competitive pricing without pressure to reduce the cost of medicines.</p><p>"We haven't seen additional pressures as of late," Mr Gorsky said when questioned about pressure from private payers in the US, which have negotiated widely publicized discounts for hepatitis C drugs and indicated that specialty medicines, including cancer therapies and biologics that are being developed to treat high cholesterol, may face similar scrutiny (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>).</p><p>In addition to driving sales for the anticoagulant Xarelto and diabetes medicine Invokana, Mr Gorsky noted that the J&J teams negotiating with payers have "done a nice job in managing the overall value and pricing and reimbursement issues, but we haven't seen any noticeable changes in that environment" for arthritis medicines Remicade, Simponi and Stelara.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
