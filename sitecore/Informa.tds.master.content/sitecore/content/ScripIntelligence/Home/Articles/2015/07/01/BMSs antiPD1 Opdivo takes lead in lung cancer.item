<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb's lead immune-oncology product Opdivo (nivolumab) looks set to become the first PD-1 inhibitor to gain approval for a major lung cancer indication after an interim analysis of the Phase III CheckMate&ndash;017 study showed that it improved overall survival compared with the control chemotherapy arm. </p><p>Opdivo was the first PD-1 inhibitor to reach the market worldwide when it was approved for the treatment of melanoma in Japan, but in the US it was pipped to the post by Merck & Co's rival PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which gained approval for melanoma in September (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 September 2014</a>). FDA go-ahead for Opdivo in melanoma came later, but still three months ahead of schedule, in December (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 December 2014</a>). </p><p>Getting to market as early as possible is key for the new wave of immune-oncology products as it will be some time before any real comparisons can be made on their relative safety and efficacy. Giving physicians time to become comfortable with using each particular product in the meantime is vital for long-term sales growth for all players. Other anti-PD-1s from AstraZeneca/MedImmune (MEDI-4736/durvalumab) and Roche (RG7446) are in Phase III development for NSCLC. </p><p>"The fact that this trial was stopped early because an overall survival advantage had been demonstrated bodes well for Opdivo's prospects as a treatment for previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic squamous cell NSCLC," said Dr Colin White, an analyst with Datamonitor Healthcare. Squamous cell NSCLC makes up about 25-30% of all NSCLC cases.</p><p>The open-label Phase III CheckMate-017 is comparing nivolumab with docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic squamous cell NSCLC. 272 patients were randomized to receive either nivolumab 3mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or docetaxel 75mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks. The primary endpoint is overall survival, with secondary endpoints including objective response rate and progression free survival. </p><p>The comparative portion is now being stopped, with patients given the option to continue or start Opdivo therapy in an open-label extension to characterize long-term survival. The data are being shared with health authorities, BMS said, and the full data will be published in due course. </p><p>Analysts at Leerink noted that the fact that data will be shared with health authorities was "intriguing" given that Opdivo has been filed in the EU for third-line use in squamous NSCLC based on the CheckMate&ndash;063 study and was due to be filed in the US before the end of 2014. "We believe it is possible that both agencies could evaluate -017 as part of the -063 filing, potentially providing a broader label including second-line lung cancer. Recall that Yervoy's initial approval didn't include data in the label for first line melanoma, but the availability of data to the agency allowed approval with a broad label." They add that while this would be the best case outcome for BMS, they nonetheless expect full approval and a breakthrough designation for Opdivo in second line squamous NSCLC in 2015.</p><p>In addition to the &ndash;017 and &ndash;063 studies, BMS also has other Phase III trials in NSCLC, including the CheckMate&ndash;057 study comparing it with docetaxel in non-squamous cell NSCLC after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy in more than 500 patients. Primary endpoints are due to report in May. </p><p>Rival Merck is similarly looking at Keytruda in Phase II/III in both squamous and non-squamous patients but selected for PD-1 expression in the KEYNOTE studies. The company has just announced plans to file the product for lung cancer by mid-year. </p><p>Other Opdivo lung cancer studies include the open-label CheckMate&ndash;026 trial comparing nivolumab with investigator's choice chemotherapy as first-line therapy for stage IV or recurrent PD-L1+ NSCLC; and the CheckMate&ndash;153 Phase III/IV safety study in advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed during or after receiving at least one prior systemic regimen. A Phase III study of nivolumab in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) in patients with advanced NSCLC is also planned. </p><p>
