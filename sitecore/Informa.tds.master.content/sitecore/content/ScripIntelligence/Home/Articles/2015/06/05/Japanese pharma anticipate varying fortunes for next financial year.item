<p>Japanese pharma companies have begun reporting their annual results, for the full year ending 31 March. While the numbers appear to be in-line with expectations, guidance for the following year has lifted some eyebrows. Meanwhile, Takeda Pharmaceutical &ndash; Japan's largest pharmaceutical company &ndash; reports its annual results later this week. It has said there will be discrepancies from its previous forecast (announced in February). Profit lines, from operating profit downwards, will be impacted by the US Actos settlement. </p><p><b>Astellas</b></p><p>Astellas reported full year sales of &yen;1247.3bn, a 9% increase year-on-year, with core operating profit up by 16% to &yen;216.5bn. The firm's Urology franchise (Vesicare and mirabegron) showed strong growth (+16%). Sales in Japan dropped by 6% however, owing to the NHI price cut and generic competition to off-patent products such as Lipitor, Gaster, Myslee and Seroquel. Meanwhile, the SGLT2 inhibitor Suglat (which was launched in April 2014) had sales of &yen;4.1bn and Xtandi US sales came in well above guidance $803m (versus $690m).</p><p>However, the company provided a modest profit guidance for the next financial year. It expects sales of &yen;1,362bn (up by 9% on the financial year just ended), with core operating profit of &yen;238bn +10%), and core profit of &yen;170bn (+11%). </p><p>"Topline guidance is slightly higher than our estimates (&yen;1,351bn) and consensus (&yen;1,331bn) but core-operating guidance is lower than our estimates (&yen;263bn) and consensus (&yen;259bn). An increase in co-promotion fees for Xtandi in the US and an increase in R&D costs seem to be the main reasons," noted Jefferies analysts.</p><p><b>Shionogi</b></p><p>Shionogi reported sales of &yen;274bn for the financial year ending 31 March, which was a 5% decrease on the previous year. Operating profit was down by 19% to &yen;50.4bn, however ordinary income jumped by 25% to &yen;78bn mainly due to a big dividend increase from its HIV joint venture with GSK and Pfizer, ViiV Healthcare. Net profit was up 9% to &yen;44bn. These numbers were in-line with the recently raised guidance.</p><p>As with Astellas, domestic sales dropped due to the NHI price reduction and generic erosion. They were down 4% on last year. Overseas sales were 16% down as the income associated with the sale of pediatric products and sales of Naprelan, which were divested, were included in the previous year.</p><p>On future guidance, the company is projecting solid growth for the next financial year. The company expects sales of &yen;296bn (+8%) and operating profit of &yen;72.5bn (+44%).</p><p>"Topline guidance is in line with our estimates (&yen;310bn) and consensus (&yen;296bn) but operating profit guidance is higher than our estimates (&yen;70.1bn) and well-above consensus (&yen;62.4bn)," noted Jefferies, which plans to review its numbers after meeting with the company.</p><p><b>Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (SDP)</b></p><p>SDP reported sales of &yen;371bn for the 12 months ending 31 March, which were 4% down on the previous 12-month period. Operating profit stood at &yen;23bn, down 45%, while ordinary income was down 43% at &yen;23bn. Net profit was &yen;15bn, a drop of 23.0% year-on-year. The numbers were in line with consensus figures.</p><p>In addition to the NHI price cut impact and generic erosion, SDP was hit by lower sales of Lunesta (down 82%) due to the loss of market exclusivity in April 2014. This was partially offset by solid sales of Latuda (+78.5%). </p><p>Takeda last week <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Another-Latuda-setback-as-Takeda-exits-alliance-358297" target="_new">ended an alliance</a> with SDP for Latuda (lurasidone). The companies terminated a March 2011 license agreement under which Takeda had jointly developed and was exclusively commercializing Latuda and other lurasidone-containing products in Europe.</p><p>Dainippon issued guidance for the next financial year that was "significantly lower than our estimates and consensus, mainly due to an increase in R&D expense for late stage programs," noted Jefferies. The company anticipates sales of &yen;392bn (+6% year-on-year), with operating profit of &yen;27bn (+16.0%), and ordinary income of &yen;26.5bn (+14%). "Top-line guidance is consistent with our estimate (&yen;391.9bn), in line with consensus (&yen;388.4bn) but operating profit guidance is significantly lower than our estimates (&yen;37.3bn) and consensus (&yen;34.6bn). The company projects a better gross margin than us, but higher R&D budget (&yen;87bn vs. ours &yen;75.2bn)."</p><p><b>Takeda preview</b></p><p>Takeda will report its full year results on 15 May, and has said there will be some discrepancies to previously forecast figures.</p><p>Revenues are expected to be slightly higher, at around &yen;1,725bn (versus &yen;1,725bn). This is due to stronger growth of new products such as Entyvio for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, better resilience of Colcrys for gout in the US, and also further weakening of the yen.</p><p>Profit lines, however, will be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Takeda-offers-2.4bn-no-fault-settlement-Of-Actos-suits-358108" target="_new">impacted by a provision</a> to cover the US Actos settlement. </p><p>On the other hand, the estimated amount to be covered by product liability insurance is booked as an asset. The net of these two items will be recognized as other operating expenses. Negative effect to operating profit is approximately &yen;270bn, and to net profit is approximately &yen;180bn.</p><p>As a result of all of these factors, the latest estimate is &yen;130bn in operating loss (versus previous estimates of +&yen;170bn), &yen;145bn in loss before income tax (versus +&yen;160bn), and a net loss of &yen;145bn (versus +&yen;65bn).</p>
