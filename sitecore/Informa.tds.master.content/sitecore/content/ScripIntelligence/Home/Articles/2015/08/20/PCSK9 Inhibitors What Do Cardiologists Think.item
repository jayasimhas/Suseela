<p>Cardiologists appear confident of both the efficacy and safety of the new PCSK9 inhibitors, even ahead of their cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) data, a new survey by BioMedTracker has found. </p><p>The findings should make reassuring reading for Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen who are now debuting their products <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab) and <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab) following their recent/imminent EU and US approvals. Both products are now in CVOT studies to test their longer-term safety and efficacy. </p><p>Praluent came first to market in the US in late July, but Regeneron senior vice-president of commercial Robert Terifay said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Regeneron-Warns-of-Slow-Praluent-Uptake-While-Eylea-Fuels-Growth-359771" target="_new">during the company's Aug. 4 earnings</a> call that the companies were distributing free samples of Praluent to patients who are awaiting insurance coverage decisions, and that this would make it harder to assess uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor. The launches are being closely watched to see how the market and payers will react to this potential blockbuster class of an injectable cholesterol lowerers. Both companies have consistently warned that they believe uptake will be gradual, in part because of lengthy reimbursement decisions and insurers' utilization management strategies, and also because of patient and physician hesitancy to switch to biologics. </p><p>BioMedTracker surveyed 23 cardiologists to find their attitudes towards the PSCK9 class, their projected usage of the drugs before their CVOT data become available and depending on insurance authorization, their preference for one drug over the other, and how oral CETP inhibitors could impact PSCK9 usage. </p><p>They found that the cardiologists had a substantial proportion of patients still above the HDL-C goals of 70mg/dl and 100mg/dl and so had need of new hypolipemic products. </p><p>The survey found 74% were at least moderately confident that the LDL-C changes seen with the PCSK9 inhibitors would lead to an outcomes benefit, and 52% were at least moderately confident they were safe, which would increase to 78% if the CVOTs demonstrated safety. </p><p>"It is interesting, though, that even with the CVOT results, a minority would still not be very confident in safety and 43% only moderately confident. This could be because the long-term consequences of very low LDL-c or safety in general could take years to truly assess," said BioMedTracker researchers. </p><h2>Praluent Vs Repatha</h2><p>While still early days, it looks like Praluent will have the edge prior to the CVOT data becoming available, taking about 62% of usage. This is likely due to lower the availability of a lower dose of Praluent (75 mg every two weeks) while Repatha is dosed at 140 mg every two weeks, which is similar to Praluent's higher approved dose (150 mg every two weeks). </p><p>However, this could all change when the CVOT data are revealed, if they are shown to be safe even when producing very low LDL-C levels or, indeed, if it seems that lower is better in term so efficacy, BioMedTracker said. </p><p>Another confounder will be whether insurers require pre-authorization for the PCSK9 inhibitors and what documentation they might insist on. The cardiologists surveyed said that, before the CVOT data, there would likely be limited use (about 26%) of the products in those with LDL-C over 70mg/ml if pre-authorization was needed. This average increased to 40% if no pre-authorization was needed, though the projections varied a great deal, BioMedTracker notes.</p><h2>What About The CETPs?</h2><p>The injected PCSK9 inhibitors are likely to face competition from the oral CETP inhibitors (Merck & Co's anacetrapib and Eli Lilly's evacetrapib), once their CVOT data are in, and the cardiologists surveyed indicated that any changes in their use of the PCSK9s would depend on the strength of the CETP inhibitor effects on CV event rates. </p><p>If the CETP inhibitor reduction in events was only half that as the PCSK9 inhibitors (as might be expected for some of the CETP inhibitor candidates if their benefit was primarily from LDL-c reduction rather than HDL-c increase), it would not change usage of PCSK9 inhibitors a great deal. </p><p>However, if CETP inhibitors had a similar reduction in CV events, the usage of PCSK9 inhibitors was projected to be almost cut in half in clinical ASCVD patients with LDL-C over 70 mg/dl), although opinions did diverge. </p><p>For full details of the survey, see <a href="http://www.biomedtracker.com/ReportDetail.cfm?ReportID=637" target="_new">Sagient's BioMedtracker</a>. </p><p><p>
