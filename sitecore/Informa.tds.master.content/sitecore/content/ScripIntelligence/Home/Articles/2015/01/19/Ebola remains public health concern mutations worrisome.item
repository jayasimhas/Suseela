<p>Genomic changes, or "drifting," of the particular strain of the Ebola virus spreading in West Africa could lessen the effectiveness of three types of experimental medicines that are being developed to fight the disease, researchers reported.</p><p>This comes as an emergency committee on Ebola of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak in West Africa continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, even though the spread of the virus has been tapering off somewhat in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in recent weeks.</p><p>The WHO initially deemed the situation in West Africa a public health emergency this past August, renewing that declaration three more times since (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-declares-Ebola-international-public-health-emergency-353262" target="_new">08 August 2014</a>).</p><p>About 22,000 people in West Africa have been infected with Ebola, with more than 8,600 dying of the disease during the current outbreak, which was sparked by one case in Guinea in December 2013.</p><p>While there initially was little interest by the drug and vaccine industry to get involved in developing products against Ebola &ndash; with the disease deemed by one WHO official as a "market failure" &ndash; now there are several products in the works (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-defends-Ebola-actions-condemns-worlds-failures-356174" target="_new">16 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/WHO-chief-blasts-biopharma-over-Ebola-failures-354828" target="_new">04 November 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-A-market-failure-353355" target="_new">13 August 2014</a>).</p><p>But researchers from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Center for Genome Sciences (USAMRIID), Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the evolution of the Ebola virus is undergoing, as it is transmitted from human to human, may impede the effectiveness of Mapp Biopharmaceutical's three-drug monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals' experimental small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment TKM-Ebola and Sarepta Therapeutics investigational phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer AVI-7537.</p><p>The three experimental medicines have shown promise in treating Ebola in animal testing but have yet to prove themselves in clinical trials (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-gambles-24.9m-to-speed-Ebola-drug-ZMapp-353682" target="_new">3 September 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-drug-ZMapp-100-effective-in-monkeys-353643" target="_new">1 September 2014</a>, 21 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tekmira-siRNA-drug-protects-against-Ebola-like-virus-353481" target="_new">August 2014</a>).</p><p>Although the strain of Ebola that has caused the outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is known as Zaire, the mutated variant has been dubbed Makona (EBOV/Mak). </p><p>But ZMapp, TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537, or earlier versions of those drugs, were designed specifically against sequences derived from variants that caused smaller outbreaks in 1976 or 1995, known as Yambuku-Mayinga or Kikwit (EBOV/Kik), respectively, the researchers said in an article published this week in the scientific journal mBio.</p><p>In comparing the variant strains, the scientists identified 600 mutations. </p><p>Of the mutations that occurred in the genetic sequences targeted by the experimental therapeutics, they found 10 new mutations, which they said might interfere with the mechanisms of the sequence-based drugs &ndash; ZMapp, TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537. </p><p>The researchers noted that three of the mutations appeared during the current West African outbreak. </p><p>"The virus has changed and is continuing to change," said Dr Jeffrey Kugelman, a viral geneticist at USAMRIID and the paper's first author. </p><p>The results of the evaluation, the researchers said, suggest the efficacy of the drugs developed against Ebola should be reevaluated against the currently circulating strain.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
