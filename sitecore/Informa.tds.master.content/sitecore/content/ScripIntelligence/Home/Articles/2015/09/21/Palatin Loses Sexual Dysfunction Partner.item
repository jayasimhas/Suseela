<p><p>Just weeks after the approval of the first female sexual dysfunction drug, a competitor is facing problems with its own treatment for the issue. Palatin Technologies announced its partner, Gedeon Richter, has decided to part ways and return the drug back to Palatin. </p><p>The pair signed a licensing agreement for bremelanotide in August 2014 for co-development and commercialization in the EU. Palatin received $9.8m in upfront payments, as well as $3.1m in milestone payments when it initiated Phase III trials. </p><p>The subcutaneous drug entered late-stage trials in December 2014 and results are anticipated in mid-2016. Bremelanotide is a synthetic peptide analog of the naturally occurring hormone alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone). The drug is meant to be an on-demand treatment for female sexual dysfunction and not for chronic use. </p><p>The drug has a storied past; Palatin originally intended an intranasal version to be a treatment for male sexual dysfunction, but side effects like elevated blood pressure put a wrench in development. The company switched to the subcutaneous formulation in 2010. </p><p>The female sexual dysfunction market has been a topic of discussion since Sprout Pharmaceuticals faced an FDA decision for its own pill, Addyi (filbanserin). While <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bumps-May-Grind-Female-Sex-Pills-Sales-360016" target="_new">approved in August</a> and expected to launch in October, the drug has raised concerns about safety &ndash; prompting a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and a black box warning. The approval of Addyi has also prompted discussion about the potential market size &ndash; something that will likely remain unclear until these drugs hit the market. </p><p><p>
