<p>The European Medicines Agency earlier this week granted accelerated assessment to Takeda Pharmaceutical's late-stage multiple myeloma therapy, ixazomib, and the drug maker has big plans for its latest cancer product. </p><p>The EMA's scientific committee, the CHMP, has given Takeda's product accelerated assessment for used in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The accelerated assessment procedure is a relatively new initiative for the European regulator and it is granted to medicines deemed to be of major public health interest and, in particular, therapeutic innovation.</p><p>Ixazomib, a second generation small molecule proteasome inhibitor, has not yet been filed for regulatory assessment in Europe but Takeda expects to follow with this action "in the coming weeks." </p><p>However, Dr Mike Vasconcelles, senior vice-president and head of Takeda's oncology therapeutic unit, told <i>Scrip, </i>"This accelerated assessment is a reasonable indication of how the EMA views the potential of this product for patients with multiple myeloma in the refractory setting."</p><p>He noted that multiple myeloma remains an area of unmet need in Europe and the rest of the world. "We are at an important time in the treatment of this disease because there are quite a few therapies available but it's still a disease that is incurable," Dr Vasconcelles said. "We have products in development with strong data that show, when used with existing regimens, the drugs have meaningful improvements in progression free survival."</p><p>He highlighted that working closely with European regulators at an earlier stage for this product was important to get the drug to patients sooner. "This is exactly the sort of scenario where we want to do everything we can, working together, to get these products to patients," Dr Vasconcelles said. </p><p>The accelerated approval is also an important step further into Europe for Takeda, a Japanese firm, which last year saw the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Takeda-overhauls-management-under-Webers-leadership-354077" target="_new">appointment of its first non-native CEO</a>, Christophe Weber. </p><p>"Takeda has a relatively long history in oncology but this has been more pronounced in the US. More recently we had the opportunity to bring cancer therapy Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) forward to European patients and others globally, outside of the US. But ixazomib will be an important global launch for Takeda," Dr Vasconcelles said. </p><p>Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer with approximately 39,000 new cases in the EU and 114,000 new cases globally per year. However, recently the EMA seems to have stepped up its attempts to see new, innovative products reach the market. Earlier this week, the regulator also granted an accelerated assessment pathway to Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie for their relapsed multiple myeloma product Empliciti (elotuzumab). </p><h2>how will ixazomib compete?</h2><p>Although oncology is a competitive market space, Takeda said its multiple myeloma product had a promising future ahead. The drug has been tested in Phase III trials in combination with standard treatment of lenalidomide and dexamethasone. However, it is being studied as an oral formulation, meaning that the three-drug regimen can be taken entirely in oral dosage. Dr Vasconcelles said this was one way the product was differentiated from its peers. "We have a three drug regimen but it's all oral. The added burden to patients is small: three pills a month. One pill a week with a week of rest."</p><p>He added, "This is a disease affecting mainly older adults and the median age of diagnosis is in the mid-60s. In the refractory setting, these are patients that have been living with their disease for a while. This is their second or third regimen. With this product the physician has the chance to sit down and talk about an all-oral regimen that is relatively easy to administer, and properly monitor, and then the opportunity of course to discuss the clinical benefit."</p><p>Dr Vasconcelles hopes this benefit will be recognized by regulators. </p><h2>first launch</h2><p>Ixazomib has been filed already in the US, but Dr Vasconcelles told <i>Scrip</i> the company did not know where the product might be approved first &ndash; the US or Europe. He said the filings were both on track in a "parallel" way. "It will just be the speed with which the dossiers are reviewed to determine which might get approval first."</p><p>The firm's best estimate for a first launch of ixazomib in either region is mid-2016 and Dr Vasconcelles said that the company was prepared for two launches to happen simultaneously. "Our brand team is putting in a tremendous amount of energy to support a relatively near-term launch of this product. If there is an overlap in US and European approvals, then that will be just fine with us," he said. "This is the most important launch for Takeda for the coming year. All eyes are on it."</p><h2>nature of prior therapies query</h2><p>A question that has occurred in the past when interim data for ixazomib has been released is the number and nature of the prior therapies before the drug can be used. </p><p>Dr Vasconcelles commented to <i>Scrip</i>, "The way the population was designed for the Phase III clinical studies patients had to receive at least one and up to three prior therapies before enrolment into the trial. Upon approval, we would hope that the product would gain this same indication of 1-3 prior therapies."</p><h2>other indications, expanded use</h2><p>Takeda is already at work researching expanded use of ixazomib in other areas of multiple myeloma therapy, as well as in other indications. </p><p>The firm has a Phase III trial ongoing to test the drug as a maintenance therapy for relapsed multiple myeloma, as well as a Phase III study in post-transplant myeloma patients. Dr Vasconcelles hopes, because of the profile seen so far with ixazomib treatment, that the drug will be the first proteasome inhibitor to be successfully used as a long-term maintenance treatment. </p><p>"We know there are current regimens that can result in high levels of response but they come with certain toxicities or complications with administration that limit the duration of the therapy. But we also know that if you can deepen the response over time it translates into better clinical outcomes," he explained. "We hope to be able to show that ixazomib has an effect on progression and overall survival through maintenance use. It's very exciting."</p><p>Dr Vasconcelles said that across the spectrum of multiple myeloma treatment, there was an ixazomib trial ongoing in almost all areas. "You will probably find an ixazomib trial that is being undertaken to answer important clinical questions, in a way that no other proteasome therapy has yet," he said. </p><p>Outside of multiple myeloma, ixazomib is being studied in a number of clinical trials including: a Phase III study in amyloidosis; a Phase II study in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); and Phase I trials in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL), lupus nephritis and solid tumors.</p>
