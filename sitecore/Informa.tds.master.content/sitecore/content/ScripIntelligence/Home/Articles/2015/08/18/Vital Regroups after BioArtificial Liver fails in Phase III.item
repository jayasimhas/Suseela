<p>Vital Therapies, Inc. is assessing its options for moving forward with its stem cell-based bio-artificial liver therapy, ELAD, after the VTI-208 pivotal trial failed to meet its primary endpoint.</p><p>ELAD is an extracorporeal human cell-based liver support system that has received "orphan designation" in both the US and Europe for the treatment of patients with acute liver failure.</p><p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01471028" target="_new">VTI-208</a> is the San Diego company's phase III randomized, controlled, open-label trial of the ELAD system in patients with alcohol-induced liver decompensation. Results announced August 21 show that there was no statistically significant difference between treated and control subjects for the primary endpoint &ndash; overall survival through at least 91 days.</p><p>"We are disappointed by the results of this trial as we did not achieve our primary or secondary endpoints. However, we are continuing our analysis of this very complex dataset and, at this time, we are hopeful that we can find a way forward that can lead to an eventual marketing approval for ELAD based on a new trial in the appropriate patient population," Vital Therapies CEO Terry Winters said during an August 21 conference call. "This will take time to define, requiring in depth analysis and discussions with numerous parties including the FDA, our clinical investigators and advisors."</p><h2>Finding The Right Patient Subset</h2><p>With $62.0m in current cash, Vital Therapies believes it could run a new trial without raising additional capital, but that will depend on the design of the trial and what the FDA recommends. Winters did not offer specifics on how the company would fund a new trial, but indicated the company will have to be restructured. "We plan to size the company appropriately in order to enable the completion of a redesigned clinical trial without raising additional capital," Winters said. "We've also been focusing on doing a lot of other things in preparation of marketing [ELAD] and we would cease most of those things as well [to fund a new trial.]"</p><p>To conserve cash, Vital Therapies will suspend the ongoing VTI-210 trial, which was evaluating ELAD in patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, as well as the VTI-212 trial, which was evaluating ELAD in patients with acute liver failure. </p><p>The company says it plans to meet with the FDA as soon as possible to discuss restructuring its clinical development program and the possibility of launching a new trial focused on the patient subsets from VTI-208 that appeared most likely to benefit from ELAD therapy. </p><p>Prespecified subset analysis from VTI-208 show that the survival benefit of ELAD versus standard therapy almost reached statistical significance among patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score under 28, near the median MELD score for all patients in the trial. A meld score of 28 correlates to a 46% chance of surviving 90 days. However, in patients with MELD scores over 28 &ndash; indicating kidney injury and a slow prothrombin time &ndash; at baseline the outcomes appeared to be worse in the ELAD group compared with the control group, so the company will only focus on the patients with sub-28 MELD scores from now on. </p><p>The preliminary data from the trial also showed that younger patients &ndash; those younger than the median age in the trial of 49.6 years &ndash; had better outcomes with ELAD, while older patients did better on standard therapy than with ELAD therapy. The data also suggest that patients with acute kidney injury or evidence of severe coagulopathy are poor candidates for ELAD therapy. "Going forward, we'll take steps to eliminate these patients from enrollment in our pivotal trials, further enriching the population by excluding patients who are not likely to benefit from ELAD therapy," Winters said.</p><p>"It appears that in the VTI-208 study, the positive effects [of ELAD] observed in the population with a MELD score less than 28 may have been offset by the negative impact of [age, acute kidney damage, etc] to give an overall result with no impact on survival," he said. "Indeed, these effects appear to be additive." </p><p>Winters also pointed out that the 91-day overall survival in the control group was higher than the investigators had estimated, based on published literature, when they designed the trial. Winters suggested that control group patients may have received additional therapy not permitted by the trial protocol. Also, the patients in the trial may have had better survival rates than what was predicted by the scientific literature because trial patients received weekly visits from a nurse during the study follow-up period to minimize bias, as specified by the regulatory authorities, and the study excluded patients with end-stage liver disease or serious comorbidities, Winters pointed out.</p><p>"We continue to see an exciting opportunity for ELAD. From the VTI-208 trial, we know much more about ELAD and how it may be able to impact survival in specific patient populations," Winters said. "We have more to learn from these results but we believe we are gaining knowledge about the population that could benefit from ELAD."</p><p><b>FDA Had Misgivings About Trial Design</b></p><p>When the disappointing trial results were announced at 4 pm ET on August 21, the Vital Therapeutics' stock price on NASDAQ immediately plummeted from $17.68 to $4.20. </p><p>However, there had been early warning signals from the company that VTI-208 could go pear-shaped. In the company's <a href="http://ir.vitaltherapies.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-14-215136&CIK=1280776" target="_new">quarterly reports</a> since it <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/IN-VIVO/32/10/Deals-Shaping-The-Medical-Industry-November-2014?result=1&total=24&searchquery=%253fq%253dvital%252520and%252520elad" target="_new">went public in April 2014</a>, the firm has repeatedly warned that "the FDA has noted its view that preliminary clinical evidence, at this time, does not indicate that the ELAD System may demonstrate a substantial improvement over standard-of-care."</p><p>Furthermore, the company warned investors that "the FDA has expressed concern about the open-label design of study VTI-208, our pivotal study in [alcohol-induced liver decompensation], and the need to apply a consistent standard-of-care and to standardize post-discharge care, both being issues that could significantly confound the study results, impact morbidity and mortality and cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to require that we repeat clinical trials with different trial designs."</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="http://www.clinica.co.uk/" target="_new">Clinica Medtech Intelligence</a>.
