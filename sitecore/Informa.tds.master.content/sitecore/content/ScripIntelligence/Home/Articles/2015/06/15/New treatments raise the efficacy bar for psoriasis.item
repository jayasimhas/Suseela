<p>The therapeutic success of novel therapies for psoriasis, notably the anti-IL17a therapies such as Lilly's ixekizumab and Novartis's Cosentyx (secukinumab), are pushing back the treatment frontiers in the disease, and mean that the efficacy bar for new treatments needs to be raised, experts say. </p><p>The comments accompany the full publication online on 10 June of two pivotal Phase III studies of ixekizumab in <i>The Lancet</i>. The UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 clinical studies in more than 2,500 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis found ixekizumab to be significantly better than the mainstay anti-TNF therapy Enbrel (etanercept) and placebo on all measures of skin clearance looked at. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Lilly-takes-its-turn-in-the-IL-17-psoriasis-data-game-353499" target="_new">Lilly released the top-line data last August</a> and regulatory filings are due shortly.</p><p>In the UNCOVER trials, the co-primary efficacy endpoints were the proportions of patients achieving a static physician global assessment score of 0 or 1 (sPGA 0/1), and achieving a 75% or greater improvement in the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) at week 12. However, success was also seen in the even more stringent PASI-90 and -100 measures (ie, 90% and 100% reduction) that were also tested. </p><p>Of the patients receiving ixekizumab every two weeks, 71% in UNCOVER-2 and 68% in UNCOVER-3 achieved PASI 90, while 41% and 38% achieved PASI 100 in the two trials respectively.</p><p>Of those patients receiving ixekizumab every four weeks, the figures were 60% and 65% achieving PASI 90 in UNCOVER 2 and 3 respectively, with 31% and 35% achieving PASI 100. </p><p>The corresponding figures for etanercept in the two trials were 19% and 26% for PASI 90, and 5% and 7% for PASI 100. </p><h2>robust</h2><p>The successful UNCOVER data followed similarly positive head-to-head data for Novartis's lead anti-IL17 product Cosentyx which became the first to market in this new class of anti-inflammatories in late 2014/early 2015. As such they provide "a second set of robust evidence" that blocking IL17 leads to better efficacy than the well-established etanercept, says Herv√© Bachelez of Department of Dermatology, AP-HP H&ocirc;pital Saint-Louis, in Paris, France. </p><p>He adds that a "collateral, but far from anecdotal, effect" of the high efficacy seen with ixezizumab is an ongoing shift in current treatment objectives for moderate to severe psoriasis. "The 90% skin clearance threshold could now be preferentially advocated as a new, reachable frontier instead of 75% clearance for the treatment of this severe disease with its multiple effects on health, because the former clinical response status is associated with a probability of showing no disease-specific effect on daily quality of life."</p><p>He continues: "Despite the short timeframes of the UNCOVER-2 and UNCOVER-3 studies, efficacy results with interleukin-17 inhibitors could lead to reconsideration of treatment goals in patients with severe psoriasis, bringing the potential of complete or almost complete skin clearance for many patients."</p><p>However, Dr Bachelez sounds a note of caution about the safety profiles of these new products, especially as IL-17 plays a role in the homoeostatis of several organs and in protection against pathogens, fungal and bacterial. "In keeping with these models is the higher incidence of infection in patients given ixekizumab than in those given etanercept, and a few observations of non-invasive <i>Candida </i>spp infection in patients given ixekizumab (eight in patients receiving ixekizumab every two weeks, four in patients receiving ixekizumab every four weeks, five in those receiving etanercept, and one in a patient receiving placebo), which were also reported in the secukinumab trial."</p><p>Other concerns include the worsening of inflammatory bowel disease in two high-dose patients but this is compensated for by a reassuring cardiovascular profile, he adds. </p><p>Overall though the data "provide an appealing picture of the short-term risk/benefit profile of ixekizumab in severe psoriasis, but he stresses the need to more safety data. "Since a large proportion of patients with severe psoriasis are not eligible for clinical trials because of comorbidities that could affect both efficacy and safety, it will be mandatory to investigate interleukin-17 inhibitors in large post-marketing registries with minimum dropout rates, to draw a reliable picture of the benefits and risks in real life populations."</p><p>Indeed, safety has come to the fore with this class following Amgen's decision to pull out of the co-development with AstraZeneca of brodalumab following concerns over suicidal ideation and behavior. This product appears to have a slightly broader mechanism of action than its rivals, blocking IL-17F and IL-25. </p><p>The class is also being investigated for use in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, although brodalumab and secukinumab have been halted for rheumatoid arthritis. </p><p><p>
