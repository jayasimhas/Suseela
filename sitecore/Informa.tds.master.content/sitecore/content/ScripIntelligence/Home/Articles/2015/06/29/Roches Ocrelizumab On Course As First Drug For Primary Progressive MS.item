<p>Roche/Genentech's new multiple sclerosis drug ocrelizumab is the first to demonstrate efficacy against primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), according to data from the pivotal Phase III ORATORIO study. About 1 in ten people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS, and there are currently no drugs approved for the condition.</p><p>"There is a huge unmet need in PPMS," Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Daniel Chancellor told <i>Scrip</i>. "Patients' symptoms, function and quality of life deteriorates from the onset of their disease and there are no available drug treatment options for them." This is despite the huge advances in disease-modifying drugs that are effective for RRMS (relapsing remitting MS), where they reduce the frequency of relapses and slow the accumulation of disability, he notes.</p><p>In a brief press release on Sept. 28, Roche said the ORATORIO study met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the progression of clinical disability sustained for at least 12 weeks compared with placebo, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).</p><p>The positive study results observed with ocrelizumab in both people with PPMS (ORATORIO) as well as those with relapsing forms of MS (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bravo-for-Roches-multiple-sclerosis-drug-in-Phase-III-OPERA-studies-359198" target="_new">OPERA I and OPERA II</a>) "validate the hypothesis that B cells are central to the underlying biology of the disease," said Roche.</p><p>"Ocrelizumab is unique compared to all other drugs on the market and in the pipeline in that it will be effective for the whole spectrum of MS patients, including RRMS and PPMS," explains Chancellor. "I would also include those RRMS patients that go on to develop a progressive disease course, and are subsequently diagnosed as SPMS (secondary progressive MS) patients."</p><p>Top-line data from the ORATORIO study will be presented as a late-breaking abstract at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) meeting on Oct. 10th in Spain. Phase III data from OPERA I and OPERA II will also be presented during the meeting.</p><p>Roche plans to pursue marketing authorization for ocrelizumab in relapsing MS and in PPMS. Data from the OPERA I and II studies and from the ORATORIO study will be submitted to global regulatory authorities in early 2016.</p><p>Chancellor believes that if approved, ocrelizumab's biggest competitor will be Tysabri (Biogen's natalizumab), an established high-efficacy, second-line treatment with annual sales of approximately $1.5bn.</p><p>Biogen has not yet tested Tysabri for PPMS, although the company could report results later this year from its ASCEND trial in SPMS patients, which might have some read-through on Tysabri's potential efficacy for PPMS. "Ocrelizumab's advantages over Tysabri are its confirmed positive effect for PPMS and potentially comparable efficacy for RRMS. As more patients receive ocrelizumab we will know more about its relative safety profile, which is also a very important consideration," says Chancellor.</p><p>Tysabri has been linked with the potentially fatal neurodegenerative condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), although the risk can be mitigated by testing for the JC virus. </p><p>"Ocrelizumab has not yet caused cases of PML, although this was also the case with Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), where cases are only just being discovered as the number of exposed patients grows." Ocrelizumab does carry an increased risk of serious infections, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Roche-and-Biogen-Idec-discontinue-ocrelizumab-for-RA-289424" target="_new">stopped its development as a rheumatoid arthritis</a> treatment. </p><p><b>Ofatumumab</b></p><p>GlaxoSmithKline <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-Sees-Real-Value-Of-Ofatumumab-In-MS-Pays-GSK-Up-To-1Bn-360059" target="_new">recently divested its rights to ofatumumab</a> (marketed as Arzerra in oncology indications) in autoimmune indications, including multiple sclerosis, to Novartis (which had previously acquired the oncology rights). The deal could be worth up to $1.034bn to GSK.</p><p>"Ofatumumab shares the same mechanism as ocrelizumab and so this news is positive too for Novartis," says Chancellor. Novartis had hoped to extend the label for Gilenya (fingolimod) to include PPMS, but its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Novartiss-Gilenya-fails-in-multiple-sclerosis-subgroup-355333" target="_new">INFORMS trial failed</a> late last year. </p><p>"At the moment it is too early to compare ofatumumab with ocrelizumab, though Roche likely has a large head start on Novartis here," concluded Chancellor. </p><p><b>ORATORIO and ocrelizumab</b></p><p>ORATORIO is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, global multi-center study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab (600 mg administered by intravenous infusion every six months; given as two 300 mg infusions two weeks apart) compared with placebo in 732 people with PPMS.</p><p>Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. Earlier studies suggest ocrelizumab binds to CD20 cell surface proteins expressed on certain B cells, but not on stem cells or plasma cells, and therefore important functions of the immune system may be preserved.</p>
