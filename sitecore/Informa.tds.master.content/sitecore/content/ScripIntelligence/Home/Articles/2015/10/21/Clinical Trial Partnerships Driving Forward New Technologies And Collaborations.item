<p>Consolidation among contract research organizations (CROs), the emergence of disruptive digital technologies and a continuing emphasis on "patient centricity" and risk-based monitoring (RBM) have featured in the news in the past 12 months. </p><p><p>Those factors are expected to remain important in the next 12 months, and will be debated in discussions during Informa Life Sciences' 14th annual "Partnerships in Clinical Trials (PCT)" meeting, to be held in Hamburg, Germany on November 17-19. </p><p><p>Being good at partnering has become a vital skill for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and for companies that provide in-depth services for conducting clinical trials, analysing their outcome and preparing dossiers for regulatory submissions.</p><p><p>That's been particularly true over the past several years, as economic austerity has led pharma companies big and small to try and improve business efficiencies, and to extract synergies by outsourcing various aspects of the drug development process. No one pharmaceutical company can be expert in the diversity of skills now required to develop new medicines, hence the need to collaborate with other companies, and to partner with outsourcing providers.</p><p><p>But the nature of partnerships is also changing. "Partnerships are becoming more focused and more structured," says Biogen's senior director of digital health technologies, Michael Sauter. There's more outsourcing of commodity functions, but not a great appetite to add lots of new relationships either, because they are difficult to manage, he adds.</p><p><p>During the PCT meeting, there will be a plenary session on the partnership landscape, chaired by Eli Lilly's Jean Edwards, procurement director for Europe, Australia and Japan. There will also be discussions on whether RBM will decrease clinical trial costs, lessons to be learned from the fast-tracking of Ebola clinical trials, and lessons from other industry sectors, citing Nestle's outsourcing strategy. Further, the implementation of RBM, the changing role of the clinical research associate (CRA), and the role of "patient centric" trials in improving patient recruitment and retention will be debated.</p><p><p>Over the past 12 months there's been an explosion of interest in all things digital among the clinical trials community, mirroring the success of apps and smartphones in the outside world. Biogen's Sauter will chair a session at the PCT meeting on advances in disruptive technologies, showcasing new innovations in clinical trials including remote monitoring. </p><p><p>For example, the often frustrating search for patients to take part in clinical trials is one of the reasons why well-known US technology company IBM has developed a cognitive computing process, IBM Watson, that could be used to speed patient recruitment. IBM Watson is able to match patient characteristics as recorded in millions of electronic patient records, mostly in the US Mid-West, with the criteria for enrolment in clinical trials, thereby allowing physicians and patients to consider taking part in those trials. </p><p><p>The CRO ICON plc announced Sept. 10 that it would conduct a pilot of the IBM Watson technology in oncology clinical trials. IBM Watson can interpret words and phrases and learn from its interactions, and the technology could well be disruptive, says ICON's chief operating officer Steve Cutler.</p><p><p>"It automates a manual process, increases the ability to identify the right patient for a trial, and if it reduces the recruitment time it could make a major impact on clinical trial costs," Cutler says. Just being involved in a clinical trial has been shown to benefit patients, whether they are in the treated group or not. </p><p><p>The cost of clinical trials is only going up, and we need to change that and lead the way in becoming more efficient and more effective, the ICON executive commented.</p><p><h2>Apple's apps</h2><p><p>Another US technology company Apple launched ResearchKit app software in March 2015 for iPhones that allows researchers to access data from the companion HealthKit app, and is expected to make it easier to recruit participants for large-scale studies.</p><p><p>Digital technologies are also being used in smartphone apps that can help to monitor the progress of clinical trials. In June 2015, Quintiles announced it would launch an Infosario mobile app to give improved access to critical clinical trials information for stakeholders in the drug development process. Researchers and managers will be able to access site start-up statistics, recruitment results and compliance information, Quintiles says.</p><p><p>A further fascinating digital technology advance this year is the development of ingestible pills that can track patient adherence to therapy, developed by Redwood Shores, California-based Proteus Digital Health and its partner, Japan's Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. An NDA for a product combining the sensor with Otsuka's antipsychotic Abilify (aripiprazole) was submitted to the US FDA in September. </p><p><p>The Proteus product involves embedding sensors in tablets that send signals to a patch on the skin once they reach the stomach. The patch records the time of the signal and other data and relays it to the patient or healthcare provider via a mobile device or smartphone. </p><p><p>The product is potentially the first "digital medicine", and Proteus has teamed up with software company Oracle to use that company's electronic data capture technology with the device. It could identify earlier problems with adherence in clinical trials, saving money and quickening the conduct of clinical trials, the companies say. </p><p><h2>M&A Still Hot For CROs</h2><p><p>Another way of improving the efficiency of conducting clinical trials is for CROs to consolidate with similar businesses. In February 2015 the acquisition of the CRO Covance was completed by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) for $6.2bn, creating one of the world's leading healthcare diagnostics and drug development services company. </p><p><p>The merged company has its HQ in Burlington, North Carolina, and has two business units: clinical laboratory services through its LabCorp Diagnostics business, and drug development services through Covance Drug Development. The latter will be headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey.</p><p><p>CRO Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc. has also set up a joint venture with Madison, New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics to merge their global clinical trials laboratory services businesses. </p><p><p>The new business, Q&sup2; Solutions, was launched in July 2015 and is the second-largest central laboratory services company in the world with pro forma sales of more than $500m. Quintiles owns 60% and Quest Diagnostics 40% of the new business. Q&sup2; Solutions' customers include all of the top-20 largest biopharmaceutical companies, and as well as laboratory tests it aims to develop companion diagnostics and novel regulatory and reimbursement strategies.</p><p><p>And completing a round-up of recent M&A activity among CROs, Chiltern closed in September 2015 the acquisition of Theorem Clinical Research, a CRO that was previously a subsidiary of Omnicare but was sold to private equity in 2011. </p><p><h2>In Silico Studies</h2><h2></h2><p>CROs and pharma might eventually incorporate in vitro computer-based "in silico" clinical trials into their work. At the end of September, the Avicenna Consortium released the final version of its "Roadmap for in silico Clinical Trials". </p><p><p>The consortium, consisting of academics and company personnel from around the world, believes computer simulation involving virtual physiological human (VPH) models and in silico clinical trials (ISCTs) will revolutionize the clinical trials process. "In engineering, mathematical modelling is used routinely, while we are not doing the same in biology," says Adriano Henney, director of the VPH Institute for Integrative Research, and a Consortium partner. </p><p><p>"There is a need to show industry is willing to consider such mathematical modelling, and that there is an appetite for an alliance between academia and companies to move the approach forward," Henney says. At some point, regulators may have to be involved, but a regulatory framework would have to be developed first, he adds.</p><p><p>Parexel is making some progress in mathematical modelling, announcing July 9 an expanded capability in the use of mathematical models to predict a drug's benefits and adverse effects. Model-based techniques are increasingly becoming standard in new drug applications, the company said. </p><p><p>Avicenna is a pre-competitive consortium, and during the PCT meeting, speakers will discuss the latest output from another pre-competitive group, the Transcelerate initiative, including the use of RBM and Transcelerate methodology to streamline clinical development. Meeting participants will also discuss bringing patient perspectives to clinical trial design as part of the "patient-centric" movement.</p><p><p>But it's not only patients who are gaining a voice in the clinical trials process &ndash; one CRO, INC Research, has launched what it believes is the first Site Advocacy Group, to allow clinical research sites &ndash; and also patients - to provide insights at the clinical trial design stage. </p><p><p>"Engaging with sites early on and in a meaningful way is critical to enhancing protocol design and study conduct," said Michael Gibertini, INC's president of clinical development, in a statement. It's hoped the research sites will be able to improve the efficiency of the clinical trial process. INC Research is starting with a tough area, psychiatry, a complex therapeutic area where clinical trials are difficult to set up. </p><p><p>There's an underlying theme here: having more thoughtful conversations with others involved in clinical trials, whether they are other pharmaceutical companies, patients, regulators or clinical researchers, is expected to drive change in the clinical trial process. One could even hazard social media will be used to facilitate these conversations. 12 months in the future, the clinical trial landscape could be markedly different from what it is now. </p><p><p>
