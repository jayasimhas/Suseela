<p>In the latest round of the sparring over whether Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) should be used off-label in place of Novartis's more expensive Lucentis (ranibizumab) in wet age-related macular degeneration, the <i>British Medical Journal</i> has published a series of articles suggesting that Novartis hindered UK public clinical trials comparing the two drugs in order to maintain sales of Lucentis.</p><p>Despite a series of studies showing the two products to be equally safe and effective in AMD, and the fact that it is often used off-label in this indication, Roche has never sought a licence for Avastin's use in AMD, the <i>BMJ</i> notes. It cites a number of researchers who claim that Novartis took steps to prevent publicly funded studies being conducted, including raising safety concerns and "methodological issues" with the trials, and discouraging researchers to take part in them.</p><p>A Novartis spokesman told <i>Scrip</i> that it was "important to note that these alleged events took place several years ago". He noted that any concerns about interaction between clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry can be raised directly with the company concerned through the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority or the regulatory bodies. "So we are very surprised to hear of these allegations now," the spokesman said.</p><p>The argument over whether Avastin should be used off-label &ndash; or indeed licensed &ndash; for AMD has been raging for several years now. A key issue is that Roche owns the rights to both Avastin and Lucentis, although Novartis holds the product licence for the latter. Roche benefits from sales of the much more expensive Lucentis, the argument goes, and so it is not in its interest to have Avastin approved for this use. </p><p>Nonetheless, at least six publicly funded trials comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab in wet AMD have now reported their outcomes, and their results were pooled in a meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration last year, the <i>BMJ</i> said. </p><p>"This found no difference in efficacy and no difference in deaths, all serious adverse events, or specific subsets of adverse events with the exception of gastrointestinal disorders," the <i>BMJ</i> said. In the UK, it added, "Roche''s refusal to initiate clinical trials for ophthalmic use of bevacizumab was noted in the House of Commons by then secretary of state for health Patricia Hewitt."</p><h2>IVAN</h2><p>One of the public trials cited by the <i>BMJ</i> is IVAN (randomised controlled trial of alternative treatments to inhibit VEGF in age-related choroidal neovascularisation), which is intended to assess the incremental cost and cost-effectiveness of continuous and discontinuous regimens of bevacizumab and ranibizumab from the NHS perspective.</p><p>However, the <i>BMJ</i> said, there was "resistance to the trial from the outset". It cited Barney Reeves, professorial research fellow in health services research at Bristol University and one of the IVAN trialists, as saying that it was a difficult trial to do politically. "The drug manufacturers didn''t want it done," he said. "Novartis tried to prevent UK ophthalmologists joining the IVAN trial, with their sales representatives lobbying potential principal investigators against the trial and telling them that the IVAN protocol was seriously flawed."</p><p>Emails obtained by the <i>BMJ</i> under a freedom of information request showed that clinicians with ties to Novartis urged some primary care trusts to pull out of the trial and suggested that researchers who took part might lose funding for other trials, the journal said.</p><h2>TANDEM</h2><p>The <i>BMJ</i> also cited the example of another publicly funded trial, TANDEM, which is comparing the efficacy of high-dose versus low-dose bevacizumab as well as monthly versus two-monthly review intervals. This study aims to determine whether a lower dose and less frequent monitoring with Avastin can deliver the same outcomes with fewer side-effects. </p><p>The study is being run by Nottingham University's clinical trials unit. The chief investigator, Alex Foss, a consultant ophthalmologist at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, told the BMJ that during the trial's planning stage he was "encouraged to take on Novartis funded trial work instead of proceeding with the TANDEM trial, with the prospect of future funding for other personal research projects".</p><p>Mr Foss, the journal said, had been invited to meet one of the company's senior medical representatives to discuss the trial, and on 12 March 2009 they met at a local pub. "The representative made it clear that other senior Novartis executives would not support TANDEM, and that Foss must expect 'strong opposition' to the trial."</p><p>The representative said that Novartis would do "everything it could to stop the TANDEM trial and would particularly challenge its ethics", Mr Foss told the <i>BMJ</i>. "He stated that the challenge would not come from Novartis itself but from the RNIB [Royal National Institute of Blind People] which he made clear would support Novartis."</p><p>Asked about the comments regarding its role in supporting Avastin, the RNIB told the BMJ that it had run an advocacy service for patients in partnership with the Macular Society, which had received financial support from Novartis and from Pfizer, the manufacturer of pegaptanib, another AMD treatment, during the NICE appraisal process for ranibizumab. The RNIB also said that it had funded an "urgent judicial review challenge" on behalf of two people with wet AMD who had been refused the treatment recommended by their ophthalmologists before NICE approval.</p><p>In a statement, Novartis said it was "committed to high standards of ethical business conduct. Novartis does not tolerate unethical behavior by its associates in any country, and has a comprehensive compliance program in place to help ensure that our associates comply with the company's Code of Conduct and all applicable laws."</p><p>It added that Lucentis had been assessed by health technology assessment bodies worldwide, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) "who issued positive guidance confirming it as a clinically and cost effective treatment across five therapeutic indications".</p><h2>Wider industry concern </h2><p>As reported recently, efforts are under way elsewhere in Europe to make Avastin available in place of Lucentis for reasons of cost. Last month, France made good on its promise to provide Avastin for AMD under a "temporary use recommendation" (RTU) on the grounds that it is non-inferior to Lucentis in terms of efficacy and has shown "no significant difference" as regards systemic adverse effects. This followed the passing of a law in 2014 allowing the health authorities to issue RTUs even where an approved drug is already available (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/French-revolution-committee-OKs-off-label-Avastin-for-AMD-357480" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 25 March 2015). </p><p>Italy has passed similar legislation, and it is understood that some AMD patients have already been given Avastin. Novartis and Roche have also been fined by the Italian competition authority for alleged collusion to exclude Avastin from the ophthalmology market.</p><p>Concerns have been expressed by the wider pharmaceutical industry, including the European federation EFPIA, that efforts to allow products to be used off-label where suitable treatments already exist, solely to save money, run the risk of undermining the EU drug regulatory system (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Italys-off-label-rule-turns-EU-system-upside-down-says-EFPIAs-Bergstrom-356704" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 11 February 2015). </p><p>In a statement on the <i>BMJ</i> articles, the UK industry body, the ABPI, said that "patient safety is paramount and regulators, like doctors, need to consider the evidence when approving a medicine for use to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks for patients". </p><p>Virginia Acha, the ABPI's research, medical and innovation director, noted that the MHRA and the European Medicines Agency require "rigorous safety testing and have stringent medicines licensing requirements in order to make that judgement. Bypassing that regulatory review leaves risks to the health and wellbeing of patients on the shoulders of prescribers, and so the regulatory and legal framework quite rightly precludes the use of medicines in an unlicensed indication on the grounds of cost alone."</p><p>She continued: "The ABPI firmly believes, and is supported by government in its view, that it is neither in the interests of patient safety nor prudent to set policy for the routine use of medicines unlicensed for treatment on the grounds of cost alone."</p>
