<p>Amgen and Novartis unit Sandoz both decided a ruling last month by a panel of appeals court judges involving the latter firm's biosimilar Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) referenced on the former company's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) was a glass half-empty kind of decision &ndash; with both drug makers seeking a rehearing in front of the full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>Both sides walked away as big winners from the July 21 decision. </p><p>But California-based Amgen and Swiss firm Sandoz were unsatisfied with the portion of the ruling in which they each lost, so they separately filed petitions for an <i>en banc</i> review by the appeals court &ndash; waiting almost until the very last minute to file their briefs on Aug. 20.</p><p>New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter, noted Amgen had not filed any new documents seeking an extension of the injunction preventing Sandoz from launching Zarxio on Sept 2 &ndash; the date the court imposed. </p><p>So come that date, Sandoz appears free to market the biosimilar in the US, he told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Sandoz has, however, requested the Federal Circuit to require a bond from Amgen, on which the Swiss-based biosimilar maker could collect if it ultimately prevailed in the case, Cerwinski pointed out.</p><p><i>Amgen v Sandoz</i> was the first lawsuit to get to the appeals court level in what is expected to be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Fights-Over-Interpretation-Of-Biosimilars-Law-Disruption-To-Markets-Future-359974" target="_new">several cases</a> to test the complexities of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the law that granted the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>At issue in the case, whose <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">oral arguments</a> were heard by the Federal Circuit panel on June 3, was whether Sandoz failed to comply with the disclosure and negotiation procedures outlined in the BPCIA about what patents would be litigated &ndash; often called the "patent dance &ndash; when it withheld its 351(k) biosimilars application and manufacturing information from Amgen.</p><p>Amgen also had accused Sandoz of failing to provide proper notice the biosimilar maker planned to launch its product as soon as it won FDA approval of Zarxio &ndash; a decision that came from the drug agency on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">March 6</a>.</p><p>On the first question, the Federal Circuit panel sided with Sandoz &ndash; declaring in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">2-1 verdict</a> the company and other biosimilar makers could opt out of the patent dance and would not have to disclose their applications and manufacturing details if they chose to do so.</p><p>But on the second question, Amgen prevailed, with the panel ruling 2-1 that when a company opts out of the patent dance, BPCIA's 180-day notice of commercial marketing is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval &ndash; telling Sandoz it could not market Zarxio until Sept. 2.</p><p>Nonetheless, Amgen called the appeals panel's decision "fractured" and said biosimilar applicants should not be permitted to avail themselves of the benefits of the BPCIA, while "deliberately not complying with its information-exchange provisions." </p><p>"The majority decision lets an applicant circumvent the BPCIA's required information exchanges without meaningful consequence," Amgen said in its Aug. 20 rehearing petition.</p><p>Such an outcome, the Thousand Oaks, California-based biotech giant said, was "contrary to the plain language of the statute, and to Congress' intent that the BPCIA provide an integrated framework that balances the obligations and benefits of the applicant and the sponsor."</p><p>The consequences of the majority's ruling on July 21, Amgen said, are "significant, because an applicant that fails to provide the required information violates the 'explicit balance of obligations and benefits' of the BPCIA."</p><p>The company asserted the Federal Circuit panel had erred in holding that when a biosimilar applicant chooses not to engage in the information exchange, a reference product sponsor's sole remedy was to sue for patent infringement or declaratory judgment (DJ).</p><p>"Nothing in the BPCIA makes suing for patent infringement the only remedy available," Amgen contended.</p><p>"In effect, they are arguing that a reference product sponsor has a choice. It can either enforce the dance or it can file an immediate DJ action," Goodwin Procter's Cerwinski said. "It's sort of the flip side of the panel saying the biosimilar applicant has a choice to engage in the dance or not. Amgen is saying here the choice is the reference product sponsors'."</p><p>Amgen insisted in its petition that the harms for not fully complying with the BPCIA, as the company sees it, go well beyond patent infringement &ndash; arguing the "value of innovation, the value of a biologics license and the value to the court system of an orderly, targeted dispute-resolution regime" are jeopardized.</p><p>"To guide this developing industry," Amgen said, the full court should rehear the panel majority's decision and "correct its erroneous conclusion."</p><p>In its petition, Sandoz argued that the Federal Circuit panel's ruling on the 180-day notice after FDA licensure was effectively granting an additional six months of exclusivity protection for all innovator biologics "beyond what Congress expressly provided in the BPCIA."</p><p>And in doing so, the company said, the panel ignored the only remedy provided by Congress in the BPCIA &ndash; the right to initiate patent litigation &ndash; "and instead created a new automatic injunction remedy." </p><p>Sandoz said that while the panel "correctly recognized" the BPCIA has no provision that grants a procedural right to compel compliance with the law's disclosure requirement, the firm said the court "failed to recognize that the BPCIA also provides no right to compel compliance with the 180-day notice provision." </p><p>In fact, Sandoz pointed out, the only measure in that particular subsection of BPCIA that Congress made enforceable by an injunction was the confidentiality provision.</p><p>Essentially, Cerwinski said, the company was saying the Federal Circuit panel was being inconsistent.</p><p>Sandoz concluded a review of the panel's decision by the full court was "needed now," because the issues at hand would be "a live controversy beyond Sept. 2" &ndash; pointing out the company anticipated being a "repeat biosimilar" applicant and "could not secure full appellate review in any future case within the 180-day period at stake."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
