<p> Actavis CEO Brent Saunders has been the head of three different companies in less than two years, but with the $66bn acquisition of Allergan about to close any day now, he told <i>Scrip</i> that he's found the place where he plans to retire. </p> <p> The shareholders of Actavis and Allergan voted in favor of the companies' merger on 10 March and only one more regulator in the EU must approve the transaction. That means the acquisition should close on time in March or April at which time Actavis will become known as Allergan to emphasize the combined company's growing brand-name drug portfolio (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827">19 February 2015</a>). </p> <p> But the Allergan mega-deal probably will be Actavis's last large transformational acquisition for a while and Mr Saunders is eager to emphasize that dealmaking isn't the company's only strong talent. For both Actavis and Allergan, he noted, the third and fourth quarters of 2014 were their strongest performing quarters ever in their histories due to each company's focus on execution of their business plans. </p> <p> <b>On the Allergan acquisition</b> </p> <p> &quot;The least well understood characteristics of Actavis-Allergan is our relentless focus on execution within the portfolio, R&amp;D and the supply chain. The deal focus tends to overshadow execution,&quot; Mr Saunders said. &quot;During the third and fourth quarters we both had dealmaking going on, including a hostile takeover attempt at Allergan, and both companies focused on execution.&quot; </p> <p> The deals &ndash; or attempts to thwart a buyout by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, in Allergan's case &ndash; were being managed and run by 100 to 200 people out of 30,000 employees at Actavis and Allergan. The rest of the companies' employees remained focused on their responsibilities and customers. </p> <p> &quot;Their track record as of late, given all of the distractions, has been impeccable,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p> Actavis was the &quot;white knight&quot; bidder that saved Allergan from an unwanted acquisition by Valeant, which was backed by Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund that purchased enough Allergan stock to make it the company's largest investor (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111">18 November</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeants-54bn-bid-for-Allergan-goes-hostile-352116">3 June 2014</a>). </p> <p> &quot;My view is that a friendly deal will always trump a hostile deal, regardless of who the players are. In this business, it's the people that make the companies and a friendly deal always has an edge over a hostile deal,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p> But any deals that Actavis pursues for the foreseeable future will be much smaller transactions that add products and drug candidates to core therapeutic areas and take advantage of existing sales teams or acquisitions that enhance the company's geographic footprint. </p> <p> In fact, Actavis wasn't looking for another transformational deal when it bought Allergan, but Mr Saunders was tempted by the opportunity anyway. </p> <p> &quot;There are very few times in your professional life where you see a company like Allergan of such high quality that becomes available. Companies with high value brands generally don't come up for sale,&quot; he said. </p> <p> Allergan's portfolio, which generated $7.1bn in 2014 sales versus $6.2bn in 2013, includes the blockbuster wrinkle-reducer and migraine therapy Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) and dry eye therapy Restasis (cyclosporine). </p> <p> &quot;Allergan was built to run [on its own] for the long term and it was only the bid by Valeant that made it available,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p> Could Actavis be tempted soon by another large transaction, even though the company isn't looking for one? Not likely, he said, because to maintain the company's investment-grade credit rating, Actavis must pay off some of its debt first. </p> <p> Also, Mr Saunders noted, &quot;We have to digest the integration of Actavis-Allergan, because it's important to get it right.&quot; </p> <p> <b>On the companies' combination</b> </p> <p> &quot;We have been making the most of the pre-integration period,&quot; Mr Saunders said. &quot;We've spent a lot of time getting to know one another. We have selected the leadership teams upon close. And we've built the synergy capture plans, so that we're ready to execute upon close. We're in a really strong position in terms of being prepared for day one operations.&quot; </p> <p> While they won't be part of the post-merger executive team, Allergan's chairman and CEO David Pyott and president Douglas Ingram have been actively involved in preparing for the integration of their company into Actavis (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Actavis-names-new-senior-management-team-355793">22 December 2014</a>). </p> <p> The combined Actavis-Allergan is expected to achieve $1.8bn in synergies, including $500m of financial and $1.3bn of operational cost savings, even with Actavis's commitment to invest $1.7bn in research and development annually &ndash; a significant amount for a pharma company originally (and still) known as a generic drug maker. Which Allergan R&amp;D programs will remain priorities or be shelved will be decided after the merger closes. </p> <p> &quot;Our goal is to achieve 80% [of the synergies] within first 12 months post-close,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p> Actavis hasn't revealed how many jobs will be cut from Allergan's payroll, but the layoffs will focus first on areas with the most overlap between the two companies &ndash; administrative functions, such as human relations, legal and finance. Cuts from Allergan's commercial and R&amp;D operations also are anticipated. </p> <p> &quot;It's unavoidable in a merger of this size. We're committed to keeping as much top talent as we can,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p> The post-merger layoffs will be on top of 1,500 jobs that Allergan vowed to cut last year (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2Q-EARNINGS-Allergan-boosts-sales-cuts-jobs-provokes-Valeant-352970">22 July</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/982-California-job-cuts-precede-Actavis-Allergan-merger-355401">4 December 2014</a>). </p> <p> <b>On finding a place to retire</b> </p> <p> While several hundred, or maybe more, Allergan employees may find themselves without jobs during the next several months, Mr Saunders isn't going anywhere. </p> <p> &quot;I'm excited about the Actavis-Allergan combination, because of the people I work with and the opportunities we have to build the greatest pharmaceutical company in the world. My career goal is to retire as CEO of [post-merger] Allergan,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not going anywhere; I love my job.&quot; </p> <p> Mr Saunders was CEO of Bausch + Lomb in 2013 when the company was acquired by Valeant for $8.7bn (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-confirms-8.7bn-purchase-of-Bausch--Lomb-343536">28 May 2013</a>). Then he was recruited to run Forest Laboratories, where he executed several strategic acquisitions ahead of its $25bn acquisition by Actavis (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forests-Saunders-ropes-2nd-major-sale-boosts-personal-brand-in-Actavis-deal-350112">19 February 2014</a>). Before that deal closed, Mr Saunders was named president and CEO of Actavis with his predecessor Paul Bisaro &ndash; a dealmaker in his own right &ndash; remaining with the company as chairman of the board (scripintelligence.com, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Forests-Saunders-takes-lead-role-on-Actaviss-new-leadership-team-351859">16 May 2014</a>). </p> <p> &quot;Paul Bisaro was an excellent CEO and is a fantastic chairman. He and I &ndash; not always, but more often than not &ndash; see eye-to-eye on everything. I hope I can do an adequate job in filling his shoes,&quot; Mr Saunders said. &quot;It really is a partnership between he and I. It has really worked out better than we both expected.&quot; </p> <p> There are moments when the current and former Actavis CEOs disagree or debate issues from different points of view, but they always try to reach a consensus based on what's in the best interest of the company. Their views generally were aligned when it came to the Allergan deal, however. </p> <p> &quot;We both saw the strategic fit and alignment, but in terms of how to put the companies together, he was a sounding board. As Paul always does, he gives me his unbiased view, but at the end of the day as CEO I have to make the decisions. Sometimes he says things I don't want to hear and that makes me perhaps a stronger leader,&quot; Mr Saunders said. </p> <p><p>
