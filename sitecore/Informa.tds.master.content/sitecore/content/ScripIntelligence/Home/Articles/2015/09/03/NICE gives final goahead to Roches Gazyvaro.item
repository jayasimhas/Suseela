<p>In its new final appraisal determination, the UK's health technology agency NICE has recommended the routine use on the NHS of Roche's Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab). Specifically, the Rituxan (rituximab) follow-on product has been recommended for use in combination with chlorambucil chemotherapy for the treatment of previously-untreated adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and co-existing medical conditions who are unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy, and only if bendamustine-based therapy is also not suitable. This follows a reversal in December of a previous preliminary guidance that rejected the product because of "uncertainties in the company's submission". The U-turn was based on revised cost-effectiveness analyses submitted by Roche and a patient access scheme. Roche will also provide the product to the NHS at a reduced price. It is estimated that around 22% of intermediate and high risk CLL patients cannot receive fludarabine therapy and receive a regimen combining bendamustine and Rituxan in the first line, meaning that the decision is unlikely to have a huge impact, but it will nonetheless boost sales of the product in advance of the arrival of Rituxan biosimilars in early 2017. </p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NICE-reverses-Gazyvaro-rejection-in-latest-draft-guidance-355358" target="_new">NICE reverses Gazyvaro rejection in latest draft guidance</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-disappoints-Roche-again-with-Gazyvaro-no-354318" target="_new">NICE disappoints Roche again with Gazyvaro no</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Roches-rituximab-follow-on-approved-in-Europe-353083" target="_new">Roche's rituximab follow-on approved in Europe</a></p><p>
