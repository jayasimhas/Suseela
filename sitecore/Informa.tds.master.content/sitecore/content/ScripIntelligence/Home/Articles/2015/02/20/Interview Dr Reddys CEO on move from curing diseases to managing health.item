<p>GV Prasad, CEO of Dr Reddy's Laboratories, does not mince words - whether it is about why the US is probably the ''least risky'' market or then how he's all for the onus of compliance being on the CEO under India's code of marketing practices for the pharmaceutical industry. </p><p>In a wide-ranging interview with <i>Scrip</i> and its sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> at his office in Hyderabad, Prasad also outlines plans for a step up in emerging markets and refers to how the biosimilars game has moved to an ''innovator minus'' model. </p><p>Big picture issues such as how advances in digital health, genomics and sequencing are likely to shake up the healthcare space also engage the DRL boss &ndash; in the past he has referred to why it is, at times, vital to step back from the ''dance floor'' and take a ''balcony'' perspective. </p><h2>The US Business</h2><p><b>Question: </b>At the recent J P Morgan healthcare conference, reference was made to your neurology and dermatology portfolio as a focus area in the proprietary products business<b>. </b></p><p><b>G V Prasad</b>: These will be our proprietary products but we also have a few assets in the hospital care segment but we are not sure if we will focus on that area. We have for example a clinical trial ongoing now for a surgical site infection product where we may not set up the field force so we did a number of things in creating differentiated products but it all broadly fall in three tiers &ndash; dermatology, neurology, largely around migraine, and the third is on hospital products. We are clear to focus on the first two but for the third one, we will monetize as we go forward and it is not a bulk of our effort anymore. We will in license products [in the dermatology and neurology] segments.</p><p><b>Question: </b>That's a big shift in the general way that Indian companies have looked at developing drugs?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> If you look at our subsidiary Aurigene Discovery Technologies that is doing that kind of work in drug discovery. Aurigene announced close relationship with Curis Inc, which is quite a significant and interesting deal. It is an equity relationship and a co-development relationship. The deal brings some rights for Dr Reddy's.</p><p><b>Question: </b>At the same conference, Dr Reddy's referred to its emergence as a leading private label OTC player in the US after Perrigo Co PLC. We have seen activity in the space - 7-Eleven Inc has entered the private-label drug business and partnered with Perrigo. How is this business shaping up?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> The private label OTC market is less profitable than the generic market. There are a few barriers to entry and other companies cannot quickly come in. Significant amount of packaging infrastructure &ndash; all those things are required. The process is not simple and so to that extent it is a good cash flow. It is not going to be a trajectory-changing driver for us but it's a good business to be in. So we are not focused on vitamins, minerals segment and we are only looking at switched products. There are not as many players in OTC as we see in the generics business.</p><p><b>Question: </b>But OTC medication is a $30 billion business and, in some categories, private-brands are said to account for more than 30% of these sales?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> It's not small but it's not huge either, if we take out the vitamins, minerals segment. It's a market with a stable cash flow and not an exciting cash flow. Habitrol is an addition to the OTC business, which actually is a semi-private label.</p><p><b>Question: </b>Any updates on Dr Reddy's polypill because the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee has extended some kind of a cautious support <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-polypill-beats-strong-after-FDA-panel-view-353967%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a><b>.</b>Is it still a long shot?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> I am not sure because you are competing against five generic products versus one product which has generic ingredients and we have to switch, generate prescriptions. We could not figure out the business model for this. We have the product, we have done some work, we have done large clinical trials with The George Institute for Global Health [which is leading commercializing efforts for Dr Reddy's Laboratories polypill in various markets] but we have not been able to monetize it. </p><p><b>Question: </b>You have Aloxi (palonosetron) which has been filed via the 505 (b) (2) route.</p><p><b>GVP:</b> We have both 505 (b) (2) and an ANDA filing for the drug. We are doing NDA filings for our proprietary, differentiated products and some of these are short cuts to get into the generic market but some are actually differentiated products. We are on the verge of filing a couple of NDAs in the next few months. It may happen in the fourth quarter or first quarter of next [financial] year. </p><p><b>Question: </b>How do you see the performance of the PSAI (pharmaceutical services and active ingredients) business?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> We don't think it is fully recovered. It's early days and there are early signals but it will take a year or so to see the vibrancy that we want to see. </p><p><b>Question: </b>The U.S. Congress had initiated a probe on high prices of generic drugs<a href="http://#%5b354301http:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Skyrocketing-US-generic-prices-blame-it-on-compliance-costs-inspection-raj-354349%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 October 2014</a>)Has the issue been settled?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> They asked questions and we answered. No response after that. They have been very logical about it. But we were never setting the prices. There will be a query naturally if the price goes up by 15 times but the flip side to it is that the price is still 1% of the brand price. The US is generally a true free market and I don't expect them to come back and say why did you exploit the situation. It's market capitalism.</p><p><b>Question: </b>What about the generic glatiramer acetate opportunity in the US, in the backdrop of the rapid switch to the 40 mg/mL thrice weekly version of Teva's Copaxone by patients?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> Regulatory issues are still there and getting an approval is the key part of the strategy there. A lot of clarity has emerged in terms of what the regulator wants but approval is the bottleneck. I still feel it is a significant business opportunity.</p><h2>On Biosimilars</h2><p><b>Question: </b>On biosimilars, what are your views on the issue of interchangeability issue? Do you believe Teva may be at a disadvantage doing a 351A application for filgrastim, with Sandoz now getting the backing of an FDA panel for its 351(k) biosimilar biological product application <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-No-meaningful-differences-between-Amgens-Neupogen-Sandoz-biosimilar-355934%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 5 January 2015)</a>..or does Teva have a head-start?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> Incrementally, I don't think anybody has a clear advantage. Both are going to be products that will need detailing or some kind of a payor relationship. How market shares will develop is still up in the air. I don't think we have a view on it. The EU and US are diverging on interchangeability and the game has not played out yet</p><p><b>Question: </b>But Teva's drug is approved in the EU with interchangeability which makes things complex?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> It's not interchangeable, it is equivalent. I think the rules in the game have not played out yet. So it will be premature to say anything but what is emerging is that everybody is going full hog in terms of trial designs and trial size and it is now largely shifting to a Big Pharma model and not a generic plus model. It is an innovator minus model.</p><p>We are aggressively pursuing biosimilars in the key emerging markets where the regulatory pathways seem to be clearer than the US.</p><p><b>Question: </b>Has there been a slowdown in the launch of those products?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> It is largely a little bit of a distraction on trying to servicing the Merck relationship for the first world markets but I think we will soon see one or two products launched. We just got some approvals from the regulator to go to the clinic. We will also launch biosimilar Herceptin and we are looking at the trial now. We are also looking at bevacizumab. As against the earlier plans, we are now approaching these products globally. We used to do trials for India and then launch but now we are looking at it from the emerging markets plus India plans. Our own philosophy has somewhat changed in how we do trials and we are trying to harmonize that. </p><p><b>Question: </b>On the Sandoz side, there was not much clarity on the kind of pricing arbitrage that we may see?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> The product cannot be priced too low because if you see Sandoz, Merck KGAA, Boehringer Ingelheim, it is a $150 million trial for a large molecule, it may be less for a smaller molecule. They look at the trial designs like rituximab it could be quite high. So we still have to watch the space. </p><p><b>Question: </b>Some innovator firms have indicated that even in the tender business, the acceptance for biosimilars has been low in certain markets, plus limited uptake overall. Your views ?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> I think it's too early to make such conclusions. It's not a very competitive market yet, regulations are not very clear, it's evolving even in emerging markets. Some companies are strictly going by US and EU standards, some companies are being more pragmatic. </p><p>In my view the tender market uptake is faster but in the self-paid and prescription market, the uptake is slower. Tender is driven on price&#8230;if there is a viable product approved, equivalent, it quickly switches. Tender uptake is not bad. If you classify emerging markets where tenders are there, uptake will be much faster &ndash; Latin America, Middle East, various countries. The whole challenge is getting the registration.</p><h2>India and Emerging Markets Business</h2><p><b>Question: </b>Could you elaborate on Dr Reddy's value-added services such as CHEER (Committed to Help Educate and Encourage Renal Patients)? What is it about?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> This is about our darbepoetin launch. There is a very interesting story. The number of drop outs used to be quite high for our darbepoetin follow on treatment. By enrolling the patients into this program, by giving reminder and by connecting the doctors to their patients, the dropout of patients has come down dramatically. Originally we say very high dropout rates, almost by a third or a little less than third but from there it has come down to single digit in India. </p><p><b>Question: </b>On your portfolio differentiation efforts&#8230;Metsmall (a smaller tablet of metformin for patient convenience) and Optidoz (combination of telmisartan, amlodipine and HCTZ ) to drive better adherence for hypertension patients. Any significant market wins, takeaways?</p><p><b>GVP: </b>Metsmall is a good win but Optidoz, the jury is still out. </p><p><b>Question: </b>On the Indian market&#8230;the new code of marketing practices puts the onus of overall compliance on the CEO<a href="http://#kmsid:/" target="_new">( scripintelligence.com 24 December 2014)</a>.Your views? </p><p><b>GVP:</b> That's good. I would welcome being under scrutiny for marketing practices.</p><p><b>Question: </b>But what if a medical representative down the line reports wrongly or then takes things into his own hand?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> It's my job to cut him to size or even fire him if he's not following the code. I'd like to be held accountable for every employee's action. I don't have a problem with that.</p><p><b>Question: </b>How do you see the emerging market currency issues <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-eyes-Plan-B-for-Nexium-generic-amid-Q3-slip-356467%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 January 2015)</a>and some analysts have spoken about the company's over dependence on the US markets. How do you want to view that?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> I can't do anything about the emerging market currency situation. And it's a fact that Russia has gone down and Venezuela has also been hit. We are committed to both the markets, long term. We cannot do anything different other than managing the risks a little better. </p><p>Everybody is dependent on the US market from large pharma to generics and it remains the single largest, most attractive market. Pricing is great, clear cut regulations and everything is nice about the market. I would worry if I had an equivalent revenue stream from some other markets but U.S. is a fair country, a reasonable country and transparency is there.</p><p>I would worry if my revenue is coming a lot from India and suddenly the government says prices have to come down&#8230;then profits have gone. I love America&#8230;it's the least risky market from any perspective. There is no price control, everybody understands that it is a free market and it's a stable market.</p><p><b>Question: </b>Between 2008 and 2013, there has been a good growth in your emerging markets business of around 28%. Then does it mean, you will go with the same progression?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> One change we are contemplating is that we are trying to enter some new markets. At some point, we rationalized and said let's focus on a few high growth markets and we grew that well. Now some markets have come on the verge of getting the critical mass. It is time for us to look at another 3 to 5 markets and selectively to expand our presence there. We will see 1 or 2 markets every year&#8230;maybe Africa, Latin America or may be Middle East. We have some registrations. </p><p><b>Question: </b>How have you seen the GSK deal <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Slow-traction-clouding-GSK-Dr-Reddys-expansive-deal-354127%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 25 September 2014)</a>?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> The GSK deal has not gone anywhere in terms of great places. We may start thinking about what to do with it. </p><p><b>Question: </b>So it will be a re-entry on your own?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> A time comes when you have the ability to take on complexity. So supply chain performance, the manufacturing strategy and we think we made reasonable progress. We believe we can take on some more complexity and hence we are looking at the geographic footprint expansion. We are not sure if there will be opportunities in buyouts but if there is something that gives us a head-start into a market, we will take a look. </p><h2>Eye On Changing Paradigm</h2><p><b>Question: </b>Pharma has been looking at innovation through non-traditional partners like Google&#8230;have firms like DRL taken any definitive steps?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> Pharma is way behind and I worry about it when I think that we are so focused on pharmaceuticals. We are actually changing ourselves in that process by saying that we are not a pharmaceutical-only company&#8230;we should be a health focused company. Internally we are doing a lot of work and trying to do something. </p><p>As CEO, I'm very concerned about our lack of innovation outside pharmaceuticals and we will face a very uncertain future if we don't look at those trends&#8230;..those weak signals happening. Digital health is going to change the future of healthcare and companies like Google and lot of other start- ups are doing very exciting things. I actually hired a manager to think of this opportunity.</p><p>We are looking at this field &ndash; devices, diagnostics and digital health. Something dramatic is about to happen in the health scenario. In the next five years, I will be very surprised if some dramatic things don't happen &ndash; like the driverless car. I think healthcare will move from curing diseases to maintaining health through online real-time devices and diagnostics. As a CEO, when I look at the horizon, I can see this storm brewing...it's digital health, advances in genomics, the low cost of sequencing, big data that integrates all this. It's a perfect storm <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Dr-Reddys-CEO-on-the-forest-and-trees-view-in-biosims-digital-health-356624%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 9 February 2015)</a>. </p><h2>New Drug Discovery Research</h2><p><b>Question: </b>You had a CETP drug in clinical trial and it was very close to Dr Anji Reddy. Where are we on that product?</p><p><b>GVP: </b>The trial for the drug is probably ended and the data is locked. The CETP market has gone through ups and downs. The asset is there but we have not monetized it. We saw the trial results have come out for Merck and we are waiting to see what we can do with our drug. We don't want to invest any more money on it. Our data....preliminary looks alright. We will out license it if there is any interest. We have seen how CETPs have fallen off.</p><p><b>Question: </b>Aurigene has been doing well in terms of its business growth. Will you look at further investments?</p><p><b>GVP:</b> It is managed independently by a CEO. We believe we will not fund it under basic research. It has enough surpluses to fund itself or if it enters into partnerships. I don't know if this will change. If there is a very good risk-reward and we have the appetite, we may take a molecule all the way.</p><p>This interview first appeared in <i>PharmAsia News</i>, a sister publication of <i>Scrip</i>.</p>
