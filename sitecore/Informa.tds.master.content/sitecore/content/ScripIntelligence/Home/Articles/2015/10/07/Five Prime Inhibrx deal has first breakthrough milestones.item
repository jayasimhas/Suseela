<p>A collaboration and license agreement between Five Prime Therapeutics and Inhibrx appears to be the first-ever drug development deal that offers extra milestone fees for product candidates that are able to win a coveted breakthrough therapy designation from the US FDA.</p><p>A breakthrough therapy designation can speed a drug candidate through the regulatory review process, saving biopharmaceutical companies a lot of time. Given the value of a relatively speedy FDA approval for new therapies, it's not surprising that a drug developer would reward its partner with additional fees for winning a breakthrough designation. In fact, Five Prime may not be the first to offer such an incentive, but it's the first company to disclose those milestone fees publicly.</p><p><b>Breakthrough and other milestones</b></p><p>South San Francisco-based Five Prime will give Inhibrx a $10m license fee to obtain exclusive, worldwide therapeutic and diagnostic rights to antibodies that bind to glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), an immune checkpoint protein on T cells and T regulatory cells that Five Prime believes to be a potent inhibitor of tumor growth. GITR agonist antibodies caused tumor regression in preclinical studies, showing greater potency when combined with other immunotherapies.</p><p>In its agreement with San Diego-based Inhibrx, Five Prime also gained an option to license multi-specific antibodies that bind to GITR and other targets. Inhibrx could earn up to $342.5m in development, regulatory and commercial milestone fees for each therapeutic product or up to $442.5m in milestone fees for each product candidate that garners a breakthrough therapy designation. </p><p>"We believe this program has the potential to create a differentiated, next-generation GITR agonist that may have broad therapeutic application as a monotherapy or in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies, including products in our pipeline," Five Prime president and CEO Lewis "Rusty" Williams said in a statement.</p><p>All milestone fees may be paid in cash or in Five Prime stock, but Inhibrx also may earn low double-digit tiered royalties on product sales for approved immuno-oncology therapies. </p><p><b>Immuno-oncology adds value</b></p><p>Five Prime <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Five-Prime-launches-62.4m-IPO-Aerie-files-to-raise-57.5m-346645" target="_new">went public</a> in 2013 at $13 per share with the intention of developing FPA008 for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Five-Prime-files-for-IPO-Intrexon-sets-terms-345355" target="_new">rheumatoid arthritis</a> (RA). A Phase Ib clinical trial in RA is under way, but FPA008 also is being evaluated in combination with cancer immunotherapies as part of Five Prime's growing focus on immuno-oncology. </p><p>The company signed two different agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2014, first to develop antibodies against two immune checkpoint targets and second to test <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-and-Five-Prime-push-the-immune-oncology-deal-bandwagon-along-350670" target="_new">FPA008</a> in combination with the BMS immune checkpoint inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Four-deal-notes-including-Five-Primes-2nd-BMS-oncology-collaboration-355265" target="_new">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab). Five Prime's share price climbed above $20 based on the deals and closed at $26.03 on 16 July, reflecting a 1.2% one-day gain after the 15 July news that the company negotiated an agreement with Inhibrx. </p><p>Inhibrx signed a deal with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Tiny-Inhibrx-signs-500-million-preclinical-antibody-outlicensing-deal-with-Celgene-332297" target="_new">Celgene</a> in 2012 that was worth up to $500m in upfront and milestone payments for an undisclosed preclinical compound. Phase I development for what is now known as INBRX-103 began in early 2015. The antibody targets CD47 on cancer cells.</p><p><p>Amanda Micklus of <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/deals" target="_new">Strategic Transactions</a> contributed to this report.</p><p><p><p><p>
