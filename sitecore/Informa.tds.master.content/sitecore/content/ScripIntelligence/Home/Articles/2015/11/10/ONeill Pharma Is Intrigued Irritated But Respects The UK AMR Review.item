<p> Lord Jim O'Neill &ndash; ex-chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and the man appointed by UK Prime Minister David Cameron to launch and chair a review into the crisis of antibiotic resistance &ndash; spoke to <i>Scrip</i> at the recent BioInfect conference about what will happen when the Review of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) reaches its conclusion in summer 2016, pharma's reaction to the review so far, and how China is joining the game. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/9358233698F44485800F721A5A4C4D7D.ashx">BioInfect, an event focused solely on the issue of antimicrobial resistance held at AstraZeneca PLC's old Alderley Park site in Cheshire, UK, saw O'Neill explain that if the pharmaceutical industry banded together to produce the 10-12 new antibiotic drugs he believes are needed globally, the cost would reach between $16bn and $37bn. A huge amount of money for the average person to consider, however, O'Neill noted that the mid amount of $25bn is equal to just one quarter of 1% of global annual GDP and one quarter of what the top three pharmaceutical companies spent buying back their own shares over the last few years. <br> <br> The UK's AMR Review has already released three papers of the six it has planned looking at key topics involved in the global issue of antibiotic resistance. It is preparing to release a fourth paper, looking solely at agricultural use of antibiotics in December, and will follow up with a paper on alternative options for antibiotics, including vaccines, in the first quarter of 2016. A final report summarizing the infectious disease landscape in general will be issued next summer. <br> <br> Upon the closure of the review O'Neill said it would be important to retain momentum, globally, behind the topic. &quot;I want to accelerate momentum, partly because of my personality and partly because of my past. I am not shy of being bold and in order for us to at least keep up the momentum we have now, and in some areas accelerate it, we need to convince people to adapt to our recommendations,&quot; he said. &quot;We have got to pursue policy makers to adopt this as a priority; we have got to pursue pharma companies to get more skin in the game; and we have got to pursue 7bn people around the world to start behaving differently in terms of the misuse of antibiotics. We are aware of what we have got to do and we are prepared to make a lot of noise about it.&quot; <br> <br> On the topic of pharma's reaction to the AMR Review so far, O'Neill said the industry has been &quot;intrigued, irritated, but has shown respect,&quot; for the work. &quot;There is recognition that what we are suggesting is necessary,&quot; he said. &quot;Where there is contention is that the industry doesn't feel they have the right amount of support to get back into the game of developing new antibiotics.&quot; <br> <br> &quot;In my opinion companies need to start thinking a bit differently and play this out in what I call their enlightened self-interest, rather than letting it be someone else's responsibility,&quot; he added. <br> <br> As for what happens next following the closure of the UK AMR Review, O'Neill was positive of a change taking effect: &quot;Maybe we are being a little bit naive or maybe arrogant,&quot; he said, &quot;but we are hoping that the power of our recommendations will succeed in getting policy makers to agree to implement steps.&quot; <br> <br> He added, &quot;I am trying to persuade China to treat AMR as a priority for their G20 presidency next year, that action in itself will carry our legacy through I believe.&quot; <br> <br> The AMR Review team has already reported that antibiotic resistance could be responsible for 10m deaths per year by 2050 &ndash; more than presently die from cancer. It has also set the economic impact at least $100tr in sacrificed gross national product &ndash; higher than the current GDP of the entire world. O'Neill told the conference that around 30% of those deaths will come from &quot;reversing 30 years of great advances in TB, HIV and malaria&quot; as the world runs out of effective antibiotics to treat associated infections. <br> <br> O'Neill said the AMR Review team is currently working on getting the United Nations to be in agreement with its proposals at its assembly in 2016. &quot;There will need to be individuals that understand that strange world of the United Nations, to take over this leadership,&quot; he said, &quot;but if we carry on with the discussions we are having then I am reasonably hopeful that there will at least be an attempt to get some UN agreement by September next year.&quot; </p>
