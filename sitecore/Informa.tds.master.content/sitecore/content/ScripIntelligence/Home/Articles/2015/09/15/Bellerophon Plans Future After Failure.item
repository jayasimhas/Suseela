<p><p>Bellerophon Therapeutics has finally found its way forward after a major failure with its lead product candidate left it flailing. </p><p>The company announced in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange that it has appointed a slate of new management and will cut staff in an effort to continue operating. Twenty-one staffers will be let go and the company will incur $1.5m in pre-tax charges. Bellerophon's chief scientific officer and chief clinical development officer were also let go. The chief operating officer also resigned. </p><p>Bellerophon has been trying to pick up the pieces since it announced in July that its bioabsorbable cardiac matrix that it picked up from BioLineRx in 2009 failed in a Phase III study. The drug/device combo had been widely expected to succeed and the biotech's stock plummeted on the news. </p><p>CEO Jonathan Peacock, who took over in 2014, will be joined by a new management team, including David Abrams as principal financial officer and Deborah Quinn as chief medical officer. </p><p>The management changes were also part of a shifting of directions for the company, which will now focus on a Phase III candidate for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The company has been in discussions with the FDA and EMA to move forward with the late-stage development plan and create a special protocol assessment to conduct the trials under. </p><p><p>
