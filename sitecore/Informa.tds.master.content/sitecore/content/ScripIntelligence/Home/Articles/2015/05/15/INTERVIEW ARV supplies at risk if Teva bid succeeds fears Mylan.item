<p>At least one senior board member of Mylan is apprehensive about supplies of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to low income countries from the generic firm's Indian sites should Teva Pharmaceutical succeed in its acquisition bid.</p><p>Generic giant Mylan is now sending out louder signals in opposition to a planned $40bn acquisition bid by archrival Teva.</p><p>While questioning the basic strategic logic of combining with Teva, on senior Mylan executive has now expressed apprehensions that supplies of essential medicines from India, particularly ARVs, to scores of low income countries may be endangered if a merger deal is allowed to go through.</p><p>In an exclusive telephone interview with <i>Scrip's </i>sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i>, Rajiv Malik, Mylan's president of global operations and a member of its board of directors, was clear that a deal with Teva defied any industrial or strategic logic, would add up to nothing and instead actually destroy value.</p><p>"We do not know how one plus one can make more than even 1.5 in this case," Malik noted, pointing out that just stitching up a deal to get a bigger size would not benefit any stakeholders.</p><h2>undoing past work</h2><p>In opposing Teva, Malik is heavily batting for Mylan's Indian operations, of which he can arguably be called an architect, leading deal negotiations with a slew of local producers while simultaneously turning the valve on investments to augment capacity and build a strong research base.</p><p>The veteran executive, who has had a meteoric rise since Mylan bought Matrix Labs, marking its Indian entry in 2007, fears that Teva &ndash; in realizing its stated objective to achieve $2bn in cost synergies from the combined entity &ndash; may not just risk jobs in manufacturing and local R&D. A deal may even bring uncertainty about the low-cost supplies of essential ARVs to scores of developing nations, he warned.</p><p>"We cater to more than 40% of the population of the developing nations and Sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly half of our total API [active pharmaceutical ingredient] capacity is deployed for just ARVs and we are working with the most comprehensive network of international health and relief agencies.</p><p>"Over the last five years we consistently built market share and this is what we are very apprehensive of. How has Teva viewed all this?" Malik asked.</p><p>From the stakeholder's point of view, he argued that stands to be a grave concern.</p><p>He noted that Teva has developed ARVs for markets like the US and Europe, while expressing concerns about its deployment of resources in developing nations. "Will Teva continue with what Mylan has done all these years?" Malik queried, adding: "Looking at their track record and the $2bn cost saving target, it is very difficult for us to believe that the focus that Mylan has will continue if Teva takes over."</p><p>Despite the low margins often associated with the ARV business, Malik said Mylan had grown the segment steadily from as early as 2000. "We know the backend issues, sourcing issues and what it really means to work with multiple global partners like WHO [World Health Organization], Clinton Foundation. It is a task to consistently bring costs down and it is on multiple levels that the business operates," he stressed.</p><h2>big India ramp up</h2><p>Mylan's India build-up of the past few years demonstrates why Malik is not going easy in the storm kicked up over the potential deal with Teva. In contrast to Teva&rsquo;s low scale of Indian operations, Malik said that over the last eight years Mylan had multiplied its India headcount, starting from just 1,700 to over 13,000 at present, while pouring in R&D investments. Its annual research spend in India has shot up to INR3.5bn ($55m).</p><p>Mylan's Hyderabad R&D site is one of only three worldwide that integrates into the global R&D function creating what it calls a round-the-clock unique and efficient capability.</p><p>Mylan's annual capital expenditure outlay for India, according to him, exceeds $100m, aggregating nearly $500m in the last six years, mostly directed at ramping up capacity in APIs and formulations and bringing in knowledge about technology and regulatory compliance.</p><p>Also, Malik said, the "big bang" for Mylan came from its inorganic growth strategy, pointing to the string of deals to buy the local manufacturing units of Unichem Laboratories, SMS Pharma, Strides Arcolab and most recently Famycare.</p><p>Those investments and acquisitions perhaps made Mylan the largest employer in the Indian pharmaceutical industry before Sun acquired Ranbaxy, he noted, despite having much smaller and relatively new commercial operations.</p><p>But for Malik, the excitement about India is far from over. His unambiguous message to his Indian staff in the face of the latest takeover threat is "We will weather the storm."</p><h2>positive on Perrigo</h2><p>Asked if Mylan may further increase its bid value for Perrigo, Malik said the company has already been fairly valued, while expressing optimism that once the Teva "overhang moves out of the way," the Perrigo management may see the real value in seeing a deal through. </p><p>In contrast to steadfastly opposing Teva's buyout overtures, Malik is enamored to see a deal with Perrigo, saying it makes great sense and would be a bonding of two different businesses. "We have been missing the OTC [over-the-counter] side and we have been at the back of the store while this is at the front of the pharmacy, and it makes a lot of sense from many different angles for us. We will do everything right to make it happen," he stressed.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/29/takeda-offers-24bn-nofault-settlement-of-actos-suits" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p>
