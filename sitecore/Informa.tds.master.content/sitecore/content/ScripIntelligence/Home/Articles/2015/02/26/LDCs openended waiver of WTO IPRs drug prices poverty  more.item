<p>Mammoth price differentials between patented and locally produced drugs in a country where nearly 25 million people live in extreme poverty are some of justifications emerging from Bangladesh's promising pharmaceutical industry after the country led Least Developed Country (LDCs) members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to seek an extension of the transitional period to enforce intellectual property rights on medicines.</p><p>First a price check, based on the data shared with <i>Scrip</i> by Bangladesh pharma: cholesterol-lowering drug Crestor 10mg (rosuvastatin) tablet costs around $7.25 in the US versus a comparable Bangladeshi generic price of $0.25; antibiotic Zyvox 600mg (linezolid) comes at $165.5 versus the generic price $1.1 while diabetes drug Januvia 50mg (sitagliptin) is priced at $11.25 against the local generic price of $0.25. </p><p>''Many emerging and chronic diseases require newer drug therapies, and it is impossible for a poverty-stricken nation like Bangladesh to bear the high cost of these medicines many of which still remain under patent protection. Against this grim backdrop, there is no other viable option than locally produced generic drugs, '' Dr Shawkat Haider, general manager, Beximco Pharma, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>LDCs led by Bangladesh recently proposed extending their deadline for protecting and enforcing pharmaceutical patents and clinical data when WTO members met as the intellectual property council on 24&ndash;25 February. The proposed new deadline would exempt them from having to protect and enforce pharmaceutical patents and clinical data submitted to obtain marketing approval until they move up from LDC status. The proposal was made because a 2002 decision is set to expire at the end of 2015.</p><p>Bangladesh's note referred to how LDCs were ''disproportionately'' exposed to the health risks associated with poverty (such as poor and under-nutrition, unsafe water and poor sanitation) and that low-income levels mean that they also struggle to provide their population with prevention, treatment and care. </p><p>''Patent protection contributes to high costs, placing many critical treatments outside the reach of LDCs,'' Bangladesh said on behalf of the LDC group. LDCs represent some of the poorest and weakest segments of the international community.</p><p>Like its Asian neighbour India, the bulk of Bangladesh's 160m population pays for medical treatment out of their own pockets. This even as the poverty rate in Bangladesh was over 26% in 2013, with nearly 25 million people living in extreme poverty. </p><p>Dr Haider referred to data from Bangladesh National Health Accounts (BNHA) 1997-2012 which suggests that expenditure on medicines and curative purposes accounted for 67% of the total healthcare expenditure in the country, with out-of-pocket expenditure accounting for 63% of healthcare expenditure against only 23% by the government.</p><p>''Absence of health insurance coverage forces people to borrow money, sell assets or spend their entire savings for healthcare needs. One of the major reasons for this huge population to incur debt is the cost of health care,'' he lamented. </p><p>A WTO statement noted that since the LDCs proposal was not on the formal agenda of the WTO meeting, but introduced for information under ''other business'', the discussion was brief and will now be discussed ''more substantially'' at the next TRIPS Council meeting in June.</p><h2>Local industry</h2><p>On whether the proposed extension, if permitted, would also allow Bangladesh's local industry to mature and serve local needs better with or without technology support, the Beximco official said that the domestic industry could develop further with sufficient backward integration into active pharmaceutical ingredients, acquisitions, an exchange of technical know-how , reforms in patent laws etc to gain competitive advantages and then comply with IP obligations in due course. </p><p>''In view of the socio economic challenges, the country must be given further waiver till it gets out of LDC status,'' Dr Haider underscored.</p><p>However, despite the progress in making some life-saving medicines affordable, the local industry acknowledges that this is far from what is required to provide sufficient access to modern, innovative therapies for a nation facing ever increasing burden of diseases. Enforcement of patent laws in pharmaceuticals will only make things worse, it indicated. </p><p>Moreover, there appears to have been limited progress between the developed world and LDCs when it comes to technical co-operation.</p><p>Bangladesh's pharmaceutical industry had, though, earlier indicated its soaring ambitions. It believes that local companies with average sales of more than $100m should be targeting the $1bn mark in 10 years and that firms could mirror some of the strategies, including mergers and acquisitions, deployed by successful Indian firms to get there <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/10x-in-10-years-Bangladesh-firms-target--Indian-growth-rates-and-markets-339973%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 13 February 2013).</a> Firms like Beximco and Square have been at the forefront of the local industry's globalisation efforts <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Beximco-debuts-in-Australia-via-multi-partner-alliance-356306%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 22 January 2015)</a> and more recently another local firm Incepta Pharmaceuticals launched a cut-price generic Sovaldi (sofosbuvir)version at Taka800 ($10.4) per tablet <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 February 2015)</a>. </p><h2>LDC request at WTO</h2><p>Among a string of details, Bangladesh's note at the WTO meeting refers to how LDC members continue to face massive health challenges from communicable and non-communicable diseases. </p><p>The representation said that in addition to the socio-economic and financial constraints, LDCs also lack adequate technological base and local pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. ''These special needs and circumstances of LDCs and the vulnerability of LDCs confirm the need for a renewed transition period for as long as these constraints remain,'' it said.</p><p>''LDCs hereby submit a duly motivated request for an extension of the transitional period (that ends on 1 January 2016) for as long as the WTO member remains a least developed country''.</p><p>LDCs already benefit from a general extension of the deadline up to July 2021 to protect IP and implement other WTO IP, including for pharmaceuticals under a 2013 decision covering all intellectual property. The new document seeks also to exempt LDCs from having to apply two special transitional provisions &ndash; mailbox and marketing exclusivity &ndash; for which LDCs currently have a waiver. </p><p>Experts like Professor Brook Baker, professor of law at the Northeastern University School of Law, program on human rights and the global economy, in Boston and a senior policy analyst for the human rights activist body Health Gap, however, recently argued that the second TRIPS-compliance extension 2013-2021 does not provide the same level of ''open-ended'' freedom from recognizing and enforcing pharmaceutical patent, data-protection, and market-exclusivity rights as would a further extension of the existing pharmaceutical extension.</p><p>Professor Baker believes that the WTO should be ''lining up support'' for an unconditional extension of the pharmaceutical production transition period and for a General Council waiver with respect to obligations under TRIPS Article 70.8 and 70.9 (mail box and marketing exclusivity provisions) until such time as an LDC member is no longer an LDC. </p><p>''Rich countries should expend their efforts in really promoting technology transfer and aiding the development of LDC members instead of engaging in an irrational lobbying effort to give LDCs less than they need and less than they are legally entitled to. LDC members must intensify their joint advocacy and hold firm on their key demands,'' he said in a recent post on the issue.</p>
