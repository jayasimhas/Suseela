<p>Apricus Biosciences successfully confused its investors on Sept. 10 when the San Diego-based company announced that it managed to license its own topical treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) from Allergan for a meager $1m upfront payment plus a future $1.5m regulatory milestone fee.</p><p>In fact, Allergan gave up its right to market Vitaros in the US six years after one of its predecessor companies licensed the drug, which is approved in Europe and Canada. Yet despite the potential loss of a major international pharma partner to market Vitaros, Apricus ended the day with a 7.7% gain to close at $1.83 per share, since the company stands to earn up to 10 times the milestone fees originally promised by Warner Chilcott in 2009 if Allergan exercises an option for Vitaros at a later date.</p><p>Allergan may reacquire the right to market Vitaros in the US upon FDA acceptance of a new drug application (NDA) for the ED treatment. If so, Apricus will earn up to $25m in upfront and product launch milestone payments plus a double-digit royalty on sales. If not, Apricus will market Vitaros and pay Allergan a double-digit royalty. Allergan also retained the right to launch an authorized generic of Vitaros under a profit share agreement with Apricus. </p><p>Warner Chilcott <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Apricus-signs-further-partners-for-Vitaros-and-MycoVa-325741" target="_new">licensed Vitaros in 2009</a>, before the company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Chilcott-deal-has-slaked-thirst-of-generic-hunter-Actavis---for-now-343382" target="_new">was acquired by Actavis</a> (now Allergan). Warner unsuccessfully pursued FDA approval for Vitaros before Allergan relinquished its right to the topical drug in the US. Under the companies' original agreement, Apricus earned $2.5m up front and was entitled to a $2.5m milestone fee upon FDA approval, so if Allergan opts back in to sell Vitaros in the US Apricus stands to earn a lot more money in milestone fees. </p><p><p><p><p><p>
