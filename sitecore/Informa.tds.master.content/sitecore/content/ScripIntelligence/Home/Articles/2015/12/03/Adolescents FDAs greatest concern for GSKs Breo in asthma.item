<p>The FDA raised several concerns about the use of GlaxoSmithKline's Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder) in treating patients 12-17 years as a once daily treatment for asthma, but that may not stop a panel of advisers from recommending its use in adults.</p><p>Breo, a combination of fluticasone furoate (FF), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol (VI), a long-acting beta2 adrenergic agonist (LABA), already is approved in the US as a long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis or emphysema, and as a therapy to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations.</p><p>The drug was in fact the first once-daily ICS/LABA to win those indications in the US when it gained the FDA's initial blessing in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKTheravance-US-Breo-win-pleases-investors-343079" target="_new">May 2013</a>.</p><p>Now, GSK wants to expand the use of Breo Ellipta in asthma patients 12 years or older in the US, so the FDA wants advice from its Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs (PADAC) and Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committees, which are holding a joint meeting to review the application on 19 March.</p><p>Analysts from Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, said they believed the committee would favor approval in at least the 18 years or older group, but may well not recommend approval in the younger patients.</p><p>RW Baird analyst Brian Skorney said the FDA&rsquo;s review indicates a &ldquo;high probability of a favorable panel vote and approval." </p><p>"The overall efficacy-safety profile discussed in the review appears to be supportive of approval in this cycle,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The only real question likely for debate at the adcomm, Mr Skorney said, is whether to include the 12-17-year-olds or limit the label to adults. </p><p><b>LABA concerns</b></p><p>The FDA already has been concerned about evidence showing an excess risk of severe asthma exacerbations in children treated with LABAs. </p><p>The agency in February 2010 told makers of LABA's they needed to revise their labeling to include a contraindication for the use of those drugs without an asthma control medication; a recommendation to use fixed-dose ICS plus LABA combination in pediatric and adolescent patients; and alert to assess asthma control and consider step-down therapy. </p><p>The FDA also required post-marketing controlled safety trials.</p><p>There currently are two LABAs, salmeterol and formoterol, approved as single ingredients or in combination with ICS in inhalation products for the treatment of asthma. </p><p>Breo Ellipta is the first inhalation product with a new LABA &ndash; vilanterol &ndash; proposed for asthma in over a decade and would be the first once daily LABA-containing product for asthma, regulators noted in briefing documents ahead the 19 March joint PADAC-DSaRM meeting.</p><p><b>Breo&rsquo;s R&D in asthma</b></p><p>GSK's asthma development program was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug versus placebo, the contribution of VI to the combination and the added benefit of the higher 200mcg/25mcg dose of Breo over the lower 100mcg/25mcg dose. </p><p>The data to support the efficacy of Breo for the maintenance treatment of asthma was derived primarily from four trials &ndash; HZA106827, HZA116863, HZA106829 and HZA106837.</p><p>GSK also conducted another trial, HZA113091, which compared Breo to the company&rsquo;s Advair (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol) in asthma, which the FDA said provided an additional benchmark comparison for Breo. </p><p>The London-based drug maker already has won US approval of fluticasone furoate, marketed as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-GSKs-Arnuity-Ellipta-in-asthma-353487" target="_new">Arnuity Ellipta</a>, as monotherapy to treat asthma at doses of 100mcg and 200mcg once daily in patients 12 years or older &ndash; gaining that nod from the FDA in August 2014.</p><p>So the main goal of GSK's Breo asthma program was to demonstrate the added clinical benefit of vilanterol, regulators said.</p><p><b>Adolescent efficacy</b></p><p>In GSK's 12-week, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group HZA106827 trial, once-daily treatment Breo 100mcg/25mcg and FF 100mcg demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo with respect to trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) and weighted mean FEV1 at week 12. </p><p>But there was no statistically significant treatment differences observed with either endpoint between Breo 100mcg/25mcg relative to FF 100mcg, so the lung function contribution of VI to Breo 100mcg/25mcg was not demonstrated in trial HZA106827. </p><p>Two subsequent trials &ndash; HZA116863 and HZA106829 &ndash; however, did show a contribution of the VI component, regulators pointed out. </p><p>The FDA conducted subgroup analyses for lung function in trials HZA106827, HZA116863 and HZA106829. </p><p>The FDA emphasized the trials were not powered to detect differences based on subgroup analysis. </p><p>But when examining lung function, the number of adolescents 12-17 years in each subgroup was small, treatment effects within subgroups were not statistically significant and tests for interaction between treatment and age were not statistically significant, the FDA's drug reviewers said. </p><p>They noted, however, there was a numerical trend towards a smaller observed treatment effect in the Breo treatment group versus FF alone in younger patients in all three trials for weighted mean serial FEV1 and in two of the three trials for trough FEV1. </p><p>When the subgroup analyses from the Arnuity Ellipta clinical development program were examined, the treatment effect of FF was comparable between the younger age group and the adult population, the FDA's reviewers said. </p><p>"When considering the typical efficacy of bronchodilators, such as vilanterol, the inability to consistently demonstrate the contribution of a LABA to the combination product in younger patients, even numerically, is an issue that warrants discussion," they said. </p><p>Regulators noted the adolescent population in the HZA106837 trial comprised about 13% to 15% of the total study population &ndash; the largest adolescent subgroup for analysis. </p><p>When the 12-17 year subgroup was compared to the subgroup 18 years or older, there was a numerical trend towards increased risk of asthma exacerbation with Breo versus FF. </p><p>The FDA's reviewers said the results of its analysis showed about 10% of adolescents on Breo had at least one asthma exacerbation, versus 7% in the FF treatment group. </p><p>"Consideration of the efficacy information, including the efficacy in the 12 to 17-year-old subgroup with respect to lung function and asthma exacerbation, will be important in the risk-benefit evaluation as the advisory committee discusses the issues related to the adequacy of the safety database to assess for the LABA-associated serious asthma outcomes of hospitalization, intubation and death," regulators said. </p><p>The FDA said use of Breo in the COPD indication for adults represented only a small part of the combination LABA market &ndash; only 1% of the dispensed fixed-dose combination ICS/LABA prescriptions in 2014. </p><p>Data showed that only 101,000 patients received dispensed Breo prescriptions from May 2013 through December 2014, with 41% of those prescriptions written by pulmonary disease specialists, regulators said.</p><p>If Breo Ellipta is approved for asthma treatment, the agency's epidemiology reviewers urged continued periodic post-marketing surveillance for evidence of off-label in age groups outside those labeled and other inappropriate uses of the drug. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
