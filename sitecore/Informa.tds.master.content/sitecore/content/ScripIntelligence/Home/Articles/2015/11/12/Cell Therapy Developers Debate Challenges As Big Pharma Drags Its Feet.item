<p>Companies developing 'advanced' treatments such as cell therapies face many of the same challenges in getting their innovative products to market, yet the attitudes of management towards the various hurdles differs quite significantly, <i>Scrip</i> found at Alliance for Regenerative Medicine's third annual 'European Advanced Therapies Investor Day' on Nov. 12.</p><p><b>Challenges</b></p><p>Zami Aberman is chair and CEO of Pluristem Therapeutics, an Israeli company developing an 'off-the-shelf' therapy made from expanded placental cells. He feels the biggest hurdle is "persuading the [pharma] industry and regulators of the consistency of allogeneic products, which could be derived from many different donors."</p><p>Eduardo Bravo is CEO of TiGenix, a Belgian cell therapy developer. He believes the root of all the difficulties in the space is the scarcity of large-scale data. "We don't as yet have large amounts of compelling data and this is our major problem," he told attendees of the Investor Day.</p><p>Avita Medical is a medical technology company with regenerative products on the market to treat wounds, scars and other skin conditions. CEO Adam Kelliher said his most significant obstacle is "medical orthodoxy." Physicians have a "set way of doing things and it's difficult to persuade them to do it differently." Avita gets around this by positioning its products as an "adjunct" to existing ones, adding: "We tell them that it is something that works [alongside] their existing tool set."</p><p><b>Manufacturing</b></p><p>Unsurprisingly Alexander Vos, CEO of cell therapy-focused contract manufacturer PharmaCell, highlights other concerns. He believes it is the scaling up of manufacturing processes where many companies trip up. "Companies are desperate to get to the next stage, the next clinical trial, to show their potential partners. But they need to be able to demonstrate scalability of their manufacturing processes, and this isn't always easy."</p><p>Vos also warns that a contract manufacturer is "no substitute for in-depth scientific knowledge of your production process. You need to understand it thoroughly [on a small scale] before you can consider scaling it up." And when a company is ready for scale-up, "we can step in and help."</p><p><b>Pricing</b></p><p>The panel of speakers also differed in their attitudes towards the pricing of their cell therapies.</p><p>"Getting approval is one thing, getting reimbursement authorities to pay for it is quite another," said TiGenix's Bravo. The problem, as Bravo sees it, comes back to data again. Because of the small number of patients in the trials, the resulting volume of data "is not enough to convince payers."</p><p>Aberman of Pluristem looks at it differently. "We need to aim for significant improvement. If the improvement is significant, people will want to pay for it," he believes. "Even if it's with only 20 patients, a large improvement will give you the p value [you need]."</p><p>Kelliher from Avita reminded everyone to get an agreement from regulators on endpoints early on in the clinical design process "to avoid a grenade in the lap" at a later stage. </p><p>Here, Aberman said the EU's adaptive pathways approach works well. "You are asked to work alongside the [regulator's] people from the beginning," he noted. This helps to avoid nasty surprises. "The adaptive pathway is looking for clear data on efficacy," and will work with companies to help them achieve that.</p><p>However, according to TiGenix's Bravo, cell therapies are never going to be cheap "so we have to target indications where patient need allows us to charge a higher price."</p><p>Pluristem's Aberman disagrees. "We need only to be confident of a significant improvement strategy. We shouldn't make excuses for that." He acknowledges that reimbursement agencies "only care about money" but by demonstrating significant improvement it would leave them with "little choice" but to pay for the product.</p><p><b>Pharma Investment</b></p><p>The speakers all bemoaned the relative lack of investment by big pharma in the cell therapy space. </p><p>"Big pharma coming in will help us in two ways," explained Bravo. "One, they will invest in enabling technologies. Two, they will have the money and long-term commitment to do the large clinical trials that will bring the data."</p><p>Pharma's delay in entering the space is because of a "herd mentality," he claimed. "If you think about the early days of monoclonal antibodies, no pharma wanted to take part. Hence the big biotechs &ndash; Amgen, Biogen &ndash; became big. Roche bought Genentech and look how well that turned out."</p><p>"Pharma companies want to see more data before they enter," suggested Aberman. </p><p>"The fact is that pharma would prefer to pay three times more for a de-risked program," responded Bravo. </p><p>"It's true we have not had the strong data pharma looks for but it is coming, and then [pharma] will follow," Aberman said. Astellas has set up a cell therapy division, he noted, and so has Novartis.</p><p>Novartis of course <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-calls-Dendreon-an-enabler-not-a-failure-355048" target="_new">bought Dendreon's manufacturing facilities</a> after the cell therapy pioneer declared bankruptcy a few years ago. "It is spending a lot of time and effort on those manufacturing facilities," Aberman noted.</p><p>"When we talk to pharma companies we have to demonstrate that we have solved all the problems," concluded Aberman. "We have to show all the solutions, and then pharma will enter the cell therapy space."</p>
