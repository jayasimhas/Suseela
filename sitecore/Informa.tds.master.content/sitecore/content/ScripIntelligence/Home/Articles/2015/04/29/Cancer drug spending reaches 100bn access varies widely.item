<p>Total global spending on oncology medicines reached $100bn in 2014 &ndash; up 10.3% from a year earlier &ndash; with targeted therapies accounting for about half of those dollars. </p><p>While the US continued to dominate the oncology drug market, accounting for 42.2% of the total spend in the space, the so-called "pharmerging" countries &ndash; the 19 nations with the fastest emerging biopharmaceutical markets &ndash; had the swiftest growth during last year, at 15.5%, according to a new analysis by IMS Health. </p><p>The information and technology services firm currently defines pharmerging countries as Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, China, Columbia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela and Vietnam, a spokesman told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Japan had the slowest growth in oncology spending in 2014 &ndash; coming in at 4.3%, IMS said in its <i>Global Oncology Trend Report 2015</i>.</p><p>Oncology represented 14.7% of total drug spending in 2014 in the EU5 countries &ndash; France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK &ndash; while it was 11.3% in the US.</p><p>Over the past five years, there have been 45 new cancer drugs launched throughout the world covering 53 indications, with 10 of those novel products entering the marketplace in 2014, including five biologics &ndash;Amgen's Blincyto (blinatumomab), Lilly's Cyramza (ramucirumab), Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) and Janssen's Sylvant (siltuximab). </p><p>IMS pointed out, however, that not all of those 45 drugs were launched in all countries.</p><p>For instance, Roche's alectinib and Kyowa Hakko Kirin's mogamulizumab entered the market in Japan last year, but nowhere else.</p><p><b>Lack of access</b></p><p>But even with several new cancer drugs on the market and spending on those medicines on an upward trajectory in the pharmerging countries, patients in those nations had a tougher time trying to access the products, especially targeted oncology treatments, IMS reported.</p><p>For example, of the 27 targeted cancer drugs launched globally since 2009, only four were available in India last year, while Brazil patients had access to only six. Patients in China were able to obtain eight targeted drugs in 2014, while there was only nine available in Russia. Patients in Mexico fared the best, with access to 13 targeted medicines.</p><p>But with the potential the World Health Organization's 2015 "essential medicines list" may include targeted therapies, the availability of the drugs may increase for patients across pharmerging countries, IMS said.</p><p>The availability of cytotoxic agents also was scarce in 2014 in Brazil, China, Mexico and Russia, where patients only had access to two of those products.</p><p>In India, however, there was only one of the new cytotoxic drugs available.</p><p>IMS also noted that the availability of cancer medicines varied widely across developed nations, too, with patients in Japan, Spain and South Korea only having access to about half of the newest drugs. </p><p><b>Reimbursement</b></p><p>Even when cancer medicines were available in pharmerging countries, lack of reimbursement &ndash; particularly in nations employing formal cost-effectiveness methodologies based on cost per quality life year gained &ndash; constrained patients' access, the IMS analysis showed.</p><p>In Brazil and Mexico, private insurers were more likely to reimburse for new cancer drugs than the public health systems, which were less open to new products. </p><p>In China and India, patients frequently had to pay for all or most of the costs of the newer cancer drugs they received, according to IMS.</p><p><b>Value</b></p><p>Assessment of the value of oncology products also played a role in spending in 2014, IMS found.</p><p>Payers and patients &ndash; who are facing a growing share of treatment costs &ndash; are increasingly scrutinizing the value of cancer drugs more closely. </p><p>But determining the value of cancer agents is becoming more complex because the medicines are being awarded multiple indications &ndash; with expectations most of the oncology products will be approved for three or more uses by 2020, IMS said.</p><p>Divergence in clinical value by indication complicates assessments of appropriate pricing by payers, IMS said.</p><p>In many cases, the majority of a drug's clinical value may be in areas with small patient populations, while most of its use is for indications with relatively less value.</p><p>The IMS analysis also showed that overall cancer treatment costs per month increased 39% over the past 10 years in inflation-adjusted terms &ndash; similar to the 42% increase in overall response rates and 45% increase in months that patients were on therapy, which also contributes to higher overall spending levels associated with improved survival rates.</p><p>In addition, the firm said out-of-pocket costs in the US associated with intravenous cancer drugs rose steeply as consolidation of smaller group practices into larger hospital systems triggered higher outpatient facility costs shared with patients.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
