<p>"Don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg." This is what industry's retort appears to be to an Indian parliamentary committee report that expressed "surprise" that all drugs are not listed on the country' s national list of essential medicines (NLEM) - implying that the panel favours price caps across the board.</p><p>The 31-member parliamentary standing committee on chemicals and fertilizers chaired by Anandrao Adsul believes that "all medicines are essential" and taken only when needed by patients and that these medicines including life-saving drugs should be available in the market at "affordable cost". </p><p>The committee, in its report presented to the Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament, on 20 April, and accessed by <i>Scrip</i>, recommends that the scope of price control be "enlarged" to make all the drugs available especially life-saving ones, in all parts of the country. </p><p>"The government should also expedite the process of notifying the ceiling prices of the remaining medicines. The committee would like the department[of pharmaceuticals] to act accordingly and be apprised of the targets achieved in the matter," it said in the report that was laid in the Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of Parliament, on 23 April.</p><p>Drugs on the NLEM 2011 are currently subject to price caps in India and this list is in the process of being <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Revised-essential-drugs-list-on-Indian-agenda-amid-tensions-354022" target="_new">reviewed</a>. </p><p>The committee report notes a representative of the department of pharmaceuticals as saying that the process of revising the NLEM is also currently ongoing in the Ministry Of Health. </p><p>"They have constituted a core committee which is revising the NLEM. So, when the NLEM gets revised and we have the 2015 version, instead of the 2011 version, if it recommends more medicines in that list, automatically more medicines would come under price control. That depends on the Ministry of Health - whatever they feel is essential in terms of therapeutic segments, in terms of requirements of the Indian population at large, in terms of the disease burden," the report said.</p><p>India had earlier notified the Drug Prices Control Order 2013 capping the prices of around 628 formulations across 27 therapeutic segments specified in its NLEM 2011, in line with a previously announced national pharmaceutical <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-caps-essential-drug-prices-343296%5d" target="_new">pricing policy</a>. </p><h2>Shortages</h2><p>While the parliamentary panel's report is expected to be music to the ears of pro-health activists who have long been demanding an expansion in price control, industry bigwigs have cautioned that further large-scale price controls will not only hurt the workings of an already beleaguered sector but also potentially impact supplies.</p><p>"Price controls can help only if medicines are available. There are other ways such as the Tamil Nadu model for improving affordable access," one industry expert told <i>Scrip</i>, underscoring that an unbalanced pricing policy approach could force manufacturers to re-evaluate their product portfolios. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation's model (in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu) of centralised tendering and purchase of drugs is known to have been rather successful.</p><p>Experts have previously cautioned that the government's lopsided pricing approach would result in shortages in the short term, a concentration of market share in the hands of a few players going forward and also decreased competition. They noted that products such as azithromycin have seen a volume drop of more than 90% in the case of certain companies, probably indicative that the concerned firm may be withdrawing from that segment &ndash; again a fallout of, what industry claims, is an unviable pricing policy.</p><p>Last year, India's apex pricing authority swung into <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-pricing-body-initiates-action-to-check-essential-meds-shortage-353854%5d" target="_new">action</a> to tackle the "scarcity" of certain essential medicines including an antimalarial combination and rabies vaccines setting sharp compliance timelines for industry. </p><h2>Cases</h2><p>While Parliamentary panel reports are not really binding on the government, they could clearly provide enough fodder against industry in ongoing cases concerning price controls.</p><p>The All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), an independent network of several NGOs working to increase access and improve the rational use of essential medicines, had earlier filed a petition expressing concern over the shift to a market-based mechanism for price control from a cost-based one, though the current status of this case could not immediately be ascertained.</p><p>Last year, India's National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Industry-cries-foul-as-India-caps-drug-prices-in-public-interest-352867" target="_new">capped the prices</a> of 108 "formulation packs" in the diabetes and cardiovascular segments, including products such as Merck & Co's Januvia (sitagliptin) and GSK's Volibris (ambrisentan), exercising certain special powers under para 19 of the Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013 &ndash; a move which pharmaceutical firms had slammed as unjustifiable. Paragraph 19 authorizes the government, in extraordinary circumstances, to fix, in the public interest, the ceiling price or retail price of any drug for such period as it deems fit. </p><p>Industry went on to <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-price-control-opera-in-court-but-confusion-prevails-353156%5d" target="_new">challenge</a> the move in court <a href="http://(scripintelligence.com 1August 2014)" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 1August 2014)</a>. </p><p>The NPPA has also recently launched a "Pharma Jan Samadhan" scheme which provides consumers and others with an online facility to redress complaints concerning pricing and availability of medicines.</p>
