<p>The EU's CHMP has granted a positive opinion to Novartis's anticancer Odomzo (sonidegib), for approval in adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) who are not amenable to curative surgery or radiation therapy.</p><p>Sonidegib inhibits the hedgehog pathway, a key regulator of development and morphogenesis in mammals, which is linked to the pathogenesis of several cancers including BCC. The product has also been tested in a range of cancer indications at Phase II. </p><p>Odomzo will need to compete with Roche's hedgehog inhibitor Erivedge (vismodegib, licensed from Curis). This became the first FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma early in 2012, which was followed by an EU conditional approval in 2013, and it currently enjoys no competition in this niche market. </p><p>The CHMP singled out Odomzo's benefit as reducing locally advanced BCC lesions, with a response rate of about 54% and a progression-free survival of approximately 22 months. Its most common side-effects are muscle cramps, muscle pain, hair loss, alteration or loss of taste, nausea, diarrhoea, blood creatine phosphokinase increased weight decrease and fatigue. </p><p>Sonidegib has been awaiting US approval since a filing last year. </p><p>
