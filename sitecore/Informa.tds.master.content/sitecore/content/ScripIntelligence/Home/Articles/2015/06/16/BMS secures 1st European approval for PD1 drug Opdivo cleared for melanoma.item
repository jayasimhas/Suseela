<p>The European Commission has approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab), a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, for both first-line and previously treated advanced melanoma patients. This makes it the first approval for a PD-1 inhibitor in Europe for any cancer indication. </p><p>The approval follows an accelerated assessment by the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. In the EU, accelerated assessments are used for "products of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the view point of therapeutic innovation".</p><p>Opdivo was the first PD-1 inhibitor to reach the market worldwide when it was approved for the treatment of melanoma in Japan, but in the US it was pipped to the post by Merck & Co's rival PD-1 drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab), which gained approval for melanoma in September. The FDA go-ahead for Opdivo in melanoma came in December. Keytruda gained a CHMP positive opinion for first-line and previously treated advanced melanoma in May. </p><p>Meanwhile, interim data from the Phase III CheckMate-017 trial released in January suggest Opdivo looks set to become the first PD-1 inhibitor to gain approval for a major lung cancer indication after improved overall survival compared with the control chemotherapy arm.</p><p>Getting to market as early as possible is key for the new wave of immune-oncology products as it will be some time before any real comparisons can be made on their relative safety and efficacy. Giving doctors time to become comfortable with using each particular product in the meantime is vital for long-term sales growth for all players.</p><p>Opdivo's European melanoma approval was based on data from the CheckMate-066 trial which demonstrated superior overall survival versus dacarbazine in the first-line setting and the CheckMate-037 trial which showed improved response versus chemotherapy in previously-treated patients. The trials investigated Opdivo across treatment lines and mutational status with a consistent dose of 3mg/kg every two weeks.</p><p>In the US, Opdivo is priced at about $12,500 per month.</p><p><b>early access</b></p><p>Earlier this month, in what appeared to be only the second such decision by the UK regulator, the MHRA, Opdivo was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-gets-green-light-for-UK-early-access-scheme-358724" target="_new">given the go-ahead</a> to enter the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS), for adults with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, meaning it was made available in advance of its EU approval. The first product to gain an EAMS scientific opinion, in March this year, was Merck's new drug, Keytruda.</p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-Opdivo-gets-speedy-ok-for-the-EU-market-358056" target="_new">BMS's Opdivo gets speedy ok for the EU market</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Another-quick-lung-cancer-approval-in-Opdivos-future-357947" target="_new">Another quick lung cancer approval in Opdivo's future?</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">BMS's anti-PD1 Opdivo takes lead in lung cancer</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">Bristol-Myers wins US Opdivo approval three months early</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">Merck melanoma drug Keytruda OK'd; 1st US PD-1</a></p><p>
