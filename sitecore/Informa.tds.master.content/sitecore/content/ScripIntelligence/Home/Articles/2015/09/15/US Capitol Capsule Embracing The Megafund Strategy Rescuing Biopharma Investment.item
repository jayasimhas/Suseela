<p>Even in light of the economic rebound in the U.S. in recent years, public and private investment in the biopharmaceutical industry has remained tempered &ndash; mostly due to investors' concerns about the time it takes to see a return on investment and the risky nature of drug development &ndash; although venture capital invested in biotechs in the past couple of years has significantly improved, particularly in 2015.</p><p>But Andrew Lo, the Charles E. and Susan T. Harris Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan School of Management and director of the MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering, and his colleagues have proposed what they think is a better financial structure for the biopharmaceutical sector, in which certain financial engineering techniques are deployed to direct capital to drug development, while lessening the risk for investors.</p><p>The idea is to create large diversified portfolios of biomedical programs at various stages of development funded by a single financial entity &ndash; megafunds &ndash; and then structuring the financing of those portfolios through a combination of equity and securitized debt, or securitization. </p><p>Given that it often can take more than a decade to take an investigational medicine from discovery to FDA approval, debt financing may be better suited for drug research and development because that type of investment can be structured to have longer maturities, Lo told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>He said the megafund approach also would help ensure preclinical R&D and Phase I trials get funded &ndash; stages of development that often get ignored by public and private equity investors, who prefer the lower risks and higher chances of success involved in standing behind Phase III studies.</p><p>Lo first started thinking about the megafund and securitization strategy more than five years ago when he set out to research what he could do to help family and friends who were dealing with cancer better understand the situations they were confronting with their diseases.</p><p>What he discovered was that lack of funding was a significant bottleneck in the development of new cancer therapeutics.</p><p>"It didn't make sense to me that we didn't have enough money to develop these products and therapies," particularly in light of the billions of dollars the U.S. government was shelling out to save companies like General Motors and AIG through the $700bn Troubled Asset Relief Program, enacted by President George W. Bush in October 2008, Lo said.</p><p>The MIT professor said that when he and his colleagues proposed their megafund strategy in a September 2012 paper in <i>Nature Biotechnology</i>, there was a lot of initial skepticism by the biopharmaceutical industry and investors that the methods could work.</p><p>But, he said, the concept is now being embraced by the sector "to the point where they're coming up with similar innovations without any of our involvement."</p><p>"It's really gratifying to see the industry has become a lot more receptive," Lo said.</p><p>Part of what led to that change in perception, he said, "is that they've realized that this is essential at this point." </p><p>In other words, Lo said, drug makers have concluded they have no other choice and must make better use of their financial resources, "and this is a way to do it."</p><p>Using historical data in a simulation of new cancer drugs, Lo and his colleagues found that megafunds of $5bn to $15bn could potentially yield average investment returns of 8.9% to 11.4% for equity holders and 5% to 8% for "research-backed-obligation" &ndash; holders that are lower than typical venture-capital hurdle rates, but attractive to pension funds, insurance companies and other large institutional investors.</p><p>In applying their approach to a simulation of orphan drugs &ndash; medicines which typically need lower amounts of capital than products for broader populations &ndash; Lo and his colleagues in a May 2014 <i>Drug Discover Today</i> article said they found that a megafund of $575m could potentially yield double-digit rates of return with only 10-20 projects in the portfolio.</p><p>The MIT economist and his colleagues then examined a portfolio of the rare diseases therapeutic develop program from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health, which comprised 28 research projects initiated at the preclinical stage. </p><p>In simulating a hypothetical megafund using their proposed financing structure, the NCATS data and valuation estimates from a panel of "industry experts," the "senior" and "junior" debt yielded 5% and 8%, respectively, the economists wrote in a February 2015 article in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>.</p><p>They said the simulated expected return to equity was 14.7%, corresponding to a modified internal rate of return of 21.6%.</p><p>The economists said those returns and the likelihood of private-sector funding could be enhanced through third-party funding guarantees from philanthropies, patient advocacy groups and government agencies.</p><p>Lo pointed out that Rep. Juan Vargas (D-CA) plans to soon introduce legislation aimed at establishing public-private funding for drugs to treat orphan diseases based on the megafund approach.</p><p>He noted that a somewhat similar approach to his proposed megafund and securitization strategy is being used by so-called "royalty investment firms," like Royalty Pharma, which acquires ownership interests in the royalty streams of approved drugs, rather than the equity of biopharmaceutical companies.</p><p>By combining ownership interests into a single portfolio, royalty investment companies are able to provide more attractive risk-reward profiles for their investors and can issue debt to finance their acquisitions, Lo and his colleagues wrote in the <i>Nature Biotechnology</i> paper.</p><p>Lo said the fact that Royalty Pharma has been so successful in its endeavors and other companies have followed in suit has convinced him the megafund approach is "practically viable."</p><p>"The idea is getting traction, and I suspect that within the next year or so we're going to see more of these funds being launched, as well as the return of debt financing for bigger deals," he said.</p><p>Lo, who will explain his concept during a <a href="http://mitsloanexperts.mit.edu/closer-to-a-cure-a-new-approach-to-funding-biomedical-innovation" target="_new">Sept. 24 online webcast</a>, acknowledged there are risks of abuse and corruption in using securitization for raising capital &ndash; pointing to what happened in 2007-2008 with mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>"It's an unavoidable aspect of innovation that we have to be aware of it so as to avoid the mistakes of the past," he said.</p><p>Rules about sales practices, disclosure requirements, permissible corporate governance structures and suitability criteria for investors, Lo and his colleagues suggested, "must be imposed and strictly enforced to ensure that megafunds serve their purpose without jeopardizing the stability of the financial system."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/A-Califf-Regime-The-Disruptor-FDA-Industry-Needs-360491" target="_new">A Califf Regime: The Disruptor FDA, Industry Needs</a></p><p>If Robert Califf is confirmed as the next commissioner of the FDA &ndash; which most in the biopharmaceutical community are anticipating is all but assured &ndash; he'll be taking over an agency that's in the midst of some of the most complicated challenges it's ever faced, the resolutions of which have broad implications for drug and device makers. Cleveland Clinics' Steven Nissen and the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest's Peter Pitts are among those who insist Califf is the right person for the job, but Public Citizen's Michael Carome asserted the former Duke professor would be "bad news" because of financial ties to the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Califf-Praised-As-Thoughtful-Choice-To-Lead-FDA-360469" target="_new">Califf Praised As 'Thoughtful' Choice To Lead FDA</a></p><p>After months of growing speculation, President Barack Obama on Sept. 15 made it official &ndash; declaring his intent to nominate Robert Califf as the next commissioner of the FDA. Tony Coles, CEO of Yumanity, who was one of Califf's medical students in the coronary care unit at Duke in the 1980s, said he was not surprised at all by President Obama's choice.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Woodcock-FDA-Focused-On-Biosimilars-Science-Before-Policy-360510" target="_new">Woodcock: FDA Focused On Biosimilars Science Before Policy</a></p><p>Under fire from lawmakers, Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, took cover by insisting the reason the agency has yet to issue or finalize some of the most important biosimilars guidance documents industry has been waiting on &ndash; specifically, those on interchangeability and labeling &ndash; is because regulators must first "get the science right."</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Unveils-Precision-Medicine-Working-Laboratory-Plan-360515" target="_new">NIH Unveils Precision Medicine 'Working Laboratory' Plan</a></p><p>After hearing from hundreds of the nation's top scientists, which gathered at four workshops over the past six months, and receiving input from two public requests for information, a working group on Sept. 17 delivered a blueprint to National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins mapping the way forward for building a one-million person research cohort &ndash; the foundation of President Barack Obama's precision medicine initiative.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Experts-FDAs-Made-Laudable-Progress-But-Efforts-Fall-Short-360557" target="_new">Experts: FDA's Made 'Laudable' Progress, But Efforts Fall Short</a></p><p>While the FDA has made "extensive, transformative and laudable" progress since a scathing 2007 report by a subcommittee of the agency's Science Board condemned regulators for failing to fulfill their mission because of a weak scientific base and lack of scientific workforce, the same panel of outside expert advisers in a new analysis, unveiled on Sept. 18, identified a number of areas in which improvements continue to be needed.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/AstraZenecaBARDA-In-Antibiotics-Deal-170m-Potential-360492" target="_new">AstraZeneca/BARDA In Antibiotics Deal; $170m Potential </a></p><p>AstraZeneca has entered into a public-private partnership worth potentially $170m to the company with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop new antibacterials intended to address biothreat pathogens, in addition to antibiotic resistance, under a "portfolio" approach, which will allow the U.S. government funds to be steered away from a product that proves to be unsuccessful early on in the R&D process to other promising candidates.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-BIs-Spiriva-Respimat-In-Asthma-360494" target="_new">FDA OK's BI's Spiriva Respimat In Asthma</a></p><p>The FDA gave Boehringer Ingelheim approval to market Spiriva Respimat (tiotropium bromide) as a long-term, once-daily, prescription maintenance treatment for patients 12 years or older with asthma, a disease that affects more than 22 million Americans, causing airways to become inflamed and tighten, making it hard to breathe.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-Big-Biosimilars-Questions-Will-Senate-Get-Answers-360448" target="_new">The Big Biosimilars Questions: Will Senate Get Answers?</a></p><p>AbbVie hoped lawmakers would get to the bottom of why the FDA did not require Novartis and its Sandoz unit to identify in the labeling of Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) the product is a biosimilar and did not clearly state the drug had not been found to be interchangeable &ndash;
