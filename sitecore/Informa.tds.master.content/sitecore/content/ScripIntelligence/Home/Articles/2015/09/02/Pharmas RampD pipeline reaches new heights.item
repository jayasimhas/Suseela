<p> Pharma's R&amp;D pipeline just keeps on growing, and new figures from Citeline suggest that the rate of growth is even gaining pace. </p> <p> A snapshot taken from Citeline's Pharmaprojects R&amp;D database shows that as of mid-January there were 12,300 products in development (including all active drugs in the database from preclinical up to and including launched), a rise of 993, or 8.8% on the same time last year. The figure for 2014, at 11,307, was itself a 7.9% rise on the previous year, following five or so years of relatively flat growth, and giving an impression of renewed R&amp;D vigour in the industry. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/2E32592DE41443D2AAD10CC75D24DFA4.ashx"> </p> <p> However, it is not clear how much of this rise can be attributed to better editorial processes and greater disclosure by companies as the lion's share (577 or 58%) of the new products are at the preclinical stage. While this clouds the issue somewhat, it should be noted that increases were seen across all the development phases: of 4.9% at Phase I, 7.0% at Phase II, and 8.6% at Phase III. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/478A877694C94953BB326CA814F991A5.ashx"> </p> <p> &quot;The increases seen at later development phases certainly do suggest, however, that there is some genuine expansion ongoing in the pharma pipeline universe,&quot; said Ian Lloyd, senior director of Pharmaprojects and data integration at Citeline, who wrote the report. </p> <p> Overall, the total number of drugs currently at any clinical phase has gone up by 7.7% to 4,625. &quot;It's interesting to note that percentage figure, which is only just behind the overall pipeline expansion rate. This would suggest that there is significant growth in the pipeline not just across the board, but where it matters.&quot; </p> <p> Again the rate of growth for the past year at the clinical stages compares well compared with recent history, said Mr Lloyd. &quot;We can even surmise that, with the Phase III numbers increasing at a faster rate than those in Phase II, that there is some slight improvement in attrition rates at the end of the latter development stage.&quot; </p> <p> <img src="-/media/99793D035B1A4F53995CC35C136704B8.ashx"> </p> <h2> By company </h2> <p> Looking at the pipeline by company, it seems that GlaxoSmithKline shrugged off misfortunes elsewhere to hold on to the top spot for pipeline size, while the two Swiss majors traded places for second and third. Citeline notes that Novartis has the most self-originated drugs of any company, although Lilly is the company whose pipeline has the highest proportion of homemade candidates. </p> <p> AstraZeneca will likely be gratified that its pipeline (one of the purported reasons for Pfizer's hostile pursuit in 2014) leapfrogged that of its nemesis last year. Pfizer's pipeline, which it claims is &quot;underappreciated&quot;, shrank slightly and dropped down the 2015 Citeline rankings to seventh place. </p> <table> <h2> Top 10 Pharma Companies by Size of Pipeline </h2> <tr> <td> <p> <b>2015 Position (2014)</b> </p> <p></td> <td> <p> <b>Company </b> </p> <p></td> <td> <p> <b>No of drugs in pipeline (2014)</b> </p> <p></td> <td> <p> <b>Number of originated drugs</b> </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 1 (1) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> GlaxoSmithKline </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 258 (261) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 163 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 2 (3) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Novartis </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 245 (223) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 182 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 3 (2) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Roche </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 234 (248) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 158 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 4 (5) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> AstraZeneca </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 222 (197) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 121 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 5 (8) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Johnson &amp; Johnson </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 204 (164) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 100 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 6 (6) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Merck &amp; Co </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 199 (186) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 130 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 7 (4) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Pfizer </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 199 (205) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 132 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 8 (7) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Sanofi </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 184 (180) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 84 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 9 (10) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Takeda </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 130 (132) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 68 </p> <p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> 10 (11) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> Eli Lilly </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 119 (124) </p> <p></td> <td> <p> 93 </p> <p></td> </tr> </table> <p> <p> Meanwhile, the pharma/biotech universe continues to expand, with the number of companies currently involved in drug R&amp;D growing by 10.1% last year to 3,286. Again, Citeline notes that some of this expansion could be attributed to better data sourcing that added 618 new companies to its database, more than compensating for the 300 or so that dropped out of pharma R&amp;D since the previous year. </p> <p> Nevertheless, Citeline says there are simply more companies starting to do pharma R&amp;D, with strong growth being seen in the number of very small companies. More than half of those recorded only have one or two candidates in their pipelines. </p> <h2> By therapy area </h2> <p> One thing that hasn't changed is oncology's dominance of the R&amp;D landscape. The number of drugs with an oncological focus is up yet again this, the rise of 8.7% to more than 3,500, with the growth largely attributed to the rise in immunological candidates, while neurological products continued to languish with the lowest rate of increase at 4.5%. </p> <p> Within the different indications, breast cancer remains top of the list with a 25% increase in the number of candidates since last year, while the second largest indication, colorectal cancer, also posted an impressive 17.7% rise. Other indications performing well were rheumatoid arthritis (+14.6%) and psoriasis, while perhaps unsurprisingly there was a drop in the number of candidates in development for hepatitis C as companies exit this bloated therapy area. </p> <h2> NCE or NBE? </h2> <p> Most of the drug candidates are still chemically synthesised small molecules, but there has been a slow rise in the proportion of pipeline made up of biologicals since 1996 to reach 29.1% this year. This is only up slightly from the 28.9% last year but over the past 20 years the proportion of biologicals has doubled. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/417E2E6B770F440E8F644D953FBD1C30.ashx"> </p> <p> The growth in the pipeline was mirrored by the very healthy levels of drug approvals at the FDA and EMA last year, and it seems like 2014 was a bumper year for new active substance launches too. Scrip and Citeline are still working on our definitive list of the first drug launches worldwide (due to be published in early March) but early signs are that it will be a record-breaking year. </p> <p> <a href="http://www.citeline.com/resource-center/whitepapers/?utm_source=scrip&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_content=report&amp;utm_campaign=AnnualReview" target="_new">Download the full Citeline report here.</a> </p>
