<p>In a Phase II investigator-sponsored study focused on the elderly, CTI BioPharma's acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy tosedostat has seen almost half of patients achieve durable complete responses. </p><p>Results presented at the European Hematology Association (EHA) meeting in Vienna, Austria, showed that in the intend-to-treat population tosedostat in combination with low dose cytarabine/Ara-C (LDAC) resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 54% &ndash; with 45% of patients achieving durable complete responses. In the responding patients, the median time for achieving best response was 74 days (range: 22-145 days) and 55% (n=10/18) were still in remission after a median follow-up of 319 days.</p><p>Development of tosedostat, an oral aminopeptidase inhibitor, has been somewhat turbulent because of adverse events observed in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Cell-Therapeutics-rises-after-FDA-lifts-hold-on-AMLMDS-drug-tosedostat-349074" target="_new">early trials</a> &ndash; and in particular its association with cardiac problems. However, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Dr Joseph Hedden said the drug's complete response rate of 45% in Phase II was "quite impressive given that it is an elderly population." But he noted benefits of the drug will have to be balanced against toxicity risks. In the latest Phase II study there is still some evidence of cardiac events in the reported TAEs (6%), he highlighted. CTI Biopharma is currently conducting a Phase II/III study of the drug itself in AML and the safety data from that trial will be "highly anticipated," Dr Hedden said. </p><p>"If CTI BioPharma can show that cardiac events are relatively low in frequency (like in this study) then it has a fair chance of approval, considering that when you target elderly patients you have to accept a certain degree of toxicity is inevitable," Dr Hedden told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>CTI BioPharma is pushing ahead with its own development agenda. Dr Alan K Burnett, global lead for myeloid diseases at CTI BioPharma, said in a statement about the latest Phase II study, "Based on the clinical data observed to date, we are advancing the development for tosedostat including the potential for a Phase III registrational study for primary acute myeloid leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia that evolves from myelodysplastic syndrome."</p><p>The Phase II multicenter clinical trial was designed to assess tosedostat (orally once-daily) in combination with intermittent LDAC (twice daily) in 33 elderly patients (median age = 75 years) with either primary AML or secondary AML after MDS.</p><h2>selecting biomarkers</h2><p>Meanwhile, one of the secondary endpoints of the Phase II investigator-led trial was to identify possible biomarkers associated with sensitivity and/or drug resistance.Â A gene expression profile (GEP) was performed on purified AML cells obtained from 29 patients. Analysis of these patient cells identified a molecular signature associated with clinical response (CR vs no CR). Based on the differentially expressed genes (n=212), samples were divided according to either CR or no CR. Results showed that these differentially expressed genes were associated with relevant biological functions and pathways &ndash; including B-catenin (beta-catenin), TNFA-NFkB, ERB2, inflammatory response, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition &ndash; and showed that the achievement of a CR could be efficiently predicted by GEP.</p>
