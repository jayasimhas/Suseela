<p>Smart companies are raising money to advance drug development programs while investors are pouring cash into the biotechnology industry. The latest to raise private capital: Oncobiologics, Ra Pharmaceuticals, RaNA Therapeutics and SutroVax.</p><p>Oncobiologics founder and CEO Pankaj Mohan told <i>Scrip</i> that the company raised $31m from institutional investors, including hedge funds and mutual funds, to ramp up production of its biosimilars and to increase its visibility among Wall Street-focused investors. Oncobiologics has a 90 employees working at a 50,000-square-foot development and manufacturing site in Cranbury, New Jersey and the company anticipates doubling the size of its facility and adding 100 employees during the next year.</p><p>The recent funding round was led by Perceptive Advisors with participation from Cormorant Global Healthcare Master Fund, Longwood Capital Partners, venBio Select Fund, Proximare Lifesciences Fund, OSSB Pharma Fund and MIH Fund. The financing is a precursor to a larger near-term funding attempt.</p><p>"It's the first time we took our story to the market. We didn't have marketing visibility and it was hurting our visibility in Wall Street. This sets the stage for a major raise in the next three to four months," Dr Mohan said.</p><p>Oncobiologics also will continue to develop partnerships outside of the US. The company has earned about $21.3m in licensing revenue to date from collaborations with Ipca Laboratories in India, Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co in China and Laboratorios Liomont in Mexico. </p><p>Oncobiologics expects to generate revenue from additional ex-US deals before the end of the year. The company previously raised $26m from various investors, including <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strides-invests-in-promising-Oncobiologics-352920" target="_new">Strides Arcolab</a>, and it assembled $20m in equipment financing.</p><p>The private equity, licensing revenue and other cash funded a technology platform designed to rapidly and efficiently develop and commercialize monoclonal antibody biosimilars. </p><p>Dr Mohan, whose background is in biologic development at Genentech and Bristol-Myers Squibb, said Oncobiologics has the ability to prosecute biosimilar programs at a faster pace and lower cost than its competitors. Both development and manufacturing are done in-house at the same site. The strategy saves time in the transfer of technology to manufacturing. It saves money, because manufacturing isn't outsourced.</p><p>Also, the company also has benefitted from big pharma and biotech layoffs in New Jersey. Biotech lab and manufacturing space is plentiful and relatively cheap, because of all the recent vacancies. And, Dr Mohan said, "We have talent from Pfizer, Merck, BMS and Imclone. One of our biggest strengths has been the ability to attract top talent from large pharma and biotech."</p><p>Oncobiologics has two products in the clinic, including a biosimilar for AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) that will enter Phase III soon. Phase I data for an Avastin (bevacizumab) biosimilar are expected in the next few weeks. Nine other products are in preclinical development and the company plans to take two assets into the clinic each year, based on its recent and forthcoming financings. Biosimilars for Genentech's Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Amgen's Prolia (denosumab) will enter the clinic in 2016. </p><p>"It is really critical for biosimilars to be developed in a model that provides pricing leverage," Dr Mohan said. "We have a fully integrated model that can move efficiently and manufacture at a lower cost. We can meet the same scientific rigor as a large pharma or biotech and get market penetration."</p><p><b>Ra, RaNA and SutroVax</b></p><p>Ra, RaNA and SutroVax each have novel therapies in development, but none of the companies are as far along in development as Oncobiologics. The closest is Ra Pharmaceuticals, which plans to begin its first clinical proof of concept studies in late 2015 for lead candidate RA101495 in multiple indications. The first clinical trial will test Ra's complement C5 inhibitor in the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). </p><p>Ra Pharmaceuticals raised $58.5m in Series B venture capital in a round led by RA Capital Management, Novo Ventures and Lightstone Ventures with participation from new investors Rock Springs Capital and Limulus Venture Partners as well as prior backers New Enterprise Associates, Novartis Venture Fund, Morgenthaler Ventures and Amgen Ventures. </p><p>The capital also will fund further development of the company's Extreme Diversity platform and additional therapies targeting diseases of the complement system. Ra was focused on a treatment for hereditary angioedema when it obtained the second tranche of a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ra-Pharma-to-use-extra-8.6-million-to-develop-peptide-cyclomimetics-for-HAE-330718" target="_new">Series A round</a> in 2012. Merck & Co recently <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-Ra-enter-into-Cyclomimetics-collaboration-341695" target="_new">extended a multi-target collaboration</a> with the company that was established in 2013. </p><p><i>RaNA</i></p><p>Merck also supported RaNA Therapeutics through its venture capital arm MRL Ventures. MRL and The Baupost Group co-led RaNA's $55m Series B round with participation from Rock Springs, Brookside Capital, Leerink Partners and an undisclosed "blue chip public investment fund."</p><p>With the financing, RaNA expects to have up to two therapeutic candidates in the clinic by 2017. The company is developing proprietary platforms focused on epigenetic gene upregulation and messenger RNA stabilization. The first treatments will address spinal muscular atrophy and Friedreich's ataxia.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Life-after-Merck-What-Idenixs-Renaud-did-next-355507" target="_new">RaNA CEO Ronald Renaud</a> has strong ties with Merck. The big pharma bought his last company, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-in-3.85bn-Idenix-buy-to-bolster-hep-C-outlook-352208" target="_new">hepatitis C drug developer</a> Idenix Pharmaceuticals, for $3.85bn in 2014.</p><p><i>SutroVax</i></p><p>The antibody-drug conjugate firm Sutro Biopharma, which signed a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sutro-EMD-Serono-deal-is-second-ADC-collaboration-for-both-354004" target="_new">licensing deal</a> in 2014 with Merck KGaA's US subsidiary EMD Serono, decided to spin its conjugate vaccine technology out in a new company called SutroVax. Abingworth led a $22m Series A round for SutroVax with participation from Longitude Capital, Roche Venture Fund and CTI Life Sciences Fund. The cash will fund preclinical proof of concept for multiple vaccines to prevent infectious diseases.</p><p><b>Venture cash flooding biotech</b></p><p>It appears that 2015 will be a record-breaking year for venture capital deals that back startup companies and follow-on rounds for early-stage drug developers. </p><p>A recent report from the venture capital-tracking firm CB Insights and accountants at KPMG notes that global VC investment totaled $32.5bn in the second quarter across industries. Health care companies received 11% of second quarter VC dollars &ndash; about $3.6bn.</p><p>CB Insights and KPMG reported that North American companies raised $19bn in venture capital during the second quarter compared with $15.6bn during the same quarter in 2014. The increase was attributed to investments by corporate VC funds as well as hedge funds, mutual funds and sovereign wealth funds that are chasing higher returns than they're seeing with other investments.</p><p>North American health care companies raised $2.95bn in the second quarter, including $1.32bn for 52 biopharmaceutical firms and $498.6bn for businesses involved in drug discovery and development. Another 71 companies involved in medical devices and diagnostics raised $1.03bn, while 68 companies involved in digital health and health care information technology raised $746.95m.</p><p>While CB Insights and KPMG peg North American VC investments in biopharma, drug discovery and development at $1.82bn, the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and its research partners recently reported <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-VC-deals-have-best-ever-quarter-2.3bn-359519" target="_new">$2.3bn in US biotech investment</a> in their quarterly MoneyTree Report. A small portion of the biotech venture capital data from NVCA, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Thomson Reuters includes funding for biosensors, biotech equipment, animal medicines and industrial biotech.</p><p><p><p><p>
