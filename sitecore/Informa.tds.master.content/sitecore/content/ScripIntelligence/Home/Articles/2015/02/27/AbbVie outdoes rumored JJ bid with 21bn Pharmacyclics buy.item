<p>AbbVie swooped in to buy Pharmacyclics for $21bn on 4 March after several days of speculation that the Sunnyvale, California-based biopharmaceutical firm would be acquired by its Imbruvica (ibrutinib) development partner Johnson & Johnson for as much as $19bn.</p><p>North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie will use a combination of cash, stock and new debt to pay $261.25 per share for Pharmacyclics, which is $30.77 more than the company's 4 March closing stock price of $230.48 &ndash; a 13.4% premium. Pharmacyclics shares have jumped about 22% since 24 February, around the time when rumors of an acquisition by J&J or another suitor began to circulate (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pharmacyclics-rockets-on-acquisition-speculation-356961" target="_new">26 February 2015</a>).</p><p>AbbVie was not one of the supposed buyers contemplated by market speculators, but the deal makes sense for a company that's trying to expand its portfolio while battling an onslaught of biosimilar competition for top-selling product Humira (adalimumab), especially after AbbVie abandoned its $53bn attempt to boost its rare disease prospects through an acquisition of Shire (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-drops-Shire-bid-354511" target="_new">16 October 2014</a>).</p><p>"The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is a strategically compelling opportunity. The addition of Pharmacyclics' talented and innovative team will add enormous value to AbbVie," AbbVie chairman and CEO Richard Gonzalez said in a statement from the company. </p><p>Pharmacyclics fanned the flames for pharma companies with a burning desire to add high-growth assets to their portfolios when the biopharma firm said it expects Imbruvica sales revenue to more than double from $492m in 2014 to $1bn in 2015 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pharmacyclics-says-Imbruvica-revenue-will-double-in-2015-356854" target="_new">20 February 2015</a>). </p><p>The sales guidance seemed to make J&J a natural buyer for Pharmacyclics, however, since the two share costs and profits for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, which is approved to treat four different hematological malignancies.</p><p><b>Oncology opportunity</b></p><p>Mr Gonzalez said "Imbruvica is not only complementary to AbbVie's oncology pipeline, it has demonstrated strong clinical efficacy across a broad range of hematologic malignancies and raised the standard of care for patients." </p><p>Pharmacyclics chairman and CEO Bob Duggan noted that "Team Pharmacyclics is honored and enthusiastic to join the AbbVie organization."</p><p>AbbVie's only marketed oncology drug is Lupron (leuprolide), a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist) that's approved to treat men with prostate cancer as well as women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis, and children with central precocious puberty. However, the company has five wholly-owned and partnered oncology drug candidates in Phase II and III development plus seven more in Phase I, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database.</p><p>The most advanced cancer therapies in AbbVie's pipeline are the PARP inhibitor veliparib, which is in Phase III for breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and Phase II for ovarian, brain and colorectal cancers plus melanoma; ABT-199 (venetoclax), which is in Phase III for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and Phase II for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); and elotuzumab, a Phase III multiple myeloma therapy with a breakthrough therapy designation from the US FDA (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AbbVie-starts-second-Phase-III-veliparib-study-351328" target="_new">16 April</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-AbbVies-venetoclax-gets-responses-in-pre-treated-AML-355534" target="_new">10 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-grants-BMSAbbVie-multiple-myeloma-drug-elotuzumab-breakthrough-status-351906" target="_new">20 May 2014</a>).</p><p>The Pharmacyclics acquisition "accelerates AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology, strengthening its already robust pipeline, and establishing its strong leadership position in hematological oncology &ndash; an attractive and rapidly growing market, now approaching $24 billion globally," AbbVie said on 4 March long after the stock market closed.</p><p>The pharma company sees additional opportunities for the Pharmacyclics assets as well, including potential solid tumor indications for Imbruvica. AbbVie also will apply its expertise to early-stage immunology programs at Pharmacyclics.</p><p><b>Biosimilar Humira threat</b></p><p>Immunology is AbbVie's biggest revenue generating therapeutic area, because of Humira. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor is approved in the US and many other markets to treat various types of arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and plaque psoriasis. However, the company's $12.5bn in annual Humira sales as of 2014 (up 11% from 2013), are under attack from biosimilar competitors.</p><p>Amgen reported results from a second positive Phase III study a month ago for its biosimilar Humira, which may put the company on track to commercialize its copycat version of AbbVie's blockbuster when the anti-TNF therapy's patents begin to expire in 2016 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/More-Phase-III-success-with-Amgens-biosimilar-Humira-356545" target="_new">4 February 2015</a>). </p><p>Pfizer and its recent acquisition target Hospira each have Humira biosimilars in development as well, but Pfizer's candidate is in Phase I and Hospira's biosimilar with Celltrion is preclinical (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wheres-the-value-in-Pfizers-17bn-Hospira-buy-356578" target="_new">6 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Zydus Cadila launched a Humira biosimilar in India at the end of 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zyduss-fingerprint-match-Humira-version-debuts-in-India-355530" target="_new">9 December 2014</a>).</p><p>To combat the coming decline in brand-name Humira revenue and build up its oncology portfolio, AbbVie will initiate a tender offer to acquire outstanding Pharmacyclics common stock for cash, AbbVie stock or a combination of cash and AbbVie shares. The aggregate deal consideration will be 58% cash and 42% stock. The Pharmacyclics purchase is expected to close in mid-2015.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
