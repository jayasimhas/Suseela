<p><p>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, the non-profit subsidiary of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, is expanding a long-running collaboration with Sanofi's Genzyme. The research agreement is searching for treatments for cystic fibrosis patients with certain genetic mutations.</p><p>The duo announced the $14m expansion on 16 April. The collaboration is doing research and development work to find treatment for patients with the F508del mutation, the most common genetic mutation amongst CF patients, affecting nearly 90% of people with the disease. </p><p>According to the companies, the F508del mutation causes problems with the folding of the defective proteins and keeps them from migrating to the surface of the cell where the protein is needed to regulate the intake of salt and fluid. </p><p>The initial collaboration was established in 2011, but financial details were not disclosed. Since then, the duo has discovered several compounds that have shown in laboratory tests that they help the protein reach the surface of the cell. </p><p>Genzyme will now be tasked with making those compounds ready for clinical trial. </p><p>"We are pleased to continue CFFT&rsquo;s agreement with Genzyme and are excited by the possibilities of what our pooled knowledge expertise and resources can bring," said Dr Robert J. Beall, president and CEO of the CF Foundation, in a statement. </p><p>The CF Foundation has had plenty of success with its partnering programs &ndash; the patient group contributed $150m to Vertex Pharmaceuticals for the development of its blockbuster Kalydeco (ivacaftor), the first drug approved to treat the underlying cause of the disease. In November 2014, the foundation <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CF-Foundations-3.3bn-royalty-sale-will-fund-drugs-services-355181" target="_new">sold its royalty rights</a> to the drug to Royalty Pharma for $3.3bn. </p><p>Amongst the other medicines funded by CFF are the Phase III RNA-based therapy Ataluren (PTC124) from PTC Therapeutics for nonsense mutation CF; N6022, a Phase I injectable therapy from N30 Pharmaceuticals that modulates CFTR; Pharmaxis's Bronchitol, a Phase III inhaled dry powder form of the osmotic agent mannitol; and Roche/ Genentech's approved product Pulmozyme (dornase alfa), an inhaled medication to thin and clear mucus from the airway.</p><p>Disease foundations have taken <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ANALYSIS-Disease-foundations-sharpen-the-knife-to-spread-the-wealth-337204" target="_new">on the crucial role</a> of funding early disease research in hopes of contributing to a cure or disease-modifying treatment. These foundations have become increasingly savvy at choosing which programs they are going to put their cash behind.</p><p><p>
