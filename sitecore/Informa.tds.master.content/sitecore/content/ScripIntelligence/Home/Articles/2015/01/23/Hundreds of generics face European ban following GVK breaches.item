<p>Several hundred generic medicines look set to have their marketing authorizations suspended in Europe following an investigation by the European Medicines Agency after the French medicines agency ANSM uncovered data manipulation by the Indian contract research organization GVK Biosciences.</p><p>The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) says it looked at over 1,000 pharmaceutical forms and strengths of generic medicines for which clinical studies had been carried out by Hyderabad-based GVK. Although it has cleared more than 300 as having sufficient supporting data from other sources, it has recommended the suspension of all of the others, unless they are of critical importance for patients because alternatives will not be able to meet patients' needs.</p><p>The committee's recommendation will be sent to the European Commission for a legally binding decision. Some member states, including Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg had already suspended products (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Germany-suspends-80-products-linked-to-Indian-CRO-problems-355527" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 9 December 2014</a>). The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it would await the EC decision. If the recommendation is adopted, "we will work with our colleagues at the Department of Health to ensure people have access to the medicines they need," said Dr Samantha Atkinson, deputy director of MHRA's inspection, enforcement and standards.</p><p>The data concerns center on evidence of systematic manipulation of electrocardiogram records during the conduct of nine generic medicines studies over a period of at least five years. "Their systematic nature, the extended period of time during which they took place and the number of members of staff involved cast doubt on the integrity of the way trials were performed at the site generally and on the reliability of data generated at that site," said EMA. </p><p>However, GVK has argued that EMA's "action is unprecedented and highly disproportional" given that the ANSM had said that the check-out ECGs were not essential given the demonstration of bioequivalence" and that "the observations made should not be extrapolated to other trial-related activities at the same site (bioanalytical, pharmacokinetic and statistical activities) or to [its] other site in Ahmedabad". It also said: "There is no direct impact of "check-out" ECGs [which are conducted before volunteers leave the clinic as an additional safety test] on the bioequivalence studies."</p><p>The EMA responded that the findings from the current review did only apply to generic medicines for which studies had been conducted at GVK's Hyderabad.</p><p>The agency has stated that there was no evidence to date that the products concerned posed a risk to human health or lacked effectiveness. </p><p>The complete list of products and companies that CHMP has recommended suspending is available on the EMA's website. It includes hundreds of dosage strengths and forms of tens of products sold by around 100 companies across the EU. Companies include Actavis, Dr Reddy's, Glenmark, Generics (UK), Lupin, Mylan, Ranbaxy, Ratiopharm, Sandoz, Teva, Torrent Pharma and Wockhardt. Medicines include atorvastatin, candesartan, clopidogrel, desloratadine, donepezil, escitalopram, esomeprazole, fluconazole, metformin and tacrolimus.</p><p>The European Generic medicines Association (EGA) called for "a strengthening of international inspection capabilities in the area of Good Clinical Practices (GCP) in order to avoid such issues affecting multiple companies in the future."</p><p>For medicines that are considered critical, companies will be given 12 months to submit additional data.</p><p>Last month GVK Biosciences' CEO argued that its processes were rigorous and the actions of European agencies were overblown (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Fudged-ECG-reports-GVK-blunder-or-overblown-storm-355513" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 9 December 2014</a>).</p><p>
