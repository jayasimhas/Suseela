<p>It was always likely the fates of BioMarin Pharmaceutical's and Sarepta Therapeutics' experimental Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drugs were going to be bumping up against each other &ndash; although the former firm's product is a ahead of the latter in the regulatory process.</p><p>On 29 June, BioMarin said its new drug application (NDA) for drisapersen was granted a priority review by the FDA, which set 27 December as the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date. </p><p>Meanwhile, potential DMD competitor Sarepta had news of its own on 29 June &ndash; disclosing it had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarepta-rolls-with-eteplirsen-NDA-new-FDA-relationship-358527" target="_new">completed its rolling NDA</a> for eteplirsen, which it initiated in May.</p><p>Sarepta said it also is seeking a priority review for eteplirsen. </p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the chances of BioMarin gaining the FDA's blessing for drisapersen at 84%, which is 5% below the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>The <i>BioMedTracker</i> analysts had a slightly lower prediction for Sarepta winning the agency's nod for eteplirsen &ndash; putting it at 83%.</p><p>Neither firm had a particularly good day on Wall Street on 29 June &ndash; likely to due to the panic over the financial crisis in Greece, which was on the verge of defaulting.</p><p>BioMarin's investors nudged its stock up $1.45, or about 1%, before it dropped $3.27, or 2.4% &ndash; closing at $132.33, down $2.53, or 1.9%.</p><p>Shares of Sarepta plunged 10.3%, or $3.23, before closing at $28.18, down $3.08, or 9.85%. </p><p>BioMarin confirmed the FDA told it to expect an advisory committee on its drisapersen NDA, although the date of that event has yet to be revealed.</p><p>Most on Wall Street expected the same panel to also review Sarepta's application for eteplirsen. </p><p>BioMarin and Sarepta are both seeking approval of their experimental drugs as therapies to treat patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping.</p><p>Duchenne is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood &ndash; affecting about 1 in every 3,500 live male births, with about 20,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year. </p><p>BioMarin, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioMarin-completes-rolling-NDA-for-Duchenne-drug-drisapersen-358083" target="_new">completed its rolling NDA</a> for drisapersen in April, obtained its drug through the firm's acquisition of Prosensa, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Drisapersen-rolling-NDA-gets-underway-Prosensa-rises-354415" target="_new">initiated the application</a> last fall.</p><p>In June 2013, the FDA granted drisapersen a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-breakthrough-for-GSKProsensa-DMD-drug-drisapersen-rattles-Sarepta-344477" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a>, which is intended to expedite the regulatory process. The investigational drug also has won orphan drug designation and fast-track status in the US.</p><p>"It is a sign of great progress to witness multiple companies working on multiple therapies to urgently get treatments to our families," declared Dr Laura Hagerty, scientific program officer at the Muscular Dystrophy Association.</p><p>But with little visibility into the FDA's decisions on the drugs, RW Baird analyst Brian Skorney said he believed "success will be contingent not only on drisapersen's acceptance but eteplirsen's rejection, and see compelling reasons for the agency to go in any direction."</p><p>"We think the likelihood is that both drugs share the same fate as neither data set is convincing of an effect and both are supposed to do the exact same thing," he said in a 29 June research note.</p><p>Mr Skorney said he was somewhat surprised the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/EU-filing-for-DMD-candidate-drisapersen-358904" target="_new">EMA only granted a standard</a>, rather than an accelerated, review for drisapersen.</p><p>But, he said, while drisapersen's fate is intertwined with eteplirsen's in the US, the destiny of BioMarin's drug in Europe is contingent on another DMD medicine altogether &ndash; PTC Therapeutics' ataluren.</p><p>The EMA granted conditional approval to ataluren last year, after PTC appealed a prior rejection, despite a failed randomized study &ndash; a controversial decision that was made with the expectation that results from a confirmatory trial expected this fall will determine whether regulators there were right or wrong, Mr Skorney said.</p><p>"We believe the EMA decision to grant drisapersen a standard review may be driven by a desire to see ataluren results well ahead of a decision date for drisapersen," he said. </p><p>A positive outcome for the ataluren Phase III would "embolden the EMA to take on the risk of approving another marginal data set for a DMD indication, whereas failure would likely cause the regulators to rethink the level of evidence they need before granting approval," Mr Skorney predicted. </p><p>He noted investors should expect to hear by 29 August whether the FDA has accepted the eteplirsen NDA.</p><p>If granted a priority review, Sarepta could have a decision by 29 February 2016 &ndash; Leap Day, "a fitting PDUFA for what is certainly one of the smallest clinical data sets to be reviewed for a drug approval," Mr Skorney said.</p><p>Sarepta also disclosed on 29 June it had entered into a credit and security agreement with Midcap Financial for a senior secured term loan facility to borrow up to $40m at an annual rate of 7.75%, with a maturity of June 2018.</p><p>Sarepta said it already has drawn down $20m under the facility and has the right to repay all borrowed funds and terminate the facility at any time.</p><p>"Although we are not in love with development-stage biotechs doing debt deals, this facility does provide a capability to keep a nice cash position at a decent cost of capital," until the company can raise at a more favorable stock price, Mr Skorney said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
