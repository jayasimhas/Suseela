<p><p>Agenus is adding to its capabilities in checkpoint inhibitors with the licensing of antibody programs from Italy's Diatheva. </p><p>The Massachusetts biotech announced 20 July that it has gotten the worldwide development and commercialization rights to Diatheva's CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1) program. Agenus will pay a total of $44m including upfront and early development milestones, and Daitheva is eligible for potential sales milestones and royalties on any products that result. The programs are currently preclinical. </p><p>CEACAM1 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on T-cells and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including lung, colon, melanoma, bladder and pancreatic cancers. </p><p>&ldquo;CEACAM1 is emerging as a powerful immune modulator, with significant evidence that blocking its interactions could strengthen immune cells&rsquo; attack on cancer,&rdquo; said Agenus CSO Dr Robert Stein. </p><p>The CEACAM1 program from Diatheva fits into the Agenus portfolio, which already includes several other checkpoint inhibitors that work against popular targets like PD-1, CTLA-4 and TIM-3. An important part of the immuno-oncology story is combination therapies; the licensing deal gives Agenus more room to experiment with different combinations. CEACAM1 has been shown in animal models to coordinate well in TIM3 and is complementary to PD-L1 &ndash; the most popular target in the immuno-oncology space. </p><p>&ldquo;Diatheva&rsquo;s anti-CEACAM1 monoclonal antibodies expand and complement our broad portfolio of checkpoint modulators and personalized cancer vaccines, with the potential to create best-in-class combination therapies for treating patients with cancer," said Dr Stein. </p><p>The deal complements another recent deal Agenus conducted, when it bought privately-held European biotech 4-Antibody for $10m in stock upfront and another $40m in potential earn outs. </p><p>More recently, Agenus inked a deal with Incyte to development combinations in the immuno-oncology space. Under the five-year partnership, Incyte and Agenus split costs and profits equally for checkpoint modulator programs targeted at GITR and OX40. Agenus is also eligible for royalties on TIM-3 and LAG-3 programs that Incyte is taking forward on its own. The biotech is also partnered with Merck & Co on some of these assets. </p><p>Expect Agenus to discuss its plans for the new programs during its 23 July earnings call. </p><p><p>
