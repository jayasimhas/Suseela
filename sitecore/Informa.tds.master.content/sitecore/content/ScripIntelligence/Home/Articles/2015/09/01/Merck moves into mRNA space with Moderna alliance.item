<p>Moderna Therapeutics, the subject of the largest ever biotech private equity fundraising of $450m earlier this month (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Moderna-raises-450m-most-ever-for-private-biotech-355938" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 January 2015</a>), has signed a license and collaboration agreement with Merck & Co for the discovery and development of vaccines and passive immunity treatments against viral diseases using modified messenger RNA (mRNA). </p><p>Moderna's work in the collaboration will be led by Valera, its subsidiary entirely focused on the development of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics for infectious disease.</p><p>The three-year research collaboration (with the possibility of a one-year extension) is focused on the development of new mRNA-based treatments and vaccines against four undisclosed viruses. Under the agreement, Merck will make an upfront cash payment to Moderna of $50m which gives Merck commercialization licenses to five product candidates. It will also make a $50m equity investment in Moderna, which is in addition to the $450m financing announced recently, Moderna clarified. </p><p>Moderna can also earn per-product development and commercial milestones under the license as well as royalties on any sales. Merck will lead the discovery and development of candidates and commercialization of any products resulting from the agreement, while Moderna will design and synthesize the messenger RNA product candidates directed against the selected targets. </p><p>In addition to this deal with Merck, Moderna has ongoing agreements with Alexion Pharmaceuticals in rare diseases, AstraZeneca in cardiovascular disease and some areas of oncology, and DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in biodefense. </p><p>AstraZeneca paid $240m upfront when it signed a deal for the right to use Moderna's technology on 40 different drug candidates (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Another-2300-AstraZeneca-jobs-go-but-simplification-will-lead-to-growth-says-Soriot-341386" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 21 March 2013</a>).</p><p>Moderna has raised $950m since its inception in 2011 from venture capital investors even though the company has yet to take a single program into the clinic. The company's discovery activities and its 45 preclinical programs are based on a proprietary approach for using modified mRNA to instruct native cellular machinery to make therapeutic proteins in vivo.</p><p>
