<p>There are a number of factors why industry has been hesitant to invest in new antibiotics, said Dr Julie Gerberding, executive vice president of strategic communications, global public policy and population health at Merck and the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the George W Bush administration.</p><p>"We are now operating in an environment where the productivity of our research and development is under intense scrutiny," she told attendees during a session at the annual meeting in Philadelphia of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), which is changing its name in early 2016 &ndash; replacing "industry" with "innovation."</p><p>"We can't place the same bets that we used to be able to place even 10 years ago," Dr Gerberding said. "So it's harder for something to pass the threshold of investment if we don't have confidence in the predictability and reliability there will be a successful market for the drug when we go forward."</p><p>The main problem with antibiotics, said Dr Kenneth Hillan, CEO of biotech Achaogen, "is fundamentally, they really don't make economic sense."</p><p>"It's very, very hard to make money and to then reinvest into discovering and developing," Dr Hillan said, adding that venture capitalists don't find antibiotics interesting.</p><p>"So the funding is going to have to come, at least initially, from someplace else," he said.</p><p>Dr Hillan suggested the <i>Orphan Drug Act</i> model should be used to incentivize antibiotic development.</p><p>"That's been an enormous success," he told attendees at the BIO session, Investment Incentives to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance.</p><p>"Our concern about the pipeline is we need the reassurance that we can be reimbursed at a price that will make the investment worthwhile," Dr Gerberding said.</p><p>But, she said, "We have to do that in such a way that the patients who need the drugs get them but in a way that doesn't incentivize people to use them when they shouldn't."</p><p>Makers of antibiotics are "now in a different mindset of enlightened self-interest where we don't want to over-utilize these drugs because we want to sustain their value for a long period of time," Dr Gerberding said. "For the small number of companies that have stayed in the business, we need to be able to accelerate the development of the things that we think are good and are coming and make sure the market will support their utilization when they finally emerge. And that requires not just action in US but global perspective."</p><p><b>Advocacy?</b></p><p>Dr Steve Solomon, of Global Public Health Consulting and the former director of the CDC's Office of Antimicrobial Resistance, said there are "some good things happening" with investment and support in the US.</p><p>He pointed to funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the recent efforts by President Barack Obama to get Congress to back his <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">antimicrobial resistance (AMR) initiative</a> with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">$1.2bn</a>.</p><p>"President Obama was the first president in history to make antibiotics resistance a priority, to put it in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">State of the Union</a>," Dr Solomon said.</p><p>Dr Gerberding also noted the White House even hosted a forum earlier this month focused on AMR &ndash; a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-superbug-summit-Saving-miracle-antibiotics-358716" target="_new">superbug summit</a> &ndash; at which her firm and several other pharmaceutical firms and other human and animal health stakeholders participated.</p><p>Dr Solomon said he was surprised about the lack of advocacy from the patient community for AMR.</p><p>"It's not clear why we have not been successful in making it an issue that people will coalesce around," he said.</p><p>But Dr Helen Boucher, director of Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program in the Division of Geographic Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Tufts Medical Center, had a stark response to that question.</p><p>"A lot of our patients aren't here, they don't have a voice, because they are dead," she said.</p><p>Dr Boucher also said it's hard to get hospitals to talk about AMR because they don't want to be put in the spotlight, having to publicly admit their facilities are confronting the problem. </p><p>But Lord Jim O'Neill, chairman of Review on Antimicrobial Resistance &ndash; an independent project commissioned in 2014 by UK Prime Minister David Cameron and funded by the Wellcome Trust &ndash; noted that some organizations are being more upfront about the issue of AMR.</p><p>He pointed to the US-based fast-food chain McDonalds, which in March announced it was moving to antibiotic-free chicken.</p><p>The company likely realized, Lord O'Neill said, that it was not only a "cool" trend, but that it needed to make the move to stay ahead of its competitors on the matter.</p><p><i>Our daily &ldquo;BIO 2015 Dispatches&rdquo; draw on the combined forces of Scrip Intelligence and The Pink Sheet staff, reporting from the Philadelphia meeting.</i></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
