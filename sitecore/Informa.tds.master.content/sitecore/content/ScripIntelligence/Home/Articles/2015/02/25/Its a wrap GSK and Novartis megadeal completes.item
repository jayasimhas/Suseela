<p>GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis have completed the landmark three-part transaction that they announced last April. GSK, which is affected more significantly than its larger European peer by the resulting changes, says it will hold an investor meeting on 6 May where it will provide 2015 earnings guidance and profile the medium and long-term shape of the company.</p><p>GSK hopes the $20bn transaction will give it a much-needed shot in the arm. When presenting the company's 2014 annual results recently, CEO Sir Andrew Witty said he was not ruling out a major corporate reorganization of the following closing of the deal. "I don't have a religious commitment to any specific kind of corporate structure," he said (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-2014-revenues-fall-but-shares-climb-on-upbeat-respiratory-talk-356544" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 February 2015</a>). "It would be disingenuous of me to say that the Novartis transaction doesn't give us options for different structures that may enhance shareholder value." </p><p>Meanwhile, GSK's is also considering an IPO of its HIV joint venture ViiV. However, Sir Andrew indicated he was in no rush to make a decision on when, where or even if a flotation would occur. </p><p><b>mega deal summary</b></p><p>In brief, the three-part transaction sees GSK acquire Novartis's global vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines) for an initial cash consideration of $5.25bn. A consumer healthcare joint venture has been created between the companies where GSK has majority control and an equity interest of 63.5%. In addition, GSK has divested its Oncology business for an aggregate cash consideration of $16bn. Meanwhile, Novartis sold its animal health business to Eli Lilly.</p><p>The net after tax proceeds of the deal to GSK are around $7.8bn. Under the terms deal, up to $1.5bn of that purchase price would have to be returned to Novartis if certain conditions relating to the COMBI-d trial are not met. However, following positive results from this study (announced by GSK in early February), GSK believes these conditions will be satisfied.</p><p>Overall survival (OS) results from COMBI-d demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death for the combination of dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and trametinib (Mekinist) compared to dabrafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. </p><p>Following this result, GSK says it is confident enough to plan the return of &pound;4bn of the transaction proceeds to shareholders. </p><p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Wittys-bonus-scythed-as-GSK-still-recovers-from-China-scandal-356983" target="_new">Witty's bonus scythed as GSK still recovers from China scandal</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-bolsters-vaccine-portfolio-ahead-of-Novartis-influx-356702" target="_new">GSK bolsters vaccine portfolio ahead of Novartis influx</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-sells-flu-vaccine-business-at-knockdown-rate-354672" target="_new">Novartis sells flu vaccine business at knockdown rate</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-NovartisGSKLilly-swapping-extravaganza-explained-351569" target="_new">INFOGRAPHIC: Novartis/GSK/Lilly swapping extravaganza explained</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-in-28.5bn-mega-deal-with-GSK-Lilly-351395" target="_new">Novartis in $28.5bn+ mega-deal with GSK, Lilly</a></p>
