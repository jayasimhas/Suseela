<p>Santhera Pharmaceuticals' Raxone (idebenone) has garnered a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the treatment of visual impairment in adolescent and adult patients with Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). </p><p>The thumbs-up is the result of Santhera's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Santhera-makes-its-second-EU-approval-bid-with-Raxone-351647" target="_new">second attempt</a> to get Raxone onto the European market. Its original application was withdrawn in 2013 to allow further clinical evidence to be added to the dossier, and the product was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cash-strapped-Santhera-pulls-Raxone-MAA-341432" target="_new">re-filed last year</a>.</p><p>LHON is a heritable mitochondrial disease that leads to blindness. </p><p>The CHMP's decision was hailed as a "major breakthrough" as it "paves the way for the first medicinal product to become available for the treatment of a mitochondrial disease," stated Dr Thomas Klopstock, professor for neurology at the University of Munich, LHON investigator and coordinator of the German network for mitochondrial disorders, mitoNET. "LHON is a severe form of vision loss caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Affected patients, usually young and otherwise healthy, rapidly lose central vision and become bilaterally blind within a few months from the onset of symptoms. The mode of action of idebenone provides a clear biochemical and medical rationale and the clinical data demonstrate that vision of affected patients can substantially improve upon treatment with Raxone." </p><p>Dr Klopstock believes the recommendation is a "landmark" in mitochondrial disease research worldwide and will "undoubtedly spur further research in this direction."</p><p>The CHMP based its recommendation for Raxone on data from the RHODOS trial, Santhera's Expanded Access Program, and comparative natural history data from a comprehensive case record survey. The committee considered that the totality of the data provided for an orphan disease as severe as LHON with no available treatment options warranted a recommendation for approval under Exceptional Circumstances. Santhera will gather additional long-term efficacy and safety data in LHON patients as post-authorization measures. </p><p>Idebenone, a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for LHON.</p><p>
