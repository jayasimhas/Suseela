<p>The FDA on 8 January finally gave its blessing to Impax Pharmaceuticals to market its Parkinson's disease drug Rytary, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa.</p><p>Shares of Impax soared more than 16%, before closing at $34.60, a gain of $3.61, or 11.6%.</p><p>Specifically, the drug is approved to treat Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. </p><p>The FDA initially had rejected Rytary in January 2013, citing inspection issues at the firm's manufacturing facility &ndash; problems that had continued to plague the company over the past year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/More-FDA-inspection-problems-plague-Impax-353190" target="_new">5 August 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/GSKs-European-Rytary-ambitions-unclear-on-US-setback-339337" target="_new">30 July 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Warning-letter-could-delay-Impaxs-Rytary-again-353117" target="_new">24 January 2013</a>).</p><p>Impax had been partnered with GlaxoSmithKline on Rytary, but the London pharma giant pulled out of the deal (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-dumps-Impaxs-Parkinsons-candidate-342611" target="_new">30 April 2013</a>).</p><p>Impax plans to make four strengths of Rytary available in the US by next month: 23.75mg/95mg, 36.25mg/145mg, 48.75mg/195mg, and 61.25mg/245mg.</p><p>The drug's clinical program studied patients with early to advanced Parkinson's in the US and Europe. Impax's APEX-PD, which enrolled 381 levodopa-naive patient, met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in the sum of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II activities of daily living score and UPDRS Part III motor skills score for Rytary versus placebo at week 30 or early termination.</p><p>In the firm's ADVANCE-PD trial, which enrolled 393 patients with advanced Parkinson's, the results showed Rytary reduced the percentage of "off" time of 36.9% to 23.8% from baseline, versus immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa of 36.0% to 29.8% during waking hours to end of study.</p><p>Rytary also increased "on" time without troublesome dyskinesia during waking hours, versus baseline to end of study by 1.8 hours. </p><p>Less "off" time was primary related to more "on" time without troublesome dyskinesia, the company said. </p><p>The most common adverse reactions with Rytary were nausea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams, dry mouth, dyskinesia, anxiety, constipation, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension.</p><p><p><p><p>
