<p>It's a new year and a refreshed start for Valeant Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>The acquisitive company &ndash; which failed to secure a takeover of Allergan last year &ndash; has upped its 2015 guidance and announced renewed tactics to focus on the acquisition of a number of smaller businesses instead of a megadeal. </p><p>Valeant is updating its guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014 and now expects to realize revenue of approximately $2.2bn and cash EPS of approximately $2.55 or more. Its adjusted cash flow from operations is expected to be greater than $600m. </p><p>CEO and chair J Michael Pearson said on an 8 January conference call "This new guidance absorbs the negative headwinds from foreign exchange of approximately $50m to the revenue line and approximately $0.10 to cash EPS since October." </p><p>He added that the Canadian firm, which lost out on buying Allergan to a $66bn bid from Actavis (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 18 November 2014</a>), will be active in the area of business development this year. </p><p>The company's CEO kept his comments on the Allergan saga brief. He said "Reflecting on 2014 it is probably most appropriate to begin by providing a post-mortem on our pursuit of Allergan. Clearly, we did not ultimately prevail in terms of consummating a deal, and we congratulate Actavis on their deal with Allergan. I remain convinced that the fit between Valeant and Allergan was unparalleled, and we would have ultimately prevailed absent another bidder."</p><p>Mr Pearson noted that though the company had been focused on its failed pursuit of Allergan it still managed over 25 tuck-in acquisitions for the year and the firm's acquisitive streak for 2015 has already kicked off. On 6 January Valeant bought a portfolio of specialty hospital products from Marathon. Valeant's CEO said the company's history lies with smaller acquisitions of private companies and it is what it will be doing more of in 2015. </p><p>Specifically, Valeant will be looking to grow its presence in some regions where it is subscale. Mr Pearson mentioned China as one particular country where the company will be looking to add on business. He added that Africa, the Middle East and Latin America are also areas of priority. </p><p>Though Valeant doesn't plan to change its business model any time soon, Mr Pearson thinks the company is juggling its areas of focus. He said "I do think it [company strategy] is evolving a little bit based on the products that we have. And the fact we have a number of exciting launch products with significant potential, means that we will spend a little bit more on sales and marketing as long as the growth supports it." He added that the company will be spending "a little bit more" also on R&D to support its pipeline programs; but its basic philosophies will remain. </p><p>As well as seeking new acquisition targets, Valeant will be focusing on two main existing areas specifically in the coming year: the further development of its dermatology business, and investment into Bausch + Lomb, the eye-care company it acquired in 2013. </p><p>
