<p>Teva's investigational drug SD-809 (deutetrabenazine) has hit its endpoint in moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia patients in a pivotal Phase II/III trial, top-line results show. The drug, which Teva acquired when it bought Auspex Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, is one of the leading candidates in this neurological disease, for which there are currently no approved treatments in the US.</p><p>These are the first pivotal results for Austedo in tardive dyskinesia and follow positive results for the drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Auspex-rises-on-Phase-III-Huntingtons-data-success-355704" target="_new">in Huntington's disease in December</a>. A filing in this indication had been slated for mid-2015.</p><p>The data will come as a relief for Teva as it is relying on its success in three indications for the product to validate the <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Teva-band-aids-issues-with-3.5bn-Auspex-deal-357579" target="_new">$3.2bn Auspex acquisition</a> and to boost its position in the CNS field. SD-809 was developed using Auspex's proprietary chemistry platform that modified existing treatments to improve their safety, efficacy and dosing regimens. The small molecule inhibits the vesicular monoamine 2 transporter (VMAT2) that is thought to regulate dopamine levels and it is being investigated for use in two other CNS diseases with unmet needs, Huntingdon's chorea and Tourette's syndrome. </p><p>SD-809 is one of only four products in clinical development for tardive dyskinesia, its chief competitor is Neurocrine's VMAT2 inhibitor valbenazine (NBI-98854) in Phase III (and also in earlier development for Huntingdon's chorea and Tourette's). The others are Medicure's MC-1 and Synchroneuron's controlled-release acamprosate, both at the Phase II stage.</p><h2>study details</h2><p>The international ARM-TD study randomized 117 patients with moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia to either SD-809 or placebo, titrated to optimal dosage over the course of six weeks, and then administered at that dose for a further six weeks to givie a total of 12 weeks' treatment.</p><p>Top-line data showed success for the primary endpoint of the change in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) from baseline to end of therapy, assessed by blinded centralized video rating. The SD-809 patients achieved an improvement of 3.0 points on the AIMS score from baseline to end of therapy compared with 1.6 points for placebo (p=0.0188) &ndash; a clinically meaningful effect.</p><p>It also demonstrated a positive trend in all secondary endpoints, including the safety and tolerability, including low rates of depression, somnolence, insomnia and akathisia with the drug that were similar or lower than in the placebo group. Further analysis is ongoing and full results will be shared at a future medical meeting and peer-review publication.</p><p>The principal investigator Dr Hubert Fernandez at the Cleveland Clinic described the results as "very encaouraging". He added, "There is a serious and growing medical need as tardive dyskinesia is one of the most debilitating and often irreversible side effects of dopamine receptor blocking agents&#8230; With no approved treatments of this serious condition currently available, the need for a therapeutic solution is urgent and overdue."</p><p>Analysts at BioMedTracker said that overall, the results appear quite positive with an impressive 3.0 improvement in AIMS score which compares favorably to the results observed in the Phase IIb KINECT2 study of Neurocrine's valbenazine. "Perhaps most surprising is the control arm of ARM-TD which resulted in a 1.6 point AIMS improvement making the statistically significant benefit with [SD-809] even more impressive." </p><p>A second pivotal study of fixed-dose SD-809 is underway, and the first results of that study are expected in 2016 followed soon after by regulatory filings, the analysts note. "With these first pivotal results, we are raising our likelihood of approval by 3%."</p><p><p>
