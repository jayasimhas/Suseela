<p>The FDA has given its blessing to Celgene to market Revlimid (lenalidomide) in combination with dexamethasone for use in newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma (NDMM). </p><p>Celgene's drug plus dexamethasone was initially approved in 2006 to treat multiple myeloma patients who had received at least one prior therapy.</p><p>But the company has been able to show that Revlimid improves the progression-free survival in patients newly diagnosed with the disease.</p><p>The approval was based on safety and efficacy results from Phase III studies, including the FIRST trial (MM-020/IFM 07-01), which evaluated continuous Revlimid in combination with dexamethasone until disease progression versus melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for 18 months as the primary analysis, and a fixed duration of 18 cycles of continuous Revlimid as a secondary analysis, in 1,623 newly diagnosed patients who were not candidates for stem cell transplant. </p><p>In this randomized, open-label, three-arm trial, median PFS was the primary endpoint of the study. PFS was significantly longer for patients receiving continuous Revlimid than for those treated with MPT, 25.5 months versus 21.2 months, respectively.</p><p>Median overall survival in the two groups was 58.9 months and 48.5 months, respectively.</p><p>Patients in the continuous Revlimid arm had a 25% reduction in the risk of death, versus those in the MPT arm. </p><p>Revlimid, a thalidomide analogue, also is approved in the US to treat transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. It&rsquo;s also approved for patients with mantle cell lymphoma whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib.</p><p>Because of its risk for severe birth defects, Revlimid is distributed under a mandatory risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program. </p><p>Shares of Celgene closed at $118.11 on 18 February, up $2.09, or 1.8%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
