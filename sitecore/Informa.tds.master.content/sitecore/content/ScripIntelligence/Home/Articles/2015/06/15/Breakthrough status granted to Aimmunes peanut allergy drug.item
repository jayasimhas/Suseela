<p>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) to Aimmune Therapeutics' investigational oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy, known as AR101.</p><p>Brisbane, California-based Aimmune said its drug, which is intended for children and adolescents 4-17 years, is a highly characterized, complex mixture of naturally occurring proteins and pharmaceutical-grade inactive ingredients for the treatment of peanut allergy &ndash; one of the most common food allergies.</p><p>Aimmune CEO Dr Stephen Dilly noted there currently are no approved medical therapies to treat the more than two million children and adolescents in the US and Europe with peanut allergy who are vulnerable to reactions from accidental exposures. </p><p>The company's drug is actually the second product being investigated as a peanut allergy treatment to gain the BTD status.</p><p>In April, French drug maker DBV Technologies revealed it won the designation for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/DBV-snags-1st-food-allergy-drug-breakthrough-status-357753" target="_new">Viaskin Peanut</a>. </p><p>As of 12 June &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 78 of the 260 BTD requests it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 132.</p><p>As of 31 May, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least 12 of the 50 requests it has received for the status, denying at least 37.</p><p>To <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Breakthrough-fees-FDA-urges-self-control-on-requests-358065" target="_new">gain BTD</a>, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i>, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.</p><p>Aimmune said the results of its randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study showed that AR101 as a desensitization treatment of peanut allergy showed that 100% of patients who completed the active treatment regimen tolerated exposure to a cumulative amount of at least 443mg of peanut protein, the company said. </p><p>The firm said 78% of those patients tolerated exposure to a cumulative amount of 1,043mg of peanut protein after being treated with AR101. </p><p>Based on those results, the company said it has plans to initiate a Phase III trial, although it did not disclose when that study will launch. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
