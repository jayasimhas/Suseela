<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd reported robust growth for the second quarter ended September, but plant-related concerns appear to weigh on the firm's near-term prospects.</p><p>The Hyderabad-based company reported an 11% increase in consolidated revenues to INR39.9bn ($609m) in the second quarter with net profits at INR7.2bn (+26%). </p><p>Dr Reddy's, however, said that during October two of its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) customers received ANDA approval "rescission" letters from the FDA. Each letter cites that Dr Reddy's API facility was classified as potential "Official Action Indicated (OAI)" on the date of approval. These ANDAs of customers were approved in January and February 2015, post the FDA's inspection of the Indian firm's API facilities. </p><p>Dr Reddy's top brass said that the development was "certainly a concern" but that the firm "continues its journey". </p><p>"We are updating the FDA and putting in significant resources in improving the systems and quality. How they [the FDA] will move ahead in future is more important, which is still unknown to us and we are engaging with them," Dr Reddy's chief operating officer, Abhijit Mukherjee, said in a post results investor call in response to an analyst's query.</p><p>An FDA inspection of the firm's API site in Srikakulam had earlier raised certain compliance issues, pushing the company to opt for a site transfer to retain its generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) opportunity. Last month Dr Reddy's launched <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Plan-B-takes-Dr-Reddys-Into-Hot-US-Nexium-Market-360726" target="_new">generic Nexium</a> delayed release capsules in the US. </p><p>Revenues from global generics segment grew 15% to INR32.8bn, primarily driven by North America, Europe and India. </p><p>US revenues stood at INR18.6bn (+32%), primarily on account of sustained performance of the injectable franchise and market share gains in key molecules. It was also backed by contribution from products launched subsequent to quarter ended Sept. 2014 &ndash; mainly products such as valganciclovir, sirolimus, memantine and Habitrol (an over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy transdermal patch acquired from Novartis Consumer Health).</p><p>Revenues from emerging markets slipped 22% to INR6.6bn, impacted largely by macro-economic factors. Performance was flat in constant currency terms wherein the growth in Russia and CISR regions was offset by the decline in Venezuela. </p><p>Mukherjee said that the company continues to be "cautious" and had calibrated supplies in Venezuela. Dr Reddy's had earlier re-evaluated its economic position following the modification of the currency exchange systems by the government of Venezuela in February 2015.</p><p>"The focus is on building a business model that can outlive the current macro-economic situation."</p><p>Dr Reddy's, Mukherjee added, had signed a deal with a part of the Government of Venezuela on some critical care products which are to be "tech-transferred into one of their facilities, which in turn will reduce healthcare costs and also provides a new line of [government assured] business."</p><p>Russian revenues declined 29% primarily on account of depreciation of rouble; in constant currency revenues grew by 11%. </p><p>Revenues from India stood at INR5.5bn(+14%) , while revenues from Europe surged to INR2.1bn (+65%), primarily driven by new products &ndash; aripiprazole and pregabalin &ndash; launched during the second half of fiscal 2015.</p>
