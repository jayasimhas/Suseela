<p>Placebos are having a good week, giving drug makers Alcobra and Transition Therapeutics troubling clinical trial results to report for their drugs meant to treat Fragile X syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Both companies' stock prices fell on 24 June after they disclosed trial results that showed placebos performed better than expected &ndash; and in Alcobra's case, better than the company's drug candidate. A day earlier, Vical's stock fell more than 40% after the company said placebo bested both versions of its therapeutic <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Vical-plummets-on-placebo-promise-in-herpes-study-359089" target="_new">genital herpes vaccine</a> in a Phase I/II study. </p><p>Following a Phase III failure for Alcobra's non-stimulant GABA modulator metadoxine (MDX) in the treatment of adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that was disclosed in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Alcobra-tumbles-on-Phase-III-ADHD-results-for-metadoxine-354315" target="_new">October</a>, the Israeli company now says that MDX failed in a Phase II Fragile X clinical trial. The primary endpoint was change in ADHD rating scale IV (ADHD RS-IV) scores and Alcobra said the results favored placebo.</p><p>Alcobra closed down 13% at $7.30 per share based on the Phase II Fragile X results. The relatively small dip, considering the company's stock price fell by more than 50% after the Phase III ADHD failure, indicates that investors may have expected negative results in the hard-to-treat disease. A second Phase III ADHD study in adults and a Phase II pediatric ADHD study are under way. </p><p>Transition's stock, on the other hand, took a major beating &ndash; the Canadian company's share price fell 74.2% to close at $2.35 on 24 June after Transition said "there was a greater than expected reduction in agitation and aggression observed in the placebo group" at each time interval that Alzheimer's patients were assessed in a Phase II/III study for ELND005.</p><p>The company reacquired ELND005 from Elan's purchaser Perrigo in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Perrigo-parts-with-Elan-Alzheimers-inheritance-350345" target="_new">March 2014</a>. Transition previously relinquished its 30% stake in the drug to Elan in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Transition-hands-over-Alzheimers-asset-to-Elan-ahead-of-Phase-III-307879" target="_new">late 2010</a>.</p><p>Both Alcobra and Transition are reassessing the paths forward for their drugs. Alcobra is particularly optimistic about MDX in Fragile X based on positive results on two out of five secondary endpoints in its clinical trial. MDX bested placebo in the intent-to-treat group with positive cognitive results related to daily living skills and distractibility.</p><p><p><p><p>
