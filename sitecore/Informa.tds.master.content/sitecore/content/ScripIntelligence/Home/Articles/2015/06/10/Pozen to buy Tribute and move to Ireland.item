<p>Pozen, which a week ago announced the immediate retirement of its founder, chairman and CEO John Plachetka, is to acquire Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada for $146m. On completion, slated for the end of 2015, the combined company will be named Aralez Pharmaceuticals and be domiciled in Ireland. </p><p>Pozen's lead proprietary product is Yosprala (PA8140/ PA32540), a combination immediate-release generic omeprazole and enteric-coated (EC) delayed-release aspirin tablets. Shares of Pozen <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-Pozens-Yosprala-again-shares-plummet-355702" target="_new">plummeted</a> in December after the company revealed the US FDA had for a second time rejected the company's new drug application (NDA) to market Yosprala.</p><p>Pozen also has two commercial pain products, Vimovo (naproxen and esomeprazole) and Treximet (sumatriptan / naproxen sodium), which are marketed by partners. Tribute's portfolio includes Fibricor (fenofibric acid), Bezalip (bezafibrate) SR and Visken (pindolol)/Viskazide (pindolol&ndash;hydrochlorothiazide) for various cardiovascular indications; Cambia (diclofenac) and Fiorinal (aspirin, butalbital, and caffeine) and Fiorinal C for acute migraines and tension headaches, respectively; and a range of other specialty products. </p><p>In connection with the acquisition, a syndicate of healthcare investors, led by Deerfield and including QLT, has committed up to $350m in growth capital for the combined company. The proposed investment in Aralez includes: </p><p>?$75m of equity at a purchase price of $7.20 per ordinary share; </p><p>?$75m in 2.5% convertible senior secured notes due six years from issuance with a conversion price of $9.54 per ordinary share; and </p><p>?Up to $200m committed senior secured debt facility to fund future acquisitions. </p><p>The combined company's initial focus will be on the commercialization of Yosprala and other cardiovascular products. </p><p>The new company will be led by Pozen's new CEO Adrian Adams. Mr Adams was most recently CEO and president of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals until its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Endo-wins-over-Auxilium-QLT-dropped-354371" target="_new">acquisition by Endo</a> for $2.6bn, a transaction which closed in January. Of note, the acquisition agreement with Endo prompted Auxilium to drop a proposed merger agreement with QLT.</p><p>"We are very pleased to join with Pozen," said Rob Harris, president and CEO of Tribute. "Our businesses are highly complementary and with access to additional, lower cost of capital, our ability to further expand our product portfolio increases significantly from where Tribute was prior to this transaction."</p><p>
