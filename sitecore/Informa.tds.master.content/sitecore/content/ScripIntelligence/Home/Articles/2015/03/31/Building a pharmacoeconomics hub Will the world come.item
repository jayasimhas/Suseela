<p>United Therapeutics chairman and co-CEO Dr Martine Rothblatt said her company doesn't shy away from challenges.</p><p>Indeed, one of United Therapeutics' mottos is to "identify the corridors of indifference and run like Hell down them," Dr Rothblatt declared.</p><p>It was with that attitude she threw out a challenge for the biopharmaceutical industry to work with academia and government to establish a pharmacoeconomics hub in the US under a public-private research venture, where the best and brightest minds could flesh out the answers to the challenging questions about the value of one therapy over another.</p><p>And Dr Rothblatt had just the place to set up such a hub &ndash; Maryland, where United Therapeutics is headquartered.</p><p>After all, she pointed out, Maryland not only is the home to the FDA and the National Institutes of Health &ndash; two of the most important agencies to the biopharmaceutical industry &ndash; but also to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), "which is the largest payer in the known universe." </p><p>The state also has several academic institutions, including the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University, which "we should take advantage of . . . to establish the number-one center of expertise in the fields of pharmacoeconomics and disease management," Dr Rothblatt said on 30 March at the 2015 Maryland Regional Biotech Forum, which was hosted at the Gaithersburg, Maryland headquarters of MedImmune, a unit of UK pharma giant AstraZeneca. </p><p>While pharmacoeconomics is "hugely important" to the biopharmaceutical industry and the healthcare community in general, and something for which there is a dire need, there's not a lot of coordinated work going on in that area in the US, Dr Rothblatt insisted &ndash; which she said means there's an opening for a public-private venture to be a "big fish in a small pond."</p><p>"There's a humongous opportunity," Dr Rothblatt said, suggesting that with CMS located in Maryland, local biopharmas, research institutions and other government agencies could work together to become a "powering strength" and a "world leader" in pharmacoeconomics by creating a hub. </p><p>CMS itself also could benefit from having such a collaborative enterprise nearby to tap as a reservoir of knowledge and wisdom, especially given the new domain the federal government is moving into under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i>, in which it is playing a larger role in prescribing practices with the establishment of the insurance exchanges, Dr Rothblatt concluded. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
