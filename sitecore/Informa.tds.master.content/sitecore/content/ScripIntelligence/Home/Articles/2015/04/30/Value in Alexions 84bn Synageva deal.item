<p><p>Ultra-rare disease biotech Alexion is laying down $8.4bn to add Lexington, Mass.-based rare disease company Synageva BioPharma into its arsenal in an effort to gain its protein therapeutics. Alexion is paying $115 per share in cash, as well as 0.6581 Alexion in shares in stock, about $230m, for the biotech. </p><p>The $8.4bn deal, which is expected to close in mid-2015, sent shares of Synageva skyrocketing &ndash; the stock jumped 112% to linger near $204 per share, after a close the previous day of $95. </p><p>"This transaction aligns with our exclusive focus on life transforming therapies, enables us to leverage our 50-country operating platform to establish a premier metabolic rare disease franchise; creates the most robust rare disease pipeline in biotech; and accelerates and diversifies our revenues, and will be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2018," said Alexion CEO David Hallal in an 06 May conference call with investors.</p><p>There is speculation that Alexion is paying too much; the big biotech has a market cap of about $33bn and the deal constitutes about a quarter of that. Also, much of Synageva's pipeline is preclinical and will take several years to pan out. The company is only expected to bring in $50m in revenues during 2018. </p><h2>A win for Alexion</h2><p>The value for Alexion comes from Synageva's Kanuma (sebelipase alfa), a treatment for lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency &ndash; a rare disease caused by a genetic mutation and characterized by a buildup of fatty tissue in the liver and the blood vessel walls. The drug was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and has a user fee action date of 08 September. Alexion is expected to give the drug a global launch this year. Analysts estimate that the drug could be worth $5m in 2015 and bring in as much as $493m in 2020. </p><p>Alexion believes that it can provide development, regulatory and commercial support for Kanuma that Synageva would not be able to give at its current size. </p><p>"We are acquiring Kanuma at the right point in time, before approval and when we can shape the global launch plans to serve the greatest number of patients with LAL-D," said Mr Hallal. "In evaluating LAL-D and Kanuma, we see substantial similarities with PNH and Soliris."</p><p>Alexion began as a small biotech focused on ultra-rare diseases; its lead product Soliris is now worth more than $2bn in revenues. </p><p>Aside from Kanuma, Synageva has a rare disease pipeline. SBC-103 for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidoses is expected to reach sales of $65m by 2020. "We view the acquisition as adding a near-term product launch and a significant clinical-stage pipeline program in '103, as well as several preclinical programs. Alexion is likely to add value to these programs via clinical and regulatory expertise, as well as by leveraging its global ultra-rare disease platform," wrote UBS analyst Matthew Roden in a 06 May note. </p><p>Mr Hallal sees a strong asset in Synageva, he noted during the conference call. "Our pipeline will now include the total of eight product candidates and 11 indications with three ongoing registration programs," said Mr Hallal. "In addition, Alexion will have more than 30 diverse pre-clinical programs across a range of therapeutic modalities, including 12 from Synageva's novel drug discovery platform. And we expect four of our combined pre-clinical programs to enter the clinic next year."</p><p><p><p>
