<p>Shire remains on track to double drug sales from $5bn in 2013 to $10bn in 2020, but its pending $5.2bn acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals &ndash; and other business development efforts &ndash; could add significantly to the five-year revenue forecast.</p><p>Chief executive officer Flemming Ornskov reviewed the $10bn by 2020 strategy that Shire outlined in December, but didn't preview full-year 2014 sales or offer any revenue guidance for 2015 during his 13 January presentation during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-pipeline-to-add-3bn-in-sales-by-2020-355556" target="_new">10 December 2014</a>). However, Dr Ornskov noted that even after the NPS deal announced on 11 January the company remains committed to adding commercial products and pipeline programs via acquisitions and licensing (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-paying-5.2bn-for-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-356071" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>). </p><p><i>Scrip</i> spoke with Shire's head of research and development Phil Vickers during the JP Morgan conference about the company's NPS acquisition and its business development priorities from an R&D perspective. </p><p>"We continue to balance what we do internally with things we bring in from the outside," Dr Vickers said. "For the 10-in-20 strategy that Flemming talks about, we have to do both to achieve that."</p><p>The NPS transaction was not factored in to Shire's $10bn sales forecast for 2020, however, and at least one stock analyst firm predicts that NPS's approved and lead drug candidates will bring in more than $1bn in annual sales.</p><p>Jefferies said in an 11 January research note that NPS previously forecast peak Gattex (teduglutide) sales at $350m per year, but Shire could increase the short bowel syndrome drug's sales based on its commercial expertise in Europe.</p><p>Leerink Swann estimated on 11 January that Gattex and Natpara (rhPTH[1-84]) for hypoparathyroidism (HPT) could generate annual sales of $500m and $575m, respectively, assuming that Natpara will win US FDA approval by the 24 January Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date assigned to NPS's biologic license application (BLA). </p><p>Dr Vickers said Shire's in-house regulatory experts looked closely at NPS's communications with the FDA regarding the Natpara BLA and "we are confident, based on what we've seen, that it will get approved."</p><p>Shire is focused on buying and licensing assets in therapeutic areas where it has domain expertise, including the gastrointestinal and rare disease areas that NPS is familiar with, and the ophthalmic and neurology markets where Shire also has expertise. The company looks to buy programs in all stages of clinical development and it partners with academia and venture capital-backed companies in early-stage research or drug development.</p><p>"We look broadly at what opportunities there may be," Dr Vickers said. "When we go out and look at things, it's not the size of the deal that counts; it's the value it could bring to the organization."</p><p>He noted that Shire has to be open to creativity in its dealmaking processes and willing to negotiate transactions quickly, while valuing the target company or asset appropriately and developing a plan to integrate newly acquired programs into the commercial, research and development portfolio. </p><p>Shire has 22 therapies in clinical development, which is the largest number of programs in the clinic at one time ever in the company's pipeline, leading Shire to develop its $10bn by 2020 sales forecast without taking NPS and other yet-to-be-named acquisition targets into account.</p><p><p><p><p>
