<p>Hayward, California-based Anthera Pharmaceuticals jumped 25% to close at $3.25 per share on 10 February after the company said an independent statistician recommended continuation of a Phase III lupus clinical trial for blisibimod following an interim analysis based on the trial's new primary endpoint.</p><p>Blisibimod failed to significantly improve symptoms for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Phase IIb study, but Anthera justified initiation of a Phase III clinical trial based on results for the highest dose &ndash; 200mg dosed once-weekly (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Anthera-says-final-Phase-IIb-data-back-blisibimod-despite-earlier-failure-332936" target="_new">18 July 2012</a>). The company expects to complete enrollment in the Phase III trial by mid-2015 and report the study's results by the third quarter of 2016.</p><p>The original primary endpoint for Phase III was the SLE Responder Index 8 (SRI-8) at 24 weeks. That's been changed to SRI-6, but SRI-8 will be a secondary endpoint.</p><p>"The SRI-6 endpoint has a history of consistency across multiple trials and represents the best possibility for success. Maintaining the SRI-8 endpoint as a key secondary endpoint can maximize our commercial opportunity for the severe patients we are enrolling in the CHABLIS-SC1 study," Anthera chief medical officer Colin Hislop said.</p><p>Blisibimod is a selective inhibitor of B-cell activating factor (BAFF) that's being developed to block abnormal elevations of B-cells that lead to autoimmune responses that cause diseases such as SLE and IgA nephropathy.</p><p>GlaxoSmithKline's Benlysta (belimumab) is the only approved BAFF for SLE or any other indication, and the drug generated $264m in 2014 sales. Eli Lilly gave up on its Phase III BAFF inhibitor in October after tabalumab failed in a SLE clinical trial (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-ditches-tabalumab-after-another-Phase-III-trial-fails-354268" target="_new">2 October 2014</a>). </p><p>There are only two other BAFF inhibitors in clinical development, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database: Merck KGaA's Phase II atacicept for SLE and the Phase II Novartis candidate VAY736 for multiple sclerosis and pemphigus vulgaris.</p><p>Sagient gives blisibimod a 55% likelihood of US FDA approval, which is 4% below average for drugs with similar indications and in the same phase of clinical development, due to the candidate's past Phase IIb failure.</p><p><p><p>
