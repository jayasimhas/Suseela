<p>Lupin reported marginal sales growth and a dip in net profits for the fourth quarter ended March 2015, jaded by tough conditions in the US, its key market.</p><p>The US accounted for 45% of Lupin's sales in the quarter ended March 2015.</p><p>Net sales for the quarter ended March 2015 stood at INR30.54bn ($478.2m) as against INR30.51bn in the corresponding period of the previous year, while net profits dipped to INR5.47bn (-1.1%) during Q4.</p><p>Lupin's managing director, Nilesh Gupta, said that higher price erosion in the US and a slowdown in product approvals impacted growth in the quarter, though the firm's overall performance saw improved gross margins and enhanced profitability for the year. </p><p>Net sales for the year ended March 2015 grew by 13.6% to about INR126bn with net profits up 30.9% to INR24.03bn.</p><p>The weak quarterly performance, however, pulled Lupin's shares down 3.35%, with the stock ending at INR1690.60 on 13 May on the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p><p>Mr Gupta said the company continued to ramp up investment in research in segments like inhalation, complex injectables and biosimilars. </p><p>"Our execution strength, pipeline evolution and planned M&A (merger and acquisitions) will drive our future as a global generic and specialty company." Analysts have in the past referred to Lupin's interest in small to medium sized deals largely around technology platforms or for geographic expansion.</p><p>Late 13 May India time, Lupin announced the acquisition of Medqu&iacute;mica Ind&uacute;stria Farmac&ecirc;utica, marking its entry into the Brazilian market. Medqu&iacute;mica, which offers branded and pure generics and OTC products, reported revenues of about $31m in 2014 and comes with more than 550 employees.</p><p>Lupin, which previously set up a dedicated centre of excellence for inhalation research in Florida, earlier this year entered into an <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-links-with-Polish-firm-to-jumpstart-Advair-generic-plans-356840%5d" target="_new">alliance</a> with the Polish biopharmaceutical firm Celon to jointly develop fluticasone/salmeterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), a generic version of Advair Diskus.</p><h2>US sales</h2><p>Lupin's US sales declined to $211m during the fourth quarter of FY15 as against $241m in the corresponding period of FY14.</p><p>Analysts have, over the recent past, also expressed concern over the risk to Lupin's Suprax (cefixime) after competitor Aurobindo Pharma received FDA approval for its cefixime for oral suspension 100mg/5mL and 200mg/5mL last month. The market size for the product is estimated at around $123m as per IMS data for the 12 months to February 2015.</p><p>Lupin introduced three products in the US in the quarter, taking the total number of launches there to 12, including InspiraChamber during FY15. The Indian firm now has 77 products on the US market. Lupin claims to be the market leader for 28 products in the US generics market.</p><p>Europe sales increased by 9% to INR891m during Q4 FY15; Japan sales declined by 9% to INR2.94bn during the period. </p><p>The Indian formulations business, however, reported robust numbers, contributing 22% of company's sales in the quarter. Sales in India were up 15% to INR6.63bn.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
