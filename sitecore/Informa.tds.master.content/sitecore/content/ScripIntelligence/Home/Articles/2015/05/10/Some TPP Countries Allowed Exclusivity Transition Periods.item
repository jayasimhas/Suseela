<p>Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam would be permitted to have transition periods of five to 10 years in implementing the biologic marketing exclusivity rules agreed to under the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), according to a document posted online on Oct. 9 by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks.</p><p>But the Washington consumer watchdog Public Citizen complained those transition periods are "too short" to expect that those four countries will be "substantially more able to absorb the rules' impact than they are today."</p><p>The TPP, whose negotiations officially <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Biopharma-Really-Lose-In-TPP-Trade-Deal-360829" target="_new">ended on Oct. 5</a> between the 12 nations involved &ndash; Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam &ndash; has two options for providing marketing exclusivity protection for innovator biologics against biosimilars: At least eight years from the date of first marketing approval for the brand-name product or at least five years from the date of first marketing approval with "other measures" and recognizing that market circumstances also contribute to effective market protection to deliver a comparable outcome.</p><p>Several of the TPP nations already have acknowledged the agreement does not require them to change their existing biologic exclusivity rules, including the US, which has 12 years of protection under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> &ndash; the 2010 law that gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars &ndash; and Australia, which has at least five years.</p><p>Currently, Brunei, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam have no marketing exclusivity protection for innovator biologics.</p><p><b>Crocodile Tears?</b></p><p>But even though those five nations would now be required to have at least five years of exclusivity &ndash; versus the zero years they currently have &ndash; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) expressed displeasure the TPP deal fell well short of the 12 years across-the-board for all participating countries the trade groups have been lobbying for over the past six years.</p><p>President Barack Obama invited a half dozen or so biopharma executives, including Merck's Kenneth Frazier, to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biopharma-Execs-Obama-Go-Face-To-Face-Over-TPP-360879" target="_new">White House on Oct. 8</a> to try to persuade them to back the TPP and to hear the industry leaders' concerns, although neither PhRMA's John Castellani nor BIO's Jim Greenwood &ndash; the trade groups' CEOs &ndash; were at the meeting.</p><p>But Public Citizen's Burcu Kilic, director of the group's Global Access to Medicines program, said the "monopolist pharmaceutical industry has won a lot with the TPP at the expense of people's health," and should "stop crying crocodile tears."</p><p><b>Transition Approach Favored</b></p><p>Public Citizen noted that an earlier draft of the of the intellectual property chapter leaked by Wikileaks in October 2014 showed the TPP negotiators were considering allowing poorer countries to forego certain IP rules until they reached a certain level of development, defined by an economic indicator.</p><p>But, the group said, that plan was abandoned in favor of the transition-period approach, which would require all participating nations to conform to every pharmaceutical patent rule in the TPP, regardless of any individual country's wealth &ndash; or lack thereof &ndash; or level of development. </p><p>The transition approach also would permit certain nations to postpone implementing marketing exclusivity for small molecules; patent linkage; extended exclusivity for new clinical information submitted to support marketing approval of a previously approved pharmaceutical covering a new indication, new formulation or new method of administration; and patent term adjustments for patent office delays or unreasonable curtailment as a result of the approval process.</p><p>According the document leaked by Wikileaks &ndash; which Public Citizen insisted is legitimate because he text does not contain "negotiating country brackets," indicating the rules are no longer subject to debate, but are the final version subject only to a legal "scrub" &ndash; Malaysia and Mexico would be allowed a five-year transition for implementing biologics marketing exclusivity rules, while Peru and Vietnam would be permitted to take up to 10 years. </p><p>But even with the transition periods, Public Citizen asserted generic and biosimilar competition would be delayed once the exclusivity rules are put in place &ndash; making the medicines more expensive and unobtainable for some patients. </p><p>A spokesman for the office of the US Trade Representative told <i>Scrip</i> that "While we can&rsquo;t confirm alleged leaked texts, we are in the process of finalizing the entire actual agreement so the American people can read every word of it."</p><p>"We are eager to show exactly how TPP levels the playing field for American workers and businesses," he said. "On intellectual property, the TPP agreement will achieve a strong and balanced outcome that supports innovation, access to medicines, a free and open internet and American jobs."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
