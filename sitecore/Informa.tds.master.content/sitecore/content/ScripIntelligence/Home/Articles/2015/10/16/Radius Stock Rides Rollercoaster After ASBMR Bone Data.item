<p>Radius Health Inc. continues to report positive results for its osteoporosis therapy abaloparatide, but the company's stock has been on a somewhat bumpy ride since results were presented at the recent American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) meeting.</p><p>At $61.09 per share, Radius is down from its 2015 peak of $80.63, but the stock still is 57% above its year-end 2014 value. And for a company with no marketed products, Radius's $2.6bn market cap seems to reflect investor enthusiasm for the near-commercial abaloparatide opportunity. The company is preparing to submit applications for US and EU approvals of subcutaneous abaloparatide by the end of this year, while earlier-stage development for an abaloparatide transdermal patch is ongoing.</p><p><b>Ahead Of New Competition</b></p><p>Waltham, Massachusetts-based Radius is going up against Amgen Inc.'s approved osteoporosis product Prolia (denosumab) and the big biotech's Phase III sclerostin inhibitor romosozumab, but Radius has a head start with its completed Phase III program for abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide analog of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (hPTHrP).</p><p>Abaloparatide also will go head-to-head with Eli Lilly & Co.'s Forteo (teriparatide), if the Radius therapy is approved, but it appears to be more effective and may have safety benefits over Lilly's now-generic recombinant parathyroid hormone.</p><p>Amgen reported positive top-line Phase III results for romosozumab in September, but it has two more Phase III studies under way and US FDA approval is not anticipated until two or three quarters after an FDA decision on abaloparatide. </p><p>But while Amgen has one set of Phase III data for romosozumab versus Forteo in hand and continues to analyze the study's results, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Radius-Ready-To-Face-Off-With-Amgen-At-ASBMR-360882" target="_new">no Phase III data were presented during the ASBMR meeting</a>, only additional Phase II results showing estimated bone strength gains.</p><p>Radius dipped down to $49.80 on Oct. 13 following its ASBMR presentations, but the stock has regained $11.29 (22.7%) since then with help from rumors that Shire plc is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Key-Products-And-Themes-3Q-Pharma-Results-Previewed-361106" target="_new">interested in buying the company</a>.</p><p><b>Blockbuster Potential?</b></p><p>Upon further review of the latest abaloparatide data and following a conversation with Radius CEO Bob Ward, JP Morgan analyst Jessica Frye said in an Oct. 19 report that the company's lead asset is "a clinically de-risked product with a $1bn-plus peak sales opportunity."</p><p>Radius presented a few more details at ASBMR from the first six months of its Phase III ACTIVExtend clinical trial in which post-menopausal women treated with abaloparatide in the Phase III ACTIVE trial who stopped treatment during the extension study retained bone mineral density (BMD) gains &ndash; 20.4% of those women had a 6% or greater gain in BMD at three key sites &ndash; the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck. </p><p>In the ACTIVE study, post-menopausal women had a 70% reduction in major osteoporotic fractures compared with placebo (p=0.0004) and a 55% reduction compared with Forteo (p=0.031), representing slightly better gains than Radius reported in prior top-line results. By the end of the 18-month clinical trial, 44.5% of abaloparatide-treated patients had a 3% or greater BMD increase compared with 1.9% of placebo patients and 32% of women who received Forteo (p<0.0001 for=""></0.0001></p><p>"We believe the improved clinical profile of abaloparatide relative to Forteo would represent a significant marketing advantage, if approved," Frye said in her report, which noted that Radius plans to sell its product on its own in the US with up to 300 sales representatives. </p><p>The US launch is anticipated in the second half of 2016 followed by an EU launch in collaboration with a yet-to-be-name partner in late 2016 or early 2017.</p><p><p><p><p>
