<p>The US Supreme Court on 24 March unanimously ruled that investors can't sue companies for making statements of opinion in securities documents they believe are true, even though they ultimately end up being wrong.</p><p>But a firm can be held liable for securities fraud if it omits facts from its registration documents, the justices said.</p><p>The case involved a lawsuit brought against Omnicare, the largest long-term care pharmacy provider in the US.</p><p>In a 2005 Securities & Exchange Commission filing, Omnicare said it believed its contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers complied with state and federal laws.</p><p>But the firm was later charged by the US federal government of being involved in kickback schemes. Omnicare agreed to pay $124m to settle the charges.</p><p>A group of investors sued Omnicare, claiming the firm made an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact. </p><p>A district court, however, dismissed the case, declaring the plaintiffs failed to show Omnicare had knowingly made false statements. But the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed that decision, arguing the investors only had to show the firm made "objectively false" statements.</p><p>In the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling, however, Justice Elena Kagan said a sincere statement of pure opinion is not an untrue statement of material fact regardless of whether an investor can ultimately prove the belief wrong, </p><p>The case now goes back to the lower courts to determine if Omnicare's statements omitted material facts.</p><p>Omnicare insisted the case is without merit and should be dropped in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
