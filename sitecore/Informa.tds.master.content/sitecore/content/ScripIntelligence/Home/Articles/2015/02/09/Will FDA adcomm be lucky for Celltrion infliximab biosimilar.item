<p>For only the second time, the FDA plans to convene a panel of its outside advisers to review a US application for a biosimilar product seeking to enter the US market.</p><p>This time around, it's Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar, known as CTP13, which is referenced from Johnson & Johnson's Remicade.</p><p>The FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee will meet on 17 March to discuss the so-called 351(k) biosimilar application for Celltrion's infliximab product.</p><p>The meeting will follow the 7 January gathering of the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), which voted 14-0 the totality of evidence supported licensing for all five indications sought by Novartis unit Sandoz for its version of filgrastim, of which the innovator product, Neupogen, is sold by Amgen (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-biosimilar-1st-to-win-FDA-panel-backing-355993" target="_new">8 January 2015</a>).</p><p>From the get-go, the ODAC meeting was a lovefest between regulators and the Sandoz's filgrastim biosimilar &ndash; whose 351(k) was the first ever to go before an FDA advisory committee &ndash; with Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation & Research, even declaring it was "historic occasion" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/FDAs-1st-biosimilar-adcomm-a-lovefest-355994" target="_new">8 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Sandoz is awaiting the FDA's judgment on the firm's biosimilar, which it plans to market in the US as Zarxio &ndash; a slightly different spelling than the moniker it goes under in Europe, Zarzio.</p><p>Celltrion's drug, though, is going before a different committee, which may not be as receptive as the ODAC and could potentially be much more skeptical, given infliximab is a monoclonal antibody. </p><p>So it may take a bit of luck for the Korean company to win over the panel of arthritis doctors and other experts at the St Patrick's Day meeting.</p><p>The FDA's thinking could be different the second time around as well, although that will become clearer with the release of the briefing documents, which are expected to be posted on the agency's website on 13 March ahead of the Arthritis Advisory Committee meeting.</p><p>Sagient Research&rsquo;s <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, has put the likelihood of Celltrion' drug winning US regulators&rsquo; nod at 87%, which is on an even keel with the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Celltrion revealed this past August it had submitted its 351(k) to the FDA seeking its blessing for CTP13, which the company plans to sell in the US as Remsima (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-US-biosimilar-MAb-on-the-horizon-as-Celltrion-files-Remsima-353328" target="_new">11 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Celltrion is seeking the FDA's approval for CTP13 as a biosimilar therapy to treat Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, active rheumatoid arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.</p><p>Biosimilar infliximab also is approved in other markets, including the European Union, where it is sold as Inflectra by Alvogen under a strategic partnership with Hospira, which is partnered with Celltrion (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biosimilar-Remicade-now-available-in-Europe-350035" target="_new">13 February 2014</a>).</p><p>It's unclear how those collaborations may change if Pfizer goes through with its acquisition of Hospira, announced last week (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-to-buy-Hospira-for-17bn-in-injectables-and-biosimilar-boost-356560" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Ranbaxy also is marketing an infliximab biosimilar in India under the name Infimab (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/First-biosim-infliximab-in-India-debuts-at-20-discount-355503" target="_new">08 December 2014</a>).</p><p>At least two other companies are seeking the FDA's approval for a 351(k) biosimilar application &ndash; Apotex, which wants to sell a pegfilgrastim version of Amgen's Neulasta, and Hospira, which is hoping to market Retacrit, an epoetin alfa biosimilar version of Amgen's Epogen and J&J's Procrit (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-biosimilar-of-Amgens-Neulasta-under-FDA-review-355732" target="_new">18 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Hospira-seeks-FDA-nod-for-EpogenProcrit-biosimilar-356100" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>).</p><p>A big question for the US biosimilar market is whether the drugs will cut medication costs for Americans. </p><p>At the 7 January ODAC meeting, Dr Mark McCamish, head of global biopharmaceutical and oncology injectables development at Sandoz, said he could not say whether Zarxio&rsquo;s price would be less than Neupogen &ndash; declaring the issue was &ldquo;complex.&rdquo;</p><p>But, he told the ODAC, the cost to consumers would be less, likely because insurers in the US negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
