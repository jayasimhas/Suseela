<p>The FDA on Aug. 28 warned health care providers and patients about new concerns over severe and disabling joint pain linked to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as Merck's Januvia (sitagliptin), AstraZeneca's Onglyza (saxagliptin), Lilly's and Boheringer Ingelheim's Tradjenta (linagliptin) and Takeda's Nesina (alogliptin) and their related products.</p><p>The news didn't appear to have much impact on investors on Aug. 28, though, with shares of Merck closing up 42 cents at $55.38 and AstraZeneca gaining 6 cents, to close at $31.67. Lilly, however, closed down 55 cents at $83.19.</p><p>The FDA said it has imposed new warnings about the increased risk of severe joint pain on the labeling of the medicines, which are used to treat type 2 diabetes, and advised patients to contact their doctors if such events occur while using the drugs.</p><p>"Health care professionals should consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause of severe joint pain and discontinue the drug if appropriate," the agency said in an alert distributed through the FDA's MedWatch system.</p><p>Other medicines affected include Lilly's and BI's Glyxambi (linagliptin/empagliflozin) and Jentadueto (linagliptin/metformin), Merck's Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin) and AstraZeneca's Kombiglyze ER (saxagliptin/metformin), Kazano alogliptin/metformin) and Oseni (alogliptin/pioglitazone). </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Add-heart-failure-risk-to-AstraZeneca-Takeda-DPP-4s-357886" target="_new">In April</a>, a panel of FDA advisers called for the agency to add new safety alerts to the labeling of Onglyza and Nesina and their related products about an increased risk of heart failure.</p><p>The FDA's concerns over the DPP-4s were sparked by results of a cardiovascular outcomes trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SAVOR-proves-no-savior-for-AZBMSs-Onglyza-344209" target="_new">SAVOR</a>, which reported a 27% increase in the rate of first event hospitalizations from heart failure linked to Onglyza or Kombiglyze XR (saxagliptin and metformin) versus an inactive treatment &ndash; shattering the idea DPP-4s could reduce CV outcomes.</p><p>So the FDA opened an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-investigates-heart-failure-link-with-BMS-OnglyzaKombiglyze-349996" target="_new">investigation</a> on the possible association between heart failure and the use of Onglyza and Kombiglyze, which used to belong to Bristol-Myers Squibb, until AstraZeneca acquired the entirety of its diabetes alliance with that firm.</p><p>In 2013, the FDA created a firestorm by opening an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-probing-pancreatitis-pre-cancerous-findings-with-GLP-1s-DPP-4s-341200" target="_new">investigation</a> after a study by a group of academic researchers suggested there was an increased risk of pre-cancerous cellular changes, along with pancreatitis, in patients with type 2 diabetes taking DPP-4 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.</p><p>The EMA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GLP-1-DPP-4-precancerous-probe-expands-EMA-joins-FDA-341578" target="_new">soon joined</a> the precancerous probe shortly thereafter. </p><p>But just a few months later, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-CONCURS-No-confirmation-of-new-GLP-1-DPP-4-pancreatic-concerns-345359" target="_new">FDA</a> and the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GLP-1-agonists-DPP-4-inhibitors-off-the-hook-for-now-345301" target="_new">EMA</a> concluded the available data did not confirm the agencies original concerns.</p><p>Regulators noted, however, they planned to keep an eye on the ongoing studies of those medicines.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
