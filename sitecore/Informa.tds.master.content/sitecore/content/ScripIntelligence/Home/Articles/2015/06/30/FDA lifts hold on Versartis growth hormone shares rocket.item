<p>Shares of Versartis rocketed 33.2% on 6 July after the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold on the firm's investigational new drug application for its long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) VRS-317, which is being investigated to treat growth hormone deficiency (GHD).</p><p>The FDA told the Menlo Park, California-based company it could proceed with its randomized, open-label Phase III registration trial, known as VELOCITY, of VRS-317 in children with GHD.</p><p>Shares of Versartis closed at $18.92 on 6 July, up $4.30, or 29.4%.</p><p>The company notified investors on 6 May after the US markets closed about the partial hold &ndash; news that had the firm's stock tumbling as low as 13.2% the next day.</p><p>The FDA had imposed the partial hold on the Phase III trial pending the receipt and analysis of additional bioanalytical data.</p><p>Versartis, which initiated the VELOCITY study in January, emphasized in May the FDA's action would not affect the firm's ongoing extension trial &ndash; with patients being allowed in that study to continue to be dosed with VRS-317.</p><p>But under the partial hold, no new patients were being enrolled at US sites in VELOCITY until the FDA gave its nod.</p><p>Versartis CEO Jay Shepard said his team had worked "diligently with the FDA" to resolve the matter.</p><p>He said he continued to expect VRS-317 to be the "first and longest-acting rhGH product candidate in development" to reach the US market.</p><p>"With the removal of the partial clinical hold, we remain on track to achieve this goal," Mr Shepard assured patients and investors.</p><p>"There is a significant need for these patients to have treatment options that are less burdensome than the daily injections that are the current standard of care," he added.</p><p>Versartis reaffirmed its previously stated anticipated milestones for the VELOCITY Phase III study, including interim six-month mean height velocity data by the end of 2016 and top-line data on the 12-month mean height velocity primary endpoint by mid-2017, which the company said should enable it to submit a biologics license application, with an anticipated decision from the FDA by late 2018.</p><p>The VELOCITY trial, which is expected to enroll up to 136 na&iuml;ve-to-treatment pre-pubertal children with GHD, will include a 3:1 randomization of 3.5mg/kg VRS-317 twice-monthly to daily rhGH at the highest approved dose labeled for Pfizer's Genotropin (somatropin [rDNA origin] for injection) and Novo Nordisk's Norditropin (somatropin [rDNA origin] injection) 34ug/kg/day. </p><p>The primary endpoint of the study is non-inferiority between the two treatment groups for 12-month mean height velocity, Versartis said.</p><p>After completing the Phase III trial, all patients will be offered the opportunity to continue treatment with VRS-317 in the ongoing pediatric extension study, the firm said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
