<p>The Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) government has issued a statement intended to reassure the public that biosimilar medicines are as safe and effective as their reference drug, in an apparent effort to offset any "misinformation" being disseminated about biosimilars.</p><p>PBAC, which makes recommendations to the government on which medicines should be subsidized for consumers, says that biosimilars present an opportunity to make biologic drugs more affordable, as many expensive brands are due to come off patent in the next five to 10 years. </p><p>A number of steps have been taken recently to boost the biosimilars market. For example, if a biosimilar is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration as being as safe and effective as the reference drug, the PBAC will consider listing it on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Moreover, the committee <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australia-moves-ahead-with-biosimilar-substitution-358614" target="_new">recently recommended</a> that clinicians and pharmacists should be allowed to substitute a biosimilar in place of the reference drug, on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>The PBAC says substitution of biosimilars would not be happening unless it was "sure of their equal safety and effectiveness". But it and the government "are concerned that the introduction of biosimiliars may lead to the spread of misinformation, as has happened in other countries, which will slow the progress of the development of these medicines". </p><p>It does not specify where else, or by whom, such misinformation might have been circulated, or whether this has already happened in Australia. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said only that it was "a bit of a preventive move, although big pharma has already been very vocal in the last few days". </p><p>The committee's statement further reassures patients that they will continue to have the final choice as to which version of a medicine they want to receive. "If the PBAC recommends the biosimilar should be substitutable, this provides the option for clinicians and pharmacists to offer patients the choice of taking the original biologic drug or the substitute biosimilar drug, just as they currently do with generic versions of synthetic molecule drugs."</p><p>Moreover, if clinicians consider it inappropriate in a particular case, they will be able to prevent biosimilar substitution by ticking a box on the prescription form, again as already happens for generic medicines. </p><p>The PBAC says it will be meeting with stakeholders to consult on the application of its substitution recommendations in order to get feedback on how the initiative can be successfully applied in practice.</p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/home/" target="_new">Scrip Regulatory Affairs</a>.</p>
