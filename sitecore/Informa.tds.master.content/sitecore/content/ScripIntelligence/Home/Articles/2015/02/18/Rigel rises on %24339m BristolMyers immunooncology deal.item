<p>Rigel Pharmaceuticals got a much-needed boost on 23 February from news that it will receive $30m up front and up to $309m in milestone fees plus royalties under a cancer immunotherapy collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to develop Rigel's preclinical TGF beta receptor kinase inhibitors.</p><p>South San Francisco-based Rigel closed up 26.7% at $3.23 per share, bringing its market cap to $283.6m, after trading as high as $3.91 earlier in the day. The Bristol-Myers deal gave investors a reason to back a company whose stock value has been cut in half during the past two years based on a series of clinical trial failures, including a Phase II disappointment in August for R348 in dry eye disease.</p><p>Rigel and BMS agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies based on Rigel's portfolio of small molecules that inhibit TGF beta, which suppresses effector cell proliferation and function while promoting differentiation of certain T cells in the tumor microenvironment. </p><p>Inhibiting TGF beta signaling could counteract a mechanism that cancer uses to escape the immune system's response to the disease. Rigel has shown <i>in vivo</i> efficacy for its TGF beta inhibitors in animal models of cancer that is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action.</p><p>Bristol-Myers wants to evaluate the role of Rigel's TGF beta inhibitors as monotherapies and in combination with the company's immune checkpoint inhibitors &ndash; the cytotoxic t-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4) inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab) and the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab). BMS has exclusive worldwide rights to Rigel's TGF beta inhibitors for cancer and other indications.</p><p>"Rigel has focused on immunology and oncology via numerous partnerships. This collaboration is Rigel's first in immuno-oncology and is one of the company's several programs in this area," Rigel president and CEO Raul Rodriguez said in a joint statement with BMS.</p><p>Rigel's lead development program is fostamatinib, an oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor for which the company is expected to report Phase III data in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) by early 2016. The SYK inhibitor previously failed in three Phase III rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials after which AstraZeneca handed back its rights to the drug (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SYK-happens-AstraZeneca-puts-fostamatinib-out-of-its-misery-343743" target="_new">3 June 2013</a>). Rigel plans to initiate a Phase II clinical trial for fostamatinib in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) soon.</p><p>The company also has two separate oncology product candidates in Phase I with partners BerGenBio and Daiichi Sankyo and it is working with AstraZeneca on two preclinical programs for R256 in asthma.</p><p>On its own, Rigel also continues to develop R348, a topical janus kinase (JAK) and SYK inhibitor in Phase II for dry eye in ocular graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) despite last year's failure in dry eye disease, which followed Phase II disappointments in 2013 for R333 in discoid lupus erythematosus and R343 in allergic rhinitis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Rigel-Run-Down-By-Another-Failure-353373" target="_new">14 August 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
