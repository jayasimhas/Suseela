<p>Astellas had few battles to wage on 22 January when it took its experimental antifungal Cresemba (isavuconazonium) before the FDA's Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee (AIDAC), which wholeheartedly embraced the medicine as a treatment for the deadly invasive infection aspergillosis, and nearly so for use in another fungal infection, mucormycosis. </p><p>The AIDAC voted 11-0 in backing the use of Cresemba in treating aspergillosis and 8-2, with one abstention, in supporting the mucormycosis indication.</p><p>"I think this is a bit of a slam dunk today," declared AIDAC chair Dr Thomas Moore, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Kansas at Wichita.</p><p>Cresemba is a novel prodrug of isavuconazole, a triazole antifungal agent. Astellas has developed a hard capsule for oral administration of the medicine and also a sterile, lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion after reconstitution.</p><p>Panelist Dr Yu Shyr, a biostatics professor and the director of the Center for Quantitative Sciences at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said he had no reason to believe Astellas' global multicenter, randomized-controlled Phase III trial of Cresemba versus voriconazole &ndash; the standard of care &ndash; did not meet the noninferiority margins in treating aspergillosis, a life-threatening angio-invasive infection that is seen predominantly in severely immune-compromised patients.</p><p>"This was a solid yes," Dr Shyr said. </p><p>There was, however, some concern by the AIDAC over shortening of the QT interval with Cresemba in the aspergillosis trial &ndash; the clinical significance of which is uncertain.</p><p>Some on the committee also were worried that following the reconstitution, the IV Cresemba formulation may spontaneously hydrolyze in aqueous solution and precipitate as insoluble isavuconazole. </p><p>In the study, the drug was administered through an inline filter to remove particulates. So some on AIDAC suggested that should be done in the real-world setting.</p><p>The labeling also should warn not to shake the vials, insisted panelist Dr Diane Cappelletty, an associate professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Toledo in Ohio.</p><p>Others on the committee said therapeutic drug monitoring needed to be better defined in the labeling and considerations for cautions about use in certain ethnicities, such as Asians, should be included. </p><p>But all in all, the positive vote for Cresemba in aspergillosis "was a relatively straightforward decision to make," said panelist Dr Dean Follmann, an assistant director for biostatistics at the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID).</p><p>"I thought they did a nice well-justified study," he said.</p><p>But Dr Follmann had his doubts when it came to the use of Cresemba in treating mucormycosis, a fungal infection caused by the filamentous fungi of the Mucorales order of the subphylum Mucoromycotina.</p><p>For the mucormycosis indication, the company relied on an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study of Cresemba in the invasive disease and other rare molds, yeasts or dimorphic fungi.</p><p>The six-year trial, known as 9766-CL-0103, actually was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cresemba for the primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by <i>Aspergillus</i> species in subjects with renal impairment, or rare filamentous fungi. </p><p>An open-label design was selected due to the inherent difficulty of enrolling sufficient numbers of patients for diseases with a low prevalence, such as mucormycosis. </p><p>A subgroup of 37 patients was identified within the modified intent to treat population of the study to support the mucormycosis indication. </p><p>Natural history data from the scientific literature also were used as a basis of comparison.</p><p>If the FDA approves Cresemba for the mucormycosis indication, the labeling needs to be "very clear" Astellas' drug was never compared in a head-to-head study against amphotericin B, the only therapy approved in the US to treat the disease, said panelist Dr Michael Neely, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California and chair of antimicrobial stewardship at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.</p><p>"We need to be concerned about whether this going to be worse than amphotericin," Dr Neely insisted. "I don't think anybody would argue it is better than placebo. That was fairly well established. But the larger question for me is, is it worse than amphotericin?"</p><p>"I think clinicians are going to have a little bit of trouble understanding when do they use amphotericin or [Cresemba] if they have somebody who strongly or they even know has mucormycosis what should be their first-line therapy. It is not clear at all," Dr Neely added.</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr Neely voted in favor of the FDA approving Cresemba for the mucormycosis indication.</p><p>"We really have to take into consideration the absolute unmet need for this drug, because there is the distinct possibility that it's at least as good amphotericin, possibly even better, and it has certainly pharmacologic considerations that make it very appealing compared to amphotericin, ie, that it is both IV and oral," he said. "And its safety profile is better, even though it, again, has not been compared head-to-head against amphotericin, we can certainly extrapolate I think its safety is improved compared to amphotericin by looking at the voriconazole comparative data. We know that vori is safer than amphotericin.&rdquo; </p><p>Dr Neely said Cresemba would fill an unmet need in mucormycosis. </p><p>&ldquo;I have high hopes that it is at least as good as amphotericin, but I do think we need more data to confirm that as time moves on,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>But panelist Dr John Bennett, chief of the Clinical Mycology Section at NIAID, who joined Dr Follmann in voting &ldquo;no,&rdquo; said he was unconvinced Cresemba has significant activity against mucormycosis.</p><p>He said he was concerned the FDA would be lowering the bar by approving Cresemba based on the open-label data.</p><p>"If the bar for acceptance is so low on this kind of data, we have a terrible problem," Dr Bennett charged.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
