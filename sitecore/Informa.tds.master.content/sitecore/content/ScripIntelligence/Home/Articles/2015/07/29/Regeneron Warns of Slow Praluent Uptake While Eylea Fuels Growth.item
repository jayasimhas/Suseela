<p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and big pharma partner Sanofi are distributing free samples of the new cholesterol therapy <i>Praluent</i> (alirocumab) to patients who are awaiting insurance coverage decisions, Regeneron senior vice president of commercial Robert Terifay said during the company's Aug. 4 earnings call, while also warning that this will make it hard to assess uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor. </p><p>"For the next several months, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales," he said. "This would understate both the volume of physician and patient adoption."</p><p>Regeneron and Sanofi launched Praluent just days after the drug won <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">FDA approval</a> on July 24 for certain patients with high cholesterol who are taking maximally tolerated doses of statins, but still require additional lowering of their LDL.</p><p>The launch is being closely watched by investors &ndash; and the industry &ndash; since Praluent is the first of what is expected to be a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Praluent-Repatha-FDA-guinea-pigs-to-market-trailblazers-359580" target="_new">major new category of drugs</a>, one that could bring in billions in revenues for Regeneron and Sanofi, but will also test insurers' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9s-are-coming-But-who-will-get-them-359579" target="_new">ability to pay</a>. </p><p>With the launch only a few days before Regeneron's second quarter sales and earnings call, the company said it is too early to provide any meaningful sales information. </p><p>But both companies have consistently warned that they believe uptake will be gradual, in part because of lengthy reimbursement decisions and insurers' utilization management strategies, and also because of patient and physician hesitancy to switch to biologics. </p><p>Some pharmacy benefit managers like CVS Health are withholding coverage decisions for Praluent until FDA's anticipated approval of a competitor in the coming weeks, Amgen's <i>Repatha</i> (evolocumab), which has an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">Aug. 27 PDUFA date</a>. </p><p>During CVS's second quarter conference call the same day, CEO Larry Merlo said the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) plans to manage PCSK9 inhibitor costs by implementing formulary exclusions, similar to what it and some other PBMs have done with other competitive drug categories, like <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gileads-CVS-exclusive-may-best-AbbVies-Express-Scripts-hepatitis-C-deal-355940" target="_new">hepatitis C</a>.</p><p>Regeneron said it was pleased with its implementation of the launch, with the first patient dosed on the Monday that followed the Friday approval. </p><p>The company estimates there are between 8m to 10m patients in the US who are eligible for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy based on the Praluent label. However, Terifay said, "maximally tolerated statin therapy will and should remain the mainstay of therapy."</p><p>The expectation is that use will expand if positive data emerges from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes data testing PCSK9 blockers, including Regeneron/Sanofi's 18,000-patient ODYSSEY Outcomes trial, which is on target to be fully enrolled by year end with completion expected by the end of 2017. </p><p><b>No Slow-Down For Eylea</b></p><p>While Regeneron waits for Praluent to pick up steam, it can rely on Eylea (aflibercept) to continue filling its coffers. The eye injection is Regeneron's primary revenue generator and brought in $993m globally in the second quarter, up 50% over the second quarter of 2015. </p><p>Eylea generated $655m in the US and $338m internationally, where it is commercialized by Regeneron's partner Bayer. Regeneron recognized $107m from its share of net profit from Eylea sales outside of the US, compared with $67m in the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>Given the strength of Eylea, Regeneron said it is increasing its US Eylea sales guidance to year-over-year growth of between 45% and 50% from the previously guided range of 30% to 35%. Eylea generated $1.74bn in US revenues in 2014. </p><p>Growth of Eylea, already strong as the drug continues to take share from the competition in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, has been fueled by expansion in new indications, including most recently for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Regenerons-Eylea-in-diabetic-retinopathy-357501" target="_new">diabetic retinopathy</a> in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). </p><p>Positive data in October from a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Eylea-bests-Lucentis-in-DME-but-Avastin-wins-on-cost-356825" target="_new">Protocol T</a>, which compared the efficacy of Eylea to Roche's <i>Lucentis</i> (ranibizumab) and off-label <i>Avastin</i> (bevacizumab) in patients with DME, has been driving growth, according to Regeneron. Treatment with Eylea demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at 52 weeks compared to either of the other two drugs, with one fewer injections. </p><p>"The data have been viewed very positively by physicians and payers and were one of the biggest drivers of strong Eylea growth in the second quarter," Terifay said. </p><p>Regeneron's GAAP net income in the second quarter increased 103% to $195m in the second quarter. </p><p>The other big news for Regeneron is the broad deal announced July 28 with Sanofi to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of new antibody cancer treatments in the field of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-plays-catch-up-in-immuno-oncology-with-new-Regeneron-deal-359646" target="_new">immuno-oncology</a>, including the development of a Phase I programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor. </p><p>"We're cognizant of the fact that this is a crowded area with many players who have immuno-oncology assets that are more advanced," CEO Leonard Schleifer said during the second quarter call. "Nevertheless, we believe that the key to future success in this complicated area is the efficiency and sophistication with which one can attempt and evaluate novel treatments and their combinations in novel settings. We believe that we are well positioned to be competitive in this area."</p><p>The company's stock jumped on the positive earnings results, ending the day up 4.8% at $580.94 on Aug. 4, a new all-time high.</p><p><p>[Editor's note: This story is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
