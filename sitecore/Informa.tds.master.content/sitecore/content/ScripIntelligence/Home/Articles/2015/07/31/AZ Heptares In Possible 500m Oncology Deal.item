<p>Japan-headquartered Sosei Group's $400m acquisition of Heptares Therapeutics could prove to be a money spinner as the biotech unit has signed an immuno-oncology focused partnership with pharma major AstraZeneca plc, potentially worth $500m. </p><p>UK-based Heptares, acquired by Sosei in February, is targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play a key role in cancer biology. Under the new partnership AstraZeneca will pay Heptares $10m upfront for exclusive global rights to adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, HTL-1071, and potentially more than $500m in development and commercial milestones. The company is also eligible for up to double-digit tiered royalties on net sales.</p><p>Tumor cells have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system, including through the production adenosine. By stimulating A2A receptors, adenosine stops T-cells within the immune system from proliferating and reduces their ability to destroy cancer cells. Heptares noted that its technology works by blocking A2A receptors to promote the anti-cancer response of T-cells. </p><p>AstraZeneca will focus on exploring HTL-1071, which is currently in preclinical stages of development, across a range of cancers and in combination with its own existing portfolio of immunotherapies. The two companies will also collaborate to discover further A2A receptor-blocking compounds for development. </p><p>The deal builds on an existing research pact between Heptares and AstraZeneca from 2011, which was focused on the development of small-molecule candidates targeting specific GPCRs in CNS and metabolic indications. </p><p>Malcolm Weir, CEO of Heptares said: "The A2A receptor program has been an outstanding example of our Structure Based Drug Design approach in action, resulting in a novel clinical candidate, HTL-1071, with a highly attractive profile."</p><p>Sosei acquired Heptares, which is now an autonomous subsidiary of the Japanese firm, to rejuvenate its R&D offering. The UK drug design specialist attracted Sosei with its StaR precision drug design platform technology and its active, revenue-bearing partnerships with Cubist Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Merck & Co.), Takeda Pharmaceutical Industries, MorphoSys AG and Novartis AG.</p><h2>Mirati deal</h2><p>Meanwhile, AstraZeneca's biologics unit MedImmune has also signed a new immuno-oncology focused deal. The firm has entered into an exclusive clinical trial collaboration with oncology company Mirati Therapetuics to test its anti-PDL1 inhibitor MEDI4736 (durvalumab) in combination with mocetinostat, Mirati's investigational spectrum-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.</p><p><b>Related stories: </b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/400m-Heptares-acquisition-to-drive-Soseis-RandD-356884" target="_new">$400m Heptares acquisition to drive Sosei's R&D</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Life-after-acquisition-Heptares-CEO-on-living-with-Sosei-359211" target="_new">Life after acquisition?
