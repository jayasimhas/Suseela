<p>Next steps in the development of heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil are unclear following the successful conclusion of a Phase II clinical trial while Cytokinetics Inc. waits to determine with partner Amgen Inc. whether the mid-stage data are sufficient to justify investment in a Phase III program.</p><p>Omecamtiv mecarbil, a cardiac myosin activator, met the primary pharmacokinetic objective and showed statistically significant improvements in all secondary measures of cardiac function in the Phase II trial known as COSMIC-HF. Though the data presented in a Nov. 8 late-breaker session at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in Orlando, Florida were seen as positive, a Cytokinetics spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i> that "the company believes the data are supportive of potential progression to Phase III, and Amgen and Cytokinetics will make a joint decision in the coming months."</p><p>Amgen executive vice president of research and development Sean Harper said as much during the big biotech company's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Revenue-Exceeds-Expectations-Threats-Remain-Despite-New-Launches-361283" target="_new">third quarter earnings</a> conference call at the end of October after Amgen and Cytokinetics reported top-line COSMIC-HF results. </p><p>Harper noted that Amgen was pleased with the Phase II data for oral omecamtiv mecarbil after an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Cytokinetics-heart-drug-misses-goal-in-Phase-II-study-346178" target="_new">intravenous version failed in Phase II</a>, but he said that the COSMIC-HF results would be shared with regulators to inform the companies' decision "about whether to proceed and in what exact format in terms of study designs and that sort of thing."</p><p><b>COSMIC-HF Design And Data</b></p><p>The expansion phase of COSMIC-HF evaluated oral omecamtiv mecarbil in 448 chronic heart failure patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, who were treated with placebo, 25mg of omecamtiv mecarbil twice daily, or 25mg twice daily with dosing increased to 50mg twice daily depending on plasma concentrations of the drug after two weeks of the starting dose. About 60% of patients in the dose titration group eventually received 50mg twice daily.</p><p>At 20 weeks for the titration group versus patients in the placebo group, systolic ejection time increased by 25msec (p<0.001), stroke="" volume="" increased="" by="" 3.63ml="" (p="0.022)," heart="" rate="" decreased="" by="" 2.97="" beats="" per="" minute="" (p="0.007)," left="" ventricular="" end-systolic="" volumes="" decreased="" by="" 1.79mm="" (p="0.003)," end-diastolic="" dimensions="" declined="" by="" 1.29mm="" (p="0.013)," and="" n-terminal="" pro-brain="" natriuretic="" peptide="" (nt-probnp)="" decreased="" by="" 970pg/ml="" (p="0.007)."></0.001),></p><p>Amgen and Cytokinetics also said there were statistically significant increases in systolic ejection time and stroke volume as well as a decrease in NT-proBNP in the 25mg twice daily group. </p><p>Sagient Research analyst Peter Chang noted the consistent effects of omecamtiv mecarbil's across multiple measures in a Nov. 9 BioMedTracker report. Chang also repeated a COSMIC-HF investigator's observation that NT-proBNP changes for omecamtiv mecarbil-treated patients were similar to those seen for patients treated with Novartis AG's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Payers-expected-to-embrace-Novartis-heart-failure-drug-Entresto-359294" target="_new">recently approved</a><i>Entresto</i> (sacubitril/valsartan).</p><p>However, Chang said, whether the positive changes across all efficacy measures are substantial enough to lead to clinical benefits is yet to be determined. The significance of the data "could depend what measures one trusts and whether one has more confidence in the changes from baseline or versus placebo. For example, the increases in ejection fraction from baseline are around or above the threshold some researchers have told us in the past could be clinically meaningful," he wrote, noting that omecamtiv mecarbil's effects could be greater with longer-term dosing.</p><p><b>Encouraging Safety And Efficacy</b></p><p>Roth Capital analyst Joseph Pantginis said in a Nov. 9 research note that omecamtiv mecarbil "is relieving significant pressure on the heart and not making the muscle work as hard and this is a major clinical impact for patients who were already on optimal background therapy."</p><p>Adverse events in COSMIC-HF were described as comparable between the omecamtiv mecarbil and placebo groups. The incidence of adjudicated deaths was 2.7% in the placebo group and 1.4% for omecamtiv mecarbil, including myocardial infarction (1.34% for placebo and 0.34% for omecamtiv mecarbil) and unstable angina (0% for placebo and 0.34% for omecamtiv mecarbil). </p><p>Cardiac troponin increased by a median of 0.001ng/mL in the 25mg omecamtiv mecarbil group and 0.006ng/mL in the titration group versus placebo at 20 weeks, but none of the elevated troponin events were due to myocardial ischemia or infarction. </p><p>Pantginis said in the Roth Capital report that "the cardiac function and the strong safety profile constitute strong support for a Phase III. The leading bear case, in our belief, would be whether Amgen, on its end, will decide to bring the drug forward as these are very large studies that would need to be run. However, we believe the strength of the data from this large Phase II makes the case to move forward" in 2016.</p><p>Cytokinetics gained 13.6% on Nov. 9 to close at $12.29 per share &ndash; a new one-year high &ndash; based on the positive COSMIC-HF data in an indication with 23m patients worldwide, half of whom have reduced left ventricular function. The company's stock fell 2.9% on Nov. 10 to $11.93, bringing the company's market cap to $463.5m.</p><p><p><p><p>
