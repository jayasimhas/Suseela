<p>Bayer saw net profits fall in the first quarter of 2015 due to higher R&D expenses and integration costs. Meanwhile, oral anticoagulant Xarelto (rivaroxaban) also failed to meet expectations. </p><p>Despite its fall in profits though the German pharma major is raising its guidance for the full year: the company now expects sales of &euro;48bn to &euro;49bn compared with its previously forecast &euro;46bn, helped by favorable foreign-exchange conditions. EBITDA before special items is predicted to increase by a high-teen percentage compared with its previous forecast of a low- to mid teen percentage increase. </p><p>Net profit for the quarter ended 31 March fell 8.4% on the year to &euro;1.30bn, compared with &euro;1.42bn a year earlier, slightly missing analyst expectations of &euro;1.36bn. </p><p>Bayer did note that earnings were held back by net special charges of &euro;244m that mainly comprised &euro;91m for the integration of acquired businesses, &euro;77m for the consolidation of production sites and &euro;41m for additional efficiency improvement measures. EBIT before special items rose by 7.3% in the quarter to &euro;2,242m (1Q 2014: &euro;2,089m).</p><p>On a positive note though sales of the group moved ahead in the first quarter of 2015 by 2.7% after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects to &euro;12,117 (up by 14.8% from 1Q 2014: &euro;10,555m). HealthCare sales improved by 7.2% to reach &euro;5,742m (up 25.6% from 1Q 2014: &euro;4,572m).</p><h2>Xarelto misses</h2><p>In its 1Q 2015 earnings report Bayer said that "Xarelto expanded its leading position among the new oral anticoagulants in the quarter, particularly in Europe." It added that "business with Xarelto also developed very positively in the US, where it is marketed by a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson." </p><p>However, 1Q sales of Xarelto only reached &euro;482m, down from &euro;516m in the final quarter of 2014. Bayer said this difference was because of an impact of its US royalty arrangement. Bayer said on its 30 April earnings call, "We have no concern of the trading of Xarelto in other markets [outside of the US]." </p><p>The firm also said it is upping its growth estimates for Xarelto for the full year from 20% to 30%. "Market shares continue to be very strong," the German drug maker noted. </p><p>Altogether though Bayer's growth products, Xarelto, Eylea, Stivarga, Xofigo and Adempas did post high combined sales of &euro;898m up from 1Q 2014 sales of &euro;598m.</p>
