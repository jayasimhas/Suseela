<p>Sanofi, Roche and Bayer are also ranked among the top 50 companies in profit terms despite foreign drug makers being generally smaller than their Chinese domestic counterparts.</p><p>While not the largest pharmaceutical companies by size in China, multinationals have strong ability in marketing core products and maintaining solid profit margins, a new official industry ranking shows.</p><p>The Annual Ranking for Pharmaceutical Companies in 2014 was released April 7 by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), and ranks a total of 2,048 domestic and foreign drug makers under three categories: size as measured by total capital, core business revenues, and total profits.</p><p>According to the table below compiled by <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i>, among multinationals included in the ranking, Pfizer has the largest annual profits, by which measure it places eighth overall, followed by Sanofi and Roche, ranked 25th and 34th, respectively. German conglomerate Bayer came in at 36th.</p><p>Pfizer's ranking is a step up from the previous year, when it was ranked 12th, while Sanofi and Bayer dropped from 16th and 28th in the ranking for 2013.</p><p>Chinese pharma manufacturing and distribution giant China Resources Group led in total profits and was followed by over-the-counter drug makers Yangtze River PharmaCo. Ltd and Yunnan Baiyan Pharma Co. Ltd. Device maker Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Co. Ltd. was fourth, followed by XiuZheng Pharma, Qilu Pharma, SinoPharm, Pfizer and Fosun International Ltd.</p><h2>Revenues</h2><p>Compared to domestic groups, MNCs as a group are ranked higher in terms of core business revenues although they are not the biggest single companies. Bayer led the pack with a ranking of 11th, followed by Pfizer (13th), Roche (19th) and Novo Nordisk (22nd).</p><p>Roche is ranked as the largest foreign drug maker, at 24th place, followed by Bayer (26th) and Pfizer (36th).</p><p>The list is a preliminary ranking based on data from January to December and gathered from company filings, noted the department of pharmaceuticals at the MIIT's Bureau of Consumer Goods Industry. Since the data are unaudited, a final ranking will be released upon the completion of an audit on detailed filings from the companies, the agency said [See: Link to the ranking for pharmaceutical companies in China &ndash; Chinese language].</p><p><table><h2>Pharma MNC Rankings in China</h2><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company Name</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Ranking by total profits</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Ranking by core business revenues</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Ranking by total profits</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.8</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.13</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.36</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Roche</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.34</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.19</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.24</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Bayer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.36</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.11</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.26</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Sanofi</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.25</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.29</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.96</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novo Nordisk</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.52</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.22</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.39</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AstraZeneca</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.75</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.30</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.45</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novartis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.53</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.84</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Xian Janssen Pharmaceutical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.71</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.35</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>No.85</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Eli Lilly & Co.
