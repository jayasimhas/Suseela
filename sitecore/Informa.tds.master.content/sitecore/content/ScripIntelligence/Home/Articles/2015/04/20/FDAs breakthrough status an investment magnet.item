<p>The FDA's breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) is working as intended &ndash; speeding new innovative drugs to patients sooner than otherwise would be the case without the status.</p><p>But a new analysis also shows the designation has another benefit: attracting investment.</p><p>Indeed, investors have recognized the potential value a BTD could have on the profitability of a drug, said analysts Karen Nguyen of Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i> and Patricia Giglio of <i>Medtrack</i>.</p><p>Their research looking into the BTD &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> in 2012 under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> (FDASIA) to help expedite the regulatory process for medicines aimed at treating serious conditions &ndash; found that companies with the breakthrough status have been successful at raising capital.</p><p>"Drugs in expedited programs are especially appealing because of the potentially lower development costs and greater return on investment," Mses Nguyen and Giglio said.</p><p>For instance, they said, Intercept Pharmaceuticals brought in $192m in investment shortly after its lead product obeticholic acid (INT-747) received <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">BTD in January</a> as a treatment for patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with liver fibrosis. </p><p>Another BTD winner, privately held Aduro Biotech, has raised over $100m in capital since receiving the status in July 2014 for its metastatic pancreatic cancer combination treatment, which consists of CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas immunotherapies. The firm subsequently filed an initial public offering, which closed on 20 April.</p><p>And, Mses Nguyen and Giglio said, AbbVie's 4 March <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-outdoes-rumored-JandJ-bid-with-21bn-Pharmacyclics-buy-357078" target="_new">$21bn bid</a> for Pharmacyclics was in part attributed to Imbruvica (ibrutinib), which was approved for three hematologic malignancies after gaining breakthrough status in each: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JanssenPharmacyclics-drug-Imbruvica-2nd-FDA-breakthrough-to-cross-finish-line-348135" target="_new">mantle cell lymphoma</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PharmacyclicsJanssen-win-FDA-nod-for-Imbruvica-in-CLL-350013" target="_new">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PharmacyclicsJanssen-win-FDA-OK-for-Imbruvica-in-Waldenstroms-356455" target="_new">Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia</a>.</p><p>In their new <a href="http://www.biomedtracker.com/ReportDetail.cfm?ReportID=607" target="_new">report</a>, <i>Breakthrough Therapy Designation: Paving the Way for Innovation</i>, Mses Nguyen and Giglio also noted that one-third of the BTD drugs are partnered &ndash; an identical amount to the licensing patterns of orphan-designated drugs during the same time period. </p><p>But, Mses Nguyen and Giglio pointed out, since the BTD is a relatively new program and the majority of licensing deals involving therapies with the status occurred before enactment of FDASIA, it's too soon to determine the designation's impact on partnerships, if any. </p><p>"The full partnering dynamic will become clearer as more breakthrough therapies are approved and launched and the commercial benefits attributed to them are realized," Mses Nguyen and Giglio said. </p><p>To <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">gain the BTD</a>, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.</p><p>As of 17 April &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 74 of the 248 requests for the breakthrough designation it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 124.</p><p>As of 31 March, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least 11 of the 49 requests it has received for breakthrough status, denying at least 34.</p><p>The FDA has approved 24 medicines that were granted BTD, according to information on the agency's website.</p><p><b>Oncology dominates</b></p><p>While the FDA is able to reveal the numbers of BTD requests, grants and denials, only the companies can disclose the identities of the drugs that have gained the status.</p><p>But of those that are known, Mses Nguyen and Giglio said they were not surprised to find that oncology has dominated the BTDs, given that growth in the space largely is driven by significant advances in newer targeted and immunotherapy approaches, which offer broad potential across different cancer types.</p><p>They pointed to Pharmacyclics' oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase Imbruvica, Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-melanoma-drug-Opdivo-wins-priority-review-breakthrough-354175" target="_new">Opdivo</a> (nivolumab) and Amgen's bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amgen-BiTE-antibody-blinatumomab-wins-breakthrough-status-352610" target="_new">Blincyto</a> (blinatumomab) &ndash; all BTD winners &ndash; as examples of innovative medicines that are addressing multiple cancers and redefining the treatment standards within their approved indications. </p><p>But, Mses Nguyen and Giglio said, even though there's been innovative breakthroughs in oncology, "many other life-threatening cancers still lack effective treatment options, making oncology an area of constant focus and growth for drug developers" &ndash; meaning there likely could be many more BTDs awarded in the space in the future. </p><p>The analysis from <i>BioMedTracker</i> and <i>Medtrack</i>, both affiliates of <i>Scrip</i>, found that infectious diseases also was a popular area where FDA granted BTDs &ndash; with most of those awards going to a single disease: chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).</p><p>"Prompted by the rapid evolution of drastically safer and more effective antiviral agents, the FDA labeled each new promising regimen as 'breakthrough,'" Mses Nguyen and Giglio declared.</p><p>But, they said, once drugs like Gilead Sciences' Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) and AbbVie's Viekira Pak (paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir) entered the market &ndash; essentially providing a cure for HCV &ndash; other products were no longer viewed by the FDA as "breakthroughs." </p><p>So the FDA began notifying some companies earlier this year, like <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">Merck</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-latest-target-for-breakthrough-status-loss-356576" target="_new">BMS</a>, the agency intended to rescind the BTDs those firms' had earlier won for their experimental HCV medicines.</p><p>BMS accepted the FDA's decision to take back two BTDs earlier awarded to the company's regimens related to daclatasvir.</p><p> Merck, however, worked with regulators to find a more focused indication for the firm's combination HCV drug grazoprevir/elbasvir (MK-5172/MK-8742) and the FDA ended up <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-replaces-rather-than-rescinds-Mercks-breakthrough-status-357726" target="_new">replacing</a> the BTD rather than rescinding it.</p><p>"These unfolding events serve as a reminder of the competitive setting among breakthrough therapies within a single space, as well as the evolving process around this new pathway," Mses Nguyen and Giglio said. </p><p>They noted that outside of oncology and HCV, the BTDs that are known to have been awarded have been granted in a range of disease areas. </p><p><b>Quicker approvals?</b></p><p>When the BTD was first introduced in 2012, it was unclear what kind of impact it would have on approval timing. </p><p>"Reviews were expected to go by faster, but it remained to be seen how fast they could be done," Mses Nguyen and Giglio said.</p><p>Of the 24 drugs with BTD that were approved by the FDA &ndash; either as original applications, of which there were 16, or supplements &ndash; most were assessed ahead of schedule, the analysts said, although they noted the HCV applications actually took the full eight months under their priority reviews. </p><p>The shortest review for an original application with BTD was for Amgen's leukemia drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-gains-early-US-win-for-BiTE-antibody-Blincyto-355400" target="_new">Blincyto</a> &ndash; with the FDA taking only 76 days to make an approval decision.</p><p>The review for BMS' supplemental <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">lung cancer indication</a> for Opdivo, which initially was approved to treat melanoma, came in quicker at 73 days &ndash; "the fastest approval" Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum said he had seen in his 15-year career.</p><p>Other supplemental applications, too, were assessed ahead of their six-month deadline, with the quickest going to cancer drugs, Mses Nguyen and Giglio observed.</p><p>They noted that 14 applications with BTD status &ndash; 11 of them original &ndash; were granted approval at least one month before their Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date, with the agency spending an average of 152 days, or about five months, reviewing original applications and 116 days, or about 3.8 months, reviewing supplements.</p><p>"This means that the average expedited review was approved roughly two to three months ahead of schedule," Mses Nguyen and Giglio said.</p><p>"Despite the small sample size, these results show the agency's ability to bring breakthrough therapies to the market fairly quickly," they said. "It may be impossible to predict how long applications will spend under review, but the BTD program has been generally successful thus far in terms of its overall goals."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
