<p><p>Talk amongst the industry may indicate that Shire is losing faith in its ill-considered attempt to take out newly spun out Baxalta as the biotech continues to thwart any takeout talk. Speculation has emerged that Shire is looking into other potential targets, including Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Actelion Pharmaceuticals and Radius Health.</p><p>It's been widely talked about that Shire's $34bn offer for the newly-formed Baxalta is financially motivated and not necessarily strategically sound. The big biotech <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shires-Bid-For-Baxalta-A-Fools-Errand-359774" target="_new">announced</a> the morning of Aug. 4 that it has proposed an all-stock merger of 0.1687 Shire American depositary receipts for each Baxalta share, implying a value of $45.23 per share, or $33.9bn. While both companies operate under the large umbrella of rare diseases, they have few drugs in the same therapeutic areas and little in common culturally. </p><p>Yet, Shire claims that the deal could have nearly $1bn in synergies and a very beneficial 17% tax rate. With synergies being the driving rationale behind the offer, it's particularly important that those synergies are realized. </p><p>But much like politicians, mergers don't often live up to their promises. </p><p>Paul Heugh, CEO of London strategy implementation consultancy Skarbek Associates, pointed out in an interview that about half of M&A fails to achieve the synergies promised when deals are signed. </p><p>"Synergies can usually be read as redundancies in an M&A context. But trimming duplicated jobs is more problematic than it appears. Synergies carry all sorts of hidden risks that are rarely considered sufficiently and most often not priced into the deal," he said. </p><p>"If you look at the longer term picture &ndash; taking the financial strategy out of it &ndash; putting two complementary portfolios together doesn't necessarily lead to a stronger company," Heugh added, acknowledging that companies need to ask if they have the knowledge, expertise and infrastructure to support and exploit that larger portfolio. </p><p>Shire has been pursuing a significant deal since its hopes of a merger with <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily/2014/10/15/tax-reform-takes-its-toll-abbvie-having-second-thoughts-about-shire" target="_new">AbbVie were dashed</a> in 2014. Yet, the rationale behind that deal was also financial &ndash; and not strategic. AbbVie's $54bn merger with Shire was motivated by Shire's advantageous tax rate; once that inversion was taken off the table by changes in tax policy in the US, AbbVie no longer saw any sense in the deal. </p><p>If a takeover of Baxalta is unsuccessful &ndash; and so far it's looking like it might be &ndash; Shire seems ready to pursue any number of other companies until it finds the right fit.</p><p><p>
