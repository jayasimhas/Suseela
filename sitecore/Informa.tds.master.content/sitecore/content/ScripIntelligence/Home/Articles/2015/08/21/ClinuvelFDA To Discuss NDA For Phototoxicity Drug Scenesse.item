<p> The Australian company Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals is to meet the US Food and Drug Administration in late September to discuss the NDA filing requirements for its orphan drug Scenesse (afamelanotide) for the treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by an absolute intolerance to light. </p><p> Among the issues to be discussed are the possibility of an accelerated assessment for Scenesse and whether the risk-management program it agreed with the European Medicines Agency after EU approval last year will satisfy the FDA's demands as well, the company said. </p><p> The approval of Scenesse in the US would be a welcome addition to the therapeutic toolbox as there are no other treatments available for patients with EPP, who risk second-degree burns, swelling and burning if they are exposed to daylight. </p><p> Scenesse works by increasing the melanin content of the skin without having to expose it to the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation. In recommending its approval last year, the EMA's CHMP said the benefits of treatment were a reduction in light sensitivity and a consequent, if limited, increase in the time patients could spend in daylight or sunlight. </p><p> Clinuvel says it has been in close contact with the FDA throughout the Scenesse development program, and has formally met the agency on a number of occasions since 2009 to discuss the product's use in EPP and another skin disorder, vitiligo. </p><p> Next month the company will meet staff from the Division of Dermatology and Dental Products (DDDP), part of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). The DDDP will be responsible for the scientific review of the Scenesse NDA, having previously reviewed the original 2009 Investigational New Drug application and subsequent amendments. </p><p> Clinuvel says it will use the Type C meeting to identify the FDA's current thinking on the following areas, among others: </p><ul> <li> The eligibility of Scenesse for accelerated approval (subpart H); </li><li> The requirements for a US post-authorization Phase IV trial to monitor EPP patients' treatment in the long term; and </li><li> Whether Clinuvel's annual Scenesse reporting obligations to the EMA would meet the FDA's requirements. </li> </ul><p> The company's chief scientific officer, Dennis Wright, said that the European distribution of Scenesse had developed into a &quot;complex and well considered program with a need to satisfy the EMA&quot;, and that he expected this program to be &quot;subjected to the FDA's attention as long-term follow-up of patients is also a US requirement.&quot; </p><p> Scenesse was approved in the EU under the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; provision, which is used where the drug fills an unmet medical need but the company is unlikely ever to provide comprehensive data on the product, for example for ethical reasons. Under this provision, Clinuvel set up a post-marketing program to monitor ongoing safety and efficacy, including patient registries and a Phase IV pharmacokinetic study in according with the pharmacovigilance plan. </p><p> &quot;We will learn whether the current European risk management plan meets the FDA's criteria,&quot; Wright said. &quot;The pool of our data, patient reported outcomes, and physicians&rsquo; declarations of effectiveness all add to the strength of the dossier which we have established over more than a decade.&quot; </p><p> As to how the FDA will view the Scenesse NDA package, company chairman Stanley McLiesh said: &quot;One never really knows how different regulatory agencies act, however the response of patients and physicians on both sides of the Atlantic has been uniformly in favor of the treatment. Given that the FDA would have access to a similar data package as submitted to the EMA, we anticipate similar discussions on risk, benefit, and clinical relevance of Scenesse.&quot; </p><h2> Patient Involvement </h2><p> As in Europe, the company has taken steps to ensure the involvement of patient representatives and expert clinicians, who have separately met the agency to discuss the impact of EPP and the effects of Scenesse treatment in clinical trials. </p><p> In the EU, Scenesse was the first product where patients' views and experiences were formally integrated into the EMA's decision-making process, as part as a move towards greater patient involvement in benefit-risk discussions. Company CEO Philippe Wolgen <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Clinuvels-Philippe-Wolgen-on-Scenesse-and-the-patient-factor-356792" target="_new">said earlier this year</a> that this played a part in the EMA's October 2014 decision to begin a pilot whereby patients could be invited to take part in product-specific benefit-risk discussions at the CHMP on a regular basis. </p><h2> Vitiligo Studies </h2><p> As well as EPP, Scenesse is being developed as a repigmentation therapy in adults with generalized vitiligo, for which the development program began in 2010. Results of the first trial, CUV102, were released in December 2012, with follow-up results being published in 2013. The data suggested that Scenesse might produce the best results in darker-skinned patients. A Phase II trial in such patients, CUV103, began in Singapore in 2014. </p><p> Clinuvel says it has identified a number of patient populations with a clinical need for photoprotection and another population with a need for repigmentation, ranging in size from 5,000 to 45 million patients. </p> <p>
