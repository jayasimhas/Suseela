<p> There's probably a lot riding on her but Samina Vaziralli, part of Cipla's founding family and new inductee on the company's board, appears unfazed by the task on hand or all the speculation around top level exits at the firm. </p> <p> Ms Vaziralli is the daughter of Cipla's vice chair M K Hamied, who is the brother of chairman Dr Yusuf Hamied. </p> <p> In an exclusive interview with <i>Scrip</i>, the unassuming heiress talks about how her new role reinforces the Hamied family's &quot;commitment and continuation&quot; to the Cipla &quot;legacy and story&quot; and plans to nurture the new baby &ndash;the firm's fledgling consumer healthcare business which was incubated by her. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/F9A8D1FD912D452EAFDD335E4CBDBEAD.ashx"></p> <p> <i>Samina Vaziralli, Cipla director and a member of its founding family</i> </p> <p> &quot;This is the third generation of the Hamied family in Cipla and my hope is that there are several more generations to come. It is challenging and if you look at other family-run companies, by the time they hit the third generation, there is not that interest to take the legacy forward,&quot; the soft-spoken Ms Vaziralli said. </p> <p> However, in the Hamied family's case, it probably has &quot;much deeper meaning&quot; as Cipla, she claims, was built for patients and to provide affordable healthcare. </p> <p> &quot;In that respect it is my endeavor that I can take that legacy forward for the family for several more generations.&quot; </p> <p> Ms Vaziralli's new dual role would predominantly involve focusing on incubating the consumer healthcare business and representing the management and the promoter family on the Cipla board and ensuring that she and Cipla's global CEO Subhanu Saxena together with the management team set the strategic vision for the company and &quot;course this.&quot; </p> <p> The young scion is also quick to dismiss, at least for now, speculation of potentially more top level exits including rumors swirling that Mr Saxena may be moving on. More on personnel later. </p> <h2> Consumer healthcare </h2> <p> Cipla's consumer healthcare journey apparently started 24 months ago with Ms Vaziralli partaking in a 6-to7 month exercise together with consultants Bain &amp; Company. </p> <p> &quot;I personally went with them across India, met 6,500 families, did 500 interviews, and met 1,200 chemists just to see what Cipla stands for. What are the choices? Where should we play in [the segment] and where do we have the right to win?&quot; </p> <p> Broadly, it then meant taking 58 segments and &quot;putting them through a funnel&quot; to decipher what the unmet needs of consumers were, where the consumer is going and how Cipla could, with its R&amp;D and innovation, meet unmet needs. </p> <p> The company then narrowed down its focus to certain segments and the first area was smoking cessation, where Cipla has since launched Nicotex, a gum which helps smokers quit the habit. Nicotex, which was switched from the firm's prescription business to consumer healthcare, notched sales of around INR350m ($5.5m) last year. </p> <p> The Indian consumer healthcare market is currently valued at around $4bn and growing at a compound annual growth rate of 15%. It is expected to touch $10bn by 2020. </p> <p> In addition to identifying products that can be switched &ndash; from Rx to OTC &ndash; Ms Vaziralli also referred to Cipla's business in South Africa, where around 25% of the topline comes from an OTC pipeline, which she emphasized was &quot;totally built&quot; by Cipla's R&amp;D team and manufactured in India. </p> <p> &quot;So there's a pipeline of products we can leverage and bring to India and actually see which of those meet the unmet need of the Indian consumer.&quot; </p> <p> The next consumer healthcare product is slated for launch in around eight to 12 months, but Cipla is already gearing on the personnel and other fronts. </p> <p> Mr Anantha Nayak, who has comes with considerable experience from P&amp;G, will lead Cipla's consumer healthcare business and Ms Vaziralli referred to other hires from Heinz, Novartis OTC and Ranbaxy OTC. </p> <p> She also noted how the consumer healthcare business requires a different &quot;ecosystem and governance model,&quot; hence necessitating its spin off. </p> <p> &quot;For us it's pharma in&#8230;it takes in all the R&amp;D, manufacturing that you would do for a pharma company&#8230; but it's very fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) out. It is a pull-based model, where the pull would come from campaigning, TV ads, activation at the retailers end. It's a lot of front loaded cost, something that a pharma company is not used to.&quot; </p> <p> Cipla's board recently cleared the &quot;divestment&quot; of its <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-heiress-joins-board-as-family-fortifies-commitment-359368">consumer healthcare business</a> to a wholly owned subsidiary that is proposed to be incorporated. </p> <p> Mr Saxena in an earlier <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CEO-sets-sights-on-regional-presence-global-thrust-345709">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i> envisioned that Cipla can be in pharma what giant Hindustan Unilever is to the FMCG industry &ndash; every person in India should be within 500 meters of a Cipla product that is available at a price that's affordable to them. </p> <p> Cipla is also open to in-licensing products (several discussions around that are ongoing, Ms Vaziralli noted) given that the company has leverage in the healthcare network and &quot;10,000 boots on the ground,&quot; in addition to brand acquisitions in the space. </p> <h2> Personnel exits </h2> <p> Ms Vaziralli also brushed aside suggestions of any unusual personnel churn at Cipla. </p> <p> She said that the new leadership team had brought a &quot;lot of success&quot; to Cipla &ndash; whether it was stabilizing operations, putting a robust pipeline in place or going out and front ending. </p> <p> &quot;Some people, unfortunately, have left but have delivered at the times they were expected to. But it's evolutionary and dynamic. I honestly think the company is positioned well for success.&quot; </p> <p> She maintained there was no cause for alarm and that the core team is in place and remains &quot;unfazed and is delivering.&quot; </p> <p> &quot;We had a very strong fourth quarter and we see lots of the same momentum in the first quarter and hope to continue that till the end of the year. The performance has definitely gone up.&quot; </p> <p> She dismissed speculation that senior official Frank Pieters may be moving on and stressed that he was &quot;very much part of Cipla.&quot; </p> <p> Earlier this year, Cipla confirmed to <i>Scrip</i> that Timothy Crew, who has had stints with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Teva, and leads Cipla's North American business, will get <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-management-rejig-anticipates-respiratory-build-up-356140">additional charge</a> of Cipla's Europe business. Consequently, Frank Pieters, Cipla's head of the European region and the global respiratory business, would largely be focused on the latter part of his responsibilities (global respiratory) and the specialty business. </p> <p> Cipla has recently seen a series of high profile personnel exits from the company. <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ciplas-scion-leaves-company-for-new-horizons-357733">Kamil Hamied</a>, son of MK Hamied and Ms Vaziralli's brother, had earlier exited - a move that was apparently timed to allow the young scion &quot;deepen and widen his horizon.&quot; Mr Kamil Hamied is apparently unlikely to return to Cipla in an executive role in the near future. Ms Vaziralli also has a sister, Rumana Hamied. </p> <p> Cipla's country head (India) <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-India-head-Sameer-Goel-quits-357683">Sameer Goel</a>, also quit earlier, while more recently CFO, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CFO-quits-to-turn-entrepreneur-firm-cites-bench-strength-358698">Rajesh Garg</a>, moved on. </p> <p> Ms Vaziralli also referred to Cipla's &quot;fantastic bench&quot; of the next generation of leaders, including herself and sees the company's next leadership team coming from &quot;within.&quot; Mr Saxena had earlier said that a critical area of focus for Cipla over the next 18-24 months was to build its leadership bench in the top 100 positions. </p>
