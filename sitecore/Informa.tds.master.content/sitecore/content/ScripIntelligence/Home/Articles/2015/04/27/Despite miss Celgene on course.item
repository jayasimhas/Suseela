<p><p>Despite a pretty dismal first quarter full of missed expectations &ndash; including the top line, analysts believe that Celgene is right on track. </p><p>The big biotech reported a slew of misses on 30 April, including $2bn in revenues, below analysts' consensus expectations of $2.1bn. Virtually the only drug in its bag to hit expectations was its best-seller, the cancer drug Revlimid (lenalidomide), which brought in $1.34bn worldwide &ndash; slightly above the $1.33bn analysts' expected. </p><p>Yet, the cancer drug Abraxane (paclitaxel) and the psoriasis drug Otezla (apremilast) both missed significantly. Abraxane brought in $223m, below the expected $250m, while Otezla had sales of $60m worldwide, falling short of the estimated $71m. </p><p>Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas believes Otezla is on track to dominate the psoriasis market and is note discouraged by the sales so far. "While Otezla missed consensus expectations with sales at $60M vs. $71M street, we are encouraged by the uptake as the drug is taking the highest (~40%) share in new to brand market," she wrote in a 30 April note to investors. She also highlighted that approximately 85% of Otezla business is coming from patients who have not been treated with a biologic previously. </p><p>"These two factors, in our view, will establish Otezla as the first-line treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We highlight these markets are slow uptake markets and we are encouraged by the fact that Otezla launch is tracking well above Stelara launch," she added. Karnauskas also added that Abraxane revenues are typically low I the first quarter and chalked the miss up to seasonality. </p><h2>Moving forward in I/O</h2><p>"Our recently announced strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca strengthens our competitive position in the rapidly emerging and evolving immuno-oncology market," said Celgene President and COO Mark Alles on the 30 April conference call. <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celgene-pays-450m-for-AZs-MEDI4736-in-blood-cancers-AZ-signs-250m-Innate-deal-358057" target="_new">Earlier in the week</a>, Celgene paid AstraZeneca $450m up front in order to develop the UK drug maker's anti-PD-L1 product MEDI4736 in a range of blood cancers. Celgene will lead on development across all clinical trials within the collaboration and will take on all R&D costs until the end of 2016, after which it will take on 75% of costs. Celgene will also be responsible for global commercialization of approved treatments.</p><p>"To date, we have been opportunistic, anchoring the clinical advantages of Abraxane and Revlimid in combination studies with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors across tumor types and with several different partners. This new collaboration with AstraZeneca gives us the unique opportunity to actively drive the development and commercialization of the anti-PD-L1 axis inhibitor MEDI4736 as monotherapy, and with our existing commercial and emerging clinical therapies in hematology, a core area of strength," added Alles. </p><p>Celgene is trying to become a major player in the immunotherapy field and with the AstraZeneca deal, analysts believe it has entered the competition. "We view this partnership as a smart strategic collaboration for Celgene in establishing a solid foothold in the burgeoning immunotherapy market and will help to maintain its dominance in current and future hematologic oncology indications," wrote JMP Securities analyst Michael King, Jr in a 24 April note. </p><p><p><p>
