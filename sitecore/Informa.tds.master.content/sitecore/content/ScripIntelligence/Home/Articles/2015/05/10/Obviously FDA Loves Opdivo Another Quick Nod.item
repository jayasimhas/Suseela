<p>Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, obviously is in love with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) &ndash; granting the drug another remarkably fast approval.</p><p>On Oct. 9, the FDA expanded Opdivo's use in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>The approval is for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients.</p><p>Regulators noted the drug's earlier approval in NSCLC was in the squamous population only, specifically, those whose disease had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p>That initial NSCLC nod for Opdivo came from the FDA on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Opdivo-wins-speedy-FDA-approval-in-lung-cancer-357076" target="_new">March 4</a> &ndash; more than three months before its June 22 <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action date, which had Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum declaring it was the "fastest approval I've seen in my 15 year career."</p><p>Pazdur in March acknowledged his agency had worked "proactively" with BMS to facilitate the early submission and review of "this important clinical trial when results first became available in late December 2014."</p><p>Now, the FDA has done it again &ndash; giving its blessing to Opdivo about three months ahead of schedule, Schoenebaum pointed out, noting US regulators were not due to make a decision on the broader NSCLC use until Jan. 2, 2016.</p><p>Opdivo's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">first approval</a>, which was in advanced melanoma, also came three months early this past December &ndash; well ahead of its March 30 PDUFA date.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-OKd-1st-U.S.-Immuno-Oncology-Combo-360779" target="_new">On Oct. 1</a>, BMS revealed it had gained an accelerated approval to market Opdivo plus the firm's human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4-blocking antibody Yervoy (ipilimumab) as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600 wild-type unresectable or metastatic melanoma &ndash; the first immuno-oncology combination regimen cleared for marketing in the US.</p><p><b>Keytruda Competition</b></p><p>That approval gave Opdivo a leg up against rival PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), marketed by Merck & Co. Inc.</p><p>Keytruda, which is approved for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following Yervoy and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, actually made history in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">September 2014</a> as the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to gain the FDA's OK to enter the US market.</p><p>And earlier this month, Keytruda <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Mercks-Keytruda-U.S.-Lung-Cancer-Nod-Broad-Enough-360803" target="_new">won its own approval in NSCLC</a> &ndash; gaining the FDA's go-ahead as a treatment for patients with squamous and non-squamous metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an approved test and who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. </p><p>Keytruda's labeling notes that patients with epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for those aberrations before receiving the medicine. </p><p><b>Opdivo Data</b></p><p>For Opdivo's latest approval in NSCLC, BMS' application relied on data from the firm's Phase III CheckMate -057 study, where the drug demonstrated superior overall survival in previously treated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, versus chemotherapy, with a 27% reduction in the risk of death based on a prespecified interim analysis. </p><p>The median overall survival was 12.2 months in the Opdivo arm, versus and 9.4 months in the docetaxel arm.</p><p>"Improving survival for cancer patients represents the ultimate goal of treatment,&rdquo; said Murdo Gordon, senior vice president and head of worldwide markets at BMS. </p><p>Shares of BMS gained $1.02 on Oct. 9, or about 1.7%, before closing at $61.44, up 93 cents, or 1.5%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
