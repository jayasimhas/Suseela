<p>Fourth quarter earnings seasons in India may by and large be a lukewarm affair, with a slowdown in the number of ANDA approvals, currency headwinds and continuing FDA scrutiny at domestic sites expected to rein in growth across a clutch of Indian firms.</p><p>At least two brokerages cited how the absence of "meaningful" ANDA approvals and currency issues, among others, could translate into subdued earnings. The Indian market, though, is expected to deliver significant growth.</p><p>"Over the past year, the approval rate for all companies (except Lupin and Dr Reddy&rsquo;s Laboratories) has been dismal and poses the biggest risk to earnings growth / premium valuations going forward," Edelweiss Securities said in a report dated 9 April. It warned that if things failed to improve, further earnings downgrades were likely. </p><p>Edelweiss, though, expects 4Q earnings to be strong for Cipla and Cadila Healthcare and "soft" for Ipca, which it cites as the least preferred pick in the universe of firms it covers. Ipca has been grappling with compliance issues at its plants, with the US FDA issuing <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ipca-slumps-after-US-import-alert-ripple-effect-fears-356336%5d" target="_new">import alerts</a> across a clutch of its sites, more recently at its formulations manufacturing units in Pithampur and Silvassa. </p><p>Others noted how new ANDA approvals "dwindled" in the fourth quarter versus the previous quarter. "The only meaningful approval impacting an Indian company was the Nexium [generic] approval for Teva, partnered with Cipla," Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said. </p><p>Cipla is the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393%5d" target="_new">supplier</a> of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and formulation for Nexium delayed release capsules to Teva. </p><p>Research Delta Advisors, however, expects significant growth in Dr Reddy's US sales on the back of the "high value launch" of sirolimus, a generic version of Wyeth's Rapamune, in the third quarter. </p><p>"However, margins may be impacted due to currency fluctuations in Russia and expenses related to the Srikakulam facility. A one-time impact due to Venezuela currency depreciation also cannot be ruled out," Mr Mehta said. An FDA inspection of Dr Reddy's active pharmaceutical ingredients site in Srikakulam has previously raised certain compliance issues.</p><p>Edelweiss also noted the depreciation of currencies in emerging markets and Europe versus the Indian rupee. It believes that Dr Reddy&rsquo;s, Glenmark, Ranbaxy, Torrent and Ipca may face the brunt of these headwinds given their exposure to emerging markets.</p><p>Significantly, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is reported to have downgraded its ratings for a clutch of Indian forms including Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla and Cadila Healthcare. The brokerage noted that that after the recent rally "absolute returns" were unlikely in the next 12 months, though it was positive on the long-term prospects. </p><p>A Bank of America Merrill Lynch note dated 9 April is also said to have referred to the dip in approvals of generics, currency and regulatory issues, maintaining that these are "transient" but that they could pose a risk to premium valuations should they persist.</p>
