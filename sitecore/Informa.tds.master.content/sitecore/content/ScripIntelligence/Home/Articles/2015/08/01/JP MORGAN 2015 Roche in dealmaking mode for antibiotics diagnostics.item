<p>Roche told <i>Scrip</i> on 12 January during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco that the company is actively looking to do deals in oncology, neurology and infectious diseases and by the end of the day unveiled a new licensing deal for a Phase I antibiotic.</p><p>Since the Basel, Switzerland-based big pharma company revealed a diagnostics company majority investment to enhance its oncology pipeline on JP Morgan eve, does that mean a neurology deal will be next? Anything is possible during the annual investor conference, which often sets the investment and dealmaking tone for the biotechnology and pharma industries for the year.</p><p>When Sophie Kornowski Bonnet, head of Roche partnering, spoke with <i>Scrip</i> about the company's investment of up to $1.18bn in cash and equity in the diagnostics maker Foundation Medicine she said that Roche's partnering strategy in early research and development is particularly focused on certain therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology and infectious diseases. Dr Kornowski Bonnet also noted that the company would soon announce deals related to best-in-class antibiotics.</p><p>Meiji Seika Pharma (Meiji) and Fedora Pharmaceuticals may earn up to $750m in upfront and milestone payments plus royalties from Roche under the partnership announced late on 12 January in the US. Roche obtained worldwide rights, except for in Japan where Meiji retained its rights, to develop and commercialize OP0595, a beta-lactamase inhibitor.</p><p>The drug will be advanced in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic to target severe infections caused by <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, including multi-drug-resistant strains. Beta-lactamase inhibitors restore or potentiate the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics. </p><p>"We have seen truly impressive bacterial eradication in highly resistant strains generated by combination of this beta-lactamase inhibitor with existing beta-lactam antibiotics," Edmonton, Alberta, Canada-based Fedora's founder and CEO Christopher Micetich said in a statement from Roche. "The properties of OP0595 and its ability to be combined with new or existing beta-lactam antibiotics promise a significant advance in the battle against increasing multi-drug-resistant bacteria."</p><p>The deal between Fedora, Meiji and Roche follows antibiotic development agreements the big pharma company signed in late 2013 and early 2014 with Polyphor and Discuva as Roche set out to bolster its standing in antibiotics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-signs-another-antibiotic-deal-350310" target="_new">28 February</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-aims-to-lead-big-pharma-in-21st-century-antibiotic-discovery-challenge-350420" target="_new">6 March 2014</a>).</p><p>Dr Kornowski Bonnet said Roche is particularly interested in new drugs to treat gram-negative infections, but the company's business development team is working closely with Roche's early research and development group to identify greatest areas of need across therapeutic areas of interest to the company.</p><p><b>Diagnostics deal</b></p><p>Roche's pharma division led the investment in Foundation Medicine and the early research group was keen to be involved in the dealmaking process. Roche felt so strongly about Foundation Medicine and what its technology could add to the company's oncology drug development that it agreed to buy as much as a 56% share of Foundation Medicine's stock (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Roche-to-take-majority-stake-in-Foundation-Medicine-356082" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Roche decided a few years ago that health care information technology would be important to the company's drug development process, including diagnostics that could identify appropriate patients for clinical trials that will evaluate targeted cancer therapies.</p><p>"It is important to standardize the way we do clinical trials," Dr Kornowski Bonnet said, noting that Foundation Medicine and Roche have a similar focus on strengthening the understanding of their technology and understanding its clinical findings over time.</p><p>John Reed, head of Pharma Research and Early Development at Roche, said genetic data for study participants will become "common currency; a foundation you want to have in clinical trials."</p><p>However, it's unclear how many other deals Roche will do in the diagnostics space that will be led by the company's pharma business, since the Foundation Medicine agreement suits a lot of Roche's needs in terms of clinical trial design for targeted therapies. </p><p>Roche also acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4bn in 2008 to grow its diagnostics business and enhance its drug development activities (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Roche-gets-its-way-as-Ventana-agrees-to-buy-out-58490" target="_new">25 January 2008</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
