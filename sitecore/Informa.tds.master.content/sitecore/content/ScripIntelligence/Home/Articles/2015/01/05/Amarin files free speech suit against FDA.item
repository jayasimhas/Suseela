<p>Amarin has filed a lawsuit against the FDA in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York charging the agency's regulations restrict the company&rsquo;s free speech rights to discuss off-label use of the firm's fish oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl). </p><p>Vascepa, a semisynthetic, 96% ultra-pure ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid, is approved in the US as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, or above 500mg/dL.</p><p>But late last month, the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-rejects-expanded-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-358103" target="_new">declined to expand</a> the use of Vascepa as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in adults on statin therapy with mixed dyslipidemia and TG levels from 200mg/dL to 499mg/dL &ndash; the so-called ANCHOR indication.</p><p>Amarin said it is not suing the FDA to compel it to approve the expanded indication for Vascepa based on the ANCHOR trial results. Nor is the firm asking the court to evaluate whether the FDA's scientific conclusions about Vascepa are right or wrong. </p><p>The company said it's also not out to strike down off-label promotion laws and regulations as facially unconstitutional and it is not challenging the US government's ability to prohibit pharmaceutical companies, including Amarin, from disseminating false or misleading information about their products.</p><p>Amarin said its suit, which is joined by four independent physicians, was filed to permit the firm to share "truthful and non-misleading information, which would be considered off-label by the FDA, with US healthcare professionals. </p><p>The suit seeks a judicial declaration that FDA regulations limiting off-label promotion of truthful and non-misleading information are "unconstitutional" because they violate the firm's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment of the US Constitution or the Fifth Amendment, restriction against vague laws.</p><p>Amarin's complain is asserting that better informed physicians make better treatment decisions for their patients. </p><p>The lawsuit is seeking a court declaration that Amarin may communicate efficacy data from its ANCHOR trial of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels despite statin therapy.</p><p>The company said it does not intend to share that information with the general public.</p><p>But Amarin wants the court to allow the firm to communicate the "qualified health claim&rdquo; that it said the FDA has permitted for over a decade for omega-3 dietary supplement products: Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. </p><p>Amarin also wants to talk to prescribers about peer-reviewed scientific publications relevant to the potential effect of EPA on the reduction of the risk of coronary heart disease.</p><p>The company is insisting the use covered by the ANCHOR study is "consistent with multiple national and international medical treatment guidelines and position statements and relevant to millions of patients on statin therapy still at risk of cardiovascular disease." </p><p>In the complaint, Amarin has proposed disclaimers be used to ensure the truthful information communicated is not misleading, including that the effect of Vascepa on cardiovascular risk has not been determined and that FDA has not approved the drug to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease or for the use studied in the ANCHOR trial. </p><p>The company and the four physicians are contending that broader communication of truthful information about Vascepa will improve patient care by making doctors better informed with current scientific data before deciding how to treat patients consistent with multiple national and international medical treatment guidelines. </p><p>"Currently, FDA regulations restricting off-label promotion limit this type of truthful and non-misleading communication, preventing most physicians from making fully-informed treatment decisions," Amarin said.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-Panel-CVOT-needed-before-expanding-use-of-Amarins-Vascepa-347419" target="_new">October 2013</a>, the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 9-2 that Vascepa was not ready for primetime in the ANCHOR indication &ndash; advising the agency to wait for the results of the REDUCE-IT study.</p><p>The FDA plans to hold a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-to-hold-off-label-drug-meeting-358249" target="_new">public meeting</a> on the topic of off-label uses of drugs, although it has not yet disclosed the timing or agenda of that meeting.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
