<p>Cubist Pharmaceuticals has tapped Heptares Therapeutics, the UK-based GPCR specialist, to help it develop new medicines for an acute care indication.</p><p>Under a license deal which sees acute care-focused Cubist paying Heptares $5.5 million up front and up to $4 million in research funding plus undisclosed milestones and royalties, Cubist has nominated a drug target and Heptares will use its structure-based drug design platform to discover lead compounds. The partners will work together on optimization. Cubist will take over completely from preclinical development onwards. It also has an option to nominate a second GPCR target later in the collaboration for Heptares to work on based on pre-determined but undisclosed financials.</p><p>Heptares' business is based on platform technology that enables it to design drugs that target G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). </p><p>GPCRs are expressed in every type of cell in the body, are linked to diseases of many different types, and are the site of action of around a quarter to a third of all current drugs. However, discovering drugs that specifically target them is complicated by the fact that they become unstable when taken out of the cell membrane, losing their structure and activity. Heptares' technology overcomes this problem because it enables the engineering of stabilised GPCRs (dubbed STaRs) to which modern structure-based drug discovery can be applied.</p><p>Launched as a spin-out of the UK Medical Research Council in 2007, by early last year the company had announced that for the first time structure-based design had been used to discover a GPCR-targeted candidate. The candidate in question, a small-molecule adenosine A<subscript>2A</subscript> receptor antagonist, was licensed in March 2012 to Shire for CNS disorders in a deal potentially worth upwards of $190 million. </p><p>In 2011, Heptares secured partnership deals focused on specific GPCR targets with Takeda, with AstraZeneca for small molecules against several targets and with AZ's MedImmune business to look at applying the Heptares platform for antibody discovery; it had previously signed a deal with Novartis Option Fund in 2009 which led to it generating a STaR for its partner's target in 2011.</p><p>Aside from its discovery efforts on behalf of partners, and the product licensed to Shire, Heptares is working on its own pipeline of therapeutic candidates for neurology and metabolic conditions. </p><p>This includes the first selective muscarinic M<subscript>1</subscript> receptor agonist candidate for Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairment disorders, which moved into preclinical development in 2012 and which Malcolm Weir, Heptares' co-founder and CEO, hopes will move into clinical development late in 2013 or early in 2014. "Muscarinic receptor agonism is known to address cognitive dysfunction, and so far nobody's been able to get selective enough molecules to take forward, but we have got very selective compounds and so we've got high hopes for that," he told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>According to Dr Weir, there are "a lot of GPCRs out there, way more than you could work on, probably even within the whole industry". When the firm signs a deal, it is done purely on the basis of a particular target rather than a therapeutic area, meaning that multiple partnerships could potentially be pursued in the same therapeutic space.</p><p>"We're always talking to pharma companies and big biotechs about areas of potential mutual interest and when deal opportunities come along that fit our strategy we move them forward. But only if they're the right ones." He noted that the Cubist deal along with the milestones and upfronts from previous deals has put the company "in good shape financially", reducing the imperative for the company to sign new deals, "although it is our model to continue to do deals to provide non-dilutive income and you don't stop just because you've just done one".</p>
