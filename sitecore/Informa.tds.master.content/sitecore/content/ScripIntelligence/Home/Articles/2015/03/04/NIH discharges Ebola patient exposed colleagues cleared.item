<p>An American healthcare worker who contracted Ebola while serving as a volunteer in Sierra Leone and whose condition at one point last month was considered critical has survived the disease and was discharged from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center on 9 April after being declared virus free.</p><p>The person, whose identity is not being revealed, left the NIH in good condition after spending nearly a month at the hospital, the agency said.</p><p>Partners In Health (PIH), the group the worker was volunteering with, said he was "making his way toward a full recovery."</p><p>About 20 of the man's American colleagues who had been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Several-Americans-potentially-exposed-to-NIH-Ebola-patient-357292" target="_new">transported back to the US for observation</a> last month after potentially being exposed to the infected healthcare worker while in Sierra Leone were cleared last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health officials after 21 days of monitoring.</p><p>PIH said two of those clinicians who were under monitoring are heading back to Sierra Leone to rejoin the aid group's efforts in responding to the Ebola epidemic, in which more than 25,500 people have been infected with the virus and over 10,500 have died.</p><p>"Ebola is one of the most devastating diseases you can have," Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases, said last month during a Washington forum hosted by <i>The Atlantic</i>. </p><p>"This patient, without a doubt had he been in West Africa, would be dead now. There's no doubt about that," Dr Fauci said at the 18 March event.</p><p>"The fact you have intensive care treatment doesn't guarantee at all that the patient is going to get well. It makes the odds go from 90% chance of dying to much lower," said Dr Fauci, who treated the Ebola patient at the NIH Clinical Center. </p><p>The unidentified healthcare worker, who was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-deaths-top-10000-NIH-to-treat-infected-American-357273" target="_new">admitted to the NIH on 13 March</a>, was the second patient with Ebola treated at the Clinical Center. The NIH's first Ebola patient was Nina Pham, a Dallas, Texas nurse who had become infected with the virus when she provided care to Thomas Eric Duncan &ndash; the first person inside the US borders to be diagnosed with the disease. </p><p>Ms Pham was the first ever case of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">Ebola transmission</a> in the US.</p><p>The Dallas nurse &ndash; who filed a lawsuit against employer, Texas Health Presbyterian &ndash; recovered, as did her colleague, Amber Vinson, who also contracted Ebola from Mr Duncan, who died of the disease on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">8 October 2014</a>.</p><p>Two other healthcare workers were admitted to the NIH's Clinical Center for observation of Ebola after experiencing high-risk exposures to the virus while serving in Sierra Leone. </p><p>Neither of those patients &ndash; an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nurse-exposed-to-Ebola-under-observation-at-NIH-355620" target="_new">unidentified nurse</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NIH-discharges-doctor-exposed-to-Ebola-from-needle-stick-354342" target="_new">Dr Lewis Rubinson</a>, director of the critical care resuscitation unit at the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center &ndash; actually came down the disease. </p><p>The NIH Clinical Center's special clinical studies unit is specifically designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists, the agency noted. </p><p>The unit staff members are trained in strict infection control practices optimized to prevent spread of potentially transmissible agents, such as Ebola, according to the NIH.</p><p>A <a href="http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/5nes.pdf" target="_new">description</a> on the NIH's website said its special clinical studies unit is a seven-bed patient care unit with three double-occupancy rooms and one single-occupancy room. The unit has special air-flow systems to provide patients and staff with a continuous flow of filtered clean air.</p><p>The NIH said access to the unit is strictly controlled. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
