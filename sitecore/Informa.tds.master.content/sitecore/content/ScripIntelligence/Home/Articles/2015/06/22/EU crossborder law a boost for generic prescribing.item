<p>From October this year, most prescriptions that are issued in one EU member state but intended for dispensing in another will have to indicate just the drug's generic name and not the brand, according to an implementing directive adopted by the European Commission. </p><p>While the number of products involved will be limited, and certain medicines such as biologicals can be prescribed by the brand name, the move to mandate generic prescribing represents a small but significant encroachment by the EU into a policy area normally reserved to the member states. Moreover, by the commission's own admission, it could encourage the wider implementation of generic-friendly policies by governments across Europe. </p><p>On the other hand, the legislation will give a moderate boost to the pharmaceutical industry in general, in terms of facilitating the sale of medicines that might otherwise not be dispensed. </p><h2>Cross-border healthcare</h2><p>The new rules, adopted by the commission last month, give effect to some provisions of the cross-border healthcare directive (No 2011/24/EU), which came into force in April 2011 and must be implemented into national laws by 25 October this year. The directive lays down a minimum set of elements that must be included on so-called cross-border prescriptions. </p><p>The aim of the move is to ensure that the person who dispenses the medicine can verify the authenticity of both the prescription and the prescriber, and ensure that the correct drug is dispensed. </p><p>Cross-border prescriptions currently account for 0.02-0.04% of all EU prescriptions, and are relevant mainly for patients with chronic diseases wishing to travel to another EU country, those living in border regions or smaller countries, and patients with rare diseases who cannot access specific medicines in their home countries, the commission says. </p><p>A survey conducted in 2012 involving nearly 1,000 pharmacists in seven EU member states suggested that 55% of patients face difficulties in getting prescribed drugs dispensed in another country, mainly because of factors such as verifying the prescriber, unfamiliarity with the language, and missing information, according to an impact assessment published by the commission. </p><p>This leads to negative health effects for patients, negative financial effects for patients and reimbursement agencies, and overall negative effects on patient mobility, the commission notes. It says the co-ordination of prescriptions for medicines and devices will translate into some 200,000 additional prescriptions being dispensed each year. </p><h2>Generic name takes precedence</h2><p>From October, drugs prescribed for dispensing in another country must carry the common or international non-proprietary name in order to facilitate the correct identification of the product, which may be marketed under several different brand names across the EU, or only marketed in some countries. </p><p>Brand names should only be used for biological medicines to ensure that they are clearly identified, or for other products where the prescribing physician deems the branded drug "medically necessary" and provides sufficient justification. For medical devices, the prescription should also include the prescriber's contact details so the dispenser can enquire about the device prescribed.</p><p>The other elements to appear on cross-border prescriptions are the patient's name and date of birth, the date of issue, details of the prescriber (including direct contact details), and the product formulation, quantity, strength and dosage regimen. These are the minimum elements, and member states can require more information to be included in order to comply with national rules, provided these rules are compatible with EU law.</p><h2>Industry views</h2><p>The decision to adopt a generic prescribing approach may make sense in terms of identifying the correct product where multiple brands are marketed in different countries, but it goes counter to the wishes of the innovator industry. </p><p>In comments submitted to a public consultation on cross-border recognition of prescriptions held from October 2011 to January 2012, the pharmaceutical industry federation EFPIA and its biologicals arm EBE said that when INNs were used, "they should always be accompanied by the brand name of the product, or the name of the manufacturer, to ensure that products are delivered in accordance with the patients' specific needs". </p><p>They said they would be opposed to a policy of "mandatory INN prescribing", particularly with regard to biotech-derived drugs where two medicines may be similar but not identical to each other, and possibly with different side-effect and efficacy profiles.</p><p>The point about biologicals has clearly been taken on board by the commission, but it has put its foot down where other medicines are concerned, seeing no good reason for a brand name to be written. </p><p>Moreover, the decision to require most medicines to be identified by the generic name on cross-border prescriptions could have a bigger knock-on effect, encouraging more member states to impose generic prescribing rules for their own purposes.</p><p>Indeed, in its impact assessment the commission acknowledged that "the consideration to introduce the active substance by generic denomination on prescriptions as a mandatory element may be seen as facilitating legislative measures at MS [member state] level in the field of mandatory prescribing by generic name". It added: "These issues can be very sensitive from the industry's perspective."</p><p>Whether mandatory generic prescribing will spread as a result of this directive remains to be seen &ndash; the commission is of course thinking here of correct product identification rather than financial savings &ndash; but it will certainly do nothing to discourage cash-strapped member states from considering such policies. </p>
