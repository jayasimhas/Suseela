<p> <b>Dr Luciano Rossetti was appointed global head of R&amp;D at </b>Merck Serono <b>in July 2014, moving over from</b> Merck &amp; Co<b>, where he had been senior vice-president of late stage development. Before joining Merck &amp; Co [Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme/MSD] as franchise head for diabetes and obesity in 2006, he had had a long and distinguished career in academia, focused on diabetes research in particular. A native of Naples, he moved to the US after completing medical training in Italy. He talked to Scrip's Eleanor Malone about leadership, pipeline pruning, switching careers and more.</b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/A53A1B5E8FEC4574916B35010C50662D.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>Luciano Rossetti, global head of R&amp;D at Merck Serono</i> </p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>What are the most important changes that you've effected at Merck Serono?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>There was energy, there was motivation: almost all the people I met here had an incredible level of desire to contribute to medical progress. But the culture was very divided and diffused. R&amp;D did not have a strong identity as an organization, there were multiple fragments in different areas, even research versus development, early development, late development. From a cultural point of view I focused from the beginning on the issues of transparency, collaboration and objectivity, as the fundamental behaviours that I needed from everyone. I am impressed in just a few months what an amazing change there has been in some of these behaviours and how much people have felt empowered to speak up. </p> <p> Obviously there were small changes to be done in the governance &ndash; I like to have an objective balance between freedom to operate and ability to be creative but also having a cross-functional and cross-therapeutic area governance, so I did modify somewhat and simplify the governance structure in certain areas within the company. </p> <p> Then pipeline rationalization was needed because if we didn't do the tough job in the first few months we would not be able to do what we're doing now, which is to focus our best talent and resources on the very best programs and to accelerate them and execute as well as possible. </p> <p> And finally global clinical development really required reorganization. There was talent in the company scattered in different pockets but there was no real identity of clinical development as a center of excellence, as a department, and that's why I had to make some structural changes in that department. And my new global head of clinical development, Alise Reicin, has just joined us from MSD. </p> <p> Those were really the major areas of focus. The final point is that we are crystal clear on making our primary objectives for the next couple of years very, very transparent to the entire Merck KGaA organization and rallying around those execution goals. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>What are your personal leadership qualities?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>I try to promote transparency in decision-making. I believe very much in having a very vibrant, open and transparent debate. I've been pushing very hard to make the decision process much more open, direct and straightforward so in the end the buy-in from the organization is stronger. I also believe in talent and expertise in the specific areas. My job is to leverage that talent and make people very confident about their area of expertise and in expressing their opinion. I'm very inclusive and collaborative in my leadership style, but on the other hand I can give decisive directions once the debate has occurred and everyone has expressed their opinion. </p> <p> I also believe in people and spend a lot of time listening to opinions from the various components of the organization &ndash;not just the leaders but also people in the layers below. </p> <p> I think I can give a sense of direction to an organization. I juggle between the listening and very quickly giving a sense of purpose, a sense of the action needed. </p> <p> Those are some of the qualities that I found myself leveraging when I was in the previous job at MSD and also in academia, and I'm also leveraging those qualities now with these very good opportunities but also challenges that I'm facing at Merck Serono. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>How about your own long-term aspirations?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>My aspiration is to make a palpable impact in a disease area, and I want to solve or at least contribute to solving some major, serious concern within medical practice. At the end of the day when I finish my career I want to be able to say that in certain areas I really made a big, big difference, and that's why I am very proud and happy about my eight years at MSD, and why I'm equally excited and encouraged by what I found here at Merck Serono and the impact that I think we can have in the disease areas that we have selected. </p> <p> <p> We are really selecting very serious, devastating diseases both in immunology (for example, multiple sclerosis) and in oncology, and there is an incredible level of energy and motivation here, that was not previously fully channelled in the right direction. They needed guidance, and I believe I can make more of difference here perhaps than in a bigger company like MSD at this point. I made a pretty good impact there, firstly by prioritizing and selecting the areas to invest heavily in, and that is starting to bear fruit for Merck &amp; Co. Here at Merck Serono the potential to really transform the R&amp;D organization is even bigger. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip</b>: <i><b>What drove you to build a career in medicine?</b></i> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>I grew up in a very large family, I was the ninth, and consciously or unconsciously my drive toward medicine came from my experience within that family, even though the rest of the family were all engineering or business people. First of all, when I was only seven or eight my father developed type 2 diabetes. Also, I lost my mother to breast cancer when I was in my twenties, so there is a deep personal motivation that drove me to make a difference through medicine and science. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip</b>: <i><b>What was your first ever job?</b></i> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>I'm boring. I worked very, very hard to finish high school about a year earlier than usual and then I did medical school in absolute record time and then immediately took my first job as a resident and that was it. </p> <p> However, I did play soccer semi-professionally. When I was in my early teens, I was in a development squad. But my father was thrilled when I had a horrendous accident and I could not play anymore. He told me 'now you can dedicate yourself to your dream to be a physician', and I was very highly focused on achieving my dreams as fast as possible. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>What about your early career?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR:</b> Early in my career in academia I came to the US after a reasonably established initial medical career in Italy. I came to Yale Medical School and even though I came from a very established European background, when you come to the US as a physician you have to go through an incredible amount of retraining and re-examination and completely rebuild your credentials. In addition, I barely knew the language, and so I found myself &ndash; five or six years through medical school, already published, already fully trained &ndash; having to start again, having to learn the language, having to redo my medical degree in many ways: studying anatomy and biochemistry again to pass the medical school exams, and then redoing an internship in residence in order to get the medical license... </p> <p> That period of time was both exhilarating because I was convinced this was the right thing to do to accomplish my scientific goals, but also it was really a tough test. If I had done it very soon after my medical degree it would have been easier, but I had to do it at night and weekends, it was a very traumatic period of time to achieve the balance between being a successful scientist and putting myself in a position to be a successful physician in the US as well, that was a challenging period of time, and I had doubts whether I could make it. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip</b>: <i><b>What prompted your move many years later from academia to Merck &amp; Co?</b></i> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR</b>: We were making really major strides in certain areas of science and research but the ability to translate those effective advancements into something tangible for the patients was absolutely limited within the academic environment. </p> <p> There is really a very large gap in translating scientific advancement into medical practice and that is what prompted me to start looking for an opportunity to move into a science-based pharmaceutical company. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip</b>: <i><b>You started off at Merck &amp; Co in the diabetes franchise, your area of academic expertise, but you soon moved beyond that original specialism... any regrets?</b></i> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>Only three months after joining MSD I was asked also to take over cardiovascular disease because it was a critical franchise and needed new leadership. I did run the two franchises in parallel but frankly I had a very strong leadership team in diabetes so my efforts were 80% cardiovascular and only about 20% diabetes. </p> <p> And then in 2009 in preparation for the merger with Schering-Plough a new scientific leadership team was created under my leadership, to lead the strategy across all therapeutic areas. </p> <p> So in a very few years I moved away from diabetes and got interested in a lot of other therapeutic areas. </p> <p> I'm trained in internal medicine and my passion is not limited to diabetes, so this was fulfilling for me, I really enjoyed that role and actually I paid perhaps more attention to oncology than any other specialty within my purview even when I was at MSD, because it was the one with more opportunities, but also some gaps and challenges at that time. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>You've had a fair amount of involvement in rationalizing R&amp;D. What experiences from your time in academia have you brought to bear in this area and what other resources did you tap into to help you?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>In addition to running my own lab and my own clinical activities and teaching I had been the head of a very large diabetes centre with 65 investigators involved in different specialities, from surgery to biochemistry to molecular pharmacology, so prioritizing resources and selecting programs across multiple disciplines and different areas was something I was very familiar with. </p> <p> It was a very exciting and very difficult task when Merck &amp; Co merged with Schering-Plough and we had to merge two very large pipelines, and also to coordinate across all the different franchises. </p> <p> So when I came to Merck Serono last year I already had a natural affinity for working on prioritization and creating a very sharp focus, both in our pipeline but also in our future discovery effort and scientific interaction. </p> <p> I would say that a lot of the initial prioritization of the pipeline was a natural event, where on the clinical side it was pretty crystal clear that had been were some programs in the pipeline for a very long time and either because of emerging data or because of major changes in the disease area marketplace they were really at the point that a decision needed to be made. </p> <p> And then there was a very exciting, emerging early clinical pipeline in the disease areas that we want to focus on &ndash; immunology, oncology and immune-oncology &ndash; and I found that the promise of the early pipeline also required us to be very decisive in prioritizing the rest so we could focus our talent, resources and efforts on the most promising programs within those focus areas. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>What has been the proudest moment in your career?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR:</b> Can you give me two, one in academia and one in the industry? </p> <p> <p> I spent 25 years in academia and what I'm most proud of is that I created an area of scientific interest in which a lot of successful young investigators have made a career, and that is the regulation of metabolism from the brain, from the central nervous system, and in particular from the hypothalamus. </p> <p> I'm proud of this for two reasons. one is that the transformative ideas are being picked up by so many investigators after I left academia and are very prominent today, more than 10 years after I left. And secondly, many of my fellows and students have made a career within that area and they are now full professors with endowed chairs in different prestigious organizations in academia in Canada and in the US, so to me even though I did many different things in academia that's an accomplishment that I'm very proud of. </p> <p> And then at MSD, with the help of my team I had to make some critical decisions in the somewhat brutal prioritization following the merger with Schering-Plough and the selection of the key programs to be advanced and to receive enormous resources, such as PD-1, the BACE inhibitor, the HCV franchises with NS5A and the protease inhibitors. Now from a distance I can see the PD-1 programme advancing, the HCV franchise finally getting breakthrough status and BACE is still ongoing. Selecting the best possible opportunities and cutting out a lot of the other things to focus on those few programs I think was a big achievement and I'm hoping to do similar things here at Merck Serono. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>How about your most difficult moment?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR:</b>. During my time in the industry I felt the most challenged and the most doubtful when I did my first transition out of diabetes. </p> <p> I was already struggling when I moved to MSD in 2006, despite having 15 years of experience as a consultant, to learn how this very complex company, how drug development and drug discovery works. Coming from academia to industry you've got to learn, you're back into an internship, and it was hardly three months into that tenure when I was given this huge responsibility to shift to the largest franchise in that company, cardiovascular, with so many complicated issues related to a very large investment in cardiovascular outcome trials, different biology to be addressed and making really difficult decisions in an area that was not my most comfortable with a team that was somewhat in turmoil even among the top leadership. </p> <p> In the end that turned out to be the most important challenge in my career, because it led me to extend my horizons within medicine and really try to make an impact in different areas. </p> <p> By the time I got into the leadership of the entire cross-franchise, I was more mature and even though it was a huge challenge to get those nine franchises under one roof and make tough decisions, that came at a different stage of my growth as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry and therefore I think I was much better equipped for that challenge than the first one. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>Who do you admire and why?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR:</b> I learned a lot from some of my colleagues in academia. </p> <p> I would mention Ron Kahn, who I worked with early on. He was more senior than me, the president of the Joslin Center in Boston. He taught me a lot about leadership well beyond the science. I admire the way he handles his multiple responsibilities and has aggressively promoted young people. </p> <p> I also admire my dean at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dominick Purpura. He was an amazing influence in my career. When I came back from Texas and joined that institution; the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a very high level scientific institution but Dominick in particular was a member of the National Academy of Science, an incredibly successful physician scientist who however decided to dedicate himself to be the dean of that institution for a long period of time. He was really a force in pushing forward the interest of young scientists like me joining that institution. He took a great interest in my career and he had a huge influence in my major success in academia during my 15 years at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: <i>What do you think are the biggest changes you expect to see in the industry over next 20 years?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR: </b>We're going to continue seeing transformative progress in science, mostly driven from academia but with the pharma and biotech industries still providing the fundamental translational changes. I think there will be more progress in oncology in particular. I think the immunotherapy area is only starting to surface today, it's only the tip of the iceberg, but I think a lot more is going to be delivered through unleashing the power of innate immunities against tumour in different ways: cell based therapies, immune checkpoint inhibition, perhaps even a resurgence of cancer vaccines. </p> <p> <p> The fully integrated pharmaceutical model is probably in decline and we will see a much more step wise approach to external and internal collaboration, more based on specific skills. We will focus on core competencies in-house to fully leverage external work: we're going to externalise many different steps in drug discovery and development, so these changes are ongoing but I think they're going to be the future of the industry. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: O<i>ne myth about the industry that you would like to set straight?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>LR:</b> The major misconception is that the industry doesn't play a highly critical, socially responsible role in healthcare. At the end of the day what the industry does is translate science into truly innovative medicine. It's an incredibly high risk business, and so many companies fail every year trying to really pursue this dream. I do think there's very, very little consideration or understanding of how critical the role of the industry is in advancing human health. </p> <p> <p> In the US, spending on prescription drugs is just 10-13% of the overall healthcare cost. More prevention and better treatment can help cut healthcare costs. I think there's an enormous misconception about the mission of the pharmaceutical industry, and how much cost is involved in developing drugs, and how much positive change those drugs can have in the lives of patients and also on overall healthcare costs. </p>
