<p>Lupin's shares dipped on Indian bourses on 8 July amid news that the firm may be under fire from the Brazilian regulator, ANVISA, over certain good manufacturing practice (GMP) deviations at its cephalasporins site.</p><p>Agency reports suggested that ANVISA had suspended imports of all beta-lactam cephalosporin pharmaceutical ingredients and all imported drugs using these inputs made by Lupin, though the Indian firm sought to clarify that it exports just one beta-lactam active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to Brazil and anticipates "no impact" on revenues from the development.</p><p>"A few months back, ANVISA had inspected our cephalosporin facility near Bhopal and had certain observations, which have since been addressed. One observation related to the plant manufacturing another beta-lactam API for veterinary use for supply to Europe. While we don't see this as a GMP concern, Lupin has confirmed to ANVISA not to manufacture API for Brazil in the plant referred above. ANVISA did not have concerns with Lupin using another plant at the same location to continue supply."</p><p>Lupin expects clearance from ANVISA to resume supply by September, it added.</p><p>Lupin's shares ended at INR1875.70 ($29.5), down 1.69%, on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 8 July, though some analysts appeared less concerned about any ripple effect given the limited product impact cited by the firm. </p><p>Anvisa, agency reports said, referred to irregularities detected during the inspection for verification of GMP. </p><p>Lupin had in May this year announced the acquisition of Brazil's Medqu&iacute;mica Ind&uacute;stria Farmac&ecirc;utica, building on its play in Latin America post the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-Grins-its-way-into-Mexico-350900%5d" target="_new">buyout</a> of Mexico's Laboratorios Grin in 2014. </p>
