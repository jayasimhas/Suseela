<p> <p> Horizon Pharma is the newest victim of Valeant International's woes as the biopharma's scandal begins to seep into other areas of the industry. Valeant's bad behavior has prompted pharmacy benefit giant Express Scripts to cut ties with a specialty pharmacy associated with Horizon, putting 5% of its revenues in jeopardy. </p> <p> The PBM revealed Nov. 10 that it is removing Linden Care Pharmacy from its formulary because the specialty pharmacy almost exclusively sells Horizon products in violation of a contractual agreement Express Scripts has with Horizon. </p> <p> The decision comes on the heels of a recent scandal with Valeant that has caused the company's stock to lose almost 70% of its value since August. It recently came to light that a specialty pharmacy dubbed Philidor, which had an exclusive relationship with Valeant, may not have been acting ethically or legally. The pharmacy was accused of misconduct related to filling prescriptions and auto-refill options for patients. </p> <p> It's still unclear whether Philidor's actions are illegal and how much Valeant will be held accountable, but an ad hoc committee established by the company is investigating the matter. <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Demystifying-Valeant-And-Philidor-361239">The scandal</a>, which broke several weeks ago, has prompted payers and insurers to take a closer look at how pharmaceutical companies are distributing their products to patients. While the use of specialty pharmacies is a common practice that can offer customers a cheaper, faster way to get certain drugs, exclusive agreements with these businesses are frowned upon. Express Scripts is using the term 'captive pharmacies&quot; to describe these businesses that are deriving the bulk of their revenues from schilling the products of one company. </p> <p> &quot;We are also evaluating several other pharmacies that appear to be predominantly dispensing Horizon prescription drugs. In addition, we are reviewing and evaluating all similar captive pharmacy arrangements that we know of and will work to identify others,&quot; said Express Scripts in a statement on Nov. 11. </p> <p> &quot;We routinely monitor our network and take action when we see pharmacies trying to circumvent solutions, like formulary management, that protect payers and patients from wasteful drug spend,&quot; the statement added. </p> <p> Beyond severing ties with Linden Care, Express Scripts has also filed a complaint against Horizon to seek $140m Express Scripts says it is owed due to breach of contract. &quot;Because of Horizon&rsquo;s continued non-compliance with the agreement, Express Scripts is taking this action to recover money rightfully due its clients,&quot; said the statement. </p> <p> Horizon responded with accusations that analysts called unfounded and &quot;nothing new,&quot; accusing Express Scripts of profiteering and trying to control competition due to its ownership of a mail order pharmacy. </p> <p> &quot;This competitive role, in our view, creates a clear conflict of interest, as Express Scripts stands as both a pharmacy's overseer and competitor. Based on its Accredo ownership, it's not surprising that Express Scripts would target small, competitive independent specialty pharmacies in order to force those pharmacies from its network, attempt to dominate the US specialty pharmacy medicine distribution channel and further boost its own profits at the expense of patients,&quot; said Horizon Chairman and CEO Tim Walbert. </p> <p> Walbert added that Horizon does a large chunk of its business with Accredo and is currently reevaluating that relationship. He went on to call Express Scripts reckless in its labeling of Linden Care and reiterated that Horizon does not own a stake in Linden Care. </p> <p> Horizon is currently conducting a tender offer to acquire Depomed through a hostile takeover. The issue with Express Scripts is likely to have an impact on this offer that has already been adamantly rejecte by the Depomed board of directors. </p> <p>
