<p>True to its word, Sprout Pharmaceuticals has resubmitted its new drug application (NDA) for flibanserin, fulfilling its promise made late last year to again seek the FDA's nod in the first quarter for the experimental product as a treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).</p><p>Women with the condition, which is the most commonly reported form of female sexual dysfunction, experience a persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of sexual thoughts, fantasies or desire for sexual activity.</p><p>Flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist antagonist, which is intended as a non-hormonal drug to treat HSDD in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, is believed to work on key neurotransmitters in the brain that affect sexual desire.</p><p>It's thought flibanserin corrects an imbalance of levels of the neurotransmitters by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine &ndash; both responsible for sexual excitement &ndash; and decreasing serotonin, which is responsible for sexual inhibition.</p><p>If approved by the FDA, flibanserin would be the first and only post-synaptic 5HT1A receptor agonist and 5HT2A receptor antagonist available in the US to treat premenopausal women with HSDD. </p><p>But flibanserin has had a rough time gaining the FDA&rsquo;s approval &ndash; with the agency initially rejecting it five years ago, when Boheringer Ingelheim owned the drug.</p><p>After its loss at the US agency, the German firm sold flibanserin to Sprout.</p><p>But Sprout also was unable to convince the FDA to approve flibanserin, with the agency again snubbing the drug in 2013. </p><p>Last year, the agency also denied the company's formal dispute resolution filed in response to the complete response letter on flibanserin (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-wants-more-studies-for-Sprouts-female-sex-pill-flibanserin-350001" target="_new">12 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The FDA told Sprout it needed to complete more studies of flibanserin before the agency would reconsider approving the product for HSDD, the cause of which is believed to involve a multitude of social, psychological and biological factors and may be attributed to a complex interplay of these factors.</p><p>This past November, Sprout reported results of a Phase I driving study &ndash; one of the studies the FDA was seeking &ndash; which demonstrated flibanserin had no next-day impairment of driving ability at dosages up to 200mg at bedtime (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Sprout-plans-Q1-2015-female-sex-drug-resubmission-355245" target="_new">25 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Flibanserin was evaluated in three pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase III North American studies of premenopausal women, with a mean age of 36 years. </p><p>In all three trials, flibanserin demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo on three key endpoints: an increase of sexual desire; a decrease in distress from the loss of sexual desire; and an increase in the frequency of satisfying sex, Sprout reported.</p><p>The firm said flibanserin's safety profile was well characterized in the studies. </p><p>The most common adverse effects observed were dizziness, nausea and sleepiness.</p><p><p><p><p>
