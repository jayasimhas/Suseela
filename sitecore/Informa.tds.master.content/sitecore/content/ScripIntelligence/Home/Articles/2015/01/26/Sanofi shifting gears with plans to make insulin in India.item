<p>Sanofi has finally confirmed that it is indeed setting up a production facility for human insulin in India &ndash; its second such site after the company's existing plant in Frankfurt.</p><p>The Indian vaccine manufacturer, Shantha Biotechnics, which Sanofi snapped up from MÃ©rieux Alliance in 2009, announced on January 29 the laying of the foundation stone in Hyderabad of the new site. </p><p>However, what seemed to excite some analysts and industry watchers most was the potential of the site to eventually manufacture the company's blockbuster basal insulin Lantus (insulin glargine) &ndash; though this is still unconfirmed by Sanofi.</p><p>Sanofi told <i>Scrip</i> that Shantha had existing expertise in sterile manufacturing and biologics and given the large need for wider access to insulin and better control for patients to lead a good quality life, Shantha was now going to expand its production capabilities from vaccine manufacturing, to also include insulin, in India. </p><p>''The construction of our Insuman site is only just initiating and we expect the project to be completed and production to start by 2018-19. The Insuman products manufactured on the Shantha site will be Insuman Rapid, Basal and Comb forms, in a phased manner,'' Sanofi explained.</p><p>Asked whether the site would cater to emerging markets including China, Sanofi clarified that the plan was to establish Insuman production at Shantha for the Indian market initially, and later expand to other markets like the European Union, if required.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> has previously reported that Sanofi was weighing plans to manufacture insulin in India as it geared to build on its diabetes franchise in emerging markets, where bulk of the disease is and will continue to be concentrated. Analysts said that any company seriously looking to produce low-cost insulin in India would potentially threaten the competitive positioning of domestic firms such as Biocon and also those companies it supplies bulk insulin to in the region <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-mulls-insulin-production-in-India-amid-rising-emerging-markets-focus-338218%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 13 December 2012)</a>. They also noted the potential advantages of local manufacture of Lantus, currently manufactured at the company's German plant and exported to many countries including India. </p><p>Sanofi had previously also invested in developing a production site in Orel, Russia that is fully operational. Insulin analogs and human insulin cartridges are filled for the Russian market and insulin pens are also manufactured there.</p><h2>Indian facility</h2><p>Sanofi's new facility at Muppireddipalli in the state of Telangana will manufacture Insuman (human insulin) and construction will begin immediately, with the site expected to be fully operational by 2019. </p><p>The new site, which is being set up at an investment of INR4.6bn, will be capable of ramping up manufacturing volumes to 60 million Insuman cartridges per year, within two to three years of commercial manufacturing, a company statement said. Sanofi's Frankfurt site was previously reported to be capable of meeting the insulin needs of over two million diabetics worldwide, though the company decline to provide an update citing competitive reasons.</p><p>Dr Shailesh Ayyangar, Sanofi's managing director (India) and vice president (South Asia) said that the technology transfer and a successful collaborative effort within the Sanofi group also underlined the group's commitment to invest and "make in India". The ''Make in India'' campaign seeks to project the country as a manufacturing hub of choice. Prime minister Narendra Modi has promised an environment of trust and confidence for investors under that effort.</p><p>Sanofi also said that with the new plant, it was a front runner in efforts to address the growing epidemic of diabetes in India. </p><p>Globally, diabetes affects close to 382 million people. India has more than 65 million diabetics &ndash; about as large as France in terms of sheer population - and about 77.2 million pre-diabetics. The number of diabetics in India is expected to rise to 109 million by 2035. Of the estimated 42 million patients on insulin in India, about 3.3 million patients are prescribed regular human insulin (RHI) for diabetes management and control.</p><p>On potential price benefits for patients once the Indian site is operational, Sanofi said that manufacturing Insuman at Shantha would allow the company to offer the product without any compromise on quality, ''at an affordable price''. In India, the product falls under price control.</p>
