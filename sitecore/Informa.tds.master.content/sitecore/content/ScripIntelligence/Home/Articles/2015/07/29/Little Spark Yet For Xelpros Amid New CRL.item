<p> Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company (SPARC) has received a second complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA to its new drug application (NDA) for Xelpros (latanoprost BAK-free eyedrops), though the company claims this concerns &quot;minor&quot; labelling modifications. </p> <p> SPARC is the listed spin-off R&amp;D arm of Sun Pharma of India. </p> <p> The FDA had previously accepted the clarifications and changes to the labeling pertaining to a previous CRL for Xelpros but the Indian firm said that it had now received another CRL seeking minor changes to the proposed labeling. </p> <p> &quot;SPARC hopes to address these requirements soon,&quot; a company statement said. </p> <p> SPARC added that the FDA had also stipulated a satisfactory resolution of the current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) deficiencies at Sun's Halol site in India as a prerequisite for the final approval of Xelpros. </p> <p> While the firm gave no details on the new labelling issues, SPARC's top brass had in June this year underscored how there was <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/SPARC-close-to-licensing-epilepsy-therapy-in-US-358907">no additional demand</a> for any clinical data or preclinical data on safety or efficacy in the initial CRL. One requirement, at that time, pertained to changing the nomenclature of the product from the original proposed ophthalmic solution to ophthalmic emulsion, it told investors in June. </p> <p> SPARC's CEO, Anil Raghavan, though, told <i>Scrip</i> that the company did not believe the proposed label changes &quot;alter/suppress&quot; the addressable market in any way. </p> <p> Mr Raghavan also said that SPARC was not planning to &quot;move the site&quot; for Xelpros &quot;at the moment&quot;, when asked if a site transfer option was being considered in view of cGMP issues at Halol. </p> <p> Some analysts said that they would be concerned only if the label change &quot;substantially changes the value proposition&quot; of the product. </p> <p> SPARC had earlier explained that latanoprost was the largest selling prostaglandin in the US with more than 60% volume share. </p> <p> &quot;Out of this about 10-16% of the patients are likely to develop ocular surface disease. So, out of these 22 million units of the prostaglandin market, the latanoprost brand and other generics will comprise about 63% and out of which our product sales are expected at about 2 million units,&quot; SPARC stated in an investor update in 2014. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is known to cause or aggravate ocular surface disease. </p> <p> Earlier this year, SPARC licensed out Xelpros to a subsidiary of Sun Pharma for the US market. </p> <p> Last month, Sun's founder and managing director, Dilip Shanghvi, said that the firm had set up a <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amid-Suns-FY16-earnings-gloom-some-little-gems-359545">sales and marketing group</a> in the US focused on the ophthalmic business. </p> <p> Sun had then also indicated that remedial measures at its Halol site had resulted in supply constraints for some of the products and that it expected the situation to continue for &quot;some more time&quot; till these steps were completed. </p>
