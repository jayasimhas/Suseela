<p>Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd reported overall growth in the second quarter ended September, but Sanofi's decision to end development of the Indian firm's monoclonal antibody, vatelizumab (GBR-500), took some sheen off its good run.</p><p>Sanofi as part of its results announcement on Oct. 29 said that that it had decided "not to pursue development" of vatelizumab, following the results of a Phase II pre-planned interim analysis in multiple sclerosis (MS) that revealed the primary efficacy endpoint was not met.</p><p>Glenmark, though, underscored that the French multinational's decision was not due to safety concerns and that it would continue to pursue the "re-licensing" of GBR-500 after it&rsquo;s returned from Sanofi. </p><p>Sanofi had earlier terminated the ulcerative colitis Phase II POC study for GBR-500, but announced a new Phase II POC study for multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Glenmark told <i>Scrip</i> that the decision to terminate the ulcerative colitis studies was based on recruitment challenges. </p><p>"GBR 500 could therefore still hold potential in ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease," Glenmark said.</p><p>GBR 500 is an antagonist of the VLA-2 (alpha2-beta1) integrin, seen as having potential to be a broadly applicable anti-inflammatory compound in diseases like Crohn's and multiple sclerosis.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/INTERVIEW-Glenmarks-Buschle-on-how-it-hopes-to-BEAT-cancer-353493" target="_new">Michael Buschle</a>, Glenmark's chief scientific officer and president (biologics), previously told <i>Scrip</i> that with Sanofi acquiring Genzyme, it had a much stronger focus on MS and that if GBR 500 works in MS it's a "huge" indication. </p><p>"And at the time and before we out licensed, we generated lot of data to suggest that MS is a very good target," Dr Buschle then said. </p><p>Glenmark has received $55m from Sanofi for GBR-500.</p><p>Asked whether any payment would be due to Sanofi, with the licensing pact for GBR-500 effectively ended, Glenmark said: "At this point in time the licensing agreement is in full force and Sanofi and Glenmark will enter into discussions and reach a mutual decision on how to proceed further. In case the agreement gets terminated in the future no dues would be payable to Sanofi by Glenmark."</p><p>At the time of announcing the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-licenses-novel-monoclonal-from-Glenmark-for-up-to-663-million-315652" target="_new">licensing deal</a> in 2011 for GBR-500 with Sanofi, Glenmark had indicated that the combined upfront and potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments could be more than $600m. </p><p>Earlier, Glenmark's first in class TRPV3 inhibitor for chronic pain (GRC 15300), also licensed to Sanofi, did not meet the primary endpoint in the Phase II proof-of-concept trial. </p><h2>Overall Growth</h2><p>Glenmark, though, reported overall growth in the second quarter led by its India, US and Europe businesses.</p><p>Glenmark&rsquo;s consolidated revenue increased 13.6% to INR19.09bn ($294.89m) while net profit rose by about 20% to INR1.97bn.</p><p>Sales of the formulation business in India increased 27.27% to INR6.08bn while Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc. USA reported finished dosage formulations revenues of $92.34m (+17.90%). </p><p>Glenmark, however, said that the devaluation of currencies across emerging markets especially in countries like Brazil and Russia had an adverse effect on its operations.</p><p>It noted that the overall business environment in Russia continued to remain challenging. Sales numbers for Russia were further impacted due to currency devaluation. The average rate for Rouble to US dollar was 63.02 during Q2 FY 2016 compared with 36.25 during Q2 FY 2015, it pointed out. In local currency, Glenmark Russia grew by 5% for the quarter and 10% for the first six months.</p>
