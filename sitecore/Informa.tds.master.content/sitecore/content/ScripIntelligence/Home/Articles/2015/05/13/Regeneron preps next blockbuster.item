<p><p>Regeneron is kicking development into high gear for its interleukin-4/13 inhibitor now that the drug has shown positive results in moderate-to-severe asthma. The biotech and its big pharma partner Sanofi are pushing dupilumab into Phase III for the indication and a biologics application could follow shortly thereafter. </p><p>Regeneron and Sanofi shared positive results from a Phase IIb study at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in Denver; it was previously announced that the data was positive. The interim results showed that the cytokine inhibitor provided improved lung function in patients that showed indications of "allergic" asthma by 8% over placebo using the standard forced expiratory volume over second, or FEV1, measure. The 200mg dose of dupilumab showed a 68% reduction in adjusted rates of severe exacerbations. Both the 200mg and 300mg doses of the drug were well tolerated. All patients on the study were also treated with their stable medium-or-high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) combo. </p><p>Regeneron revealed 18 May that the companies have been in discussions with the FDA to use this Phase IIb study as one of the two pivotal trials needed to file a BLA. The partners are initiating a Phase III trial with 1,600 asthma patients that could serve as the second pivotal trial. </p><p>The partners have been developing dupilumab in multiple indications. In November, the FDA has granted the drug breakthrough therapy designation as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. The drug is also being developed for sinusitis with nasal polyposis. The companies are depending on the drug to be their next big blockbuster, with analysts putting annual sales at peaks of $2.5bn. </p><p><p><p>
