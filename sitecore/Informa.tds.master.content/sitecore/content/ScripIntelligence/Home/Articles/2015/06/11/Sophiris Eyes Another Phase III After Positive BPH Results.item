<p>Sophiris Bio Inc. bounced back from a negative interim efficacy report when the company revealed positive results from the Phase III PLUS-1 clinical trial for PRX302 (topsalysin) in the treatment of urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate, on Nov. 10. </p><p>The difference between PRX302 and a vehicle-only control in terms of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 52 weeks was statistically significant with a 7.6-point overall improvement versus a 6.58-point gain in the control group (p=0.043). Sophiris saw its stock soar to $2.90 per share on Nov. 10 &ndash; more than three times higher than its prior day closing price of $0.86 &ndash; after the PLUS-1 trial overcame a negative interim report from its independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and produced results that the company said are sufficient to justify a second Phase III study.</p><p>San Diego-based Sophiris sank from $2.82 per share on Dec. 12 to $0.52 on Dec. 15 after the IDMC's interim review of blinded 12-week results from PLUS-1 showed that a predefined efficacy threshold was not met. The interim analysis was done to inform the company's strategy for subsequent clinical trials, but PLUS-1 continued until its 52-week assessment of IPSS scores for the study's primary endpoint. With the final results in, Sophiris is eyeing another Phase III clinical trial to support US FDA approval.</p><p>"A 7.6-point improvement in IPSS total score over 12 months indicates that patients are experiencing a significant relief of their BPH symptoms and improvement in their quality of life following a single treatment with PRX302," Allison Hulme, chief operating officer and head of research and development at Sophiris, said in a statement from the company. "Oral medications such as alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors typically demonstrate a 3- to 6-point improvement in IPSS total score. We believe that a statistically significant improvement in IPSS, if replicated in a second Phase III trial, may be sufficient for registration with the FDA."</p><p>PLUS-1 enrolled 479 men who received a single intraprostatic injection of PRX302 or vehicle control and were followed for a year to gauge the reduction of BPH-related urinary symptoms. The drug's effects on IPSS scores were largely sustained through week 52 compared with the peak improvement of 8.31 points versus 6.89 points at week 18 (p=0.012). Also, men in the PRX302 group experienced greater gains in urine flow and quality of life than in the control group.</p><p>Sophiris president and CEO Randall Woods said in the company's statement that PRX302 treatment could help patients avoid surgery for BPH. That and the drug's single-dose administration and its safety profile make it a "compelling potential option" for men with the condition. Urinary burning, pain or discomfort; red blood cells in the urine; frequent urination; fever; and perineal pain were the most common side effects and were experienced more often in the PRX302 group.</p><p>Yet despite the surge in Sophiris's stock price based on the final Phase III PLUS-1 results, the company's stock still is trading well below its $5 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cause-and-effect-IPOs-up-MandA-down-in-2013-345919" target="_new">initial public offering</a> price from August 2013 when the formerly Canadian company made its US stock market debut.</p><p>"This is quite a surprising development following the apparently negative disclosure from an interim analysis," Sagient Research noted in a BioMedTracker report about the final PLUS-1 data. "The results are not overwhelming, but could be enough to continue development in either BPH or prostate cancer."</p><p>Sagient increased its likelihood of approval (LOA) rating for PRX302 by 1% to 61% based on the new data, leaving the LOA at 1% below the average for drugs that treatment similar conditions and are in the same stage of development.</p><p>A Phase IIa clinical trial in low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer is ongoing.
