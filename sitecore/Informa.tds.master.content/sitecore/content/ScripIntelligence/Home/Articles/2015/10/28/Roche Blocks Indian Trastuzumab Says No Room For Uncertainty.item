<p> Roche has moved to block Reliance Life Sciences Pvt Ltd's biosimilar version of its anticancer Herceptin (trastuzumab) in India citing &quot;genuine&quot; concern over the comparable safety and efficacy of the Indian firm's product. </p><p> Reliance and another domestic firm, Zydus Cadila, recently received approval for the package inserts of their respective trastuzumab versions from an Indian Subject Expert Committee (SEC) &ndash; which typically suggests that a potential launch may not be too far away. </p><p> Roche told <i>Scrip</i> that it had sought an injunction against the launch of Reliance's &quot;purported&quot; biosimilar of trastuzumab and that the Delhi High Court had &quot;temporarily restrained&quot; the Indian firm's launch plans. </p><p> &quot;We took this action because we are genuinely concerned whether the company's product is as safe and efficacious as our innovator product trastuzumab,&quot; Roche told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p> The Swiss multinational said that it believed this was important because only products that meet the &quot;requirements&quot; for biosimilars can claim to offer a potential benefit and safety profile that is similar to its trastuzumab. </p><p> &quot;There should not be any room for uncertainty when it comes to the treatment of breast cancer.&quot; </p><p> Roche's trastuzumab (currently marketed in India as Herclon) has been shown to help women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer from developing into an advanced, incurable disease. This, the firm, said, is important because when physicians and patients decide to opt for treatment with trastuzumab, this potential benefit is &quot;part of the reason why.&quot; </p><p> &quot;We believe that, as the innovator of trastuzumab, we have a duty to ensure that if a company claims its product is a biosimilar of, or similar to our innovator product, then it is actually as safe and efficacious as the innovator trastuzumab. Patients and physicians need to be confident that they know what they are getting,&quot; Roche underscored. </p><p> It is not immediately clear whether Zydus Cadila's product may face similar action or not. Reliance could not immediately be reached for a specific comment on the safety and efficacy of its product. </p><p> Details on the Clinical Trial Registry of India, though, list Reliance's prospective, multicentre, open-label, two-arm, parallel group, active-control, randomized comparative clinical study for its biosimilar, R-TPR-016 .The study, which evaluates the efficacy safety and pharmacokinetics of R-TPR-016 and Herceptin in patients with metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, covers 105 subjects at eight sites in India. </p><h2> Ongoing Case </h2><p> Significantly, Roche's latest action against Reliance comes at what is ostensibly a critical juncture in its hotly contested case in the Delhi High Court concerning the biosimilar trastuzumab versions of partners Biocon and Mylan. </p><p> The case, which pits Roche on one side against Biocon, Mylan and the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on the other, has seen a string of allegations and counter-allegations, including Biocon's reference to Roche's attempts to act as a &quot;super regulator&quot;. </p><p> Earlier, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Relief-And-Rebuke-For-Biocon-In-Herceptin-Biosimilars-Case-360068" target="_new">the Delhi High Court</a>, though, had some tough words against Biocon on its apparent &quot;conduct&quot; in obtaining regulatory approval of the carton, labels and the package insert. Roche had previously alleged that Biocon's package insert of its biosimilar trastuzumab was a &quot;slavish copy&quot; of its own package insert. </p><p> Arguments in the case are said to have been heard, with the court reserving its judgement last month. </p><p> Biocon's chairperson and managing director, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biocon-Chief-Roche-Should-Wake-Up-And-Smell-The-Coffee-359913" target="_new">Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw</a>, had earlier alleged that Roche was just trying to &quot;fob off&quot; competition. </p><h2> Subject Expert Committee </h2><p> Interestingly, the SEC (oncology and haematology) at its meeting on Oct. 27 approved the package inserts of biosimilar trastuzumabs of both Reliance and Zydus Cadila, subject to a list of &quot;modifications/conditions&quot;. </p><p> In the case of Reliance's &quot;TrastuRel&quot; brand, the SEC said, among other suggestions, that the boxed warning and precaution regarding infusion-related, pulmonary and cardiac toxicity be added and that adverse event in the Phase III clinical study be categorized percentage wise with the number of patients in tabular form along with their references. </p><p> Similar modifications have been recommended for Cadila's &quot;Vivitra&quot; brand. The SEC also suggested that Cadila should revise the package insert along with two other additional indications (HER2 + Early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer) to the office of the DCGI, which may be considered subject to the submission of the application by the firm. </p><p> Reliance and Zydus did not immediately respond to e-mail queries concerning the SEC approval for their package inserts or whether the Roche versus Biocon/Mylan case could, in any way, impact their launch plans. </p><p> India currently follows a three tier review process for clinical trials ahead of commercialization plans, under which applications are initially evaluated by specialized SECs. The recommendations of the SECs are then vetted by a technical review committee and finally cleared by an &quot;apex committee.&quot; </p> <p><p>
