<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 13 March said several Americans may have potentially been exposed to Ebola while serving in Sierra Leone after coming in contact with a US healthcare worker diagnosed with the disease and who has since been transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for treatment.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-deaths-top-10000-NIH-to-treat-infected-American-357273" target="_new">NIH Ebola patient</a> &ndash; the 11th person to be treated in the US for the disease &ndash; was deemed to be in serious condition on 13 March. The infected person is a volunteer with the aid group Partners in Health (PIH), whose founding members include Dr Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank.</p><p>PIH said at least 10 clinicians were identified as coming in contact with the NIH patient before that person left Sierra Leone. The 10 clinicians, who currently are asymptomatic, were being transported back to the US.</p><p>At least four of the 10 who experienced exposures were being placed into quarantine segregated from other patients at the Nebraska Medicine Medical Center&rsquo;s campus in Omaha &ndash; the same facility that successfully treated <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lesson-from-3rd-US-Ebola-survivor-Good-care-works-354146" target="_new">Dr Rick Sacra</a> and <i>NBC News</i> cameraman Ashoka Mukpo. A third patient, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-modern-techniques-too-late-to-save-doctor-355108" target="_new">Dr Martin Salia</a>, who was gravely ill when he arrived at the Nebraska hospital, died in November 2014 less than two days after arriving at the facility.</p><p>CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told <i>Scrip</i> three others will be monitored by the NIH and the other three will be watched by Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia &ndash; the facility where survivors <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Miracle-ZMapp-or-a-strapping-immune-system-353501" target="_new">Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol</a> were successfully treated for the virus. </p><p>Mr Skinner confirmed at least one of those Ebola-exposed clinicians arrived by separate charter flight in Atlanta late on 13 March and was immediately transported to Emory. </p><p>PIH, which has 2,000 employees working in West Africa, including 600 Ebola survivors and 100 ex-pat clinicians, said the NIH patient is the first clinician deployed by the aid group to be diagnosed with Ebola since it began treating patients in Liberia and Sierra Leone in November 2014.</p><p>CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes told <i>Scrip</i> the agency did not currently know whether the Sierra Leone center where the NIH patient became infected with Ebola and the other Americans potentially exposed is a site conducting any clinical studies testing drugs or vaccines against the virus.</p><p>The CDC will conduct a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">study</a> of NewLink&rsquo;s and Merck&rsquo;s experimental Ebola vaccine, known as rVSV, in Sierra Leone, but that trial is not set to start until later this month.</p><p>Another study being conducted by the NIH in Liberia of an investigational vaccine being co-developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline may need to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">relocate</a> because of the drop in Ebola infections in that nation. </p><p>To date, more than 24,500 people have been infected with Ebola during the current outbreak, with about 10,100 dying of the disease.</p><p><i>Note: This article was updated on 14 March with the latest information from the CDC, Nebraska Medicine and PIH on the 10 potentially exposed healthcare workers.</i></p><p><b>Related articles</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">CDC to soon launch NewLink/Merck Ebola vaccine study</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-deaths-top-10000-NIH-to-treat-infected-American-357273" target="_new">Ebola deaths top 10,000; NIH to treat infected American</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">Much-anticipated Ebola vaccine efficacy trial starts</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Millions-spent-on-Ebola-in-US-insurers-resist-paying-355130" target="_new">Millions spent on Ebola in US; insurers resist paying</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-modern-techniques-too-late-to-save-doctor-355108" target="_new">ZMapp, 'modern techniques' too late to save doctor</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Ebola-free-for-now-354978" target="_new">US Ebola-free, for now</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Miracle-ZMapp-or-a-strapping-immune-system-353501" target="_new">Miracle, ZMapp or a strapping immune system?</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
