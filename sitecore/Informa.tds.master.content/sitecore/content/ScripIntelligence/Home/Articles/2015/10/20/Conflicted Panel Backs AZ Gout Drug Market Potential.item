<p>The FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee (AAC) on Oct. 23 in a 10-4 vote recommended approval of lesinurad, an experimental drug from AstraZeneca plc and its US unit Ardea Biosciences Inc., as a treatment in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), such as allopurinol or febuxostat, for hyperuricemia associated with gout in adults.</p><p>But that nod came with much anguish and many caveats, with a majority of the AAC calling for postmarketing studies to be completed.</p><p>"As expected, the discussion at the adcomm surrounded the age-old problem of modest efficacy balanced against an imperfect safety profile," observed Robert Jeng, an analyst with Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>After the FDA released its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-AZArdea-Gout-Drug-Modest-Efficacy-Safety-Concerns-361168" target="_new">briefing documents on Oct. 21</a> ahead of the AAC meeting, <i>BioMedTracker</i> put the chances that lesinurad would gain the FDA's blessing at 97%, which was 10% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Jeng told <i>Scrip</i> the outcome of the panel did not change that likelihood of approval.</p><p><b>Market Potential</b></p><p>According to <i>Citeline</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, there currently are only a handful of drugs to treat hyperuricemia associated with gout, but there are about 30 products in preclinical or clinical development.</p><p>While lesinurad is out front in terms of R&D, it will be used as an add-on therapy to the XOIs.</p><p>There are two XOI's approved in the US as first-line therapies &ndash; allopurinol or febuxostat.</p><p>Other drugs include probenecid, a uricosuric agent that's OK'd as a second-line therapy, and Crealta Pharmaceuticals LLC's Krystexxa (pegloticase), which is a uricase agent used as a third-line therapy. </p><p>But Krystexxa has been held up as the perfect example that FDA approval doesn't always mean success.</p><p>Indeed, the drug turned out to be a market flop, with its developer, Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc., filing for bankruptcy protection in 2013, eventually selling the medicine to Crealta.</p><p>But Ken Saag, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, insisted there remains an unmet need for gout &ndash; a disease that affects 8.3 million Americans.</p><p>He said recent data has shown that hospitalizations for gout may now exceed those for rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>"We know what causes gout, and we can treat it, but we still have a large treatment gap," Saag told the FDA's committee.</p><p>So lesinurad has a chance to make a dent in the marketplace.</p><p><b>Lesinurad's Efficacy</b></p><p>At the Oct. 23 AAC meeting, the panel voted unanimously that, overall, AstraZeneca's and Ardea's data provided substantial evidence that lesinurad plus an XIO provided a clinically meaningful beneficial effect in treating hyperuricemia associated with gout, even though the FDA's drug reviewers said the magnitude of the investigational medicine's urate lowering effect was "modest" in two Phase III studies, 301 and 302, and less robust in another trial, known as 304.</p><p>"The effect is not large, but it does work," said panelist Donald Miller, a professor of pharmacy practice at North Dakota State University in Fargo.</p><p>"I think that the decrease in uric acid, although modest at some times, will end up being clinically relevant in the long run and that's how I view gout," said panelist Seth Berney, chief of rheumatology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. I think eventually, we'll have the data that says were decreased flares."</p><p>"I think this is clinically meaningful and likely to have a benefit over the long run," added panelist Beth Jonas, director of rheumatology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, although she pointed out she would have felt better had the committee been able to examine long-term data.</p><p>Panelist Peter Kaboli, chief of medicine at Iowa City Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, acknowledged that had the vote on efficacy occurred earlier in the day, he likely would have given a "nay" rather than his "yea," based on the information the committee was provided before the Oct. 23 meeting.</p><p>"But I've been educated now as a non-rheumatologist that over time, as a leap of faith, these people will benefit with reduction in flares, reduction of tophi and health-related quality of life will hopefully improve over time," Kaboli said.</p><p>While consumer representative Lisa Gualtieri, an assistant professor at Tufts University School of medicine in Boston, said she believed the lesinurad studies provided evidence the drug worked, she was not willing to say there was "substantial" proof.</p><p>Patient representative Cynthia Chauhan said her vote in favor also came with that same caveat.</p><p>Nonetheless, she said she backed the drug because of the limited alternatives in treating hyperuricemia associated with gout.</p><p><b>Safety Concerns</b></p><p>Most of the AAC members, however, were concerned that even though AstraZeneca and Ardea are not seeking approval of lesinurad as a monotherapy, doctors would ignore the labeling and attempt to use it alone anyway, despite the evidence in the companies' study 303 of higher renal toxicity and a marked rise in the risk of reversible and non-reversible creatinine elevations and serious renal-related adverse events, including acute and chronic renal failure, which appeared to be dose-dependent.</p><p>In AstraZeneca's and Ardea's studies, there were higher rates of deaths, major adverse CV events (MACE) and serious and non-serious adverse renal-related events. </p><p>The dose-dependent higher incidences of serious and serious renal-related adverse events observed with lesinurad 400mg plus XOI correlated with safety findings from the lesinurad 400mg as a monotherapy evaluated separately in study 303. </p><p>There was a consistent overall numeric imbalance against lesinurad in deaths that occurred during the controlled portions of studies 301, 302 and 304. </p><p>MACE events were seen in all study arms, including the placebo plus XOI arm. </p><p>Jeng said he was somewhat surprised there was "almost no discussion" of MACE events at the Oct. 23 meeting, with most panelist acknowledging that the numbers were simply too small to make conclusions. </p><p>"Thus, we expect some postmarketing surveillance or longer-term studies to be required," he said.</p><p>The AAC voted 7-6, with one abstention, the safety profile of lesinurad plus an XOI was adequate to support approval in the gout indication.</p><p>"As long as this goes to small select population, I think it's a valuable addition to the armamentarium," patient panelist Chauhan said, although she said she was "conflicted" when it came to lesinurad's safety &ndash; declaring she had "vacillated" on her vote and actually intended to abstain, but "my finger did a better job than my brain, and I voted no."</p><p>"I thought the decision was difficult," added panelist Alyce Oliver, an associate professor of medicine at Georgia Regents University in Augusta. "I was thinking much like the rest of the committee &ndash; back and forth."</p><p>But with the limited data, particularly on the renal and cardiac events, she said it was "too hard to really understand what's going on."</p><p>"It's going to take postmarket analysis and other reviews" to know for sure, Oliver said.</p><p>"I would like the sponsors to come up with reasonable recommendations for monitoring," Berney said.</p><p>Panelist Mara Becker, an associate professor of pediatrics at Children' Mercy Kansas City in Missouri, said she also was "very conflicted" over lesinurad's safety.</p><p>"I don't think the numbers, per se, are so terrible," she said. "I would just like to have a little bit more specific guidance to providers and maybe limit the exposure to patients who are already compromised from the renal function standpoint."</p><p><i>BioMedTracker's</i> Jeng said he expected lesinurad's labeling would end up being "quite narrow" and restrict use to a smaller population of patients with good renal function. </p><p>"The label might also recommend treatment discontinuation with far less than a doubling of creatinine levels," he added.</p><p>"I think the FDA has heard the panel would like some more specifics in the labeling," said AAC acting chair Tuhina Neogi, associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University School of Medicine. </p><p>But having said that, Neogi admitted she was "impressed" AstraZeneca and Ardea came prepared with a plan to caution doctors about lesinurad's safety concerns and warnings it should not be used as a monotherapy, "which I've not really seen with the rest of my meetings that I've been here."</p><p>"I think that the sponsors have spent time thinking about this and have indicated willingness to work with the FDA to tighten things up and address these concerns," she declared. "That was a positive that helped sway me towards the yes."</p><p>Shares of AstraZeneca got a 1.6% bump on Oct. 23, before closing at $31.36, up 29 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
