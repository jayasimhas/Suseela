<p><b>The Australian company Clinuvel made a splash last year when it gained EU approval for its groundbreaking photoprotective therapy Scenesse (afamelanotide 16mg) &ndash; an orphan drug with a novel mode of action for a relatively unknown disease that was developed with the close involvement of patients who had received the treatment. As the European Medicines Agency prepares to consult on its new "PRIME" (priority medicines) scheme for giving more early support to drug developers, Clinuvel CEO Dr Philippe Wolgen explains what he thinks the agency really needs to do to foster true innovation in the EU. </b></p><p>The first objective at European level needs to be to decide whether we as a society wish to remain competitive and promote innovation, or whether we are prepared to allow companies to move to emerging markets. This is an old topic that needs readdressing. Many young professionals choose to export their talents elsewhere, even if they are trained in Europe.</p><p>If we don't agree on the notion of centering knowledge, a bit like the Singaporean model of prioritizing some key areas of growth, then we may continue to see our advantage slip in an area where we used to excel &ndash; pharmaceutical innovation. </p><p>The EMA may be exploring new pathways &ndash; the PRIME scheme for priority medicines is one &ndash; but the agency seems to be overlooking the broader foundation of successful pharmaceutical development.</p><p>The emphasis should be on deep-rooted knowledge and consistency. Here the EMA needs to bring its knowledge up to a level with those companies that are focusing their resources on specific areas of expertise and which will likely apply for marketing authorisation of a new drug in the next decade.</p><p>The EMA is falling short in the domain of untested (for which read novel) scientific hypotheses, particularly when it comes to innovative breakthrough technologies. I have my own thoughts for how it could really help foster pharmaceutical innovation in Europe.</p><h2>"Scientific Janitors"</h2><p>The EMA should carefully select valuable professionals &ndash; one may call these scientific "janitors" &ndash; early on in a company's development program, who would be endowed with the status of chaperone of an innovation from start to completion. This selected professional &ndash; or an entire team &ndash; needs to be mandated by the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), have the appropriate qualifications, and be sufficiently experienced to provide non-binding early-stage advice and ongoing feedback to companies/sponsors. The proposed "rapporteur" under the PRIME scheme is in my view only a faint attempt to address the issue properly. </p><p>The "janitor's/chaperone's advice" would go much deeper and at some point in the product's development would become binding on both the company and the agency. This janitor would be the one who would perform the scientific diligence and be in contact with clinical and regulatory experts in a specific disease and technology. </p><p>This approach to reforming European drug development would lead to three changes: </p><p>1) It would force the EMS to become "knowledgeable" about &ndash; for instance &ndash; a rare (orphan) disease or unmet medical need early on in the development process. In simpler terms, the agency would be forced to enter deep expert diligence from the start of drug development and align itself with the applicant company. </p><p>2) It would force companies to enter into a dialogue with the EMA about the viability of continuing their programs at any stage. </p><p>3) It would shorten the length of the development pathway, which is unnecessarily long, often taking more than a decade. It should be a pathway of shared responsibility between agency and industry.</p><p>There are a few professionals in the EMA who could push through such a reform. I am skeptical but remain optimistic about their chances of turning the vessel around. They face a formidable challenge, which is one of addressing three fundamental issues so as to reach parity again with the rest of the world.</p><p>I have seen Clinuvel go through a three-and-a-half-year EMA review process. It is obvious what I think of the length of this review, but nevertheless last year Clinuvel became one of the few companies in Europe to be granted marketing authorisation for a truly novel drug. The product came with many novelties and tested the EMA: Scenesse was a novel molecule in a novel formulation, with a novel mode of action through an innovative delivery system and an "unknown" patient population, i.e., a disease not previously encountered by regulators. This almost proved too much for the EMA to manage and analyse. </p><p>For seven years our teams pressed the EMA to involve clinical experts, perform deeper clinical diligence and solicit input from heads of academia and &ndash; most of all &ndash; patients who had experienced the therapy. The patients' experiences ultimately drove Clinuvel's board of directors to continue the development, since we could not ignore what came from the horse's mouth.</p><p>Patients' voices go two ways: should patients, at any point, provide negative feedback on Scenesse, Clinuvel would cease production, as well as any further development for a pediatric therapy. In severe, albeit non-life threatening disorders, the patients' opinions should be weighed as part of modern decision-making. It is that simple. </p><p>The EMA yielded to the repetitive and continuous request to involve trial participants only at the very end of its review process. Now it seems we both &ndash; Clinuvel and the EMA &ndash; have written regulatory history, since the ad hoc expert meeting and the CHMP plenary session on Scenesse marked the first time that clinical trial patients had provided direct assistance and unequivocal evidence of safety and effectiveness of a new drug. </p><p>This third-party evidence, gathered through clinical diligence, could have been obtained by the agency much earlier in the review process and would have saved time and money, but, above all, enabled faster access to a much needed treatment.</p><p>In this industry you need to adhere to two principles when the odds are against you and resistance seems insurmountable: one, listen carefully to patients; and two, listen to those who know best: the expert physicians at the gate.</p>
