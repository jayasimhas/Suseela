<p>The US FDA has approved the first generic version of AstraZeneca's Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product.</p><p>While the approval statement made no reference to Ranbaxy's product, the agency's notice of administrative action dated 26 January filed in the US District Court Columbia concerning litigation over rescinded tentative approvals for Ranbaxy's generic versions of Valcyte (valganciclovir hydrochloride) and Nexium said that the forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity for esomeprazole was because Ranbaxy ''failed to obtain tentative approval of its ANDA within 30 months after the date on which the ANDA was submitted and that failure was not caused by a change in or a review of the requirements for approval''.</p><p>The FDA said that it was withdrawing its argument that Ranbaxy's claims in the matter regarding generic esomeprazole were ''unripe and lack final agency action''. </p><p>Law firm Hyman, Phelps & McNamara's blog noted that the ''failure to obtain timely tentative approval-basis'' for generic Nexium was the same basis FDA used to determine that Ranbaxy forfeited eligibility for 180-day exclusivity for generic Valcyte (valganciclovir hydrochloride), and that led Ranbaxy to sue FDA over the decision and the stripped tentative approvals. Both Dr Reddy's, represented by the law firm, and Endo had intervened in the case. </p><p>However, Ranbaxy appears to cling on to some hope yet. In its motion for expedited ruling on pending motions dated 26 January before the district court, the company said that it was renewing its request for preliminary injunctive relief and urged the court to ''promptly'' issue its disposition in this matter &ndash; ''either granting the company the relief it had requested (which would stem the mounting damages Ranbaxy is incurring from FDA's unlawful action) or denying that relief promptly (so that Ranbaxy can continue pursuing its claims on appeal)''. </p><p>In either case, ''time is of the essence,'' Ranbaxy underscored. </p><p>In a note to the Bombay Stock Exchange on 27 January, Ranbaxy said that it had received a communication from FDA concerning the forfeiture of its 180 day exclusivity for esomeprazole magnesium and was disappointed with the result and was ''pursuing all available legal options to preserve its rights''.</p><p>Ranbaxy has previously said that it would suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in losses that could never be recovered due to the government's sovereign immunity. It also explained that it had no legal remedy against competitors who lawfully enter the market pursuant to an FDA approval.</p><p>Last year, Ranbaxy suffered a setback in its challenge to the FDA's decision to revoke tentative approvals for its ANDAs for generic versions of AstraZeneca's Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) and Roche's Valcyte, after the US court declined to hold back competition for the products <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ranbaxy-loses-early-bid-to-block-generic-competition-355170%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 November 2014)</a>. </p><p>The FDA had in November last year rescinded the tentative approvals for Ranbaxy's generic Nexium and Valcyte saying that these were in error because of the ''compliance status'' of Ranbaxy's facilities referenced in the ANDAs at the time the approvals were granted <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ranbaxys-generic-Nexium-exclusivity-dead-or-alive-354921%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 7 November 2014)</a>. </p><h2>Cipla</h2><p>While the FDA's latest decision didn't really surprise many, it raised the prospects of another Indian firm, Cipla, making significant gains as a supplier to Teva.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that most investors had already factored in the ''high probability'' of the unlikely launch of the first generic Nexium by Ranbaxy in the US when the FDA revoked the tentative approvals for the firm's products last year. </p><p>But what was probably interesting, according to Mr Mehta, was that Cipla, which is said to be a key active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) supplier of the product to Teva, is expected to make strong gains. </p><p>''Even with potential five-player competition for generic Nexium and assuming up to 90% price erosion, Cipla may still rake in earnings in the region of $36m or so during the exclusivity period,'' Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Analysts also referred to how Ranbaxy had seen the writing on the wall for its Nexium generic based on the FDA decision pertaining to it Valcyte generic. Ranbaxy, in previous case documents, noted that the FDA's decision purported to withhold a formal decision on forfeiture [concerning the Nexium generic] because the Agency typically did not announce forfeiture decisions until a subsequent generic applicant is poised for approval.</p><p>''Even so, there is no doubt regarding the impact of FDA's decision: Agencies must treat like cases alike, and FDA's conclusion that Ranbaxy forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for generic Valcyte due to the retroactive of tentative approval for that ANDA controls the analysis as to Ranbaxy&rsquo;s generic Nexium ANDA &ndash; where tentative approval likewise has been rescinded retroactively,'' it then said.</p>
