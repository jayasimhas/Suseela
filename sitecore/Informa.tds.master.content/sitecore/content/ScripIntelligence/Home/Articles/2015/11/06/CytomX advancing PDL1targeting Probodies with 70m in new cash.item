<p>Californian biotech CytomX has raised $70m in a series D financing in order to take its "Probody" therapeutic pipeline into clinical trials. </p><p>CytomX will be focusing on a precision cancer immunotherapy directed against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Probody drug conjugates against novel, first-in-class targets. </p><p>Probodies, CytomX CEO Sean McCarthy explained, are created using "a novel therapeutic antibody platform designed to be active locally in tumor tissue but not normal tissue. The platform has the potential to capture the benefits of empowered antibodies (ADCs, immunotherapies, T-cell therapies) while reducing the toxic side-effects that have limited the field," he said. </p><p>This is how CytomX plans to compete in the highly active immuno-oncology space. "The industry has produced impressive results from clinical trials of combination immunotherapies and antibody-drug conjugates, but in many cases, toxic and sometimes deadly side-effects have clearly been the limiting factor &ndash; restricting the potential to small subsets of patients," he told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>"Probodies have the potential to change the way we think about cancer immunotherapy," he added. "By being active only in tumor tissue, our PD-L1 targeting Probody could bring a distinct profile with its improved safety that would make it a centerpiece for combination immunotherapy approaches," he said.</p><p>CytomX plans to advance its PD-L1 program to an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing in 2016. The company also has "multiple Probody drug conjugate programs moving toward IND-enabling studies". Looking ahead the CEO said, "Our focus [will be on] targets that are inaccessible to conventional ADCs due to expression on healthy tissue. In addition, we will expand our early research into the potential for Probody technology to open additional therapeutic targets for bispecific antibodies and engineered cell therapies."</p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-commits-up-to-1.2bn-in-CytomX-deal-352008" target="_new">May last year</a> the company struck a deal potentially worth up to $1.2bn with Bristol-Myers Squibb in the cancer immunotherapy field, focused on the using CytomX's Probody compounds in combination with BMS's immuno-oncology pipeline, which includes the approved melanoma treatments Yervoy (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab). Mr McCarthy told <i>Scrip</i> that this deal was "progressing well." One target being pursued under the partnership is CytomX's CTLA-4, but the others are undisclosed at this time</p><p>Other big players in the PD-L1/PD-1 space include Merck & Co, which has Keytruda on the market; Roche; AstraZeneca; GlaxoSmithKline; and Celgene, which is partnered with BMS for development of Opdivo in other indications. </p><p>CytomX's series D funding round was led by Fidelity Management & Research Company with participation from Casdin Capital, Cormorant Asset Management, Deerfield Management, Perceptive Advisors, Redmile Group, Tekla Healthcare Investors and Tekla Life Sciences Investors, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, Wellington Management Company and additional undisclosed investors.</p>
