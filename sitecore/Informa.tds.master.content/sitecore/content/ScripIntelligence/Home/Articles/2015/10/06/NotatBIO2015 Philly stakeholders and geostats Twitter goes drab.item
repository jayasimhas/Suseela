<p> What key message about biotechnology is coming out of Philadelphia? Well, hopefully it's nothing to do with what was bothering the Twittersphere yesterday. </p> <p> <i>Scrip</i> looked at a day's worth of #BIO2015 Tweets from the first day of the BIO convention expecting to find some interesting discussion on drug payment, Obamacare, PD1/PDL-1 inhibitors or even some abstruse self-promotion from thought-provoking biotech companies. We thought that assessing the interest in a subject from the number of retweets or &quot;favoriting&quot; would be a good way of assessing what the BIO2015 Twitterati found fascinating. </p> <p> For the sake of the BIO convention, we hope that is not so. </p> <p> <b>At #11</b> with 10 re-tweets and six favorites, and setting a very low bar for the rest of the list, it's @eezzed with the surprising news that the BIO meeting started yesterday: &quot;And so #BIO2015 starts today! Meetings have already begun.&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #10</b> with 10 re-tweets and seven favorites, and managing quite comfortably to limbo under @eezzed's bar, it's @BIOConvention (the organizers) with a host-serving huzzah for Philadelphia: &quot;Today at 3:30: learn how #LifeSciences are growing in #Philly and how you can be a part of it! </p> <p> <b>At #9</b> with 10 re-tweets and seven favorites, it's clean and shaved @WKuketz telling us that he and his team are in the shower before the meeting: &quot;@consultcollab Our Life Science team is getting ready for the conference.&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #8</b> with 10 re-tweets and 10 favorites, it's @RaleighWake with a punt for Raleigh, NC as a place to do business. &quot;Forbes ranked Raleigh as #1 Best Place for Business and Careers. Biz Make the smart move here! <a href="http://bit.ly/1IzVs96" target="_new">http://bit.ly/1IzVs96</a> @raleigh4u&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #7</b> with 12 re-tweets and two favorites, it's a plug from @meetPHL for delegates not to bother to go to the meeting at all (and who could blame them, given this list): &quot;Welcome @BIOConvention attendees! Follow @discoverPHL for free time ideas &amp; start tours @PHLVisitorCntr&quot; </p> <p> In joint seventh place, with 11 re-tweets and five favorites, it's yummy consumable distractions from @PHLVisitorCntr: &quot;@PatsSteaks @GenosSteaks What a delicious way to prep for #BIO2015!&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #6</b> with 13 re-tweets and three favorites, it's actually a Tweet about doing something about disease from @JNJInnovation: &quot;Imagine if we could stop T1 #diabetes before it starts. We've teamed w/ @WUSTLmed researchers to explore <a href="http://bit.ly/1f4KZJg" target="_new">http://bit.ly/1f4KZJg</a>.&quot; </p> <p> Also at sixth place, with 11 re-tweets and seven favorites, it's @AvalonVentures with a plug for a session on business development: &quot;Jay and @GSK's Damien McDevitt will talk collaboration and new company details on today's #buildtobuy panel: <a href="http://bit.ly/1MWrGgk" target="_new">http://bit.ly/1MWrGgk</a>. </p> <p> <b>At #5</b> with 14 re-tweets and 17 Favorites, it's @PHLCommerce with yet another Philly fillip, this time a plug for the entire set of local biotech exhibitors: &quot;More than 70 companies are showcasing in the #PAPavilion. It is clear that Pennsylvania's life sciences industry is thriving!&quot; Yay!! </p> <p> <b>At #4</b> with 14 re-tweets and 14 favorites, it's naughty child and persistent Tweeter @ChristianeTrue (79 Tweets sent on Monday 15 June) reacting to Bill Clinton's call for &quot;disruptors&quot; in biotech: &quot;I was a disruptor in grade school too. All it got me was bad grades in conduct.&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #3</b> with 15 re-tweets and five favorites, it's a retweet from @livecellassays informing the world that a venture capitalist wants to invest in drug discovery stuff: &quot;Domain Associates at #BIO2015 ready to make connections with others to reduce the risk &amp; cost of drug discovery.&quot; </p> <p> <b>At #2</b> with 24 re-tweets and 15 favorites, it's @alexmccann with appreciation for the comestibles from the USA's northern neighbor: &quot;#NovaScotia enjoying #BiotechCanada reception. <a href="https://lnkd.in/ezW5PB7" target="_new">https://lnkd.in/ezW5PB7</a>.&quot; </p> <p> <b>Finally at #1</b>, with 34 re-tweets and 22 favorites, it's @NeilPBardhan showing off his knowledge of Eastern US socio-geography: &quot;40% of the American population lives within a day's train ride or drive from Philadelphia.&quot; </p> <p> You are a very dull lot. Please find something more interesting to tell those of us not at BIO (#notatBIO2015) about tomorrow. </p>
