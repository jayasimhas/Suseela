<p>Syngene International has made a strong debut on Indian bourses listing at INR295 ($4.6) and closing higher, even as the overall market declined in the country. Syngene is the research services arm of Biocon.</p><p>The Syngene stock touched a high of INR318.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Aug.11, before ending at INR310.40.</p><p>The closing price on listing day of INR311 was at premium of 24.22% compared to the issue price which was fixed at INR250 per equity share.</p><p>A company statement said that on the first day of listing of Syngene, shares worth around INR5.68bn were traded on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), with shares worth around INR1.37bn traded on the BSE.</p><p>Biocon's chairperson and managing director, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, said that she was pleased with price spurt at the moment of listing, which meant that there was a "pent-up demand" that translated into a spurt as soon as it listed. </p><p>"It showed that there was a huge waiting list to invest in Syngene. It's also a stock which is very unique, exclusive, rare&#8230; it's not a huge offer. So from that point of view we were able to create a very exciting demand for the Syngene stock," Ms Mazumdar Shaw told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Some investment banking experts had earlier backed Syngene's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Can-Indias-Syngene-best-WuXi-359639" target="_new">premium valuations</a> suggesting that they were "fair" and that the stock should list at a premium. The Syngene IPO had been <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Strong-investor-response-to-Syngene-IPO-359681" target="_new">oversubscribed</a> 31 times, the firm earlier said. </p>
