<p>As part of President Barack Obama's plan of attack against superbugs that are growing increasingly more resistant to even the most powerful antibiotics, he intends to invite biopharmaceutical makers and other private-sector stakeholders to the White House on 2 June for a summit focused on better stewardship of the drugs, Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell revealed on 18 May.</p><p>Full details of the meeting are still being worked out, but Tom Skinner, spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told <i>Scrip</i> the "goal of the forum is to exchange ideas on ways public- and private-sector stakeholders can collaborate to improve responsible antibiotic use and to discuss opportunities for further improvement."</p><p>The summit will involve key human and animal health constituencies involved in the development, promotion and implementation of nationwide activities aimed at improving antibiotic use, Mr Skinner said.</p><p>The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria "tests our ability to fight diseases we once considered easily treatable," Secretary Burwell declared at the annual meeting in Geneva of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body for the World Health Organization (WHO).</p><p>Beyond human health, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) also threatens livestock, agriculture and even the economy, she warned.</p><p>The HHS chief noted that President Obama on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Obama-superbug-attack-plan-hinges-on-funding-cooperation-357553" target="_new">27 March</a> unveiled an aggressive five-year plan to combat the growing scourge of the superbugs, which infect about two million Americans each year, killing 23,000.</p><p>"The United States government departments and agencies, along with key human and animal health stakeholders, are committing to implement changes over the next five years to a create meaningful impact on antibiotic stewardship, slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections," the CDC's Mr Skinner said.</p><p>The five-year plan &ndash; the <i>National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria</i>, which was developed in response to a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">18 September 2014 executive order</a> &ndash; outlines the steps for implementing President Obama's multi-pronged strategy for attacking AMR and addressing the policy <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Staying-ahead-of-tricky-resistant-bugs-PCAST-outlines-path-352852" target="_new">recommendations</a> from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Policy, the details of which were first disclosed at a meeting in July 2014, with the final report issued two months later.</p><p>The US president in March called for federal agencies to work with industry, the healthcare community and other stakeholders to take action to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections; take a "one health" surveillance approach; advance the development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria; accelerate basic and applied research and development for new antibiotics, other therapeutics and vaccines; and improve international collaboration and capacities for prevention, surveillance, control and R&D.</p><p>Mr Obama acknowledged the success of his plan relies on the cooperation of a multitude of stakeholders, including the biopharmaceutical industry, and funding from a Republican-controlled Congress.</p><p>But lawmakers have made no commitments to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">$1.2bn President Obama has requested</a> to implement his strategy.</p><p>President Obama demanded $100m in new funds for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">development of new antibiotic therapies and diagnostics</a>.</p><p>He also called for $100m to back the creation of an AMR clinical trial network aimed at rapidly testing new medicines against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which will be run by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Frank Pasqualone, senior vice president of development and operations at Theravance Biopharma, which markets the injectable antibiotic Vibativ (telavancin), praised the White House's efforts to combat the spread of superbugs, like methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and further research in difficult-to-treat multidrug resistant pathogens.</p><p>It&rsquo;s critical, he told <i>Scrip</i>, key players in the anti-infective community "leverage developments like this important White House summit to drive awareness, momentum and sustainability for all initiatives focused on addressing the significant challenge of antibiotic resistance."</p><p><b>Other world efforts</b></p><p>At the WHA meeting in Geneva on 18 May, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan raised the possibility of a "post-antibiotic era, in which common infections will once again kill."</p><p>She urged the WHA delegates to adopt WHO's global action plan on antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Speaking at the WHA, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that under her chairmanship, she would see to it the G7 &ndash; the seven nations the International Monetary Fund considers to be the major economies of the world: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US &ndash; would focus on fighting AMR.</p><p>The authors of a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Pay-into-2bn-antibiotics-fund-ONeill-tells-big-pharma-358415" target="_new">report issued last week</a> by the Jim O'Neill Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, which was commissioned by UK Prime Minister David Cameron, called for the creation of a $2bn five-year global AMR innovation fund aimed at backing "blue-sky research" into drugs and diagnostics and getting "better ideas off the ground" &ndash; telling big pharma it needed to play a role in coming up with the cash.</p><p>But the charity Antibiotic Research UK insisted the focus should not simply revolve around the pursuit of newer antibiotics, but said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antibiotics-charity-wants-new-regimens-not-just-new-drugs-358414" target="_new">new ideas for keeping current medicines in use</a> also are needed.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
