<p>Japan has granted a reimbursement price to Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) as the first all-oral therapy for the disease in the country, with each pill priced well below US levels but still set to cost the national healthcare insurance system upwards of $500.</p><p>Sovaldi was granted a reimbursement price at a meeting of Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council (Chuikyo) on 20 May and Gilead's local subsidiary said it would be launched in the market on 25 May.</p><p>The once-daily nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor &ndash; the US firm's first self-marketed product in the country &ndash; was granted formal approval by the ministry of health, labor and welfare in March.</p><p>It is indicated for the suppression of viremia in genotype 2 patients with chronic disease with or without compensated cirrhosis, and is used for 12 weeks in combination with Chugai Pharmaceutical's ribavirin product Copegus, which was also approved for use in what will be the first all-oral, interferon-free type 2 regimen for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Japan.</p><p>True to form in other developed markets, the highly effective therapy will come at a high cost, supported by data showing it can effectively "cure" the disease by reducing the virus to undetectable levels. The Phase III Japanese trial used to support the approval showed 96% of patients had a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completing therapy.</p><p>But under Japan's complex reimbursement price calculation methodology, the cost per pill under the country's universal NHI system will be roughly half that in the US, being set at JPY61,799.30 ($510.50) per 400mg tablet. This compares with what Chuikyo said was $1,200 per pill in the US (Sovaldi's US cost is around $1,000 per day on a wholesale acquisition basis), and the reimbursement cost for Sovaldi works out at around JPY5.2m for a full course.</p><p>The standard patient co-payment in Japan is 30% before any state or company assistance schemes, and the NHI system does allow for co-payment reductions for chronically ill patients.</p><p>In its pricing calculations, Chuikyo said it took account of Sovaldi prices in four reference countries (the US, UK, Germany and France) &ndash; which averaged JPY92,402.90 &ndash; along with the cost of the other approved genotype 1 regimen in Japan, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma's Telavic (telaprevir; licensed from Vertex Pharmaceuticals). A system of available pricing premiums for various product characteristics was then applied to come up with the final price.</p><p>Chuikyo is predicting peak sales of JPY98.7bn ($816m) at reimbursement prices for Sovaldi two years after launch, with use in 19,000 patients foreseen at that time. Drugs which substantially exceed such official forecasts in Japan can be subject to one-off price cuts to reduce the costs to the government.</p><p>Gilead set up its own independent subsidiary in the country in 2013 in preparation for the launch of Sovaldi and the anticipated large sales it will bring, and in the launch announcement stresses the simpler treatment model that the drug will bring.</p><p>Sofosbuvir is also awaiting approval in Japan as a single tablet combination with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir for genotype 1 HCV. This would negate the need for concomitant interferon and ribavirin and the therapy (branded Harvoni in other markets) would become the first one-pill regimen for HCV in Japan.</p><h2>competitive landscape</h2><p>Between 1.5 and 2 million people are estimated to be chronically infected with HCV in the country, the large number being a legacy of unsanitary needle practices in postwar inoculation campaigns. 20-30% of those infected are genotype 2 and currently require 24-48 weeks of injected therapy.</p><p><p>HCV is a said to cause around 80% of the cirrhosis-induced liver cancer cases in Japan, from which some 30,000 people die annually.</p><p>In the genotype 2 space, Sovaldi&rsquo;s main competitor will be Telavic, an oral NS3/4A protease inhibitor approved for the indication last September and which is also approved for genotype 1 in Japan. MTP did not disclose any sales figures for the drug in its recent fiscal year results.</p><p>Several other therapies are already approved locally for genotype 1 (which occurs in around 70% of the patient total, mainly 1b), including Janssen Pharmaceutical's Sovriad (simeprevir) in 2013, which was the drug's first clearance worldwide and was for use for 12 weeks with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks.</p><p>Also approved for genotype 1 are Merck & Co's Vanihep (vaniprevir) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's all-oral, interferon- and ribavirin-free two-pill regimen Daklinza (daclatasvir) and Sunvepra (asunaprevir).</p><p>For developing countries, Gilead entered into sofosbuvir supply agreements with seven Indian generic companies last September covering 91 markets, with sublicensing deals set to increase the number of suppliers. </p><p>This article has also been published in PharmAsia News.</p>
