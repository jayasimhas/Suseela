<p>Telesta Therapeutics Inc. appears to be facing an uphill battle when it tries to convince an FDA advisory panel later this week to recommend approval of the company's experimental bladder cancer treatment, known as Mycobacterium phlei cell wall-nucleic acid complex (MCNA), a novel, microbiologically-derived, antineoplastic agent with immune-stimulant and direct anti-cancer activity. </p><p>First off, the FDA drug reviewers pointed out that Telesta's single-arm trial, known as study 301, on which the company's biologics license application (BLA) for MCNA was based, failed to achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating one-year disease-free survival (DFS) in treating patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) at high risk of recurrence or progression who failed prior <i>Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin</i> (BCG) immunotherapy.</p><p>In briefing documents released ahead of the Nov. 18 joint meeting of the FDA's Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (CTGTAC) and Oncologic Drugs (ODAC) Advisory Committees, the agency's scientists also had raised some issues with the study population in the open-label, multicenter 301 trial and Telesta's indication statement.</p><p>In addition, while MCNA allowed one out of four patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC to avoid bladder removal for up to three years, regulators said they were concerned that delaying such a procedure could actually lead to an increased risk of developing metastatic bladder cancer.</p><p><b>Limited treatment options</b></p><p>But in light of the limited treatment options for patients with BCG-refractory NMIBC, the FDA reviewers said they considered the 301 trial results, especially those in the subpopulation of patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS)-containing disease, "worth consideration" at an advisory committee meeting. </p><p>Telesta, which had changed its name last year from Bioniche Life Sciences Inc., is seeking approval in the US of MCNA for intravesical use in treating NMIBC at high risk of recurrence or progression in adults who failed prior BCG immunotherapy.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip,</i> put the chances of MCNA winning the FDA's blessing at 82%, which was the same as the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision by Feb. 27 on the BLA, which was submitted in June and accepted by the agency in August.</p><p>Montreal, Quebec-based Telesta, which is partnered with French drug maker Ipsen Inc. on MCNA in certain countries outside the US &ndash; a deal the companies inked in October &ndash; noted that bladder cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the urinary tract, with NMIBC accounting for about 75% of those cases, about half of which are high-grade disease. </p><p>While a top treatment priority is to prevent high-grade NMIBC from becoming muscle-invasive or metastatic disease, which has a poor survival prognosis, the treatment paradigm for that type of bladder cancer has essentially been unchanged since 1998, Telesta pointed out. </p><p><b>Complex Surgery</b></p><p>For BCG failures, current treatment guidelines recommend radical bladder removal, or cystectomy &ndash; a complex surgery that requires six to eight hours under anesthesia, up to 10 days in the hospital and six to eight weeks of recovery. </p><p>Cystectomy is associated with at least 28% to 45% surgical complications and 2% to 3% mortality, with up to 8% mortality within six months of surgery in the elderly population, Telesta said. </p><p>"The life-altering surgery also negatively impacts multiple aspects of quality of life, with consequences including urinary incontinence, ostomy, loss of sexual function, low self-esteem and reduced social interaction," the company said in separate documents posted on the FDA's website on Nov. 16. </p><p>Patients who refuse or don't qualify for cystectomy face an increased risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease, likely leading to metastases and death, Telesta said.</p><p><b>Data Good Enough?</b></p><p>The company insisted that MCNA offers a new treatment option for NMIBC patients.</p><p>But regulators said Telesta's data missed its mark.</p><p>The FDA said its assessment of the DFS at one year was 20.9% for the intent-to-treat population, 18.8% for patients with CIS-containing diseases and 27.8% for those with papillary-only disease.</p><p>They said the FDA-assessed DFS at one year was 17.8% for BCG-refractory patients and 36.4% for those who were BCG-relapsing. </p><p>Regulators noted the primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate that a one-year DFS was not lower than 40% based on Kaplan-Meier estimate. </p><p>But, they said, Telesta's 301 trial failed to achieve that goal.</p><p>The FDA scientists said they had concerns about the "inherent limitations of the single-arm trial design without a concurrent control," and the reliability of the DFS assessments. </p><p>In addition, they said the inability to estimate the effect size of the primary endpoint of DFS at one year also was of concern.</p><p>"These concerns make it very difficult to interpret the efficacy results of study 301 and the claimed effectiveness of MCNA," the FDA drug reviewers said. </p><p>But they also noted that in the subpopulation of 93 patients with baseline CIS-containing disease, MCNA treatment appeared to result in a durable CR in some patients &ndash; 27% at six months, with a median duration of 15.1 months. </p><p>And, they said, the adverse events associated with MCNA treatment were consistent with those observed in the use of other therapeutic intravesical agents.</p><p>While it appears patients with CIS-containing disease refractory to BCG therapy might represent a population that could benefit from MCNA therapy &ndash; with some not needing immediate cystectomy &ndash; regulators said frequent follow-up and vigilant surveillance would be needed to mitigate the concern that delaying bladder removal may increase the risk of the developing invasive disease or metastatic bladder cancer. </p><p>"In the event that the CIS-containing disease persists after initial MCNA treatment, patients could be referred to have immediate cystectomy," they said.</p><p>After a series of discussion questions, the FDA is expected to ask its CTGTAC and ODAC at the Nov. 18 meeting to vote on whether MCNA had demonstrated an overall favorable benefit-risk profile in treating NMIBC at high risk of recurrence or progression in adults who failed BCG immunotherapy.</p><p>Shares of Telesta closed at 61 cents on Nov. 16, up 2 cents, or 3.7%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
