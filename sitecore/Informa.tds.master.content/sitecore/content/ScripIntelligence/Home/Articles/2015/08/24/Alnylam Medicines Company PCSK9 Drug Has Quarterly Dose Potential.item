<p>Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company are headed into Phase II with a drug targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) that may be able to provide quarterly or twice-yearly dosing with LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy that's similar to recently approved twice-monthly PCSK9 inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals with its partner Sanofi.</p><p>Alnylam and The Medicines Company presented Phase I single-dose and multiple-dose data for ALN-PCSsc at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2015 on Aug. 30 in London. ALN-PCS uses Alnylam's RNA interference (RNAi) technology to stop the production of PCSK9 rather than block the enzyme's activity. Single 300mg subcutaneous injections of ALN-PCS &ndash; the preferred dose for future clinical trials &ndash; reduced LDL cholesterol by up to 69% with a median reduction of 44% at 140 days.</p><p>"This is at least comparable to the monoclonal antibodies, if not slightly better. The remarkable durability that we're seeing could lead to a once-a-quarter or potentially twice-yearly subcutaneous injection," Alnylam president and chief operating officer Barry Greene told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He later added, "It could be like a flu shot, but for LDL, given twice a year."</p><p>The US FDA approved Amgen's PCSK9-inhibiting monoclonal antibody <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-OKd-Payers-Eye-PCSK9-RebateDiscount-War-360147" target="_new">Repatha (evolocumab)</a> on Aug. 27, about a month after the agency approved a similar antibody drug, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Praluent (alirocumab)</a> from Regeneron and Sanofi. Both therapies are administered every two weeks, but Amgen also won approval for a once-monthly dose.</p><p>Given the trail blazed by Repatha and Praluent for therapies that target PCSK9, Greene said The Medicines Company's Phase II and III clinical trial programs for ALN-PCS probably will not have to be as extensive as the mid- and late-stage programs run by Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.</p><p>"I think the target has been significantly de-risked and we can be a lot smarter about the size and shape of studies and seek approval much more expeditiously," he said.</p><p>Now that Alnylam has completed Phase I testing for ALN-PCS, development will transition to The Medicines Company, which plans to take the RNAi drug into Phase II before the end of 2015. The Medicines Company paid Alnylam <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alnylam-and-The-Medicines-Co-run-PCSK9-race-together-through-205m-alliance-339696" target="_new">$25m up front in 2013</a> to co-develop a PCSK9-targeting drug. Alnylam may earn up to $180m in development and commercial milestone fees plus double-digit royalties under the agreement.</p><p>"We have a genetically valid target that's synthesized in hepatocytes in the liver and technology that stops those proteins from being produced in the first place &ndash; we shut off the spigot instead of mopping up the floor &ndash; and we're targeting it where it is made in the liver. I'm highly confident based on what we're seeing that we're going to have a successful Phase II," Greene said.</p><p>The Medicines Company expects to begin a Phase III program known as ORION for ALN-PCS in late 2017 with results available in time for marketing application submissions in the US and EU by 2018 and approvals in 2019. Registrational clinical trials will include studies that compare ALN-PCS against the approved PCSK9-inhibiting antibody therapies.</p><p><b>Phase I Results</b></p><p>Alnylam's Phase I clinical trial enrolled 69 healthy volunteers, including 24 people in the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the trial and 45 people in the multiple dose (MD) portion of the study. LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) declined by up to 78% in the SAD population and by as much as 83% in the MD group.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Group</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Maximum LDL-C lowering</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Mean LDL-C lowering at day 140</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><i>SAD Population</i></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Placebo (n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>25%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>25mg (n=3)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>44%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>15%</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>100mg (n=3)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>60%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>39% <u>+</u> 1 (p<></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>300mg (n=3)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>67%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>44% <u>+</u> 1 (p<></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>500mg (n=3)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>78%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>39% <u>+</u> 20</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>800mg (n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>69%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Ongoing</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><i>MD Population</i></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Placebo (n=11)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>43%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>125mg weekly for four weeks (n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>60%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>250mg every two weeks (two doses, n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>70%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>300mg every four weeks (two doses, n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>79%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>300mg every four weeks plus daily statin (two doses, n=3)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>69%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>500mg every four weeks (two doses, n=6)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>69%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>500mg every four weeks plus daily statin (two doses, n=5)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>83%</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><p>"We're very happy with the LDL-lowering we're seeing, we're satisfied with the safety profile and we're elated with the durability," Greene said.</p><p><b>Safety Adds Value</b></p><p>There were no serious adverse events or drug-related discontinuations from the Phase I trial. All adverse events were described as mild or moderate. The most common adverse events in the SAD portion of the study were cough, musculoskeletal pain, nasopharyngitis and rash with two volunteers at various ALN-PCS doses experiencing each of the side effects. </p><p>In the MD portion of the Phase I trial, eight people reported headaches, including two in the placebo group; six experienced back pain, including two placebo-treated individuals; seven people had diarrhea, including three who received a placebo; and four people reported feeling nauseous.</p><p>Greene said a cholesterol-lowering drug that is efficacious and generally safe &ndash; and with less frequent dosing that has the potential to improve adherence to medication doses &ndash; will align the interests of patients, physicians and payers, because of the extreme cardiovascular risk associated with high LDL-C.</p><p>"When drugs are highly efficacious with high adherence, it adds value to the HC system, because patients are meant to take their drugs to avoid downstream challenges," he said when asked if quarterly or twice-yearly dosing of ALN-PCS gives the drug an opportunity to compete with twice-monthly Repatha and Praluent, which will cost more than $14,000 per year before any payer discounts.</p><p>Greene declined to address the pricing issue head on, noting that "it's too early to talk about pricing, given that we'll be entering Phase II this year. We can think about a value-based approach to the health care system, because we're aligning the interests of payers, patients and physicians."</p><p>The Phase I study is ongoing, so Alnylam and The Medicines Company plan to report more results in the future that show additional durability of response in terms of PCSK9 knockdown and LDL-C reductions as well as responses according to various secondary biomarkers. </p><p><p><i>This article originally said Amgen's Repatha was approved on Aug. 28 instead of Aug. 27. The article also previously noted that the company was working on a once-monthly dose, but the FDA approved both a twice-monthly and a once-monthly dose. </i>Scrip<i> has corrected the story and regrets the errors.</i></p><p><p><p><p><p>
