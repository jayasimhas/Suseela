<p><p>Failures and setbacks in Alzheimer's disease drug development are far from unusual; most drugs for the disease never make it through late stages. Another AD drug hit a road block this week when the FDA instituted a clinical hold. Potentially illustrating why AD is best left to big pharma's deep pockets to tackle. </p><p>Forum Pharmaceuticals Inc., formerly EnVivo, announced Sept. 15 that its Phase III AD drug encenicline has been put on hold by the US regulatory agency due to a number of reported adverse events. Forum would only reveal that there was "a small number of serious gastrointestinal events reported in the AD studies" that prompted the clinical hold. </p><p>The clinical hold will also impact a long term study of encenicline for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (CIS) that is currently in Phase II. </p><p>Forum has discontinued all medication in the studies and will not recruit any new patients. Mitsubishi Tanabe, which has a license to the drug in Asian territories, has also put its studies on hold. </p><p>Two late-stage studies of encenicline in CIS that are already fully-enrolled will continue, but patients will be monitored carefully for GI effects. Results from those studies will be available in early 2016. </p><p>Fidelity Biosciences-backed Forum initiated the Phase III clinical trial in AD patients in January 2014 and has been funding the late-stage encenicline program as a private company. The drug has shown positive effects on cognition at the 2mg dose during mid-stage trials, but did not have statically significant effects at other dose levels. </p><p>A clinical hold by the FDA doesn't mean that the drug is completely finished. While most drugs never return to development after a hold is put in place due to safety reasons, there have been examples of companies working with the agency to bring their drugs back &ndash; usually for limited patient populations or with some way to sort patients to prevent further complications. </p><p><b>Too Risky?</b></p><p>AD is a particularly risky field that has thwarted even the largest of the drugmakers. Some of the most colossal failures have occurred in later stages and been hosted by big pharma. </p><p>AD &ndash; being a disease that affects a large aging population &ndash; requires clinical trials that are much larger than those needed for most other therapeutic areas. Beyond that, the trials have to be long-term, making them extremely costly. </p><p>If the cost weren't enough to keep a small biotech from trying to take on this elusive white whale, AD trials often have endpoints that are self-reported by patients or based on observations from clinicians -- and are therefore subject to quite a bit of interpretation. </p><p>Adding further to the list of risks &ndash; scientists are still uncertain about the origins of the devastating neurological condition. While there are several theories based on the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain, none of these theories have won out as a definitive cause of AD. </p><p><p>
