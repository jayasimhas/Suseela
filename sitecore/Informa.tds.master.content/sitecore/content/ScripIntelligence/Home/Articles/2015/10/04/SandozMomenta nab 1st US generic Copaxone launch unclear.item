<p>The FDA on 16 April granted Novartis unit Sandoz and its partner Momenta Pharmaceuticals approval to market the first generic version of Teva's big moneymaker Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), which is approved in the US to treat multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Shares of Momenta leaped 27% on 16 April, before closing at $17.08, up 98 cents, or 6%.</p><p>Novartis' shares also got a slight boost, rising 53 cents, before closing at $103.31, up 9 cents.</p><p>Teva's shares, however, dropped 4.6%, before closing at $63.49, down $2.48, or 3.7%</p><p>The generic drug will be marketed by Sandoz in the US as Glatopa and was approved at the 20mg once-daily dosage.</p><p>Glatopa's labeling makes it clear the 20mg/mL is not interchangeable with the 40mg/mL dose of brand-name Copaxone.</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat pointed out that Teva has switched over 67% of Copaxone volume to the 40mg formulation, which has patent protection until 2030.</p><p>Sandoz and Momenta have not disclosed the pricing for Glatopa.</p><p>Mr Raffat noted that Copaxone 40mg is at about an 18% discount to the 20mg, so "presumably, [the] generic will have to be at a further discount to Copaxone 40mg."</p><p>Teva reported it brought in $3.1bn in sales from Copaxone in 2014.</p><p>"The price of once daily Copaxone has increased by more than 165% in the last six years and it's among the most expensive MS products on the market," Craig Wheeler, president and CEO of Momenta, declared during a 16 April conference call with investors and analysts. </p><p>He noted that the average cost of currently marketed MS drugs is about $65,000 per year. </p><p>"The launch of this generic has the potential to change treatment paradigms across the MS landscape," Mr Wheeler said.</p><p><b>At-risk launch?</b></p><p>It's unclear, however, how quickly Glatopa will enter the US market, given the fierce battle ongoing in the courts, in which Teva &ndash; the generic king &ndash; has been trying to put a stop to other companies selling copycat versions of Copaxone, which accounts for about half of the Israeli company's profits. </p><p>The US Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-favors-Teva-implications-go-beyond-Copaxone-356270" target="_new">January sided with Teva</a> in its lawsuit against the generics, but that ruling was looking at the standard the appeals court used when it invalidated the last remaining patent on Copaxone, not on the validity of the patent itself, which actually expires in September.</p><p>The Supreme Court, which ruled 7-2 in Teva's favor, remanded the case back to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p><p>Both sides have recently filed briefs in the case, which stems back to 2008.</p><p>"While it's possible the appeals court could schedule a hearing, it's also possible that they could issue a decision at any time without holding a hearing and then in a more condensed timeframe than previously expected," Mr Wheeler said on the investor and analyst call. "We believe the appellate court's action in validating the patent was correct, and we have a strong chance of ultimately prevailing in the case. We have informed the court of the FDA approval and requested an expedited decision with an opinion to follow, that facilitate competitive access to a generic version of Copaxone based on our belief."</p><p>Sandoz declined to disclose whether it plans an "at-risk" launch of Glatopa. </p><p>"Given that litigation remains ongoing, we cannot comment further," Sandoz told Scrip in a statement. "For competitive reasons, as well, we would not comment further on launch strategy or timing."</p><p>Momenta's Mr Wheeler said the launch decision "will be based on competitive analysis and competitive strategies."</p><p>"If it is in our commercial interest to announce before we launch, we will and if it's not in our interest we won't," he said, adding that's "really going to be based on Sandoz's judgment of what's the best way to proceed commercially, given the competitive situation we're in."</p><p>Mr Wheeler said his firm is ready with supply of Glatopa whenever Sandoz decides to launch, although he said Momenta is still dealing with making sure it has the ability to actually ramp up supply.</p><p>As for Sandoz, it is "100% ready for launch," Mr Wheeler said.</p><p>"Sandoz has all resources at its disposal, including the Novartis sales force, if needed," he said.</p><p><b>Petition denied</b></p><p>Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, defended the agency&rsquo;s approval of Glatopa &ndash; insisting healthcare professionals and patients "can be assured" US-approved generics "have met the same rigorous standards of quality as the brand-name drug."</p><p>"Before approving this generic product, given its complexity, we reviewed additional information to make sure that the generic product is as safe and effective as the brand name product," Dr Woodcock said.</p><p>The FDA said its scientists established a "thorough scientific approach for demonstrating active ingredient sameness that takes into consideration the complexity of glatiramer acetate."</p><p>In approving Glatopa, the FDA also denied Teva's 1 April citizen petition in which it pleaded with the agency not to grant any abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to permit Copaxone generics to enter the US market. </p><p>It was Teva's eighth petition to the FDA.</p><p>In her response, Dr Woodcock told Teva that Sandoz and Momenta had succeeded in meeting the agency's criteria for demonstrating "sameness" of the glatiramer acetate active ingredient.</p><p>"We recognize and have carefully considered the complexity of Copaxone," Dr Woodcock said. "This complexity alone does not preclude a finding of active ingredient sameness between a generic glatiramer acetate injection and Copaxone. Based on our evaluation of all of the relevant data and other current relevant scientific information, our experience and expertise, agency precedent and applicable law, we find that glatiramer acetate has been adequately characterized for the purposes of approving a generic product; and we conclude that an ANDA applicant for glatiramer acetate injection can demonstrate active ingredient sameness" to the referenced Copaxone product.</p><p><b>Other generics</b></p><p>It's unclear how far ahead Sandoz and Momenta are of other generic firms, like Mylan and Natco, that are pursuing copycats of Copaxone and when the FDA may grant other approvals.</p><p>"I don't think my crystal ball is any better than yours," Momenta's chief financial officer, Rick Shea, told analysts and investors on the call. "I don't think we necessarily would have insight into that, so the longer the better."</p><p>Momenta officials said they believe the company was the first to file an ANDA for generic Copaxone with the FDA, but they don't know if they are the only first to filers.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
