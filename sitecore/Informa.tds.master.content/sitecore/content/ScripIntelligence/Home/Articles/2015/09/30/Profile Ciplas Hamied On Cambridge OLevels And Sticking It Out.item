<p> Cipla's journey over the years is steeped in history. Chairman Yusuf Hamied recalls growing up in the midst of leaders of India's freedom struggle, including Sarojini Naidu who became president of the Indian National Congress, Zakir Husain (who became the President of India), BG Kher (chief minister of Bombay) and Sardar Patel (India's first home minister and deputy prime minister), among others. <br> <br> Hamied's father and Cipla's founder, K A Hamied, supported Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Co-operation Movement against British rule. When Gandhi visited Cipla in 1939 he was said to have urged the company to supply medicines for the Indo-British war effort. <br> <br> Yusuf Hamied's mother was Jewish and his grandparents were killed in the Holocaust.<br> <br> In a candid interaction with <i>Scrip</i>'s Anju Ghangurde in Mumbai as part of our ongoing executive profile series, Hamied recounts the influence of the late Lord (Alexander) Todd, Nobel Laureate and master of Christ's College, Cambridge, on his life; how he nearly packed up and left India between the 60s and the early 70s; and his views on religion. </p> <p> <img title="Yusuf Hamied, chairman of Cipla" src="-/media/FCF592D7FE874D53A9C69D4C35314618.ashx"> <br> <i>Yusuf Hamied, chairman of Cipla</i> </p> <p> <b>Anju Ghangurde: You arrived as an infant at the Gateway of India in Mumbai, which your father, in his autobiography, refers to as an auspicious place and one reserved for the landing of kings and princes. Has that probably played out, in some ways, in your life?</b><br> <br> <b>Yusuf Hamied:</b> No, I would put it slightly differently. <br> <br> The origin of all that was&#8230;my mother was Lithuanian, my father Indian. My father went to study in Germany in 1925; my mother was also studying there. <br> <br> But the story goes back. In 1920, Gandhi had given a call for students to boycott universities in India run by the British [government]. Then my father left Allahabad University, Zakir Husain left Aligarh University. They met in Sabarmati Ashram and became bosom pals.<br> <br> On Gandhi's request, Zakir and my father were sent to Delhi and joined the Jamia Millia Islamia [National Muslim University]. In 1924, my father insisted that Zakir go abroad to study and he went to Germany and in 1925, my father followed. There he met my mother.<br> <br> They got married in 1928 in a mosque in Berlin and there was also a civil marriage in London, before they came to India. <br> <br> My sister was born in 1934. Cipla started in 1935&#8230;it was a struggle. I was born in 1936. When I was due, my mother said she'd like to have her baby at home and the family went in 1936 to Vilnius, Lithuania. <br> <br> I think what really shaped us was the variety of people that we met as kids. In those days there was no TV, hardly any radio&#8230; so people used to meet more often. One thing that my parents allowed the children to do was mix with their friends. So we grew up meeting all my father's friends. In my growing up years, I met Zakir Husain, Sarojini Naidu, Sardar Patel, Morarji Desai, BG Kher. My father was a member of the legislative council. It is really something&#8230;the way we grew up.<br> <br> <b>AG: What about the years at Cambridge? </b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> First it was Cathedral School in Bombay (now Mumbai). I was generally among the top students, particularly in science subjects. <br> <br> In 1952, my father was made Sheriff of Bombay. The sheriff was required to receive foreign dignitaries. In 1953, I got my results of senior Cambridge O Level and the results were fairly good. One of the dignitaries who came to India during that time was Lord Todd [then the master of Christ's College, Cambridge] and my father as Sheriff had to go and meet him. One thing that my father did was to keep his children with him whenever he met people. I was 17 and father told me to carry my results. My father happened to ask Lord Todd what the minimum qualification was for a student to study at Cambridge and he said: &quot;We have no such rules; we admit anyone we consider suitable to be a student of our well-known university.&quot; I never did A levels and got admitted to Christ's College, Cambridge, only on my O level results. Today, I would, perhaps, never have got admission. At that time it was a different era. I joined Cambridge at the age of 18 in October 1954. <br> <br> Others in my class had done A levels and were two years ahead of me. What saved me was that in those days after you finished A levels at the age of 18, military service was compulsory. So all the students in class with me had done two years of military service and were 20. When the lectures started, the teachers had to review things because those students had not really studied for two years. And that's what saved me. Otherwise, I'd have been very backward! I had to work for the first two years for virtually 10-15 hours a day to catch up.<br> <br> I finished my PhD at the age of 24. When I finished my PhD, I was offered a fellowship at Christ's College but I turned it down. Because, in my heart of hearts, I knew that there were many chemists in the laboratory who were much cleverer than me. <br> <br> <b>AG: You have been living largely in the UK and have watched and steered your company's growth in India&#8230; two quite different worlds. What was the journey like and the key challenges?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> I came back in 1960 but I still kept in touch with Cambridge and science in particular and we've seen Cipla grow. When I first came here Cipla's turnover was INR4,800,000 [now $73,271] the entire factory was this building where we are now seated. <br> <br> We went through a rough period from the 60s to the early 70s. How often during that period I very nearly packed up and left India. The pharma industry was dominated by multinationals and we formed the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association. Even at that time we were always fighting monopoly. But I still feel the entire Indian bureaucracy was, at that time, sold out to foreign firms.<br> <br> Yet some of us stuck it out. What you see today is certainly an outcome of the past. I don't think people really even today appreciate that&#8230;.the struggles we had in those days with some foreign firms. Those are legendary stories.<br> <br> When India's patent laws changed [India's Patents Act 1970 abolished product patents for pharmaceuticals, food and chemicals and allowed only process patents in these fields], we were one of the few companies already in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). We got our first US FDA approval in 1984. And I shared that knowledge with industry. It was a different era of co-operation.<br> <br> In the 60s and 70s, made in India was generally a bad name, at least in pharma. Nobody would meet us, show us their factories, buy from India. During that period, slowly I tried to put India on the map. I used to promote India. I always believed, then and today, that if India improves, Cipla will improve. If I'm fighting patents or saying compulsory licence, I'm not fighting for Cipla. I don't have any ulterior personal motive.<br> <br> In the late 80s, we were doing APIs, exports started booming. Around the time of us getting US FDA approval, we then thought that we should look at the global picture and not just India. By that time you had the jet flights going and you could get to England in eight-nine hours. <br> <br> Today the world has shrunk and you can't restrict yourself to only being an Indian player. You have to think globally. We started thinking globally in the mid-80s. We thought someone in the family should globalize and my wife and I decided we could divide our time between India and the UK. We got the right of abode in the UK, which took lot of effort. <br> <br> <b>AG: Who was your biggest influence, and why?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> The three people who influenced me the most were my father, Lord Todd and the senior tutor of Christ's College, Dr Pratt, who admitted me on the recommendation of Todd.<br> <br> <b>AG: What's the one corporate action you regret you made or didn't make?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> When I came back to India, the population in Bombay was around two million and yet I saw the writing on the wall&#8230; that India's biggest problem was going to be family planning. And that something had to be done about it. <br> <br> In the following years, among other things, Cipla took up the manufacture of hormones. We set up a factory in Bangalore to produce essentially hormones for family planning. In 1973, I personally went to the government and said that we can offer you the pill at cost price of INR2 per month. At that time the price of the pill in America was around $6 a month. I told the government that we didn't have the muscle to market and distribute the product and that I was willing to put the Bangalore factory totally at the disposal of the government. But they turned us down. In retrospect, that was perhaps the biggest failure in my career&#8230; that we were not adequate enough to fight the problem of family planning. And today, I still believe it is India's biggest problem.<br> <br> <b>AG: What is the best advice you've ever had?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> I think the best advice was indirectly given to me by my father. He was a Muslim, my mother was Jewish&#8230;I went to an Anglo-Scottish Christian school. All my friends in class and my closest friends are all Hindus. We grew up in a total secular environment &#8230; the 50s, the 60s in India. Even today, when I'm asked my religion, I write &quot;Indian.&quot; My contention is that we are all the same stock. When I was young, my father told me that when my mother first met him in 1925, she said: &quot;You are a Hindu.&quot; And he said: &quot;Yes.&quot; Because in 1925, the word &quot;India&quot; did not exist, we were Hindustan, and every citizen of Hindustan was a Hindu. Now, let us again change our name to Hindustan and we are all Hindus. What difference does it make? <br> <br> <b>AG: Who do you admire in the industry, and why?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> I don't like the word admire&#8230; but prefer the word achievers. I would say what Sun Pharma has done under the Indian circumstances and become global has been unparalleled. In the second range, in no particular order, the achievers would be Dr Reddy's, Wockhardt, Lupin, Cadila and Glenmark. Special achievers have been the Hyderabad [based] companies like Aurobindo, Hetero and others that are coming up...Divis, Shasun. Hats off to the Indian enterprise.<br> <br> <b>AG: How do you get step back and get perspective? </b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> As long I feel I can contribute scientifically or business-wise, I will stay here. If I can't contribute, I'll step down. But again there has to be a team effort. In this team effort the people in your team must think as if the company belongs to them. There has to be a sense of belonging. <br> <br> <b>AG: If you weren't a pharma executive, what would you be?</b><br> <br> <b>YH: </b>If not here, probably I would have been an academic or a R&amp;D chemist in some lab somewhere in the world. But I may not have been here in India.<br> <br> <b>AG: We are seeing non-traditional players like Apple, Google, and Samsung making inroads into the healthcare space. What kind of industry do you envisage say a decade down the line?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> The traditional industry will continue. Let us look at the world either from a literacy or poverty point of view. I can't see, in the Third World or the developing world, major changes, at least not in the next decade. I can see major changes for people who can afford in the developed world. You will get all your health data on your phone. There will be a greater load on diagnostics. <br> <br> <b>AG: One myth about industry that you'd like to set straight?</b><br> <br> <b>YH:</b> The Indian industry is being crucified internationally. This myth that Indian products are substandard, where does it come from? <br> <br> For example, today, we are making certain anticancers&#8230;you mean to say the foreign firms have not picked up our products in the market and analysed them? And if our products were not equivalent to theirs, would they keep quiet? <br> <br> And, the gesture shown by one or two companies to license their products to India and the Third World, like Gilead, ViiV Healthcare have done, should be more widespread for the good of the world. </p>
