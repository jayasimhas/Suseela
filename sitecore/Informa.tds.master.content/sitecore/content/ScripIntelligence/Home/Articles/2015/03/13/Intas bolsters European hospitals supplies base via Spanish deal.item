<p>Intas Pharmaceuticals of India has snapped up the hospitals business of Spain's Combino Pharm, bolstering its presence in the hospitals supplies segment in Europe.</p><p>The deal will see the combine emerge as the second largest hospital generics player in Spain, expanding Intas' existing operations in Spain and Portugal with a "broader and more robust portfolio" of products. Financial details were not immediately available.</p><p>The deal covers Combino's hospitals business in Spain and Portugal and is being routed through Intas's subsidiary Accord Healthcare. </p><p>A statement from Intas quoted the firm's vice chair and managing director, Binish Chudgar, as saying that Accord will now get certain rights to Combino's Hospital portfolio in a number of European and non-European countries.</p><p>Senior Intas officials told <i>Scrip</i> that the company would now have access to a clutch of Combino's market authorizations - probably well over 20 - though the deal does not include the Spanish firm's manufacturing site. Combino's hospital logistics services do not appear to be of much interest to Intas, either.</p><p>"It's complementary, given Intas's strength in areas such oncology and their strength in areas like anti-infectives, critical care and pain management," the official said. </p><p>Combino's product range includes teicoplanin and meropenem, details on the firm's website suggested.</p><p>Intas, some reports in the local media suggested, expects to more than double revenues in Spain via the deal. The unlisted Indian firm's revenues from Europe are in the region of $200m, these reports added. </p><p>Intas, which has been considering going public in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indias-Intas-revives-plans-to-go-public-344150%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 June 2013)</a>, had last year seen Singapore government's investment arm Temasek pick 10.16% in the company. Temasek's entry facilitated the part exit of ChrysCapital, an India-focused investment firm. ChrysCapital, which had invested in Intas twice - through Fund 3 in 2006 and Fund 5 in 2012 - held around 17% in Intas.</p><p>Ranked 12th on the Indian market, Intas is among the leading players in the chronic therapy segment. The firm is present in more than 70 countries, with about 55% of sales coming from its international business.</p>
