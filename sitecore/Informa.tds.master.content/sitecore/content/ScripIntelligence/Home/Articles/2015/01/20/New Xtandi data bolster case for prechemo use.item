<p>Astellas and Medivation reported a 10-month progression-free survival benefit for Xtandi (enzalutamide) versus Casodex (bicalutamide) in a Phase II clinical trial designed to satisfy requests for a head-to-head comparison of the androgen receptor inhibitors in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</p><p>Like the Phase III PREVAIL trial results that supported US and EU approvals for Xtandi in the treatment of mCRPC prior to chemotherapy, data from the 375-patient Phase II TERRAIN study also could change the standard of care for pre-chemo prostate cancer patients (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Xtandi-investigator-New-data-may-change-pre-chemo-practice-352089" target="_new">2 June</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-expands-Xtandis-prostate-cancer-use-353813" target="_new">11 September 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Xtandi-gets-EU-nod-for-use-earlier-in-CRPC-354668" target="_new">26 October 2014</a>). </p><p>Median PFS, TERRAIN's primary endpoint, was 15.7 months for Xtandi-treated men whose metastatic prostate cancer progressed despite androgen deprivation therapy &ndash; either treatment with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue or surgical castration &ndash; compared with 5.8 months of median PFS for men who received Casodex (HR=0.44; 95% CI 0.34-0.57; p<0.0001). trial="" participants="" took="" 160mg="" or="" xtandi="" or="" 50mg="" of="" casodex="" once=""></0.0001).></p><p><b>Shifting the standard of care</b></p><p>TERRAIN's principal investigator in the US, Dr Neal Shore of Carolina Urologic Research Center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, told <i>Scrip</i> that the results could give doctors with a preference for Casodex the evidence they need to use Xtandi instead.</p><p>"There are physicians with a certain comfort level with bicalutamide for patients who go from androgen-sensitive to castration-resistant, especially in Europe. TERRAIN creates clear evidence that bicalutamide is inferior to enzalutamide in preventing radiographic progression," Dr Shore said.</p><p>He noted that the PFS improvement seen in TERRAIN also could reinforce decisions by health care providers and payers to recommend treatment with Xtandi and reimburse the drug's costs for pre-chemo mCRPC patients.</p><p>Astellas spokesman Tyler Marciniak told <i>Scrip</i> that TERRAIN was designed to fulfill a medical community request for a head-to-head comparison of Xtandi and Casodex, but the company and Medivation do not plan to seek regulatory approvals for an Xtandi label update based on the study's results. </p><p>Detailed TERRAIN data will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.</p><p>Xtandi already is approved for both pre- and post-chemo treatment of mCRPC based on the placebo-controlled PREVAIL clinical trial and the Phase III AFFIRM trial, the latter of which supported the drug's initial approvals for patients whose prostate cancer progressed after chemotherapy. The more recent approvals for patients treated before chemotherapy covers the population enrolled in TERRAIN.</p><p>"There already is significant adoption of enzalutamide in the pre-chemo space. It was only last year that the PREVAIL results came out and we started to see it gain traction with oncologists and urologists. For certain physicians wedded to bicalutamide, this [PFS result in TERRAIN] is very robust data for them to consider," Dr Shore said.</p><p><b>Side effect considerations</b></p><p>Serious adverse event rates were 31.1% and 23.3%, respectively, in the TERRAIN study's Xtandi and Casodex treatment arms. Grade 3 or higher cardiac adverse events were reported for 5.5% of Xtandi-treated patients and 2.1% of men who received Casodex. Three seizures were reported during the study, two of which occurred among men treated with Xtandi.</p><p>Unsurprisingly given the serious cardiac adverse event rate, hypertension was among the most common side effects that occurred more often in TERRAIN's Xtandi arm than in the Casodex arm along with fatigue, hot flush, diarrhea, weight loss and pain in an extremity.</p><p>"A low frequency of seizures, which have been associated with Xtandi in other studies, was observed again but, as before, this is unlikely to raise too many concerns, especially with this strong PFS benefit," Sagient Research said in a 22 January BioMedTracker report on the TERRAIN results, which were seen as likely to boost Xtandi's use earlier in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm.</p><p>Medivation's stock price closed down 3.9% at $106.86 per share on 22 January after the TERRAIN data were announced. The company's market cap is $8.3bn at Medivation's current stock value, which is near the high end of its one-year range of $54.37 to $117.23.</p><p>"TERRAIN met the primary endpoint on efficacy, but safety and treatment duration were considered underwhelming by [investors], leading to pullback in stock price in an overall down market for biotech," William Blair analyst Katherine Xu said in a 22 January research note. "We believe the data achieved the main goal of demonstrating superiority in efficacy over Casodex, the most prescribed drug in prostate cancer, and should pave the way for Xtandi to advance further into urology to eventually replace Casodex."</p><p>Dr Xu said investors considered the treatment duration of 11.7 months for Xtandi versus 5.8 months for Casodex in TERRAIN to be too short to support a major boost in Xtandi sales, but the analyst noted that a shorter duration of treatment should not be unexpected given the metastatic status of patients enrolled in the clinical trial. </p><p>"In earlier-stage patients who are not metastatic, the treatment duration would be much longer, as demonstrated by the 600,000 [prescriptions] written for Casodex annually in the United States. Therefore, we do not believe a short treatment duration as demonstrated in TERRAIN to be negative on Xtandi's potential in urology," Dr Xu wrote.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the PREVAIL and TERRAIN results in pre-chemo treatment of mCRPC will affect Xtandi sales versus Johnson & Johnson's blockbuster prostate cancer drug Zytiga (abiraterone). </p><p>J&J recently reported Zytiga sales of $595m for the fourth quarter and $2.2bn for 2014, representing year-over-year growth of 26% in the fourth quarter and 33.1% for 2014 before factoring in foreign currency impacts (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJs-rising-sales-face-currency-hits-in-2014-2015-356274" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>). </p><p>However, Astellas hasn't reported its earnings yet for the fourth quarter &ndash; the first quarter of sales for Xtandi following approvals in the pre-chemo setting. </p><p>Medivation noted in November that Xtandi sales in the US increased 67% year-over-year to $181.4m in the third quarter while ex-US sales totaled $119.6m. The company forecasts full-year Xtandi sales of up to $640m in the US alone, which would be 63.1% more than the $392.4m in US Xtandi sales reported by Astellas in 2013.</p><p><p><p><p>
