<p>Interim data from an early study in Alzheimer's disease patients being treated with Biogen Idec's aducanumab (previously known as BIIB037) could be a breakthrough in the field &ndash; having major implications for the company, as well as for patients. </p><p>Biogen stock jumped almost 10% to linger around $475 per share after the biotech announced that an interim analysis from a Phase Ib study of aducanumab in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) showed both a reduction in the beta amyloid plaque theorized to cause the disease, as well as slowing of cognitive impairment in patients. </p><p>The positive results have prompted Biogen to push the drug into Phase III, with plans to initiate the late-stage studies before the end of the year. It also pushed analysts to raise their price targets for the company: Leerink Swann changed its target to $532 from $475, Cowen & Co pushed its estimates up to $500 from $425, Citi raised its projections for the stock to $512 from $410, and RW Baird pushed up its price target to $498 from $445.</p><p>Should aducanumab succeed, Biogen could have a blockbuster in its hand &ndash; although not until 2020, speculates Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz in a 20 March note. </p><p>"This implies approximately 700,000 US patients on aducanumab at peak, which at a relatively modest price of $12.5k/patient/year, translates into peak gross US revenues of ~$9b (~$14.5b worldwide)," wrote Schwartz. </p><p>The theory that accumulation of beta amyloid plaque in the brain causes the disease has long been batted around by the field, but until now, no drug has been able to show a statistically meaningful reduction in the plaque while also improving the cognitive symptoms that accompany the memory-shattering disease. </p><p>The study of AD drugs has long been marked by high-priced, late-stage failures from the likes of big pharmas such as Pfizer and Eli Lilly & Co (<a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Early-Alzheimers-data-sound-good-but-Biogen-has-much-to-prove-355380" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 03 December 2014</a>). </p><p>Yet, the growing number of aging adults means that the disease is becoming more prevalent and any treatment that might impact the progression of the disease could be a major blockbuster for the company that finally succeeds. Few companies are still willing to pay for the pricey clinical trials that are required for AD drugs due to the high likelihood of failure for the drugs; albeit, Lilly and Roche both have beta amyloid-battling drugs in their pipelines. </p><p>In a note to investors, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that aducanumab had an improvement in cognitive symptoms as high as 82%, while Lilly's solanezumab only showed improvements of about 17% in trials. "The magnitude of the efficacy improvements is really striking," he wrote in the 20 March report. </p><p>Meanwhile, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan sees little read-through for Lilly from the Biogen data due to the small number of patients in the aducanumab trial and the differences in trial design compared to Lilly's studies. Further data is expected on solanezumab in 2016 (<a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/3Q-EARNINGS-Lilly-looks-to-future-as-revenue-falls-354638" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 24 October 2014</a>). </p><p><b>The Data</b></p><p>The data, presented at the Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders in Nice, France on 20 March, was from 166 patients who for up to 54 weeks were treated with placebo or 1mg/kg, 3mg/kg or 10mg/kg dose doses of aducanumab. A 6mg/kg dose was given for up to 30 weeks. The PRIME study is ongoing and is looking at safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. </p><p>Mental impairment in patients was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scales, while beta amyloid plaque deposits were measured using PET imaging with the radiotracer florbetapir. Scans were conducted at baseline, 26 weeks and 54 weeks. </p><p>While plaque levels were virtually unchanged at both measurements in placebo patients, there was a statistically significant reduction in plaque at 26 weeks in all treatment arms. </p><p>Aducanumab also showed a statistically significant reduction in plaque at 54 weeks in the 3mg/kg [-0.139 (p<0.001)] and="" 10mg/kg="" [-0.266=""></0.001)]><0.001)] arms.="" data="" from="" the="" 6mg/kg="" arm="" at="" 54="" weeks="" is="" not="" yet="" available="" and="" will="" be="" presented="" at="" a="" later="" date.=""></0.001)]></p><p>The PRIME study showed that declines in cognitive and functional performance were slowed by aducanumab and there was a dose dependent correlation. Using the MMSE scale, patients on placebo showed a decline of 3.14 over one year, while those on the drug declined 2.21 in the 1mg/kg arm, 0.75 in the 3mg/kg arm, and 0.58 in the 10mg/kg arm.</p><p>Using the CDR scale, placebo patients showed a decline of 2.04, while reductions for those on aducanumab were 1.7 in the 1mg/kg arm, 1.33 in the 3mg/kg group, and 0.59 in the 10mg/kg arm. Patients given 10mg/kg of aducanumab showed a statistically significant result compared with placebo. </p><p>While the drug showed manageable levels of safety and tolerability, aducanumab showed a dose-dependent, apolipoprotein E4-(ApoE4) status-dependent adverse event of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E). </p><p>Patients given a higher dose of the drug and who were also carriers of the gene were more likely to develop the condition that resulted in swelling around areas of the brain. The issue caused a higher incidence of patients on the drug to drop out of the trial. Biogen introduced the intermediate dose of 6mg/kg to the trial after it became evident that the issue was dose-dependent. </p><p>The majority of the patients in the study who experienced the adverse event were asymptomatic and continued the study at a lower dose. </p><p>While the company dismissed the ARIA-E issue as minor, Schoenebaum speculates that clinicians will be less likely to prescribe the high (10mg/kg) dose, and will want to see lower rates of ARIA-E in patients on the 6mg/kg dose. </p><p><p><p><p>
