<p>The Indian pharma foreign direct investment (FDI) debate &ndash; something of a dormant volcano &ndash; erupted again toward the fag end of 2014, after a Parliamentary panel took a tough view on such inflows in the case of brownfield deals, only to be followed by reports of the finance ministry seemingly singing a different tune. </p><p>The issue of unfettered FDI transactions in the Indian pharmaceutical sector has always been thorny, especially when it comes acquisitions of domestic firms. Opponents argue that such transactions may have an impact on India's future medicines security. </p><p>India currently mandates that all brownfield investment proposals be routed via the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) for approval, though it continues to permit 100% FDI via the automatic approval route for greenfield investments in the pharma sector. In January 2014, India diluted the rider concerning non-compete clauses in brownfield pharma FDI <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Mixed-reactions-to-dilution-of-Indian-brownfield-FDI-non-compete-rider-349178%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 9 January 2014)</a>. </p><p>The latest round of debate follows a report by a Parliamentary panel, which reiterated the need for a ''blanket ban'' on FDI in brownfield pharma projects. The panel said that ''conditionalities'' imposed for approving brownfield FDI proposals in India were of ''little consequence'' vis-&agrave;-vis the ''dangers'' posed by the takeovers of Indian firms. These conditionalities, it claimed, were not comprehensive and did not cater to the objective/purpose for which FDI had been allowed.</p><p>However, days later a report in the local media quoted an unnamed finance ministry official as saying that there was a need to ''revisit'' the FDI policy and have a ''thorough'' debate on the ''merits of restrictions'' and its impact on the pharmaceutical sector &ndash; seen as a potentially softer approach. India recently eased norms in the medical devices sector permitting FDI up to 100% under the automatic route. </p><p>The revival of the FDI debate in the pharma sector elicited mixed reactions from industry with some industry veterans emphasizing that no major change was envisaged in India's FDI policy ''at the moment''. </p><p>Others, however, underscored the demerits of policy uncertainty.</p><p>Novartis India vice chairman and managing director, Ranjit Shahani, said that FDI was an ''essential component'' not only of developing economies but also developed economies.</p><p>''Our discussions on FDI just don't seem to have a full stop&#8230; giving rise to uncertainties in investments and strategic planning. Pharmaceuticals are a critical element of [the] health of a nation. Uncertainties in policies relating to pharmaceuticals whether FDI, pricing or regulatory, do not augur well and the industry would like to work with the new government to create an ecosystem which supports a vibrant industry,'' Mr Shahani told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>An expert with a foreign firm noted that if manufacturing in the pharma sector is be given a boost to attract FDI, a range of reforms will be required including ''smoothening out'' acquisition of land, environmental clearances and ease of hiring organized labour. </p><p>''Setting these things right are painful and may even inhibit sector growth in the short term. This leads to the double whammy of the government not attempting to set things right and the industry not showing interest in investing in the sector,'' the expert told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>While greenfield FDI may have little appeal to foreign investors, brownfield projects, he explained, often help cut through the maze of regulations, and running profitable businesses appeal more to investors who would rather have returns on their investments than their money ''tied up in policy tangles''. </p><p>''While the finance ministry has understood this and is in all likelihood supporting the commerce ministry to ease regulations and get Prime Minister Modi's "Make in India" vision to reality, the Parliamentary Panel that wants a ban on brownfield investments does so out of a misplaced sense of nationalism,'' the expert claimed. </p><p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government's ''Make in India'' campaign seeks to project the country as a manufacturing hub of choice, with the Prime Minister promising an environment of trust and confidence for investors under that effort.</p><h2>Parliamentary panel report</h2><p>The Parliamentary panel report, though, had some tough words against brownfield pharma FDI and noted that there was no compulsion on transfer of technology and similar other conditions in the current policy that could bring ''qualitative'' change to the pharma industry.</p><p>The panel believes that a condition of compulsory technology transfer should be considered before approving FDI in brownfield pharma projects.</p><p>The committee said that it was especially wary about the condition imposed in respect of maintaining R&D expenses in value terms for five years at an absolute quantitative level at the time of induction of FDI. It has sought that this condition be ''remodelled'' to ensure that at least 5% of the ''combined turnover'' of the acquired and acquiring company be earmarked for R&D expenses. </p><p>''Further, a certain portion of the R&D expenses must be earmarked for tropical diseases affecting India,'' the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce, chaired by Dr Chandan Mitra (a member of Parliament from the BJP), said in its 115th report tabled in Parliament on 22 December. </p><p>The latest report focuses on the action taken by government on a previous panel's recommendations in its 110th report on FDI in the pharmaceutical sector in August 2013, which had also called for a similar ban on brownfield FDI <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-blanket-brownfield-ban-call-brings-fresh-headwinds-for-FDI-345867%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 14 August 2013)</a>. </p><p>The December 2014 report also said that the non-compete clause in any of the inter-se brownfield FDI agreements should be completely prohibited and no exceptions whatsoever be permitted. The commerce and industry ministry in January 2014 declared that the non-compete clause in brownfield FDI would not be allowed except in ''special circumstances'' with the approval of the FIPB. </p><p>Among a string of other stinging comments, the Parliamentary committee also said that the series of takeovers in the pharma sector had largely failed to serve the purpose envisaged under FDI policy as there was ''barely any inflow'' of best global practices and ''nearly zilch'' discovery of new molecules.</p><p>''Rather there is a fear that there will be erosion in competition as these acquisitions/takeovers would help these behemoths to take control of the larger share of India's pharma industry and driving it as per their choice and desire,'' the report noted.</p><p>The committee urged the department of industrial policy and promotion to work in tandem with the ministry of health to ensure that FDI in the pharma sector did not impinge upon the availability of affordable drugs to the Indian public.</p><p>The expert with the foreign firm quoted previously, however, said that the committee's argument shows a complete lack of understanding of how the global pharmaceutical industry operates. </p><p>''Foreign firms are not acquiring Indian generic companies to stop generic medicines. With a huge number of products going off-patent globally, pharmaceutical companies are building their capabilities to sell generic drugs. They are acquiring Indian companies for their strength in generics, not to obliterate them. The concern that India's pharmaceutical industry will die if foreign companies invest here is silly. Why would Mylan spend $1.6bn to 'kill' Agila?'' he argued. </p><p>In February 2013, Mylan snapped up Strides Arcolab's injectables arm, Agila Specialties, a move that was expected to fast-track Mylan's approach towards becoming a top-three global player in the injectables space <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/1.6bn-Agila-injects-strengths-into-Mylan-340413%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 28 February 2013)</a>. </p><p>While inefficient firms would lose market share due to foreign competition, the expert said that in the long run this should increase the overall efficiency of the Indian economy. ''Either ways allowing FDI inflows is only beneficial for India and its citizens,'' he said.</p>
