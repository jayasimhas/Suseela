<p>The $2.06bn in venture capital that private US biotechnology firms raised during the third quarter almost matched the industry's near record-breaking second quarter total, keeping 2015 VC investment on track to beat 2014 despite a downturn in public biotech valuations that began in the third quarter.</p><p>The MoneyTree Report from the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Thompson Reuters previously said that biotech companies raised $2.3bn in venture capital during the second quarter of this year, beating the all-time high of $2.09bn in the second quarter of 2014, but revised data show that the April-to-June period of 2015 was just the second best quarter on record at $2.07bn. And at only $10m below the second quarter, the July-to-September total showed that the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index's (NBI) 18% drop in the third quarter did not hurt VC investment.</p><p><b>Big Quarter, Big Deals</b></p><p>The three-month period ending on Sept. 30 was the third largest quarter for venture capital raised by biotech companies since the MoneyTree Report began disseminating VC data by industry in 1995. The $5.8bn invested in biotech during the first nine months of 2015 seems to ensure that the industry's VC fundraising will beat the $6.3bn raised in all 12 months of 2014 even after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-VC-deals-have-best-ever-quarter-2.3bn-359519" target="_new">the second quarter total</a> was revised lower by $200m, because of large deals like the $217m invested in Denali Therapeutics. </p><p>But if the annual dollar amount invested in biotech beats <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-raised-6bn-in-2014-venture-capital-most-since-2007-356200" target="_new">2014's record-breaking total</a>, the number of companies raising venture capital is likely to fall from previous years, since VC investors are putting larger sums of money into the same number of biotech firms &ndash; with some companies, like Moderna Therapeutics, raising <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Moderna-raises-450m-most-ever-for-private-biotech-355938" target="_new">all-time-high venture funding rounds</a>.</p><p>While 372 biotech firms raised venture capital in the first nine months of 2014, only two more companies &ndash; 374 &ndash; garnered VC cash in 2015. The average amount of money raised grew from $11.6m to $15.6m driven by crossover investors that anticipate an initial public offering in the near future for certain private drug developers.</p><p>The boost is great for biotech firms that raised money, because they may be able to run more studies, line up additional partnerships, or otherwise spend more time looking for ways to boost their value before they have to pursue another round of venture capital or seek a buyer.</p><p>The downside of the same number of companies raising more money per funding round is that there likely are still many new startups &ndash; or previously-funded, early-stage companies with a need to finance the next stage of development &ndash; that have unsuccessfully searched for venture capital.</p><p>Companies looking for follow-on investments may have the hardest time bringing in new VC funding right now, since first-time investments in newly-formed biotech firms increased significantly during the first nine months of this year in terms of both the number of startups that raised venture capital and the amount of VC dollars invested.</p><p>The MoneyTree numbers show that 82 biotech startups received their first-ever venture capital during the first nine months of 2014 for a total of $493.8m, or $6m on average, but 91 startups raised nearly $1.3bn during the first nine months of 2015, or $14.1m on average.</p><p><b>Large Numbers All Around</b></p><p>NVCA president and CEO Bobby Franklin noted that venture capital investment in the third quarter across all sectors &ndash; biotech as well as software, consumer goods and services, information technology, media and entertainment, and other industries &ndash; favored companies at the earliest stages of product development.</p><p>"With seven consecutive quarters of more than $10bn deployed to the startup ecosystem and more than half of all investment deals now going to seed or early-stage companies, it's a great time to be an entrepreneur in America," Franklin said in a statement from the NVCA. </p><p>He also said that "venture capitalists remain undeterred and are confident investing in truly innovative companies" regardless of "recent turbulence in the financial markets."</p><p>With $16.3bn in VC investment across all industries during third quarter and more than $47bn invested during the first nine months of 2015, US venture capital investment may reach its second highest total since 1995. </p><p>But if biotech VC investment continues at its current pace, the industry will set an all-time high this year, outpacing venture capital raised in other industries and keeping money flowing to private drug developers &ndash; such as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Will-VC-Be-Last-Man-Standing-If-Biotech-Bubble-Bursts-360716" target="_new">Deciphera Pharmaceuticals and Corvus Pharmaceuticals</a>, which raised $75m each in the third quarter &ndash; while stock market investors pull cash out of public biotech firms and IPO hopefuls.</p><p><p><p><p>
