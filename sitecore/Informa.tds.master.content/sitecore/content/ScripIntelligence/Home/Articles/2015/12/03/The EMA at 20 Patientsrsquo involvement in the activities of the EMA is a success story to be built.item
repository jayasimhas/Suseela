<p><b>Great progress has been made, but more work will be needed to ensure that patients can continue to increase their involvement in the activities of the European Medicines Agency, say Yann Le Cam and Flaminia Macchia</b>.</p><p>The participation of patients and patient representatives in the activities of the European Medicines Agency took place for the very first time with the involvement of patients from the European Aids Treatment Group within the activities of the EMA's main scientific committee, the CHMP, in the late 1990s, not long after the agency was established in London.</p><p>The next major step in the evolution of patient involvement in EMA activities followed the adoption and entering into force of the EU regulation on orphan medicinal products, which provides for the statutory representation of three patient representatives in the agency's scientific and regulatory committees for the first time. This was an unprecedented event, at global level, in Europe and beyond, and it has been reinforced by the election of one patient representative as vice-chair of the EMA's Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products.</p><p>Today, we can be proud that patient representatives took part in the activities of the EMA 633 times during 2014. This figure includes participation of patients as full members within the agency's scientific committees &ndash; for example the COMP, the PDCO (paediatric medicines), the CAT (advanced therapy medicinal products) and the PRAC (pharmacovigilance) &ndash; and also as experts in the different working groups and procedures (such as the Patients' and Consumers' Working Party, scientific advice/protocol assistance).</p><p>Patients also took part in the preliminary discussions before the CHMP, and played a role as reviewers in the elaboration of information documents such as package leaflets and European public assessment reports and in the development of guidelines, information policy on clinical trials, medicine shortages, etc.</p><p>More recently, the first pilots allowing patient participation in the benefit/risk assessment at CHMP plenary sessions are taking place.</p><p>In our view, the main elements for further discussion in the future are the following:</p><p>1. How to switch from the phase of emerging practices and pilots towards more systematic and uniform processes to consolidate and deploy patient engagement while ensuring higher recognition of the patients� contribution.</p><p>2. One of the major lessons to be drawn from these 15 years of growing patient participation in EMA activities is the need to define clear rules, thoroughly address conflict of interest (CoI) issues, and evaluate these CoI risks through an approach that increasingly ensures transparency and patients� independence in a rigorous way.</p><p>3. It has to be duly taken into account that adequate patient participation in the activities of the EMA requires not only the identification of patients, their actual participation and the identification of potential conflicts of interest, but also a substantial amount of work upstream: identifying the "resource persons" within the network of patient associations, and training and capacity-building activities in order to fully capture the concepts, terminologies and processes related to drug development and authorisation. Indeed, in order to optimise the contribution from patient representatives, training and support all along the process are needed, both by the agency and by patient organisations.</p><p>The EMA is strongly committed to engaging patients in its activities. All parties involved still need to make patient participation robust in the long run in order to optimise the contribution of patients to guidance and assessment. The next important step, and one that is increasingly being looked at, is organising public hearings at the CHMP, involving all stakeholders, including health technology assessment bodies, payers, patient associations, healthcare professionals and media, in order to increase open dialogue and mutual trust.</p><p><i>Yann Le Cam is CEO and Flaminia Macchia is public affairs director of Eurordis, the European alliance of rare disease patient organisations.</i></p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency. In the run-up to the invitation-only scientific conference that the EMA is holding to mark the anniversary in London on 18 March, you'll be able to read what key individuals and stakeholders in the European pharmaceutical regulatory network have to say about the challenges the EMA and the network are facing and where they are headed as the agency moves into its third decade. </i></p><p><b><i>Previously in the series</i></b>:</p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Fernand Sauer reviews the first two decades and offers advice for regulators at all levels",</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Fernand-Sauer-reviews-the-first-two-decades-and-offers-advice-for-regulators-at-all-levels-357045" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 3 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A decade of expansion, collaboration and new legislation", by Thomas Lönngren</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-decade-of-expansion-collaboration-and-new-legislation-357061" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 4 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Independence and transparency are the key to fulfilling the EMA's public health commitments", by Health Action International</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Independence-and-transparency-are-the-key-to-fulfilling-the-EMAs-public-health-commitments-357084" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 5 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A short history of the European Medicines Agency", by Ian Schofield</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-short-history-of-the-European-Medicines-Agency-357112" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 6 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "CHMP chair on HTA, patient involvement and dealing with uncertainty", by Francesca Bruce</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-CHMP-chair-on-HTA-patient-involvement-and-dealing-with-uncertainty-357139" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 9 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "An increasing impact on the non-prescription medicines market", by Hubertus Cranz</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-An-increasing-impact-on-the-non-prescription-medicines-market-357198" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 10 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: Trust is the key", by Emily O'Reilly</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Trust-is-the-key-357223" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 11 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: A quality model that deserves to be replicated, by Richard Bergström & Pär Tellner</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-quality-model-that-deserves-to-be-replicated-357249" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 12 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: The generic and biosimilar industries on taking a positive partnership forward, by Adrian van den Hoven</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-The-generic-and-biosimilar-industries-on-taking-a-positive-partnership-forward-357280" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 15 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: Twenty years of success &ndash; the EMA and the European medicines agencies regulatory network, by Klaus Cichutek</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Twenty-years-of-success---the-EMA-and-the-European-medicines-agencies-regulatory-network-357314" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>,<i> 16 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>Margaret Hamburg on the EMA at 20: An ever stronger bilateral partnership with the US FDA</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Margaret-Hamburg-on-the-EMA-at-20-An-ever-stronger-bilateral-partnership-with-the-US-FDA-357326" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 17 March 2015.</p><p>
