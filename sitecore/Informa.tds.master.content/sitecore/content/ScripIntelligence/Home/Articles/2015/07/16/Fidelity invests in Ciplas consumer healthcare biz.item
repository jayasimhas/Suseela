<p>Private equity firm Fidelity is investing in Cipla's fledgling consumer healthcare business, currently under incorporation.</p><p>Cipla said that its board had cleared an investment by Fidelity Growth Partners India and US-based Fidelity Biosciences, through FIL Capital Investments (Mauritius) II or its affiliates, in its recently launched consumer healthcare business. The investment is subject to execution of definitive agreements and regulatory approvals. </p><p>Fidelity's portfolio includes investments in firms such as Laurus Labs and XCyton Diagnostics, among others, as per details on its website.</p><p>Cipla declined to comment on Fidelity's holding in the consumer healthcare business or whether the private equity firm would have a seat on the new firm's board. </p><p>Samina Vaziralli, daughter of Cipla's vice chair M K Hamied, who is the brother of chairman Dr Yusuf Hamied, said that partnering with a long-term strategic and financial investor like Fidelity Growth Partners would help the company create a "best-in-class" consumer healthcare business.</p><p>Earlier, Ms Vaziralli had, in an exclusive <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Interview-Ciplas-heiress-on-taking-the-legacy-forward-and-the-firms-new-baby-359429" target="_new">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i>, commented that the consumer healthcare business requires a different "ecosystem and governance model", hence necessitating its spin off. She also talked of opportunities to leverage on Cipla's business in South Africa, where around 25% of the topline comes from an OTC pipeline. </p><p>Anantha Nayak will be the CEO of the new consumer healthcare enterprise, though Ms Vaziralli had previously mentioned other hires from Heinz, Novartis OTC, and Ranbaxy OTC. </p><p>The Indian consumer healthcare market is currently estimated at around $4bn and growing at a compound annual growth rate of 15%. It is expected to touch $10bn by 2020. Cipla had recently launched Nicotex, a gum which helps smokers quit the habit.</p>
