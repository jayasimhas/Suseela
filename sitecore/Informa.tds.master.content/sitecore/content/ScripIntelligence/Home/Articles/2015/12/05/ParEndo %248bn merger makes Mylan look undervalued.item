<p> In a deal that proves just what can be done when all shareholders can be consulted in a single elevator journey, Endo International and privately owned Par Pharmaceutical have put together a $8.05bn merger to create the fifth largest independent company in the generics pharmaceutical space. And the deal makes Teva's bid for Mylan look somewhat underpowered. </p> <p> The deal puts Endo-plus-Par sixth in the league of global generics producers when Novartis's Sandoz unit is included in the reckoning (see Table 1) with $3.6bn in pharma sales. This is roughly half the size of Mylan and Valeant in fifth and fourth place, respectively, and a further $1.5bn behind Sandoz. </p> <p> With <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-defends-its-deal-plans-for-Mylan-358207" target="_new">Teva still chasing Mylan</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-not-seeing-the-value-in-Mylan-offer-358127" target="_new">Mylan chasing Perrigo</a> (perhaps as an expensive poison pill), Par's ownership by private equity investor TPG meant that its subsequent sale to Endo could be transacted smoothly. No further shareholder approval is required. The $8.05bn deal ($1.55bn in Endo shares and $6.5bn in cash) gives TPG a 4 times multiple of the $1.9bn it originally bought the company for back in July 2012. The debt financing required has already been arranged and agreed with lenders Deutsche Bank and Barclays. </p> <p> The price Endo has paid is approximately 6.3 times Par's annual sales figure. This is slightly above the 5.6-times-sales number that Teva has proposed for the acquisition of Mylan, an offer rejected with some ridicule by Mylan. To reach an equivalent 6.3 multiple Teva would have to add another 20% to its current $82-a-share offer for Mylan, easily reaching the $85-95 per share value that many analysts and investors have suggested Mylan is worth. </p> <p> <table> <h2> Table 1.

It bought Aptalis out of public ownership for $1.3bn in 2008 and sold it to Forest Laboratories in January 2014 for $2.9bn in cash, just before Forest itself was acquired by Actavis a month later. As part of the product shake-out that preceded the conclusion of Actavis's bid for Allergan in March 2015, TPG reacquired the Pharmatech division of Aptalis for an undisclosed fee </p> <p> Aptalis, formerly known as Axcan Pharma, is a global specialty pharmaceutical company that has approximately 1,000 employees worldwide. The company provides innovative, effective therapies for unmet medical needs including cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal disorders. It achieved sales of $688m in FY2013 which ended September 2013. </p>
