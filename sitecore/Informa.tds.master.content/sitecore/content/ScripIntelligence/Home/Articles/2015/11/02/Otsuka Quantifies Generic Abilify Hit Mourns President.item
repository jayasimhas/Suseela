<p>Otsuka Pharmaceutical has been rocked by the sudden death of its president at a young age, losing one of the more colorful characters in the Japanese pharma industry at what is a challenging time for the company, which outlined for the first time the impact it expects from generic Abilify in the US.</p><p>Otsuka Pharmaceutical president and Dr Taro Iwamoto died suddenly aged 54 on 9 February, the major Japanese firm announced on 12 February, with the cause of death understood to be acute heart failure. </p><p>The company has moved quickly to appoint a successor, naming Otsuka Holdings president and CEO Tatsuo Higuchi to concurrently serve as president of Otsuka Pharmaceuticals in an emergency board meeting in 12 February. Higuchi was already an executive director of the mainstay pharma operation, which comprises the group's main prescription business as well as a broad range of consumer nutraceuticals. </p><p>On 13 February, the company also announced that Otsuka Holdings vice-chairman Ichiro Otsuka would become chairman of the holding group, effective late March.</p><p>The Japanese pharma industry has lost one of its more unusual and dynamic executives, at a time when Otsuka and its new president are facing the looming loss on 20 April of US exclusivity for the standard oral formulation of by far its top product, the anti-psychotic Abilify (aripiprazole).</p><p>Abilify, used mainly in schizophrenia and other indications including depression, accounted for fully 41% of group net sales in the fiscal first half, with global sales of around $2.8 billion in the period.</p><h2>Generic Abilify Impact</h2><p>While investors appeared not to be overly concerned about the business impact of the leadership change, Otsuka Holdings' shares initially dropped sharply after the group announced its third quarter results on 13 February and issued its first guidance for this year.</p><p>The stock recovered some ground, closing down 1.8% at JPY3,641 on the day.</p><p>The firm is changing its fiscal year end from 31 March to 31 December, and reported sales in the interim nine months (April-December) of JPY1,224.3bn ($10.31bn; +8% over the comparable results in the same period of the previous year), with operating income up 7% to JPY196.5bn (+7%).</p><p>But it expects group sales to fall by 13% to JPY1,370bn in calendar 2015 on a comparable basis with 2014, with operating income forecast to plunge 49% to JPY110bn and net income by 48% to JPY80bn versus last calendar year.</p><p>North American sales of Abilify are seen plummeting by 42% to $2.86bn in calendar 2015, although global sales of Abilify Maintena, a once-monthly depot formulation, are expected to rise from JPY17.1bn in calendar 2014 to JPY55.5bn this year, the firm said. </p><p>Datamonitor analysts have forecast that US Abilify sales could in fact plunge further to around $1.63bn in 2015 and then to $414m the following year. </p><p>Otsuka recently acquired the US CNS-focused firm Avanir Pharmaceuticals for $3.5bn, which may go some way to helping to plug the gap over the mid-term. But while Otsuka has a strong balance sheet and cash reserves (of around $8bn before the Avanir deal), it is clear that existing M&A deals and growing new products will be unable to fill the revenue gap this year. </p><p>And while the potential Abilify successor brexpiprazole is progressing under the CNS alliance with Lundbeck, this looks unlikely to be approved before July, after generic versions of aripiprazole become available.</p><h2>Iwamoto's Rise, Legacy</h2><p>Dr Iwamoto assumed the presidency of Otsuka Pharmaceutical in mid-2008 after joining the firm in 1994, and by 2007 had risen to become CEO of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization.</p><p>In an interview I conducted with him in 2013 at Otsuka's major Tokushima site in Japan for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INTERVIEW-Maverick-Otsuka-looks-to-challenge-the-norm-343537" target="_new">Scrip Asia 100</a> supplement, Dr Iwamoto described how he was handpicked by former Otsuka Holdings/Otsuka Pharmaceutical chairman Akihiko Otsuka after the two met in the US. His mentor encouraged him to look at things differently, to think big and pursue innovation. </p><p>At the time, I described Dr Iwamoto as "highly animated, passionate and willing to look at challenges from an unconventional angle," and it was these qualities that made him stand out in the often drab, conformist ranks of corporate Japan.</p><p>Replying to my suggestion that Otsuka as a business was somewhat eccentric &ndash; what with its highly diversified products and unusual corporate culture &ndash; his response was: "They [investors] want Otsuka to be creative and if 'eccentricity' plays a part in this, I will actively encourage it."</p><p>He said a big goal for him was to foster a culture akin to a venture firm despite Otsuka's size, and he was also wary of M&A for size's sake, saying this had no meaning unless it helped innovation and could attract suitable human talent.</p><p>With a 90-year-plus history as a private business led by the Otsuka family and the influential and unconventional Akihiko &ndash; and in common with some other large Japanese firms such as Honda &ndash; Otsuka has been able to retain a non-business-detrimental quirky streak, even after its $2.4bn public offering in December 2010.</p><p>I remember hearing a tale of participants at one internal drug R&D meeting being asked to wear Bermuda shorts to break down barriers and help encourage informality and "out-of-the-box" thinking.</p><p>Dr Iwamoto played a part in continuing this unorthodox approach and it is to be hoped that the positive legacy aspects of his maverick qualities can be brought to bear on the challenges the company is facing.</p><p><p>
