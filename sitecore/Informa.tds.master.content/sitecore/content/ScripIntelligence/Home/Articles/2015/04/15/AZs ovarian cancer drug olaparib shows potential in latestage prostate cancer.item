<p>AstraZeneca's oral PARP inhibitor olaparib (Lynparza), which was approved in December for women with ovarian cancer and inherited BRCA mutations, might also be able to benefit men with prostate cancer.</p><p>Researchers presented data at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) conference in Philadelphia showing that up to 30% of men with advanced prostate cancer had tumors with defects in repairing DNA &ndash; and these responded particularly well to olaparib. </p><p>This investigator-initiated Phase II trial, called TOPARP-A, was led by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research, London and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and also involved several other institutions in the UK. AstraZeneca partly funded the trial.</p><p>"The TOPARP data presented at AACR are extremely compelling, building on the data presented at ESMO last year, which showed that prostate cancer patients with defective DNA damage repair mechanisms responded to olaparib," Menelas Pangalos, executive vice president of innovative medicines and early development at AstraZeneca, told <i>Scrip</i>. "Olaparib is an excellent example of how advances in the understanding of cancer biology can be used to develop the next generation of targeted medicines. We continue to be excited about its potential to treat patients across a number of different tumour types, in addition to the ovarian cancer indications in which it has already received approval in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-defies-advisers-OKs-AZs-ovarian-cancer-drug-Lynparza-355773" target="_new">the US</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Speedy-EU-approval-for-AZs-key-new-anticancer-Lynparza-355737" target="_new">Europe</a>. Phase III trials are ongoing in metastatic and adjuvant breast cancer, pancreatic and gastric cancer and, in addition to the Institute of Cancer Research study, we already have a Phase II study underway exploring the activity of olaparib in combination with abiraterone in patients with metastatic prostate cancer."</p><p>In the trial, researchers monitored the response of 49 men with treatment-resistant, advanced prostate cancer to olaparib. Sixteen patients (32.7%) responded to the drug, as defined by a set of clinical criteria. Fourteen out of the 16 had detectable DNA repair mutations.</p><p>The results will lead on to the start of TOPARP-B, a second part of the trial in which only men with detectable DNA repair mutations will receive olaparib. If the results can be replicated, olaparib could become a treatment option in advanced prostate cancer.</p><p>Trial chief investigator Professor Johann de Bono, head of drug development at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: "Our trial shows that olaparib is effective in men with defects in DNA repair genes who do not necessarily have an inherited risk of cancer &ndash; and that we can pick up these defects in the clinic. This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the particular molecular characteristics of patients' tumors.</p><p>"The trial is also exciting because it shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought &ndash; in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects than just BRCA mutations."</p><p>In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/PROFILE-AstraZenecas-Mene-Pangalos-on-yin-and-yang-not-believing-your-own----press-and-his-part-in-Soriots-vision-356773" target="_new">an interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i> not long after Lynparza's launch earlier this year, Dr Pangalos described the approval of the drug in ovarian cancer as his proudest professional moment. "Olaparib has been such a great challenge. It was written off a few years ago. The work we did to keep that molecule moving through the pipeline because we believed in the science, to get many of the issues sorted out and to get the diagnostic approved. It was a remarkable effort."</p>
