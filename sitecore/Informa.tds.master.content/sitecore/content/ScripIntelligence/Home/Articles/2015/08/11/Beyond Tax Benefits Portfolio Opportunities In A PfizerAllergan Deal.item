<p> Pfizer Inc. and Allergan plc continue to be in closed-door discussions regarding a potential merger that could significantly cut Pfizer's tax rate due to Allergan's Irish corporate base, but Allergan also has several commercial products and research-stage assets that could fill gaps in Pfizer's portfolio. </p> <p> The companies have some overlapping programs, but within therapeutic areas that they have in common, Allergan could add marketed drugs and investigational therapies for indications that Pfizer lacks &ndash; and vice versa, since it's possible that Allergan could buy Pfizer to prevent the larger company from moving its tax base overseas in a controversial tax inversion following the merger. </p> <p> Some portfolio opportunities for Pfizer include Allergan's diverse neurology portfolio and established Alzheimer's franchise (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergans-Assets-Could-Diversify-Pfizers-Neurology-Portfolio-361509?REFID=DLYALT">see separate article here</a>), its growing antibiotics business and a large women's health focus. Pfizer also could tap into categories like dermatology and aesthetics &ndash; where it doesn't have any products &ndash; and ophthalmology, which are big businesses for Allergan. </p> <p> Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told <i>Scrip</i> in <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-Seeks-Opportunities-To-Dominate-In-Key-Therapeutic-Areas-361378">an interview following the company's R&amp;D Day</a> on Nov. 4 that pharma largely has backed away from Allergan's seven key therapeutic areas: ophthalmology, neurology, dermatology and aesthetics, gastrointestinal, women's health, urology and anti-infectives. </p> <p> &quot;We are typically the largest player in the space,&quot; Saunders said. </p> <p> While Allergan does not have a significant presence in oncology, which is <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-promotes-underappreciated-RandD-pipeline-356297">a major research and development focus for Pfizer</a>, Datamonitor Healthcare noted recently that some of the companies' overlapping categories provide opportunities for growth as revenue from certain Pfizer blockbusters dwindles over a decade. </p> <p> For instance, annual sales of the neuropathic pain drug <i>Lyrica</i> (pregabalin) are expected to decline by $3.9bn between 2014 and 2024, while Datamonitor notes that Pfizer's rheumatoid arthritis drug <i>Xeljanz</i> (tofacitinib) will bring in just $958m in new sales in that time. </p> <p> Growth from some of Allergan's products could help fill the revenue gap: $376m from the low estrogen birth control pill <i>Lo Loestrin Fe</i>, $177m from <i>Canasa</i> (mesalamine) for ulcerative proctitis, $160m from the beta blocker <i>Bystolic</i>/<i>Valsartan</i> (nebivolol) for hypertension, and $127m from <i>Estrace</i> (estradiol) for vulvar and vaginal atrophy. </p> <p> The Datamonitor assessment included Allergan's approved products, but didn't take into account programs in the research and development pipeline with blockbuster potential, according to the company: abicipar pegol (formerly known as DARPin) for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rapastinel for depression, Viberzi (eravacycline) for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Esmya for uterine fibroids, Kybella (deoxycholic acid) for double chin and at least four others. </p> <p> Allergan presented details for several of its 70-plus pipeline programs during the company's R&amp;D Day, which took place at its research campus in Irvine, California, and shared a slide that highlighted 13 assets with at least $250m and as much as $2bn &ndash; or more &ndash; in projected annual sales. </p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Product</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Indication</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Launch</b> </p> <p> &nbsp;

The investment bank's analysis included revenue from Allergan's lower margin generics business, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632">which is being sold</a> to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for $40.5bn so that the company can <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-36bn-from-Teva-what-should-Allergan-buy-next-359644">focus on higher margin brand-name products</a>. </p> <p> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00251/Allergan_70-plus_De_251321a.png"> <img src="-/media/05555379FFCD42149F0828AC8E0D2B83.ashx"></a> </p> <p> <b>Diversity In Women's Health</b> </p> <p> Like Allergan's neurology platform, which includes four out of the nine blockbusters highlighted during the R&amp;D Day presentations, the company's women's health portfolio is quite diverse. </p> <p> Allergan has been building its women's health business since before January 2013 when the company &ndash; still known as generics-focused Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. &ndash; <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Watson-buys-womens-health-focused-Uteron-for-up-to-305m-as-it-adopts-Actavis-name-339343">bought Uteron Pharma</a>. At the time, Watson noted that there was little competition in women's health as big pharma competitors were leaving the space, including Pfizer's Wyeth. In May during the same year, after Watson became Actavis, the company <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Chilcott-deal-has-slaked-thirst-of-generic-hunter-Actavis---for-now-343382">boosted its women's health portfolio when it bought</a> Warner Chilcott PLC. </p> <p> Allergan has <i>Atelvia</i> (risedronate sodium or delayed-released Actonel) for osteoporosis; <i>Cervidil</i> (dinoprostone) for labor induction, <i>Crenone</i> (progesterone) for amenorrhea; <i>Proquin SR</i> (ciprofloxacin) and <i>Metronidazole</i> 1.3% vaginal gel for urinary tract and reproductive tract infections; <i>Thyrolar</i> (liotrix) for hypothyroidism; and the contraceptives <i>Ella</i>, <i>Generess Fe</i>, <i>Liletta</i>, <i>Lo Loestrin Fe</i>, <i>Lo Minastrin Fe</i>, and <i>Ovcon-50</i>. </p> <p> A new drug application (NDA) has been submitted to the US FDA for a progestin-only contraceptive patch while Phase III clinical programs are under way for <i>Esmya</i> (ulipristal) in uterine fibroids, nestorone and ethinyl estradiol contraceptive vaginal ring, <i>Prochieve</i> (progesterone) for preterm labor, and WC3011 for vaginal atrophy. Phase II testing also is under way for the contraceptive pill Estelle, and Colvir is in Phase I development for cervical dysplasia. </p> <p> Allergan highlighted Esmya during its R&amp;D Day, noting that the company expects to submit an NDA for the Phase III drug candidate in 2017 with FDA approval expected in 2018. There is a need for an effective treatment, since 11m women between the ages of 25 and 49 have been diagnosed with the condition. Esmya has been shown in mid-stage studies to reduce tumor size, relieve pain and bleeding, and help patients delay the need for surgery. </p> <p> &quot;Women's health is a $1bn business for Allergan in the US. This product can double the business,&quot; William Meury, executive vice president and president of branded pharma, said during the company's R&amp;D Day. </p> <p> Allergan projects that Esmya could generate $1bn in annual US sales based on the drug's use in Canada, where it is approved and marketed as Fibristal. </p> <p> Pfizer's small women's health portfolio includes the hormone replacement therapies <i>Duavee</i> (bazedoxifene and estrogens), <i>Premarin</i> (conjugated estrogens) and <i>Prempro</i> (conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate). The company has an NDA pending with the FDA for <i>Viviant</i> (bazedoxifene) to treat osteoporosis and it is investigating rhBMP-2/CPM (dibotermin alfa) in a Phase II osteoporosis study in partnership with Bioventus LLC. </p> <p> With no contraceptives or treatments for specific conditions like uterine fibroids and amenorrhea in Pfizer's portfolio, there is little overlap with Allergan's women's health business with the exception of hormone replacement therapies. Combined, the companies could cover a wide swath of women's health, handing over Allergan's market-leading position to Pfizer in a market with few players &ndash; pharma or otherwise. </p> <p> <b>More Antibiotics For Infectious Disease Portfolio</b> </p> <p> Allergan's infectious disease portfolio mainly consists of antibiotics: <i>Avycaz</i> (ceftazidime-avibactam), <i>Dalvance</i> (dalbavancin), <i>Pylera</i> (bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole and tetracycline) and <i>Teflaro</i> (ceftaroline fosamil). The company has ongoing Phase III clinical trials for Avycaz in hospital-acquired pneumonia, Dalvance in community-acquired pneumonia, and Teflaro-avibactam for skin infections. Allergan also is developing the antifungal agent albaconazole. </p> <p> Pfizer's infectious disease platform, on the other hand is quite diverse, led by the <i>Prevnar</i> vaccines, which generated $1.6bn in worldwide third quarter sales &ndash; up 44% from $1.1bn a year earlier. </p> <p> The big pharma's other commercial infectious disease products include the HIV/AIDS drugs <i>Epzicom</i> (abacavir and lamivudine), <i>Lexiva</i> (fosamprenavir), <i>Rescriptor</i> (delavirdine), <i>Selzentry</i> (maraviroc), <i>Tivicay</i> (dolutegravir), <i>Triumeq</i> (abacavir; dolutegravir; lamivudine), <i>Trizivir</i> (abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine) and <i>Viracept</i> (nelfinavir mesylate), all of which are marketed by ViiV Healthcare, Pfizer's six-year-old partnership in which GlaxoSmithKline holds an 85% share. </p> <p> Other Pfizer infectious disease drugs include the antifungal <i>Eraxis</i> (anidulafungin); the antibiotics <i>Synercid</i> (quinupristin and dalfopristin), <i>Tygacil</i> (tigecycline), <i>Zmax</i> (azithromycin) and <i>Zyvox</i> (linezolid); the <i>FluMist</i> seasonal influenza vaccine (as a partner with AstraZeneca plc); and the meningococcal vaccine <i>Trumenba</i>. </p> <p> <b>Other Major Areas Of Growth</b> </p> <p> Allergan also claims to hold the top spot in terms of global sales in dermatology and aesthetics with $2.1bn in 2015 revenue through the third quarter of this year, as well as a number two spot in eye care with $3bn in sales, and a number 3 spot in gastrointestinal diseases with $1.2bn in sales. The three categories are characterized by several marketed therapies and pipeline candidates, including: </p> <p> 1)Before and after its <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111">$66bn acquisition by Actavis</a>, Allergan probably was best known for Botox cosmetic, which is used primarily to treat wrinkles around the eyes. If Pfizer buys Allergan, the blockbuster wrinkle-reducer and migraine treatment with roughly $2bn in annual sales would be the larger pharma company's first aesthetic drug product. And the aesthetic market, Allergan noted during its R&amp;D Day, is expected to double by 2020. </p> <p> <i>Latisse</i> (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%) for eyelash growth is another legacy Allergan aesthetic product, and the new Allergan bought the double chin treatment <i>Kybella</i> (deoxycholic acid) via the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Allergan-Uses-Its-Cash-For-Kythera-359794">recent $2.1bn acquisition</a> of Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc. in July. </p> <p> &quot;The goal for Kybella is to very much build it like Botox was built,&quot; Saunders told <i>Scrip</i>, with multiple indications turning the single product into a pipeline of fat-reducing treatments. Allergan is targeting fat under and behind the arm, around the knee and on the hips (love handles) for aesthetic purposes, with therapeutic indications that may include lipoma, HIV lipodystrophy buffalo hump, obstructive sleep apnea and familial lipomatosis. </p> <p> 2) The blockbuster dry eye therapy <i>Restasis</i> (cyclosporine) leads Allergan's ophthalmology portfolio, which includes 13 approved products and 17 pipeline programs. Other top-sellers are the glaucoma treatments <i>Alphagan</i> (brimonidine tartrate 0.1% or 0.15%), <i>Combigan</i> (brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate 0.2% or 0.5%) and Lumigan (<i>bimatoprost</i> 0.01%). </p> <p> The ophthalmology pipeline includes the Phase III assets abicipar pegol for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and bimatoprost sustained release for glaucoma as well as the Phase II Restasis X program &ndash; a product candidate in development to <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Strike-three-Allergan-slides-on-potential-Restasis-generics-344392">protect Allergan's dry eye franchise</a>. The company submitted an application for FDA approval of a multi-use, preservative-free, single-bottle formulation of Restasis, which has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date in March. </p> <p> The long-delayed abicipar pegol program recently entered Phase III with data from two clinical trials expected in mid to late 2017 with commercialization of the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/DARPin-delay-drops-Allergan-despite-earnings-rise-342737">long-acting VEGF inhibitor</a> targeted for 2020, Nicholson told <i>Scrip</i>. </p> <p> Pfizer has just two commercial ophthalmology products and three in development, including <i>Besivance</i> (besifloxacin 0.6%) for bacterial conjunctivitis and <i>Macugen</i> (pegaptinib sodium) for wet AMD, which are partnered with Allergan rival Valeant Pharmaceutical International's Bausch &amp; Lomb subsidiary. </p> <p> Allergan noted at its R&amp;D Day that it has a 57% share of the ophthalmology pharma market, while Novartis AG has 35%, Valeant has 4% and Pfizer has 2%. The company has five out of six ophthalmology segments covered, except for the retina, which would change with approval of abicipar. </p> <p> 3)Allergan's gastrointestinal (GI) portfolio is led by <i>Linzess</i> (linaclotide) for IBS with constipation (IBS-C), but the company expects <i>Viberzi</i> for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) &ndash; purchased via the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-gaining-relevant-GI-position-with-Furiex-buy-351489">acquisition of Furiex Pharmaceuticals</a> for up to $1.46bn &ndash; to be a fast-rising star. The drug was approved in the US in May and its commercial launch is expected in late 2015 following controlled substance scheduling by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). </p> <p> With blockbuster expectations for Viberzi, Allergan is preparing a massive launch later this year, including direct-to-consumer advertising, so that &quot;promotionally, this will be the largest launch ever in the GI space,&quot; Meury said during the company's R&amp;D Day. </p> <p> Allergan's pipeline GI programs include new indications and formulations for Linzess and the Phase IIb drug candidate relamorelin for diabetic gastroparesis, which hasn't had a new treatment for 30 years. The company has high hopes for relamorelin, a ghrelin agonist, given the unmet need and Phase IIa results that show a 60% improvement versus placebo in vomiting symptoms. Allergan paid $40m up front for rights to the drug and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Deals-from-Five-PrimeGSK-ActavisRhythm-ApricusForendo-a-DARPA-collaboration-and-IPO-news-354667">has an option to acquire its developer</a>, Rhythm Health. </p> <p> Pfizer has no approved brand-name GI drugs, but the company has four Phase I and II candidates in development for Crohn's disease. </p> <p> In total, Deutsche Bank analysts project $23.6bn in total revenue for Allergan in 2020, which would boost Pfizer's revenue by 50% based on the investment bank's forecast of $57.6bn in sales by 2020. </p>
