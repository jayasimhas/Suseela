<p>Allergan&rsquo;s Botox (botulinum toxin type A) has received a positive opinion from the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; which is acting as the reference state in the European mutual recognition procedure for the treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) in adult patients who have not responded to, or are intolerant of, anticholinergic medications. </p><p>The positive opinion from the Irish Medicines Board is a step for Allergen towards securing national licenses in the 14 European countries involved in the Mutual Recognition Procedure. The thirteen other countries involved are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxemburg, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. </p><p>The recommendation is based on the results of two randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, Phase III trials (the EMBARK studies) involving more than 1,100 patients.</p><p>OAB is common in Europe with studies indicating the condition effects up to 16.6% of the population. The precise cause in often unknown but OAB can be caused by events, such as injury to the brain or spinal cord, a neurologic disease such as multiple sclerosis or degenerative processes of aging.</p><p>Douglas Ingram, Allergan&rsquo;s president for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, said the recommendation marked a &ldquo;critical milestone&rdquo; for the Irvine, California-based company. </p><p>He said Allergan&rsquo;s next task is to &ldquo;work closely with the national health authorities in Europe to secure the relevant licenses&rdquo; for Botox. </p>
