<p>Barely three years old, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is the European Medicine Agency's new kid on the block. The PRAC, according to its chair Dr June Raine, is a "clear voice for public health" that will only get louder as companies and regulators increasingly focus on providing earlier access to medicines and demand for real life data grows. Dr Raine talks to <i>Scrip</i> about the PRAC's role in risk management, adaptive pathways, data gathering and the voice of the patient.</p><p>The PRAC was created in 2012 as a central component of the new pharmacovigilance legislation, generally agreed to be the biggest change to pharmaceutical regulation in Europe since the EMA was created in 1995. Not only is the committee responsible for detecting, assessing, minimizing and communicating the risk of adverse events related to a drug, it also has to weigh up therapeutic benefits of the drug against its risks. Dr Raine, who qualified in medicine at Oxford University, is also is director for vigilance and risk management at the UK regulator, the MHRA. She was a member of the Pharmacovigilance Working Party, which the PRAC replaced in July 2012. </p><p>If you aren't familiar with the work of the PRAC, it's likely that you soon will be. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulators are already responding to patient demand for quicker access to medicines, for example through the UK's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-UK-patients-to-get-Mercks-Keytruda-after-landmark-early-access-decision-357232" target="_new">Early Access to Medicines Scheme</a> and through the EMA's adaptive pathways approach. As such, pharmacovigilance and risk management, and therefore the PRAC, are set to assume even greater importance. </p><p>The committee will indeed play an important role in the adaptive pathways project, which aims to bring new medicines at an earlier stage backed by limited data to an initially small pool of patients. As the evidence grows, so too should the patient population, and the drug's licence will be adapted accordingly. The PRAC is following the pilot scheme closely and is ready to dive in, says Dr Raine. In practice, she expects that the PRAC will sit at the table with other committees to advise companies on risk management and data gathering. It will also help develop pharmacovigilance tools that will help gather real time data.</p><p>Beyond adaptive pathways, Dr Raine predicts that real time data will be in great demand more widely. "No one wants to wait for safety knowledge, we should be talking real time." Getting those data and making sure they are of the highest quality will be a challenge. But the foundations and infrastructure for doing so are already in place, so the reality may not be too far off, assures Dr Raine. </p><p>For example, the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENcEPP), set up in 2006, already has wide access to a number of data sources and its affiliated researchers are well versed in risk management. There is also EudraVigilance, EU's data processing network and management system for reporting and evaluating ADRs during drug development and post marketing. </p><p>EudraVigilance is an "enormously powerful tool" that delivers rapid signal detection from a population of 500 million, says Dr Raine. "The risk factors and sub analyses that can be done are hugely important," she adds. In addition, patient registries will play a big role in data gathering and the EMA is spearheading an initiative to drive EU collaboration on patient registries to allow for the collection and analysis of data. "An ability to understand real time data from that infrastructure is in reach, there will be challenges, but I have no doubt we will deliver it," says Dr Raine. Real time data has been almost a reality in some arenas, like in the case of pandemic vaccines, which were subject to weekly signal detection, she points out.</p><p>It's not just data that is important to the PRAC's decision making. Patient views are "integral to the way the PRAC works," says Dr Raine, and she expects patients and public engagement to be an increasingly big part of pharmacovigilance and risk management. </p><p>Patient views are crucial to working out what level of risk is acceptable and healthcare professionals and regulators are sometimes surprised by the levels of risk that patients are prepared to accept, according to Dr Raine. "This is why we need the patient voice in every decision we take. Already two "very active" patient members sit on the PRAC, patients are consulted during reviews, and the committee regularly consults the EMA's patients and consumers working party (PCWP).</p><p>Patients are also helping the PRAC to "sense-check" the advice and information issued to patients about medicines by looking over the materials the EMA puts out. The committee recently introduced a "patient reminder card" to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw with some bisphosphonate medicines and denosumab. The card tells patients about the risk of osteonecrosis associated with the drug and the benefits of treatment, among other things. "Every aspect of the card was designed by patients for patients," says Dr Raine.</p><p>Patient involvement can go a lot further, says Dr Raine. Public hearings at the PRAC are the next step, and the committee is working with the EMA to make sure these hearings are meaningful, and not just a token exercise. "We want to understand questions such as what is an acceptable risk? How do you stop the burden of risk minimization falling on the patient?" As yet there is no set date for introducing public hearings, but this is expected later this year.</p><h2>Risk minimization and older drugs</h2><p>Much of the PRAC's work has so far focused on reviewing older drugs, many of which were approved nationally. Assessing safety signals from products that have been in use for decades was never going to be easy. For a start, explains Dr Raine, the committee looks at a drug's risks in the context of its benefits, but older clinical trials do not necessarily meet today's expected standards. In addition, the committee must reach a consensus on the benefit-risk balance across many culturally diverse member states with different approaches to medical care and different product ranges. Doing so has proved one of the PRAC's biggest achievements, Dr Raine says.</p><p>Dr Raine points to the 2013 review by the PRAC of hormonal contraceptives, undertaken after France raised concerns relating to venous thromboembolism. The committee's achievement was not only its assessment of masses of data connected to nine progestogens, but maintaining confidence among the public and avoiding panic among the general public, she says. </p><p>To help avoid such concerns further down the line, pharma companies need to get advice on risk management as soon as they can, says Dr Raine. The PRAC is keen to open up opportunities for companies to do this as part of a "one stop shop" in conjunction with other EMA committees, for example with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and the scientific advice working party. This should help companies plan ahead and prepare regulators for dealing with potentially important or complex clinical data that will help judge whether benefit risk is well balanced in clinical use, she says.</p><p>Dr Raine also advises companies to think carefully about their risk management plans. They should focus on areas where knowledge is lacking, plan studies carefully with the right expertise, set clear goals for risk minimization, and properly understand the data sources available. </p><p>Underlying everything the PRAC does, and the resulting procedures and obligations imposed on companies, is its commitment to public health, emphasizes Dr Raine. She is keen to make sure that the PRAC has a tangible benefit for public health and work is underway to measure its impact. "A range of data shows that up to two thirds of adverse drug reactions are preventable &#8230; we hope that in five years we will have a measurable effect on harm," she says.</p><p>
