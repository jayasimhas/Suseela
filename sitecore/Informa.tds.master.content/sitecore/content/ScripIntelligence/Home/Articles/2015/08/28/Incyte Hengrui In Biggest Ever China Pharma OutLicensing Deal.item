<p>In an alliance that illustrates the growing attractiveness of rising innovative R&D capabilities at selected Chinese pharma firms, the US oncology-focused company Incyte Corp. has acquired development and commercialization rights in most global markets to SHR-1210, a PD-1-targeting antibody developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd. </p><p>The deal is worth $25m up front and up to $770m in milestone fees, plus tiered royalties. Hengrui retains rights in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as part of the agreement, which comprises total potential milestones of $90m for regulatory approvals, $530m for commercial performance and $150m for clinical superiority.</p><p>Each company will separately finance all costs associated with the development and commercialization of SHR-1210 in their respective territories.</p><p>"This is the largest ever out-licensing deal for a China-based pharma company," Hengrui's head of global business development Mike Liu told <i>Scrip</i> affiliate <i>PharmAsia News</i> from New Jersey, where the firm has a small US operation.</p><p>Other major licensing-out deals involving Chinese companies have typically involved upfront payments of around $20m and been valued in total at around the $200m mark, he noted.</p><p>"Things actually moved very quickly and it took us about four months from our first meeting [with Incyte] to doing the deal. This showed the strong commitment from both sides, and the fact we want to work together and learn from each other," Liu said.</p><p>Wilmington, Delaware-based Incyte previously lacked a candidate in the PD-1 arena, which along with the PD-L1 ligand have emerged as major immuno-oncology targets given their broad expression and the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in enhancing T-cell response.</p><p>This appeared to please investors, who drove up Incyte's shares by around 7% after the deal to close at a record high of $123.38, despite the already intense and rising competition in the PD-1 field.</p><p><b>Deal Attractions</b></p><p>Incyte's pipeline now focuses mainly on JAK1/2, c-MET and IDO1 targets, and the addition of SHR-1210 to the early stage portfolio "reinforces our commitment to cancer patients and further diversifies our clinical development programs," Incyte president and CEO Herv√© Hoppenot said in a statement.</p><p>Piaoyang Sun, chairman of Hengrui, also described the molecule as an "excellent fit" for Incyte, noting both partners' commitment to the principle of cancer immunotherapy, a view that was echoed by Liu.</p><p>SHR-1210 "was very attractive to Incyte as they had no candidate in the PD-1 area and given the big sales forecasts for the class," he said, noting that potential combination use with the US firm's pipeline, including the IDO1 inhibitors, was one draw for the partnership.</p><p>Following the US launch of Merck & Co.'s first-in-class drug <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab) last year for melanoma, commercial and research competition in the PD-1/PD-L1 areas is intensifying rapidly, with other potential indications including non-small cell lung, bladder, gastric, head and neck, and breast cancer all in trials. </p><p>Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database shows a lengthy list of PD-1/PD-L1 projects in development, including five monoclonal antibodies with 14 Phase III clinical trials under way. A desire by firms to "catch up" in the field was a major factor behind the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizers-Read-in-Tokyo-No-AZ-clues-but-PD-L1-draws-explained-355133" target="_new">huge deal between</a>Pfizer Inc. and Merck last year.</p><p><b>Trial Plans</b></p><p>Proof-of-concept clinical studies for SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors are planned "in the coming months," Incyte said. Clinicaltrials.gov shows that an Australian Phase I trial in solid tumor patients failing standard therapies, sponsored by Atridia, is already planned to establish basic safety and efficacy, although not yet open for recruitment.</p><p>Hengrui's Liu explained that this study, initiated by Hengrui, will be transferred to Incyte as part of the deal. In China, an investigational new drug (IND) application was filed last December to allow the start of local trials and is pending approval.</p><p>Likely specific indications for SHR-1210 have yet to be decided, but the executive pointed to the broad clinical applications of PD-1 molecules, describing these as "powerful tools against multiple solid tumors."</p><p><b>Strategic Context</b></p><p>Hengrui, a Lianyungang, Jiangsu province-based manufacturer and distributor of active ingredients and finished products, has annual sales of around $1.2bn and a focus on cancer, with an R&D spend of about 10% of annual turnover, relatively high for a Chinese pharma firm. It is already working on various other oncology targets including Bruton's tyrosine and mutated B-Raf kinases.</p><p>The firm has been active in international transactions recently, licensing in its first drug candidate from overseas in a deal with Tesaro Inc. for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/PharmAsia-News-Business-Bulletin-359955" target="_new">Chinese rights to rolapitant</a>, an NK-1 antagonist for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Hengrui, which set up a unit called Eternity Bioscience in the US in 2009 to look for partnership opportunities, is looking to further develop its original R&D and to expand into more overseas markets, Liu stressed.</p><p>"We absolutely plan to do more licensing out deals in the future, which have a big upside," he declared. "We currently have around 20 innovative projects at the IND stage in China, including an HER2 inhibitor that we are progressing outside the country."</p><p>Apatinib, a small molecule VEGF-2 inhibitor, was commercialized in China late last year for advanced gastric cancer.</p><p>These steps all form part of Hengrui's wider plan to expand from small molecule generics into innovative and biosimilar biologics using a combination of in-house and external expertise and partnerships, Liu explained.</p><p>"This shift has only taken us around four years and we now have multiple innovative programs moving to INDs. We have invested around $130m in biologic manufacturing capability in China and now have adequate capacity for clinical trials," he noted.</p><p>More broadly, Liu added, Hengrui also sees the Incyte deal as "encouraging for other companies in China and supportive of the government's policy of fostering innovation."</p><p><p>This article is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmaAsia News</a>.
