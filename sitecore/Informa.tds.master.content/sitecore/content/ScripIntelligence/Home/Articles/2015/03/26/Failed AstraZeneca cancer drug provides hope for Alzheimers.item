<p>A drug that AstraZeneca had pursued as a treatment for cancer &ndash; only to see it fail in mid-stage development &ndash; has provided new hope as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease, Yale University researchers, supported by a program from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), reported.</p><p>New data of the drug, known as saracatinib (AZD0530), a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown it restored memory loss and reversed brain problems in mouse models of Alzheimer's &ndash; results NIH Director Dr Francis Collins called "substantial."</p><p>Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat-Maryland), the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, who was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Departing-NIH-advocate-Mikulski-Im-not-done-yet-357610" target="_new">visiting the NIH's $30m laboratory</a> run by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) on 31 March to help promote her legislation to boost the agency&rsquo;s funding, said the saracatinib results were "stunning."</p><p>She noted that her own father died of the consequences of Alzheimer's &ndash; a disease that affects about 40 million people worldwide, 5 million of whom are Americans.</p><p>"I've been working on a bipartisan basis to find ways to advance a breakthrough for it," Senator Mikulski told reporters. &ldquo;And to hear this today brings literally a great deal of emotion."</p><p>But the discovery about saracatinib&rsquo;s potential in Alzheimer's may never have been made had AstraZeneca not given up on the drug in cancer.</p><p>The company initially had developed saracatinib as a treatment for breast and pancreatic cancers and other solid tumors.</p><p>AstraZeneca had high hopes for the drug &ndash; declaring in October 2004 that saracatinib had the potential to have a "significant impact on the treatment of cancer and has a range of potential therapeutic benefits, including: an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent; use in combination treatments with other novel agents, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy; and in the treatment of leukemia and metastatic bone disease." </p><p>Early testing of saracatinib showed it had good tolerability and oral bioavailability.</p><p>But Phase II trials of the drug as a single agent in solid tumors showed it had limited benefit. </p><p>So AstraZeneca shelved saracatinib.</p><p>In 2012, however, when NCATS said it was establishing a program to study new uses of drugs that had been tested in humans but abandoned for one reason or another &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-industry-venture-taps-crowdsourcing-for-teaching-old-drugs-new-tricks-330136" target="_new">Discovering New Therapeutics Uses for Existing Molecules</a> program &ndash; AstraZeneca immediately climbed on board and offered up three of its sidelined agents, one of which was saracatinib. </p><p>Pfizer and Lilly also joined in, and a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-big-pharmas-join-NCATS-project-to-dust-off-shelved-drugs-331710" target="_new">month later</a>, so did Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen and Sanofi, with the firms making about 60 compounds initially available.</p><p>The idea behind the New Therapeutics Uses program, said NCATS chief Dr Christopher Austin, was to have a sort of "Match.com" to bring together academic investigators with compounds no longer being developed by biopharmaceutical companies and rescue those medicines for new uses, or repurposing.</p><p>Dr Collins likened the program to crowdsourcing &ndash; a concept in which ideas and assets are contributed by a large group of people or organizations. </p><p>What's contributing to the program's success, Dr Austin told reporters, is the streamlined approach NCATS used to work out the legal and administrative details between companies and researchers &ndash; "shortening the time these negotiations take by 90%."</p><p><b>The Fyn hypothesis</b></p><p>About the same time NCATS launched the New Therapeutics Uses program, Dr Stephen Strittmatter and his colleagues at Yale discovered that the Fyn kinase plays a central role in how amyloid beta clusters damage brain cells, Dr Collins explained. </p><p>So the Yale scientists wanted to see if blocking Fyn could prevent or delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>They heard about saracatinib being one of the drugs in the NCATS program, Dr Collins said, so the scientists applied for one of the agency's grants to explore their hypothesis using the AstraZeneca drug &ndash; winning the funds and access to the agent in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-invests-millions-to-unlock-cupboards-of-shelved-drugs-344190" target="_new">June 2013</a>.</p><p>In the animal study, the Yale team administered saracatinib to mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, such as memory loss and age-related buildup of abnormal amyloid beta clusters &ndash; which damage and ultimately kill brain cells and lead to loss of synapses, which are the spaces where memories are formed &ndash; modeling the development of the disease in humans. </p><p>Dr Strittmatter and his colleagues then tested the ability of the mice to do a variety of things, like go through a maze or find a platform when they were swimming &ndash; "the usual way we test brain function in mice," Dr Collins said.</p><p>After four weeks of treatment with saracatinib, to Dr Strittmatter's "great delight and ours," the drug showed "substantial benefit in that mouse model," Dr Collins said.</p><p>Indeed, there was a complete reversal of spatial learning and memory loss in the mice. And when the scientists examined the brains of the mice, they found the characteristic synapse loss had been fully restored, providing a biological explanation for the memory improvement. </p><p>The treatment also reduced several other Alzheimer&rsquo;s-related biochemical changes in the mice and did not appear to be toxic.</p><p>"We don't know if this is going to be the answer that we often dream for," Dr Collins said. "But it's a truly exciting development, and it comes out of this whole idea of repurposing compounds, for which a lot of investment has already been made and put them into this use &ndash; cutting many years and hundreds of millions of dollars off the effort."</p><p>He said the Yale researchers already have completed a Phase Ib multiple ascending dose safety trial of saracatinib in 24 people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.</p><p>The Yale team said the trial was successful and would report those saracatinib results at a later date.</p><p>But they are now enrolling more patients in a larger, multisite Phase IIa trial to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of saracatinib, Dr Collins said. </p><p>The Phase IIa study is planning to enroll 152 participants, who will receive saracatinib or placebo for one year.</p><p>Results of that study are expected in about two years. </p><p>Under the agreement AstraZeneca signed with Dr Strittmatter and his team, the London-based company has the first option to license the scientists' new intellectual property arising out of the research, Dr Christine Colvis, director of the NCATS New Therapeutics Uses program, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>AstraZeneca can decide if it wants to advance the agent through further clinical studies, and if successful, commercialize it for Alzheimer's &ndash; either on its own or with a licensing partner, she said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
