<p>While the Senate Judiciary Committee made some "good faith efforts" in a bill it adopted late last week to fix the flawed inter partes (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR) proceedings conducted by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the US Patent & Trademark Office (US PTO), the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) on 5 June said lawmakers didn't go far enough. </p><p>"Essential additional reforms are necessary to ensure that the overall PATENT Act reflects an appropriate balance between the interests of those who seek to enforce patent rights and those who are accused of infringement," BIO CEO Jim Greenwood said in a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders of the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee adopted the <i>Protecting American Talent and Entrepreneurship (PATENT) Act</i> in a 16-4 vote. The legislation now goes to the full Senate for consideration.</p><p>The bill, cosponsored by Senators Charles Grassley, Judiciary Committee chairman; Patrick Leahy, the ranking member; and committee members Senators John Cornyn, Chuck Schumer, Orrin Hatch, Amy Klobuchar and Mike Lee; mostly focuses on measures to rein in so-called patent trolls &ndash; entities that acquire patents for the sole purpose of forcing companies to pay licensing fees or settling infringement suits through threats of aggressive litigation.</p><p>But drug makers had been lobbying for lawmakers to make changes to the way the IPRs and PGRs are conducted &ndash; insisting the proceedings have been implemented in a manner that lacks basic due process protections and unfairly prejudices patent owners.</p><p>The post-grant proceedings were established to provide faster and more affordable ways to challenge patents than going through the long and arduous US court system.</p><p>The IPRs, especially, have caught on like wildfire &ndash; with close to 3,000 filed so far &ndash; something US PTO officials have admitted they never expected.</p><p>The PTAB has granted about 75% of petitions, most of which are IPRs, and has found at least some challenged claims unpatentable in over 80% of the final written decisions. </p><p>But Henry Hadad, senior vice president and deputy general counsel of intellectual property at Bristol-Myers Squibb, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMS-Broken-patent-office-proceedings-killing-innovation-358248" target="_new">told lawmakers last month</a> the "one-sided results" of the PTAB proceedings have led to "increasing abuse," including IPR petition filings by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-reform-its-all-about-the-trolls-no-Bass-358182" target="_new">hedge funds that are shorting stock</a> to drive down share prices, by parties primarily seeking to extract a financial settlement from patent holders and by litigants presenting the same or substantially the same arguments that were unsuccessful in federal court.</p><p>Senator Grassley noted during the 4 June markup hearing the language that was included in his "manager's amendment" that deals with amending claims in the US PTO proceedings was a placeholder "because it remains the subject of good faith negotiations." </p><p>"This has been a difficult nut to crack, but I understand that both sides believe that we can reach a compromise that will work," Senator Grassley said. "Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach agreement before today's session, so the placeholder language stands, but I'm committed to getting resolution on this piece as we move to the floor."</p><p>He also emphasized there was a proposal by the life sciences community about the applicability of the US PTO's post-grant proceedings to patents subject to the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act</i> and <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA)</i> processes. </p><p>Mr Grassley said it was "imperative" for lawmakers to hear from all sides, get additional information and data and consult with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over Hatch-Waxman and BPCIA. </p><p>"This is a complex issue that needs to be seriously and responsibly considered, including further review, discussion and vetting," he said. </p><p>Nonetheless, BIO praised the Judiciary Committee for including a provision that would eliminate the US PTO's claim construction standards, which the biotech lobbying group called "misguided" and said unfairly invalidated patents and were inconsistent with the way district courts determined patent validity. </p><p>The trade group also said it was happy with the measures that aim to give patent owners "greater substantive and procedural rights" in the post-grant proceeding and the statutory clarification that the US PTO director has discretion to deny any IPR or PGR petition that is "contrary to the interests of justice." </p><p>But Mr Greenwood said the bill that came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee falls short in other areas.</p><p>"The growing evidence that IPR is a proceeding that is heavily skewed in favor of patent challengers and in which it is far easier to kill patents than in court is encouraging various forms of abusive practices aimed at gaming the differential standards between the two systems," he argued. "It also is undermining the confidence of biotechnology investors and businesses who must be able to rely on the government's issuance of patent rights to justify the massive investment, over a decade or more, in developing the next generation of innovations to help heal, fuel and feed the world."</p><p>The most effective way to prevent gamesmanship and abuse of the IPR system, Mr Greenwood contended, is by reducing concurrent, duplicative and serial proceedings in the US PTO and the courts and by ensuring the evidentiary standards used by the PTAB are the same as those used in the courts so there is no systematic legal advantage in one forum over the other. </p><p>The version of the PATENT Act adopted by the Judiciary Committee, however, would not resolve those issues, he charged.</p><p>Mr Greenwood said BIO was encouraging the lawmakers to consider "other meaningful" approaches that could be taken to minimize the incentives that are leading to abusive practices, particularly with respect to patents covering approved drug and biologics "subject to unique and highly detailed statutory regimes" governing patent dispute resolution and litigation. </p><p>"It is essential that the PATENT Act seek to preserve the integrity of these carefully balanced, congressionally created processes," he said. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
