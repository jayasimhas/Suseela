<p><b>During the ten years Thomas Lönngren was executive director of the EMA, there was a massive expansion in the scope and reach of the agency. Now, he says, it&rsquo;s time for a major rethink on some fundamental issues</b>.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency is today one of the world's leading regulatory agencies and it should be deservedly congratulated and commended for its achievements in public health during its 20-year history. I had the honour and privilege of leading this agency for ten of those 20 years. Over that time, the agency massively expanded its scope and reach, integrating 13 new member states, as well as introducing several new legislative reforms with the aim of helping new, safe medicines reach much-needed patients across the EU. </p><p>Some of the most important reforms introduced during that time included: the orphan drug legislation, with the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products; the new paediatrics legislation and Paediatric Committee; and the advanced therapy legislation alongside the formation of the Committee for Advanced Therapies. Towards the latter stage of my 10-year tenure, the new pharmacovigilance legislation was introduced, which established the EMA&rsquo;s seventh scientific committee, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee.</p><p>To manage this expansion of new reforms, we instigated the "EMA Roadmap", a tool that became a fundamental way of enabling future planning and cross-boarder consensus on the direction of the agency from member states, the European Parliament, the European Commission, as well as from the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>The roadmap directed how the European regulatory system would support public health by introducing concepts such as regulatory science, adaptive licensing, benefit-risk methodology and other initiatives to strengthen the scientific aspects of the work of the agency. It also established links between the health technology bodies to encourage greater information sharing as well as introducing the concept of parallel regulatory/health technology assessment scientific advice, designed to guide pharmaceutical companies on their drug development programmes. </p><p>High on the agenda during this time was also fostering stronger collaboration with regulatory agencies across the world. This enabled us in 2001 to form an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration to share information and form closer ties in everyday working. This has now developed into a very successful collaboration, encouraging similar agreements to be extended to many more regulatory agencies around the world, reflecting the globalisation of the pharmaceutical sector. </p><h2>Threats and opportunities</h2><p>The EMA and the EU regulatory system today stand on a well-established platform. The environment is changing, however, which has consequences for the future operation of the system and the agency. Looking forward I can see both threats and opportunities. </p><p>One threat regards the supply of expertise and committee members that carry out the scientific work of the agency. Today, this is based on a partly &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; contribution from member state regulatory agencies. This challenge arises where the member states cut down or change their priorities, resulting in a reduced contribution to the EU system. There is a risk that experienced assessors needed for the work of the agency will not be available in order to keep up the highest scientific standard of the system. I believe there is an urgent need to look over the organisation and the financing of the system in this respect.</p><p>Another concern I have relates to the wider picture of drug regulation, and more specifically the approval process of new medicines. We still deal with this as a vertical process, isolated from the rest of the healthcare system, focusing purely on safety, quality and efficacy, and neglecting the bigger picture of real world clinical value. It is well documented that regulatory approval, in most cases, does not indicate the true value a product will have in clinical practice. We therefore need to bring regulatory and value assessment of new medicines together, cutting the duplication that each member state creates in evaluating the value of new medicines. The present system is counterproductive, creating uncertainty on how to develop medicines, increasing the cost of development and inefficiency and delaying new and valuable medicines in reaching patients. It is now time and a good opportunity to review the entire approval process, to move it from a &ldquo;vertical one size fits all&rdquo;, to a tailored, more healthcare integrated approach to approving new medicines.</p><p>This is further compounded by the fact that the cost of new medicines coming to the market has reached unprecedented levels, which is completely unsustainable. Neither the EU member states&rsquo; healthcare systems nor the patient can bear the full cost of equal access to new medicines.</p><p>Changing the regulatory system alone will not solve this challenge, but if we get it right it will substantially contribute to improvements that will result in valuable medicines getting to patients much faster and more cost effectively.</p><p><i>Thomas Lönngren was executive director of the European Medicines Agency from January 2001 to December 2010. Dr Lönngren is currently a strategic adviser to the NDA consultancy group and is a director of Pharma Executive Consulting, in which role he offers strategic advice to the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector, specifically in the area of health technology assessment and regulatory science</i>.</p><p><i>This article is part of a series that Scrip Intelligence and its sister publication Scrip Regulatory Affairs are publishing to mark the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency. Over the next couple of weeks, in the run-up to the invitation-only scientific conference that the EMA is holding to mark the anniversary in London on 18 March, you'll be able to read what key individuals and stakeholders in the European pharmaceutical regulatory network have to say about the challenges the EMA and the regulatory network are facing and where they are headed as the agency moves into its third decade. </i></p><p><b><i>Previously in the series</i></b><i>: "The EMA at 20: Fernand Sauer reviews the first two decades and offers advice for regulators at all levels" (</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Fernand-Sauer-reviews-the-first-two-decades-and-offers-advice-for-regulators-at-all-levels-357045" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a><i>, 3 March 2014).</i></p>
