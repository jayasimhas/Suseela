<p>Shares of Eagle Pharmaceuticals soared over 25% on 17 February on word the company had not only kissed and made up with Teva and its subsidiary Cephalon, but had in fact inked a deal involving a rapid infusion form of bendamustine.</p><p>Under the terms of the deal, Eagle is expected to receive an up-front cash payment of $30m and is eligible to receive up to $90m in additional milestones from Teva. </p><p>Eagle also is eligible to receive double-digit royalties on net sales of the product, assuming the FDA approves the firm's bendamustine product. </p><p>Teva and Cephalon market the brand-name bendamustine, known as Treanda, an alkylating drug, which is indicated in the US as a treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). </p><p>But when Eagle developed a rapid infusion form of the drug, known as EP-3102, and sought to gain the FDA's approval, the firm ended up in a patent infringement dispute with Cephalon over patent, 8,791,270. </p><p>As part of its agreement, Teva is waiving its orphan drug exclusivities for the NHL and CLL indications, which should allow EP-3102 to come to market more quickly. </p><p>The companies said they also are settling the pending patent infringement action between them involving patent 8,791,270.</p><p>Given Teva's "strong presence and unsurpassed knowledge" of the CLL and NHL market, Eagle CEO Scott Tarriff said there was "no better company" than the Israeli firm to optimize the market potential of EP-3102. </p><p>Eagle's new drug application (NDA) for EP-3102 in CLL and indolent B-cell NHL, which is currently before the FDA, is backed by data from its recently completed trials demonstrating the rapid infusion bendamustine can be administered in 10 minutes in a low-volume 50mL admixture, versus a 500mL admixture in the 60-minute infusion required for Treanda.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
