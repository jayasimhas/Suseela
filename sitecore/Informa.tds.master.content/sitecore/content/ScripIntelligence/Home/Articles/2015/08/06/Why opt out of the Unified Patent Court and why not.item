<p><b>Patent proprietors will have the ability to opt their patents out of the Unified Patent Court, but before doing so they should weigh up factors such as the value of the patent and the costs involved, Paul England explains in the latest of his series on Europe's future patent system.</b></p><p>As explained in the last article in this series, classical European patents may be opted out from the Unified Patent Court (UPC), which could be up and running in about two years' time. But should the opt-out be used? This is a strategic question, and one that requires careful consideration of a number of issues.</p><p>A successful European patent infringement or revocation action in the UPC will take effect in multiple EU member states (including the UK, France and Germany). The scope of such decisions is therefore much greater than the decisions of member state courts, which are only national in application. </p><p>With such large markets potentially affected, the risk-to-reward calculation in a UPC action is very significant. To address this, many have suggested a "safety first" approach of opting out those patents that have particular commercial significance, but which might be most vulnerable to validity attack. The rationale is that a third party who wishes to revoke the European patent is then forced to do so in parallel proceedings in the relevant national courts. This spreads the patentee&rsquo;s risk: they may achieve both wins and losses in the national courts, but they do not risk losing protection in all territories in one adverse revocation decision of the UPC. </p><p>This approach is not without risks of its own. Patentees who like the prospect of pan-European enforcement in the UPC should be cautious about presuming that they can opt out, wait and then withdraw the opt-out when enforcement becomes necessary. This is because, in the meantime, if a revocation action is started by a third party against the opted-out patent in a national court, the right to withdraw the opt-out is permanently barred and the pan-European enforcement power is lost. </p><p>Proprietors considering an opt-out might also consider whether opting out some patent families, but not others, could highlight to competitors those that the patentee thinks have relatively weak validity. A patentee might respond that it is reasonable to opt out the most important patents in a portfolio while the UPC is still being tested in its early years. Indeed, concern has been expressed about how effectively the new court will work and the inevitable "teething troubles" that it will encounter. </p><p>Doubts are also sometimes expressed about the standard of decision-making that can be expected from the divisions of the UPC, although it is possible that the eventual appearance of well-known and trusted names in the UPC's pool of judges will do much to allay many of these concerns.</p><p>Cost is also important. An enforcement or revocation action in the UPC avoids the need for parallel national actions concerning the same patent, between the same parties. The potential cost of a UPC action must therefore be weighed against the court fees, legal fees and associated management costs for a party bringing multiple actions.</p><p>Ultimately, decisions on opting out many classical European patents will need to be made on a case-by-case basis according to the strength and commercial value of the patent concerned, and with potential costs in mind. This is a difficult process that will take time and resources. With indications that the UPC could be operational in 2017, it is best that patent proprietors begin this process soon.</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at international law firm Taylor Wessing LLP</i>.</p>
