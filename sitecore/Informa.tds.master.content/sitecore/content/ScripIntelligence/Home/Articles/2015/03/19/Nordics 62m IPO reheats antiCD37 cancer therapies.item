<p>In the biggest life science initial public offering on a European exchange since November 2014, Nordic Nanovector grossed NOK 500m ($62.3m) from its IPO on the Oslo stock exchange on 23 March 2015. The company raised 20% more than it had originally planned, allowing it now to reach comfortably beyond the first regulatory submission for its lead product Betalutin (177Lu-tetulomab) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The IPO also potentially breathes new life into an old blood cancer target, CD37.</p><p>"We were originally aiming to raise NOK 400m to support execution of the clinical program until Q2 2018," Nordic Nanovector's CEO, Luigi Costa, told <i>Scrip</i>. "However, the offer was oversubscribed multiple times, so the deal was upgraded to NOK 500m." Around 65-70% of the funds raised will be used to move Betalutin through clinical development, principally in advanced forms of NHL such as follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. </p><p>The flotation approximately doubles the market valuation of Nordic Nanovector, from around NOK 500m ($85m) in June 2014 when it undertook the first of two private placements to NOK 1350m ($167m) now. (The US dollar has risen sharply against the Norwegian Krone since June last year.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the upgraded IPO means the company can adapt its strategy and compete directly with other fully funded players in NHL: "We can implement our strategy fully, and be completely independent," Mr Costa said. Previously, in June 2014, Nordic Nanovector's former CEO Jan Alfheim, who remains with the company as Chief Operating Officer, had told <i>Scrip</i> that the company would be looking for an IPO and a strategic partner.</p><p>Three other companies have anti-CD37 compounds in development for NHL or for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or both: Boehringer Ingelheim, Emergent BioSolutions and ImmunoGen. Both BI's and Emergent's molecules (BI 836826 and TRU-016) are unconjugated antibodies, and both are in phase I for CLL and NHL. </p><p>ImmunoGen's IMGN529 and Nordic Nanovector's Betalutin, in contrast, are both antibody conjugates, potentially an important difference given the propensity of CD37 to internalize when complexed with anti-CD37 antibodies. Cellular internalization means prolonged and proximal exposure of CD37-expressing cells to low intensity beta-emitting radionuclides in the case of Betalutin, or the DM-1 toxin (as used in Roche's Herceptin follow-on compound, Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine)) in Immunogen's case. </p><p>At the December 2014 meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), ImmunoGen reported that four patients showed objective responses to IMGN529, out of a set of 24 heavily pretreated efficacy-evaluable patients. </p><p>For Nordic Nanovector, recent results have also been encouraging. According to Luigi Costa, "a strong correlation between internalization of the radionuclide and efficacy" was seen in earlier clinical and preclinical work.</p><p>CD37 is not a newly described target: it was discovered in 1986 but in the last nearly-three decades has been largely superseded in blood cancers because of the success of compounds such as rituxan (rituximab) targeted against CD20. Whereas a search in PubMed on "CD20" reveals nearly 6,000 papers published on CD20 between 2000 and 2010, there were only 41 for "CD37" in the same period.</p><table><h2>Four anti-CD37 antibodies in development* in blood cancers</h2><th><tr><td><p>Compound</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Company</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Development phase</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Notes</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></th><tbody><tr><td><p>BI 836826 (MAb 37.1)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Boehringer Ingelheim</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I, dose escalation trial in relapsed CLL</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Mouse/human chimeric IgG1</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Otlertuzumab (TRU-016)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Emergent BioSolutions</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I and II randomized study with bendamustine in relapsed CLL</p>&nbsp;</td><td tinted="DarkTint"><p>Engineered single-chain monospecific protein with anti-CD37 variable regions; developed by Trubion, part of Emergent since 2010</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>IMGN529</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ImmunoGen</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I/II dose-escalating clinical trial for relapsed NHL </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>DM1 conjugated with antibody</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><sup>177</sup>Lu-tetulomab (Betalutin)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Nordic Nanovector</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Entering Phase II in NHL </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Radionuclide <sup>177</sup>Lu conjugated with antibody</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody><tr><td colspan="4"><p>*IDEC Pharmaceuticals dropped development of 131I-MB-1, antibody-linked radioiodine, despite seeing responses in patients with B cell NHL</p></td></tr></table><p>
