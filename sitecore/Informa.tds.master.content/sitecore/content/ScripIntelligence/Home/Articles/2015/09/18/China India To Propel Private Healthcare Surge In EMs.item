<p>The private healthcare segment in emerging markets (EMs) is forecast to reach $795bn in 2020, nearly twice the size it was in 2013, with hospitals, the largest segment of healthcare spending, being the biggest beneficiary of this trend, according to report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p><p>The EM private hospital market is expected to triple to $240bn by 2020, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16%, driven mainly by China (20% CAGR) and India (16% CAGR), it said.</p><p>It notes that though EM governments are ploughing in funds to improve healthcare infrastructure and meet growing demand, the development of the healthcare sector is still largely dependent on private-sector participation.</p><p>"The private sector is likely to remain the dominant force as EM governments are committed to promoting the development of private healthcare to meet surging demand," the report dated Sep. 8 said.</p><p>An expert closely tracking the healthcare sector in India told <i>Scrip</i> that he expects more private equity investment and initial public offerings (IPOs) in the healthcare space. </p><p>"You will see IPOs happening in the healthcare services segment, probably PEs looking for profitable exits and alongside some hospitals being acquired by large private equity firms. But India is still in the early stage of evolving the healthcare services business model," he told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The Indian super-specialty tertiary care hospitals chain, Narayana Health, and the country's largest cancer care network, HealthCare Global Enterprises, are already among those planning IPOs.</p><p>The EMs healthcare market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 12% over 2014-20 to $1745bn by 2020. While private expenditure contributes nearly 44% of total healthcare expenditures in EMs, it is expected to inch upwards to 46% of the overall pie by 2020. The share of private expenditure is very high in countries such as India, Singapore and South Africa.</p><p>Underscoring why growth is inevitable, the report notes that as populations grow, age and wealth increases, the demand for health services across EMs will continue to rise. By World Bank estimates, EMs are likely to witness one of the highest growth rates (3.7% per annum) in the elderly population (aged over 65), much higher than that in developed world. More than 20% of China's population is expected to be over 65 years of age by 2050 as against 13% in India.</p><p>"The attractive demographics (demand drivers), underdeveloped infrastructure (supply constraints) and willingness to pay for higher quality healthcare are some of the key drivers for the healthcare services industry." </p><h2>China </h2><p>The report notes that the Chinese healthcare industry is undergoing a major transformation as the government pushes forward bold health reforms and seeks increasing participation from the private sector. </p><p>The reforms aim to improve China's medical insurance coverage, establish a more efficient health service system and promote innovation and industrial upgrading. These efforts are expected to help unlock the huge market potential of the healthcare industry in China.</p><p>China's aging population is seen as the primary reason for the expected high growth in demand for medical care. In 2014, China had about 133m people aged over 65 years &ndash; three times that of the US. The UN projects that by 2050 over 360m Chinese will be more than 65 years old, a number that is close to the entire estimated US population. The report also notes the change in disease spectrum &ndash; a marked shift from infectious diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases &ndash; that is expected drive robust medical demand in China. </p><p>However, chronic diseases remain a low priority among China's disease control measures, attracting marginal investment from the government and thus leaving the majority of patients with chronic conditions without effective treatment. Residents in rural regions continue to have limited access to the needed care. </p><p>"We believe the demand for healthcare and pharmaceuticals in China would explode in the next several decades," the report said.</p><p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch says that Chinese government has realized the disparity of health resources allocation and "incapability" of the public sector alone to meet the surging demand for health-related products, and therefore will introduce more private participants in the health service area. </p><p>"The government aims at establishing a more marketized and diversified health service market, by increasing the supply of health services through encouraging private and foreign capital to enter the market, improving efficiency of operations through reform of public hospitals and optimizing medical resources through establishment of a progressive patient care system."</p><p>In the newly designed health system, public hospitals will focus more on basic medical demand while private hospitals are expected to provide more differentiated services such as rehabilitation/pension services as well as premium health services as a supplement. Pricing and payment renovations will be implemented along with the reforms, the report said. </p><p>While China's private hospital segment is underdeveloped within the overall healthcare sector, it also presents the greatest growth opportunity over the next 5-10 years. By 2020, revenues from health services at private hospitals are set to triple to 30% of the total hospital services. China's private hospital market is expected to touch $64bn by 2020, the report said.</p><p>China aims to establish a universal healthcare system by 2020, providing quality and reliable medical services to all urban and rural residents. The government is to continue to increase healthcare spending to 11% of total fiscal spending and 6.5-7% of GDP by 2020 (both currently at around 6%).</p><h2>India</h2><p>The report also highlights how hospital bed penetration in India at 1.3/1,000 population (0.9/1,000 population based on functional beds) is far lower than the global median of 2.5. This, it says, indicates the Indian market is best placed to offer strong structural growth as it would need 2 million more beds over the next decade assuming penetration rises to 2.0.</p><p>India's private hospital market is projected to reach $120bn by 2020 (16% CAGR). The hospitals sector, contributing nearly 70% of total Indian healthcare market, is the largest provider to the $81bn healthcare industry (pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and services) in India. Low share of government spending in healthcare and strong demand trends have propelled increased investment by private players.</p><p>Asked whether more drug firms may, like Sanofi, consider investing in hospital groups, the expert said that multinational firms may perhaps evaluate such models.</p><p>"They want to differentiate themselves from local Indian peers. Instead of treating a particular indication they are talking about how to manage your disease effectively," he said. Last year, the Competition Commission of India cleared Sanofi's proposed plans to acquire 20% per cent of the total equity shareholding and exercise certain rights, in relation to management of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Why-Novo-may-need-to-watch-Sanofis-Indian-sugar-clinics-play-354320" target="_new">Apollo Sugar Clinics</a>, part of India's Apollo Hospitals group. </p><p>The Indian healthcare industry is expected to touch $160bn by 2017 and $280bn by 2020, factoring in an estimated population growth of 1.2% annually and a 15% annual rise in healthcare spending due to changing demographics and rising income levels.</p>
