<p>Following delay after delay, Acadia Pharmaceuticals finally submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the US FDA seeking approval for Nuplazid (pimavanserin) nearly three years after the company reported positive Phase III results in the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP).</p><p>Maybe a new CEO was just the spark that Acadia needed to kick the regulatory approval process into gear. The San Diego-based company promoted Steve Davis from chief financial officer to interim CEO in March after Uli Hacksell stepped down from Acadia's top leadership post. Davis now has been named as the permanent CEO the company revealed alongside its NDA submission announcement on Sept. 3.</p><p>"If approved, Nuplazid would represent a new and distinctly different pharmacological approach to treating psychosis and would be the first drug approved in the United States for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease," Davis said in a statement from Acadia, whose stock closed up 2.8% at $39.13 after trading as high as $43.50 earlier in the day. </p><p>Acadia had a great comeback story in November 2012 when it revealed data from a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Acadia-surges-on-Phase-III-success-at-last-for-pimavanserin-in-Parkinsons-psychosis-337591" target="_new">Phase III clinical trial</a>, which showed Parkinson's patients treated with Nuplazid, a selective serotonin inverse agonist (SSIA) that preferentially targets 5-HT2A receptors, had twice the improvement in psychosis as individuals who received a placebo. Patients benefitted from the drug without side effects associated with antipsychotic medicines that often are prescribed off-label to people with PDP. </p><p>The National Parkinson Foundation estimates that 1m people in the US and 6m people worldwide have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and about 40% of those patients experience psychosis characterized by hallucinations and delusions.</p><p>"Psychosis is the leading cause for Parkinson's patients moving from their homes to nursing homes or other institutions and leads to an increased risk of mortality, a diminished quality of life and significant caregiver burden," Davis noted in Acadia's statement.</p><p>An FDA-approved therapy specifically indicated for PDP could relieve significant health care burdens for patients and their families as well as for payers that must cover specialty care and nursing home costs. That's why the final Phase III results for Nuplazid were a massive victory after the drug failed in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Acadias-pimavanserin-fails-in-Phase-III-for-Parkinsons-related-psychosis-175230" target="_new">two prior Phase III studies</a> in 2009 and 2010. </p><p>Development of Acadia's lead drug candidate eventually received a pair of important endorsements from the FDA. First, the agency said in 2013 that the company <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Acadia-flies-high-on-quicker-path-to-US-approval-342031" target="_new">would not have to complete</a> another Phase III study before submitting its NDA. Second, the FDA granted a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-dubs-Acadia-Parkinsons-drug-Nuplazid-breakthrough-353683" target="_new">breakthrough therapy designation</a> for Nuplazid in 2014 for the treatment of PDP.</p><p>But Acadia's comeback fell flat during the next few years as the company delayed its NDA submission from year-end 2014 to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Acadia-Dont-expect-Nuplazid-NDA-until-1Q-2015-354979" target="_new">first quarter of 2015</a>. By the time Hacksell stepped down in March, Acadia said the Nuplazid NDA wouldn't be submitted until the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Nuplazid-NDA-delayed-again-Acadia-CEO-steps-down-357238" target="_new">second half of 2015</a>.</p><p>Now that the application finally has been sent to the FDA, Acadia has requested priority review, which would shorten the agency's decision-making process from 10 months to six.</p><p>Acadia chairman Leslie Iversen praised Davis as "an accomplished leader" who "has done a tremendous job of aligning Acadia's operations with our short-term and long-term goals, continuing the build-out of our capabilities, and positioning the company for strong growth."</p><p>Iversen said he has "great confidence in [Davis] leading Acadia through our next stage of growth as we bring innovative treatments such as Nuplazid to [central nervous system (CNS)] disease states with high unmet medical needs."</p><p>The company is running a Phase II clinical trial testing Nuplazid in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-Relypsa-Xencor-Celladon-Catabasis-Acadia-Broad-Institute-348175" target="_new">Alzheimer's disease psychosis</a> and previously completed a successful Phase II trial evaluating the drug in schizophrenia.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
