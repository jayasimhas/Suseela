<p>Sanofi and Regeneron have announced that the EMA has accepted for review their MAA for the PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent (alirocumab) just days after announcing positive data for a monthly dosing schedule for the investitgational hypercholesterolemia product (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Alirocumabs-ODYSSEY-continues-into-once-monthly-dosing-territory-356060" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 9 January 2015</a>). The companies also confirmed that a BLA was indeed filed at the US FDA in the fourth quarter of 2014, as had been expected. </p><p>The filing dates are being closely watched by those interested in the companies' race against Amgen, and its PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab, which is under review at the FDA with a PDUFA date of 27 August. This earlier filing would have put it clearly ahead in the US market were it not for Sanofi and Regeneron's tactical use of a priority review voucher purchased from BioMarin that means their application will be reviewed in six rather than 10 months of acceptance, narrowing the distance between them.</p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron say the MAA for Praluent contains data from more than 5,000 patients, including 10 Phase III ODYSSEY trials. Additional studies including ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, are ongoing the ODYSSEY clinical trial program will in total include more than 23,500 patients. </p><p>The top-line data released last week were from the OSYSSEY CHOICE I and II trials and were the first pivotal studies to look at four-weekly dosing for alirocumab and show comparable efficacy to that seen in previous Phase III studies that examined its use every two weeks. Four-weekly dosing data had already been reported for evolocumab. Both products are approaching the market with little separating them in terms of safety and efficacy ( <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-inhibitors-shine-at-AHA-but-how-to-differentiate-355132" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 November 2014</a>), and now alirocumab appears to have caught up on the convenience front too.</p><p>Other PCSK9 inhibitors in development include Pfizer's bococizumab at Phase III, and Lilly's LY-3015014 at Phase II.</p><p>PCSK9 &ndash; or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 &ndash; is a serine protease involved in the metabolism of LDL-cholesterol. PCSK9 is excreted by the liver into the bloodstream where it binds to an epidermal growth factor-like repeat found within the extracellular domain of the hepatic LDL receptor. It is then internalized by the cell, where this binding becomes stronger, preventing the LDL receptor from recycling to the cell surface &ndash; it is instead destroyed within the cell. By blocking the action of PCSK9, these drugs should lead to an increase in the number of LDL receptors on the hepatic cell surfaces, and so increased uptake of cholesterol into cells and out of the bloodstream</p><p>
