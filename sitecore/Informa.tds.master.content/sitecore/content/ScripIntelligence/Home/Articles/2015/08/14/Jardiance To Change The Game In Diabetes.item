<p><p>Eli Lilly & Co. and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim may have just gained a significant edge in the extremely crowded diabetes market &ndash; giving the companies a chance to gain a stronger footing as the market evolves. </p><p>The pair announced positive topline results from their long term cardiovascular outcomes study EMPA-REG Outcome on Aug. 20. While the companies didn't give detailed data from the trial, Lilly and BI noted that their sodium glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor Jardiance (empagliflozin) demonstrated superiority and reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events. </p><p>The full results from the study will be shared on Sept. 17 at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes annual meeting in Stockholm.</p><p><b>A Game Changer</b></p><p>Investors are already seeing how this could impact the companies; Lilly's stock jumped 5.4%, or $4.50, in midday trading to linger near $88.30. BI is a privately-held company. </p><p>The companies pointed out in a statement that Jardiance is now the only "glucose-lowering agent to have demonstrated CV risk reduction in a dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trial."</p><p>The positive results from the three year study could give Jardiance a major boost in the market. Jardiance was approved by FDA in 2014 and launched shortly after, but the drug was not the first SGLT-2 inhibitor to market and entered a space with several other entrants. According to Lilly's most recent quarterly report, sales for Jardiance were not broken out because the product did not contribute meaningfully to the company's revenues over the last six month. In comparison, Johnson & Johnson reported its SGLT-2 inhibitor Invokana (canagliflozin), which was the first drug to market in this class, had sales of $596m for the first half of the year. Clearly, Lilly and BI have a lot of ground to make up. </p><p>While the detailed results from the trial will give a much clearer picture of exactly what impact this will have on the overall market, expect Jardiance to benefit. As the companies said, Jardiance is the first type 2 diabetes drug to show a reduction in cardiovascular risk &ndash; even insulins have failed to show this effect in the three year period. </p><p>Not only could this data give Jardiance a lead in the SGLT-2 category, but across the diabetes treatment landscape, affecting both DPP-4 inhibitors like Merck & Co.'s blockbuster Januvia (sitagliptin), as well as GLP-2 agonists like Novo Nordisk's Victoza (liraglutide). </p><p>"Our current estimate for LLY's SGLT-2 franchise is ~$645M by 2026. It would likely be revised up based on this development, and we expect the potential for the SGLT2 class could more than double," wrote Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez in an Aug. 20 note to investors. </p><p>Currently, physicians usually prescribe DPP-4 inhibitors after metformin on the continuum of diabetes treatments, but the CV benefit seen for Jardiance could mean that doctors start moving SGLT-2s forward in the treatment paradigm. Lilly expects this will benefit the whole class of drugs, but expects to see a "disproportionate" bump, the company said on its second quarter earnings call. </p><p>Other SGLT-2s are also being studied in CV outcomes trials, but the results will not be available for several years. J&J doesn't expect to see results for Invokana until 2017, while AstraZeneca will have results on Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in 2019 and Merck/Pfizer's ertugliflozin won't read out until 2020. </p><p><p>
