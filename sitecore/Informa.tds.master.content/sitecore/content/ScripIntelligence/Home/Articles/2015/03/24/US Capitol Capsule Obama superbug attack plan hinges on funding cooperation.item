<p>President Barack Obama on 27 March unveiled an aggressive five-year plan to combat the growing scourge of superbugs, which infect about 2 million Americans each year, killing 23,000.</p><p>The plan was developed in response to an 18 September 2014 executive order issued by Mr Obama and outlines the steps for implementing his multi-pronged strategy for attacking antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and addressing the policy recommendations from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology Policy</a> (PCAST).</p><p>In his <i>National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria</i>, President Obama has called for federal agencies to work with industry, the healthcare community and other stakeholders to take action to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and prevent the spread of resistant infections; take a "one health" surveillance approach; advance the development and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for identification and characterization of resistant bacteria; accelerate basic and applied research and development for new antibiotics, other therapeutics and vaccines; and improve international collaboration and capacities for prevention, surveillance, control and R&D.</p><p>But while the US president called his new AMR plan "realistic," he acknowledged its success relies on the cooperation of a multitude of stakeholders, including the biopharmaceutical industry, and funding from a Republican-controlled Congress &ndash; which made no commitments in their House and Senate fiscal year 2016 budget proposals, which were passed this past week, to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">$1.2bn Mr Obama has requested</a> to support his strategy.</p><p>The president has demanded $100m in new funds for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of new antibiotic therapies and diagnostics.</p><p>"We feel that a diverse and vibrant pipeline is required to address" the threat of AMR, Dr Joe Larson, acting deputy director of BARDA, told the PCAST during a 27 March meeting.</p><p>He noted that BARDA has been funding the development of antibiotics from Achaogen, Tetraphase, Cempra, Basilea, GlaxoSmithKline and Rempex, now part of The Medicines Company. </p><p>Among President Obama's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">other FY 2016 funding requests</a>, he also has called for $100m to back the creation of an AMR clinical trial network aimed at rapidly testing new medicines against multidrug-resistant bacteria, which will be run by the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>The president said his AMR action plan was the product of "extraordinary work" from some of the nation's top scientists, the private sector, research universities and healthcare professionals.</p><p>But a member of Mr Obama's own party, Representative Louise Slaughter (Democrat-New York) &ndash; the only microbiologist in Congress &ndash; was quick to condemn the plan as falling "woefully short" of taking "meaningful action" to curb the overuse of antibiotics in healthy food animals, such as chickens, cows and pigs, where about 80% of those drugs are used in the US.</p><p>The antibiotics are used on the farm mostly to "compensate for unsanitary and overcrowded conditions" to make the animals grow larger and faster, Representative Slaughter charged. </p><p>"Any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm," Representative Slaughter insisted.</p><p>She said the FDA's <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM299624.pdf" target="_new">December 2013 guidance</a>, often referred to simply as "213," which calls on the biopharmaceutical industry to voluntarily stop labeling "medically important" antibiotics for use as "growth promotion" by 2017, was an inadequate response to the overuse of antibiotics on the farm &ndash; with no mechanism of enforcement and no metric for success &ndash; permitting industry to police itself. </p><p>The problem with President Obama's plan and the FDA's guidance, said Mae Wu, health attorney at the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, is they continue to condone the routine use of antibiotics to help animals survive crowded, stressful and unsanitary confinement conditions under the guise of "disease prevention" uses. </p><p>"Leaving this loophole in place means that antibiotic use on animals will not decline significantly," she asserted. "Our government should be taking steps to reduce antibiotics to protect our health, rather than protecting poor industry practices."</p><p>PCAST co-chair Dr Eric Lander, president and director of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard, raised concerns about the "fuzzy boundary" the FDA has left for farmers in using antibiotics in animal health.</p><p>"Folks may say they use it for prevention, how do I really know?" Dr Lander questioned. </p><p>He complained that the PCAST was "frustrated" when it was developing its AMR report last year &ndash; the details of which were first disclosed at a meeting in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Staying-ahead-of-tricky-resistant-bugs-PCAST-outlines-path-352852" target="_new">July 2014</a>, with the final report issued <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-multi-strategy-attack-on-antibiotic-resistance-354030" target="_new">two months later</a> &ndash; it didn't have the kind of data it needed to know how much of the resistance to antibiotics that arises on the farm comes into the human healthcare system.</p><p>While President Obama's plan calls for the FDA and the US Department of Agriculture to monitor and collect those data, Dr Lander said he would be "much happier" if the agencies would sequence the genomes of those bugs, which would "provide enough information to know whether something you saw on the farm is the same as what you saw in the hospital."</p><p>In addition, he said, not only would that data help scientists to also know if there are AMR transmissions occurring from hospital to hospital, but also from hospitals to the farms &ndash; the latter of which Dr Lander emphasized also is a question that must be answered. </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hamburgs-farewell-message-Strengthen-dont-undermine-FDA-357552" target="_new">Hamburg's farewell message: Strengthen, don't undermine, FDA</a></p><p>In her last public address as FDA commissioner, Dr Margaret Hamburg on 27 March urged stakeholders to put their collaborative efforts towards strengthening, rather than undermining, the agency she led for about six years.</p><p>"It is hard to overstate the unique and vital importance of this agency for all of us," Dr Hamburg said during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. </p><p>But, she said, some have argued FDA regulations are the principal obstacles to developing innovative treatments and have suggested the agency's authorities and procedures should be fundamentally reconsidered.</p><p>"I strongly disagree," declared Dr Hamburg, who announced on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-chief-Hamburg-to-depart-late-March-356562" target="_new">5 February</a> she was leaving the FDA by the end of March.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Whos-responsible-for-safety-updates-Generics-rule-debated-357551" target="_new">Who's responsible for safety alerts? Generics label rule debated</a></p><p>At an all-day FDA meeting on 27 March, where regulators heard from about 40 people in five-minute testimonies, it was the pharmaceutical industry versus patients claiming injuries from drugs with inadequate warnings. But mostly, it was lawyers arguing on both sides of whether the FDA should finalize its proposed rule that would permit generic manufacturers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes &ndash; just like brand-name companies do already &ndash; or instead implement an alternative approach recommended by two industry lobbying groups.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-vaccines-safe-but-quandary-for-Liberia-efficacy-enrollment-357521" target="_new">Ebola vaccines safe; but quandary for Liberia efficacy enrollment</a></p><p>With the initial findings of an ongoing study in Liberia demonstrating that two experimental Ebola vaccines appear to be safe, scientists from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are ready to move forward with the next phase of the trial to validate efficacy, the agency said on 26 March. The problem now, however, is where to conduct that next portion of the study now that new cases of Ebola have dramatically slowed in Liberia</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NIH-No-rapid-mutation-of-current-Ebola-virus-357523" target="_new">NIH: No rapid mutation of current Ebola virus</a></p><p>Researchers from the National Institutes of Health on 26 March said data showed the Ebola virus currently circulating in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone does not appear to be rapidly mutating, and therefore, is not any more virulent or transmissible than those in previous outbreaks of the disease &ndash;
