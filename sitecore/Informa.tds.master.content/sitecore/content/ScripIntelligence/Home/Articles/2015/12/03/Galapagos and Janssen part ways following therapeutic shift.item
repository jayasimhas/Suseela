<p>Galapagos, which said in December that its partnership with Janssen Pharmaceutica was "very much alive," now says the companies have agreed to mutually terminate their inflammation alliance and option agreements. "The therapeutic indications of these programs have shifted along the way and moved outside focus areas of Janssen," Galapagos CEO Onno van de Stolpe told Scrip.</p><p>Among others, all rights to candidate drug GLPG1690, a selective autotaxin inhibitor, have been returned to Galapagos. A first-in-human Phase I trial for GLPG1690 has been completed and Galapagos is preparing to file for permission by the end of this year to start a Phase II trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</p><p>When GLPG1690 entered Phase I testing last year, it triggered a &euro;6.6m milestone payment to Galapagos from Janssen.</p><p>Janssen returned the rights <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Galapagos-sees-another-program-spurned-by-big-pharma-355695" target="_new">to another program</a>, targeting G-coupled protein receptor 84 (GPR84), in December. This followed on the heels of another setback with a big-name pharma. In August, Galapagos revealed that GlaxoSmithKline was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/GSKs-JAK1-doubts-raise-questions-for-drug-class-353339" target="_new">dropping development</a> of GSK2586184 (solcitinib, GLPG0778), a JAK1 inhibitor, which it discovered and licensed to GSK under a wider collaboration.</p><p>On the latest news, CEO Mr van de Stolpe said: "Our alliance with Janssen has been successful in delivering clinical molecules targeting novel mechanisms. The opportunity arose to regain full ownership of these programs and with our plan to develop these in inflamed bowel disease (GLPG1205) and pulmonary fibrosis (GLPG1690), these fit well in in our therapeutic focus. Galapagos' aim is to build a clinical pipeline of partnered and proprietary programs, so with filgotinib and our cystic fibrosis programs partnered with AbbVie, it is good to have two fully owned clinical programs."</p><p>"There is a large unmet medical need in IPF, and our preclinical data with GLPG1690 supports its potential as a competitive and novel approach in this disease area," added Dr Piet Wigerinck, CSO of Galapagos. "The alliance with Janssen has been underway since October 2007 and has generated three clinical molecules, two of which are now proprietary Phase II assets. This program is a valuable component of our development portfolio, and regaining the rights is a next step in our transformation into a mature biotech company with a proprietary product pipeline."</p><p>The companies started working together in 2007, with Galapagos receiving &euro;15m upfront for providing Janssen the option to worldwide, commercial licenses to certain Galapagos internal inflammatory disease programs.</p>
