<p>Arogya Finance, a young Indian firm offering medical loans to the "traditionally un-bankable" is changing the way this stratum of people accesses pricey therapies in India. </p><p>Typically, under such financing schemes, patients can stagger payment of the actual therapy cost over a specified period via equal monthly instalments (EMIs) &ndash; along the lines of similar schemes for consumer durables.</p><p>And clearly pharma is all ears &ndash; after all, a large part of India with meager means and no medical insurance could do with such financial assistance. Such financing efforts may also potentially trump the tried and tested tiered pricing model, Arogya claims.</p><p>Arogya already has partnerships in place with companies like Dr Reddy's Laboratories for its hepatitis C therapy, Resof (sofosbuvir), Medtronic's heart devices under its 'Healthy Heart for All' initiative, Bengal Speech and Hearing and Madhavbaug (which offers alternative therapy for cardiac conditions), with potentially more linkages in the pipeline. </p><p>Such partnerships may typically include pharma firms providing funds or a contribution to the risk taken by Arogya as industry seeks to expand access to its products. But neither partner in any manner "interferes" with the prescription/therapy selection process.</p><p>Roche and Boehringer Ingelheim India are also known to be evaluating <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Can-Indias-Borrow-And-Treat-Market-Move-The-Access-Needle-360422" target="_new">financing models</a> for their oncology products.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> caught up with Arogya's co-founder and CEO, Jose Peter, to find out about the detail of the firm's financing model, its sustainability and scalability, pharma's interest and more. </p><h2>Reliable People</h2><p>If you thought those with low incomes and lack of formal income proof would be high risk when it comes to medical loans, think again. Payback appears almost certain in the Arogya model.</p><p>Peter, a former CFO of the retail finance firm, Tata Motor Finance, indicates that Arogya does not have a "collection mechanism" and simply encourages people to come and pay up on their own.</p><p>"Our limited experience shows us that these are very reliable people, although many people feel and think otherwise. About 90% of collections happen automatically, without our intervention; may be a little telephonic intervention. I see no reason why this cannot scale&#8230;.it's just that somebody needs to be successful first," says Peter. </p><p>Large financing firms, which have a better quality and more secure portfolio, typically have huge collection teams.</p><h2>Sustainable Model?</h2><p>Good quality treatment is slowly moving from large Indian metropolitan areas to Tier-1/2/3 cities, where low cost hospital chains and primary care have expanded, taking treatment options closer to people. </p><p>A heart surgery that may cost INR500,000-800,000 ($7,564-12,102) in Mumbai can be done with "reasonably the same level of success" in smaller cities like Durgapur for around INR150,000, Peter says. "The quality is almost there."</p><p>With the aspirations and earnings of people in the smaller towns improving, amounts such as INR150,000 may no longer be beyond their reach but "they may not have it in their pocket at that point of time," Arogya's boss notes.</p><p>"If the funds are made available, I see no reason why their offtake will not increase. People are struggling with public sector hospitals; they want better hospitals. The only challenge is somebody has to make that financial inclusion model work," Peter explains.</p><p>Experts also point to low insurance penetration in India, leaving many Indians exposed to unexpected healthcare expenses. Overall insurance penetration in India is 25%, but private sector insurance penetration is less than 5% though growing rapidly on a low base, according to a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch research report. A vast pool of the middle-income group, however, is still uninsured and most vulnerable due to low coverage.</p><h2>Beats Tiered Pricing?</h2><p>Peter believes that pharma's tried and tested tiered pricing model is "very good on paper" and "starts off very well", but has not really been able to penetrate and scale. </p><p>"It ends up with everyone getting the lowest price in the market."</p><p>He notes how everyone wants the lowest price and physicians will generally empathize and ensure that it happens.</p><p>"That is very good in the short run except that it is not sustainable. The moment that happens the whole pricing mechanism will collapse and companies will not be able to sustain," he says.</p><p>Significantly, the Arogya model is also moving beyond Indian shores. Financing efforts under Medtronic's successful 'Healthy Heart for All' initiative is now available in a "limited manner" in South East Asia. </p><p>"In the Philippines, we ran a pilot in Manila; there are conversations going on about a similar one in Malaysia. They are talking about doing something in the US," Peter said.</p><p>Launched in 2010 in India, the Medtronic initiative provides financial assistance to implant heart devices such as stents, pacemakers and heart valves by partnering with hospitals. More than 100 Indian hospitals are part of Medtronic's access initiative that includes screening camps and patient counseling, besides financial assistance.</p><p>The initiative is said to have screened more than 100,000 patients, treating over 14,000 and disbursing in excess of 500 loans.</p><h2>Real Access, Not Just Business</h2><p>Finally, Peter shared some real patient stories, including that of four-year-old Dixita, who was advised brain surgery. With a family income of INR17,500 and expenses of INR12,000, Dixita's parents turned to Arogya to meet the shortfall in financing the cost of surgery, after friends initially pooled sums to help the family. After a successful operation, little Dixita is back in her nursery and leading a normal life, Arogya said. </p><p>Similarly, when 59-old Dharam Pal faced a relapse of hepatitis C after interferon treatment in 2014, his family could not afford treatment costs for sofosbuvir. Pal is now on Dr Reddy's Resof, after Arogya sanctioned a loan to his son of INR75,000 for a 36 month tenure, with an EMI of INR2,599.</p><p>The Arogya boss notes how millions of Indians are unable to pay out-of-pocket for medical emergencies and often money is borrowed at high interest rates or is organized by selling personal assets or simply ignoring much needed medical attention. This, Arogya estimates, leads to 40m people falling into poverty every year.</p>
