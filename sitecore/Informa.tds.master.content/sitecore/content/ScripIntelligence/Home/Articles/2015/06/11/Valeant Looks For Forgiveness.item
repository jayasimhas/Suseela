<p> <p> Valeant CEO Mike Pearson finally checked his ego at the door and started handling the company's scandal with a little finesse. While the effort may be too little, too late for many investors, it sparked some hope for analysts that the company can begin putting the ordeal behind it by the middle of next year. </p> <p> &quot;The past few weeks have been a painful learning experience for me personally and I know it has been painful for many of you as well,&quot; said Pearson on a Nov. 10 business update call. &quot;One of the consequences of such rapid growth is that you don't always take the time to listen to what the world outside your company is saying. This has been a mistake on our part as a company and on my part as its leader. We're going to fix that.&quot; </p> <p> The beleaguered multi-national hosted the conference call to help further clarify its situation with the specialty pharmacy Philidor and how the termination of this relationship will impact its business going forward. </p> <p> Valeant put <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Reassures-Patients-But-Analysts-Still-Skeptical-361362">a temporary plan</a> into place to minimize distribution disruptions while it looks for a way to replace Philidor, which is expected to be completely unwound by January 2016 at the latest. That plan includes distributing the prescriptions from its specialty pharmacy unit for free for commercially-insure patients or a payment of $35 for cash-pay patients. </p> <p> Pearson noted that there will be an impact on several of Valeant's business units, including dermatology and neurology &ndash; particularly in the fourth quarter. While Valeant has yet to see an impact on prescribing volumes so far, it is very likely to happen, and the company is losing money by giving its drugs out for free. </p> <p> &quot;In the very short-term, disruption in our dermatology business will be significant,&quot; said Pearson. &quot;Until we implement a new Valeant access program, many doctors will likely change their prescribing [habits].&quot; </p> <p> The exec added that Valeant hopes to have a new distribution plan in place for the parts of the business that were handled by specialty pharmacies within the next 90 days and that the business should normalize by the middle of next year. </p> <p> Valeant will not be on the acquisition path any longer and instead will use its cash in the near-term to pay down debt &ndash; something that should finally begin to please investors. The company has $23m in debt due in the fourth quarter, as well as $832m due in 2016. </p> <p> Analysts found some solace in the comments from the company on Nov. 10. Analysts from Moody's Investors Service called the deleveraging a positive move by the company in a Nov. 10 note, but warned: &quot;Valeant faces considerable challenges in light of changes to its dermatology and hospital businesses, ongoing scrutiny into its practices, and legal investigations. For these reasons, the rating will face negative pressure if deleveraging does not occur as planned.&quot; </p> <p> Jefferies analyst David Steinberg sees some hope as well. &quot;As we see things, the non-derm businesses appear to be durable. As such, the likely best way for sentiment to improve will be continued strong financial performance &ndash; though this will likely take some time,&quot; he wrote in a Nov. 10 note. </p> <p> For now, Valeant continues to struggle, losing almost 70% of its value on the stock market since August. The stock is now trading at $83.64 per share, down sharply from its 52-week high of $263 apiece. </p> <p> Valeant's troubles began when a shortselling analyst firm published a report accusing a specialty pharmacy Valeant <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Demystifying-Valeant-And-Philidor-361239">was affiliated with</a> of misconduct. Valeant has created an ad hoc committee to review Philidor connect, as well as Valeant's involvement. The company was unable to give any updates on their progress so far. </p> <p><p>
