<p>With the publication of a revised version of its guideline on non-clinical and clinical issues, the EMA has completed the updating of its trio of overarching guidelines on biosimilar products, nearly ten years after they were first published in 2005 and 2006. </p><p>The revised guideline, covering a range of issues such as study design, safety and choice of the appropriate population, will come into effect in July. It complements the revised general guideline, which was adopted in October and takes effect in April, and the guidance on quality issues for biosimilars, which became effective last December. </p><p>Together with a number of product-specific biosimilar guidelines, these documents underpin the whole biosimilar development and approval pathway, providing guidance to manufacturers as to the data and other requirements at each stage of the comparability exercise. </p><p>Focusing on the requirements for the biosimilar comparability exercise, the latest revised guideline stresses the need for a stepwise approach to both non-clinical and clinical studies. At the pre-clinical stage, it says, analytical studies and in vitro pharmacotoxicological studies should be performed before deciding whether <i>in vivo</i> animal work will be needed. <i>In vitro</i> studies should be performed with an appropriate number of batches of the reference product and of the biosimilar.</p><p>If <i>in vivo</i> studies are required &ndash; the guideline notes that "biotechnology-derived proteins may mediate <i>in vivo</i> effects that cannot be fully elucidated by <i>in vitro</i> studies" &ndash; the focus of the PK/PD/safety studies will depend on what additional information is needed. The PK and PD of the biosimilar and the reference medicinal product should normally be compared quantitatively, including where possible a dose concentration-response assessment including the intended exposure in humans.</p><h2>Clinical efficacy/safety studies</h2><p>The clinical biosimilar comparability exercise should also normally be a stepwise procedure, beginning with PK and, where feasible, PD studies, followed by clinical efficacy and safety trials "or, in certain cases, confirmatory PK/PD studies for demonstrating clinical biosimilar comparability". </p><p>It will generally be necessary to show comparable clinical efficacy in an adequately powered, randomized, parallel-group comparative clinical trial, preferably double-blind, using efficacy endpoints, the guideline says. The study population should generally be representative of the approved therapeutic indication(s) of the reference product and be sensitive for detecting potential differences between the biosimilar and the reference drug. Equivalence designs would be standard practice, although a non-inferiority design could be used if there is a strong scientific rationale, and taking account of the characteristics of the reference product.</p><p>The guideline stresses that the efficacy trials are not intended to show efficacy <i>per se</i>, but to confirm the "comparable clinical performance of the biosimilar and the reference product".</p><p>As for the safety profile of the biosimilar, the guideline says that comparative safety data should normally be collected before marketing authorization, and the applicant should provide an evaluation of the specific risks expected with the biosimilar, including the possible effects of a manufacturing process that is different from that of the reference product, "especially those related to infusion-related reactions and immunogenicity".</p><p>Immunogenicity testing of the biosimilar and the reference product, it adds, should be conducted within the comparability exercise using the same assay format and sampling schedule. </p><h2>Extrapolation</h2><p>Any extrapolation of indications must be scientifically justified. Safety and efficacy would normally be extrapolated when biosimilar comparability has been shown by "thorough physico-chemical and structural analyses", as well as by <i>in vitro</i> functional tests complemented with clinical data in one therapeutic indication, according to the guideline. </p><p>If it is not clear whether safety and efficacy data in one indication will be relevant for another, additional data will be required, for example when:</p><ul><li>The active substance of the reference product interacts with several receptors that may have a different impact in the tested and non-tested therapeutic indications.</li><li>The active substance itself has more than one active site and the sites may have a different impact in different therapeutic indications.</li><li>The studied therapeutic indication is not relevant for the others in terms of efficacy or safety, ie is not sensitive for differences in all relevant aspects of efficacy and safety.</li></ul><h2>Safety follow-up, identification</h2><p>Like all new pharmaceuticals, biosimilars must be accompanied by a risk management plan (RMP). In the case of biosimilars, the RMP must detail the steps to be taken to monitor known and potential risks associated with the reference product that may also occur with the biosimilar, and must in particular address the possibility of immunogenicity. </p><p>The guideline also has something to say on the identification of biosimilar products, which has been raised as an issue by those concerned about the traceability of drugs where safety concerns arise. The R&D-based industry had been seeking separate INNs for biosimilars, but the likelihood now is that the World Health Organization's proposal for a "biological identifier" for all biologic drugs will win the day. </p><p>Still, the EMA does not feel there is a need for any further identification to allow biologic products to be tracked down in the EU when there are safety issues, beyond the drug's trade name and batch number. The guideline sets this view down in writing, noting that the "definite identification of the concerned product with regard to its manufacturing is of particular importance", and that "all appropriate measures should be taken to identify clearly any biological medicinal product which is the subject of a suspected adverse reaction report, with due regard to its brand name and batch number".</p>
