<p>The FDA has rejected Avedro's riboflavin ophthalmic solution and UVA light source drug-device combination products for use in a procedure known as corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) to treat progressive keratoconus and corneal ectasia following refractive surgery.</p><p>The Boston biotech said the FDA had identified a small number of areas of the application concerning the device, which the company said will require additional information before the agency will approve the products. </p><p>Privately held Avedro emphasized, however, the FDA raised no concerns about the safety or efficacy data included in the new drug application.</p><p>At a joint meeting on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-Avedro-eye-disorder-drug-device-combo-356930" target="_new">24 February</a> of the FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (DODAC) and the Ophthalmic Device Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee (OPMDAC), the panelists surprised nearly everyone by backing the products, known as Photrexa Viscous, which contains riboflavin plus dextran, and Photrexa, which does not contain dextran, and the KXL device system.</p><p>The committee voted 10-4, with one abstention, there was substantial evidence of efficacy and safety to support approval.</p><p>The joint DODAC-OPMDAC also voted 6-4, with four abstentions, there was substantial evidence of the products' efficacy and safety in treating corneal ectasia following refractive surgery, such as LASIK. </p><p>In seeking the FDA's approval, Avedro is dealing with a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-adcomm-may-be-rough-for-Avedro-drug-device-combo-356879" target="_new">complicated history</a> of its investigational products &ndash; starting with the fact it obtained the rights to the drug-device combos after all patients had been treated in the Phase III clinical studies.</p><p>To complicate matters further, the previous owner, Swiss firm Peschke Meditrade, had gone against the FDA's advice to conduct the primary endpoint analysis at 12 months &ndash; with the firm instead insisting it must be done at three months.</p><p>Avedro ended up changing it to 12 months, but that raised questions in the minds of some of the FDA's advisers about whether the analysis could be trusted. </p><p>Of particular concern to several members of the FDA's committee was the fact that Avedro is seeking approval of a device that is not the one studied in the Phase III trials.</p><p>Avedro CEO David Muller, however, argued there was "not a hair's breadth" of difference between its KXL System and the study device, known as the IROC-UV-X.</p><p>Both are UVA irradiation systems that use a light emitting diode to deliver a dose of UVA light to a targeted treatment area for illuminating the cornea during CXL, he said.</p><p>"We are disappointed with the outcome of the review and the implications this has for patients in the US suffering from keratoconus or corneal ectasia who remain in need of a therapeutic treatment for these sight-threatening conditions," Dr Muller said in a 31 March statement. </p><p>He said Avedro would "diligently" work to resolve the FDA's outstanding questions "with the goal of making this vital treatment available as soon as possible."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
