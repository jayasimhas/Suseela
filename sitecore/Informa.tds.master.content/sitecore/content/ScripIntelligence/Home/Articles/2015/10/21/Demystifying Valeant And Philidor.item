<p><p>Transparency may be what Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc was aiming for on the morning of Oct. 26, but the pharma presented hordes of information that only left investors with further questions &ndash; particularly surrounding its affiliation with specialty pharmacy Philidor &ndash; and added to the company's shady fa&ccedil;ade. </p><p>Valeant hosted an impromptu investor conference call to respond to allegations made by short-selling investment firm Citron Research in a report last week. The report alleges that Valeant is the pharmaceutical equivalent of Enron and that the drug company has been operating illegally in regard to its relationship with Philidor Rx. </p><p>Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson started the conference call by acknowledging that Valeant has been <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-Pick-On-Poor-Valeant-360847" target="_new">slow to communicate</a> about the "false attacks and misleading statements by short sellers looking to make a profit."</p><p>"With respect to Philidor, the business model of using specialty pharmacies is sound and it is an important part of our strategy," said the exec, who added that all of the company's accounting is legal and ethical. </p><p>The company has formed an ad hoc committee of board members that will review the allegations related to Philidor, which is a mail-order pharmacy that allows patients to get certain drugs delivered directly to their door. The use of the pharmacy is usually recommended by the prescribing physician and often allows patients to get a discount on their commercial insurance copay. These sorts of pharmacies are not uncommon and have affiliations with plenty of companies. They are usually paid by insurers and patients and occasionally receive fees from companies for certain services. The sales practices of these types of pharmacies have been called into question as it has been revealed that some are auto-refilling prescriptions and covering patient copays. </p><p>Valeant insists this is all above board and even cited examples of competitors that have similar arrangements &ndash; like AbbVie Inc's ownership of Pharmacy Solutions, which it uses to distribute its blockbuster <i>Humira. </i>Yet, investors are still weary. Valeant has never been particularly good at transparency and its unique business model of buying close-to-market or already-marketed products and distributing those makes it stand out amongst its pharma peers. </p><p><b>So what's all the hoopla about?</b></p><p>Investors and analysts are questioning just how closely tied Valeant is to the specialty pharmacy and if that relationship is legal. First off, Valeant asserts that Philidor is an independent company and that all ties are legal. Yet, the company failed to reveal this relationship until October 2015 when a legal issue with another affiliate required them to do so and questions started being asked. In fact, the existence of Philidor was only disclosed in a couple of footnotes in some lengthy SEC documents in late 2014 &ndash; albeit not by name, admits the company, which said the relationship was not material for reporting purposes. </p><p>Valeant explained during the call on Oct. 26 that Philidor had a contract with Medicis prior to Valeant's acquisition of the company in 2012. Philidor distributed Medicis products, including <i>Solodyn</i> and <i>Ziana, </i>and expanded the relationship due to its success. Valeant did not invest in Philidor at that time and was advised by a law firm regarding the relationship. </p><p>According to the company, Philidor was doing well and had plans to expand rapidly. This expansion would mean distributing products form other companies &ndash; something Valeant was opposed to. </p><p>"If Philidor rapidly expanded with additional partners, we might lose the high-service levels to patients and doctors that had driven success, and we wanted to maintain access program exclusivity in our key therapeutic areas. Our primary interest was ensuring that Philidor remain focused on our business," former CFO and current board member Howard Schiller said.</p><p>In response to Philidor's expansion plans, Valeant bought an option to acquire the specialty pharmacy for $100m upfront and $33m in milestone payments. The contract says that Valeant has 10 years to acquire the company outright and would not owe any more money. The option also gave Valeant some power over the Philidor business, including the ability to sway hiring decisions and a seat on a joint steering committee. </p><p>The agreement also changed how Valeant did business with Philidor. Previously, Valeant treated Philidor like any other third party it worked with, but after the agreement was signed in December 2014, Valeant began consolidating Philidor financials into its own balance sheet. </p><p>This means that Valeant sends product to Philidor and considers the transaction as an intercompany sale, charging Philidor the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). Philidor then gets paid by either patients or insurance companies for the product and is responsible for making payments back to Valeant on a bi-weekly basis. Valeant doesn't record the revenues until the product reaches the patients. </p><p>Philidor currently accounts for about 5.9% of Valeant's revenues year-to-date &ndash; a small percentage of the company's revenues. Yet, Philidor does make a significant contribution to the company, bringing in nearly 44% of <i>Jublia</i>'s revenues. The foot cream is consistently one of Valeant's top-selling products and brought in $106m in sales in the third quarter. </p><p><b>What now?</b></p><p>Barclays Capital analyst Doug Tsao says that investors should expect the stock to continue to have trouble as investor uncertainty remains high. "We hope to gain additional clarity on Philidor Rx&rsquo;s business practices from the ad hoc committee of the board; until those questions are answered, we suspect some investors will remain on the sidelines, which will impact share performance," he said in an Oct. 26 note. </p><p>Tsao and other analysts expect other drugmakers to <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-Else-Dont-We-Know-May-Spread-Beyond-Valeant-361194" target="_new">feel some pushback</a> regarding their business practices with specialty pharmacies, despite these interactions being totally legal. Expect to see other companies disclosing their relationships with these distributors and potentially pulling back on the number of products that they distribute through this route. </p><p>Valeant noted during the call that it is exploring all options regarding Philidor and would potentially cut ties with the pharmacy if investor sentiment indicates that it should. Analysts expressed mixed views about this, with some calling for the relationship to cease. </p><p><p>
