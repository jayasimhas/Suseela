<p><p>Less than a year after its $23m Series A, Navitor Pharmaceuticals is exercising its option to in-license a series of small molecules developed by X-Chem that target the activation of the mTORC1 protein, which plays a key role in cellular metabolism and growth. The compounds licensed by Navitor were discovered by X-Chem using their proprietary DEX platform against protein targets supplied by Navitor under a drug discovery agreement established by the parties in 2014. The deal, which did not include financial details, gives Navitor further compounds that fit into its area of expertise &ndash; regulation of the mTOR pathway. Navitor's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJ-Innovation-Centers-report-12-new-partners-investments-352430" target="_new">Series A</a> also was supported by GlaxoSmithKline's corporate venture capital fund SR One, as well as Johnson & Johnson's venture arm JJDC. The company used the money from its first financing round to help identify drug candidates targeting cellular nutrient signaling via the mTORC1 pathway. Novel compounds discovered with Navitor's platform could treat a variety of diseases and rare disorders, including metabolic, neurodegenerative, autoimmune and musculoskeletal diseases.</p><p><p><p>
