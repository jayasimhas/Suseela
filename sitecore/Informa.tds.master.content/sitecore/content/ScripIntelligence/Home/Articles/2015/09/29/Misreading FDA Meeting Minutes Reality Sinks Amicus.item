<p>When Amicus Therapeutics Inc. met with the FDA this past spring and again just a few weeks ago, the company walked away from both meetings thinking regulators were on board with the idea the biotech was ready to submit its new drug application (NDA) for migalastat as a treatment for Fabry disease under the agency's accelerated approval pathway, or Subpart H &ndash; a plan the firm intended to carry out in the fourth-quarter.</p><p>But Amicus disclosed on Oct. 2 the FDA actually had been under a completely different impression and had determined more work was needed &ndash; a reality made clear to the company from the official minutes of the September pre-NDA meeting and through additional follow-up interactions with the agency.</p><p>So to investors' and analysts' surprise, the firm said it no longer expected to submit an NDA for migalastat before the end of the year, and acknowledged the filing under Subpart H may be in question.</p><p>That revelation sent Amicus' shares into a freefall, with the stock plummeting nearly 60% in morning trading on Oct. 2, before closing at $6.39, a loss of $7.36, or about 54%.</p><p>Amicus said the FDA has requested "further integration of existing clinical data across studies," which the company said would require more time to complete. </p><p>"The timing of an NDA submission will be based on the determination of the optimal regulatory pathway," the firm said.</p><p>Leerink Partners LLC analyst Joseph Schwartz said the announcement about the migalastat delay came as a "huge surprise," given the company's "bullish commentary" it had a positive pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.</p><p>And, Schwartz said, as recently as Sept. 30, Amicus officials were insisting the company was on track to file the NDA before the end of the year. </p><p>But, he said, "it appears that the company misread the FDA's feedback."</p><p>It wasn't the first time signals got crossed between Amicus and the FDA.</p><p>The company actually reported back in March it anticipated seeking an accelerated approval of migalastat after obtaining positive feedback from regulators at a "Type C" meeting &ndash; news that sent <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Amicus-to-seek-quicker-market-paths-for-Fabry-drug-357400" target="_new">shares of the firm climbing 41%.</a></p><p>Migalastat has had a tortured path to approval, with the latest delay certainly not the first.</p><p>Indeed, the company had intended on seeking approval two years ago, but had to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amicus-hit-hard-on-FDA-advice-for-more-migalastat-work-before-NDA-344159" target="_new">abandon those plans</a> after the FDA said Amicus' data were not sufficient.</p><p>Then, Amicus' partner, GlaxoSmithKline, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CEO-Crowley-Amicus-will-go-it-alone-on-migalastat-Phase-III-success-353476" target="_new">pulled out</a> of its deal with the company.</p><p>During an Oct. 2 conference call with investors and analysts, Amicus CEO John Crowley insisted the data the company currently has would support approval of migalastat.</p><p>Crowley explained that Amicus had been planning on providing the FDA with the company's Study 011, also known as FACETS, which was a Phase III trial designed to measure the reduction of disease substrate, or globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) following treatment with migalastat in Fabry patients with amenable mutations, as the sole basis of approval, supplemented by data from its Study 012, also known as ATTRACT, which was an open-label trial that compared oral migalastat to standard-of-care enzyme replacement therapies for Fabry disease &ndash;Sanofi unit Genzyme's Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) and Shire's Replagal (agalsidase alfa). </p><p>But he said the FDA wanted the integration of the safety and efficacy data, together with an additional analysis of that data from the FACETS and ATTRACT studies, which Crowley said is expected to take "several more months to complete." </p><p>"We continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with the FDA around the appropriate potential basis for approval of migalastat monotherapy in the United States," he said. </p><p>Crowley said Amicus was still working with the FDA on a potential Subpart H filing, but beyond interstitial capillary GL-3 as the primary endpoint. </p><p>But he said the company has not yet resolved with the FDA what the potential "multiple" pathways may be for a migalastat NDA under Subpart H. </p><p>Crowley said the FDA was "open" to considering migalastat monotherapy for full approval, not conditional approval, but it's not clear yet what would be required by Amicus, Crowley said. </p><p>"It could also be generating additional data in a short period of time with the current patients," he said, adding that there are 90 patients continuing on migalastat as their "only treatment" for Fabry disease.</p><p>"It could also involve the FDA request if we seek full approval for a new study," Crowley said.</p><p>But, he said, "let me be very clear, though, we do not intend at this point to do a new study. We think the data is very strong with both the 011 and the 012 studies together with the extension studies, and that's what we intend to continue to explore with the FDA."</p><p>Leerink's Schwartz, however, said he believed additional clinical data would be required to "bolster the case for approval in the U.S."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
