<p>More than a year after AstraZeneca PLC. hauled Glenmark to court over intellectual property rights issues concerning its dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor for diabetes, Onglyza (saxagliptin), in India, there are some signs of a potential thaw in the legal tussle.</p><p>A settlement has been broached in the case, with the matter being referred to the Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre.</p><p>Details in court documents indicate that Glenmark's counsel suggested that the firm wants to settle the matter and that it be referred to the mediation and conciliation centre. </p><p>On July.20, the Delhi High Court directed the parties to appear before the mediation and conciliation centre on July 29.</p><p>"Put up for report of settlement, if any, otherwise for admission/denial of documents on Sep. 30," the court said.</p><p>AstraZeneca did not immediately respond to an e-mail request for comment on the settlement efforts.</p><p>Glenmark, though, reiterated to <i>Scrip</i> that it is making saxagliptin monohydrate (the active pharmaceutical ingredient) for regulatory submissions in various overseas markets including the US, but has "no intention" to launch saxagliptin in India until the patent is valid and enforceable. </p><p>India's Patent Act embodies certain Bolar-type provisions. Section 107 (A) of the patent regulation lists certain acts that are not considered as infringement. It specifies the act of "making, constructing, using or selling a patented invention solely for uses reasonably related to the development and submission of information required under any law for the time being in force in India or in a country other than India that regulates the manufacture, construction use or sale of any product."</p><p>Pre-emptive litigation has generally been controversial in India with some legal experts suggesting that it can potentially open up the possibility of a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pre-emptive-litigation-in-India-extra-cautionary-or-backdoor-patent-linkage-351573" target="_new">back door entry</a> for "patent linkage" in the country. India does not currently recognize patent linkage. Others, though, have suggested that innovator firms were just going the extra mile to safeguard their intellectual property rights and Indian firms need not see such litigation as stalling development plans for generics given the country's well-defined Bolar-type provision. </p><p>AstraZeneca earlier also moved the Delhi High Court seeking permanent injunction against the Hyderabad-based Lee Pharma, restraining it against infringement of the saxagliptin patent.</p><p>AstraZeneca's actions follow Lee applying for a manufacturing licence for saxagliptin in May this year. The licence has apparently yet to be granted, details in a Delhi High Court order dated July 29, said.</p><p>Lee's counsel had then stated that the firm had applied for a compulsory licence (CL) in July and till the petition is "finally decided", the defendants will not infringe the AstraZeneca patent and have "no intention" to launch the impugned products in the market "directly or indirectly" and also not export the same. The case is set for listing on Oct. 8.</p><p>Recently, India's Controller General of Patents is said to have viewed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/India-Shuns-Onglyza-Compulsory-License-But-Lee-To-Fight-On-360007" target="_new">unfavourably the CL application</a>, though Lee can seek an opportunity to be heard. </p>
