<p>India's Supreme Court has blocked any fresh manufacture by Glenmark of its cut-price version of Merck & Co's diabetes therapies Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride).</p><p>The court has also, in what's probably an unprecedented move, made efforts to ensure that "highly contested commercial cases" such as these are dealt with in definite timelines &ndash; the court itself refers to this as a "little unusual and extraordinary course of action."</p><p>"Going by the prima facie satisfaction recorded by the High Court, we are of the view that the unfinished formulation of sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate which is to be processed in the petitioner's [Glenmark's] factory/factories will not be undertaken for the present and until the next date fixed," Justices Ranjan Gogoi and NV Ramana said in an order dated 15 May. </p><p>The Delhi High Court had while granting an <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indian-court-blocks-Glenmarks-Januvia-generic-but-it-aint-over-yet-357431%5d" target="_new">interim injunction</a> against Glenmark in March this year held that prima facie infringement of Merck's patent had been established. </p><p>The Supreme Court's decision, clearly a boost for MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside of the US and Canada), nonetheless allows the existing stock of Glenmark's generic versions, Zita and Zitamet, to be sold in the market which, the court order notes, "can take care of the current demand in the market for five to six months i.e. September-November, 2015."</p><p>On institutional supplies, the volume of which "does not appear to be very huge", the court observed that if required, that "may be put on hold until the next date fixed".</p><p>Both MSD India and Glenmark declined to comment on the latest verdict.</p><p>The Delhi High Court had on 20 March granted an interim injunction against Glenmark preventing the firm from selling, distributing or in "any manner take any steps towards placing" Zita and Zitamet on the Indian market, though products already available with distributors /retailers stood unaffected. </p><p>Glenmark had then moved the Supreme Court, which on 25 March issued an interim stay against the High Court order of 20 March.</p><h2>Definite timelines</h2><p>Significantly, the main patent infringement suit between the two firms is still ongoing and the Supreme Court has sought an expedited approach to dealing with the case.</p><p>The 15 May order directed the Local Commissioner to record evidence on a day-to-day basis commencing from 20 May and to complete the recording of the evidence of both sides including cross-examination "on or before 30 June".</p><p>The Supreme Court even set daily work hours.</p><p>"Both the parties will co-operate and any perceptible lack of co-operation by either side will be noticed and recorded by the Local Commissioner to be placed before us. If required, the Local Commissioner will arrange a special venue for conduct of the proceedings before him which shall be held from 10 am to 5pm. with the usual break(s)." </p><p>Going into specifics, the court said that if the Local Commissioner was not in a position to comply with the time frame fixed by it on account of other commitments, the trial judge should be informed immediately. The trial judge may then pass appropriate orders in the matter for the appointment of a suitable Local Commissioner. </p><p>"In the event the trial judge is not available to pass necessary orders replacing the Local Commissioner we authorize the Registrar General of the Delhi High Court to pass necessary orders in the matter," the court said. </p><p>It expects the trial judge to commence hearing the arguments "on and from 6 July" on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>"The present matter will be considered by us again on 22 July 2015."</p><p>The court also clarified why it had taken a "little unusual and extraordinary course of action" in ordering a time schedule.</p><p>"This has been prompted by our desire to ensure that highly contested commercial cases, in which category this instant case can be put, requires immediate attention and disposal to ensure a suitable commercial environment which is vital to national interest. Our above directions, therefore, will be construed to be in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution."</p>
