<p> In this second instalment of this exclusive two-part interview with PharmAsia News, Cho talks about the need to streamline China&rsquo;s drug approval process and the hot issues of multiregional clinical trials and pricing policies. For the first part of the interview, which focuses on the need for a collaborative approach to policy reforms, see (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/5/18/interview-collaboration-key-for-china-regulatory-reforms-rdpac-says-part-1" target="_new">&quot;INTERVIEW: Collaboration Key For China Regulatory Reforms, RDPAC Says (Part 1)&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, May 18, 2015 11:18 PM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <h2> Approval Acceleration </h2> <p> <p> The top issue concerning innovative pharma firms in China is a lengthy drug approval process. This has been raised repeatedly in recent years and the China FDA is now said to be trying to eliminate its sizable review backlog by 2018. </p> <p> <p> Cho sees encouraging signs towards achieving this goal. For instance, the agency is adding personnel and building capacity, increasing its staff by 53 additional hands in 2014 and planning to add 300 in 2015 (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/2/2/analysis-a-closer-look-at-chinas-drug-lag-promises" target="_new">&quot;ANALYSIS: A Closer Look At China&rsquo;s Drug Lag Promises&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Feb. 2, 2015 11:17 PM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> Meanwhile, industry associations are also helping the CFDA in the training of drug reviewers. </p> <p> <p> Nevertheless, &ldquo;There is more that needs to be done. One is to follow ICH [International Conference on Harmonisation] guidelines, be engaged in regulatory harmonization and in compliance with good review practice and good regulatory practice used by advanced markets&rdquo;, Cho said. </p> <p> <p> Currently, the data requirements for dossers to support investigational new drug, clinical trial and new drug approvals are largely the same in China, making the process burdensome and detrimental for innovators. On the one hand, the new signs are encouraging, but on the other, documentation and submission requirements need reform, he pointed out. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;What drug reviewers are focusing on is also important, so that regulatory resources are not being wasted on applications with limited contributions to the health of people in China. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;A drug pricing mechanism to price generics differently is also needed, so the volume of applications for generics won&rsquo;t overwhelmingly clog the regulatory agency,&rdquo; Cho emphasized. &ldquo;Otherwise, it will be like mopping the floor while the faucet is still running.&rdquo; </p> <p> <h2> MRCTs, Registration Fee Raise </h2> <p> <p> Since a year ago, when China&rsquo;s multiregional clinical trial (MRCT) practices were put under official review by the CFDA, as first reported by PharmAsia News, RDPAC has cried foul over the additional administrative procedure &ldquo;Sanbaosanpi&rdquo; (three applications, three approvals) on top of the popular pathway for new drug approvals in China. </p> <p> <p> In a previous interview, Cho said that the change would put multinationals&rsquo; R&amp;D plans in an &ldquo;awkward position&rdquo; <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2014/10/7/interview-china-ongoing-mrct-review-pains-industry" target="_new">(&quot;INTERVIEW: China Ongoing MRCT Review Pains Industry&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Oct. 8, 2014 3:15 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;Many are stamping their feet. It [the previous two applications, two approvals procedure] had been going for 12 years, and it&rsquo;s hard to accept the new Sanbaosanbi without much notice.&rdquo; </p> <p> <p> Pressured by the industry, the CFDA has drawn a line for NDA filings using data from MRCT trials. Any dossers that were filed before Dec. 23, 2013 will get the previous fast-track treatment and any submitted after that date will follow the new requirement, Cho said, adding that the past 12 months had been &ldquo;a year of fighting&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/14/exclusive-insight-china-to-clarify-mrct-regulatory-pathway-soon" target="_new">&quot;EXCLUSIVE INSIGHT: China To Clarify MRCT Regulatory Pathway Soon&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Apr. 15, 2015 1:42 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> Currently, the CFDA is considering a proposal to link MRCTs with new drug approval. If sponsors meet certain requirements, and their clinical data are gathered following Chinese regulations, MRCTs can be used towards NDAs, according to the proposal (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/14/exclusive-insight-china-to-clarify-mrct-regulatory-pathway-soon" target="_new">&quot;EXCLUSIVE INSIGHT: China To Clarify MRCT Regulatory Pathway Soon&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Apr. 15, 2015 1:42 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> A draft for the MRCT regulation is likely to be released by the end of the year, Cho predicted. </p> <p> <p> Similarly, a sharp increase in registration fees proposed by the CFDA for new drug and device reviews and approvals has raised eyebrows and hot debate across the industries. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;There are many arguments and one key issue is how the money will be spent&rdquo;, Cho noted. &ldquo;How will the increase in fees ensure that the promises made by the agency to erase a piling up drug approval backlog and meet timelines for various applications within three years be met?&rdquo; he asked. </p> <p> <p> But all the changes point to one message, the RDPAC head said: comprehensive drug regulatory reform is underway, and 2015 will be marked as a key year. </p> <p> <p> Cho pointed to moves made by China&rsquo;s neighbor Japan, which has rolled out an ambitious plan to allow innovative drugs and devices to gain faster market access (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/20/insight-understanding-japans-new-sakigake-process" target="_new">&quot;INSIGHT: Understanding Japan&rsquo;s New &lsquo;Sakigake&rsquo; Process&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Apr. 21, 2015 12:43 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> The &ldquo;Sakigake&rdquo; initiative combines existing organizations with new resources, and will force clinicians to adapt to good clinical practice as a sunshine policy, said Cho, who was previously the general manager in China for major Japanese drug maker Astellas Pharma Inc. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;Japan has realized the importance of international collaboration in innovation, and the better allocation of resources. China has come to realize the importance, by the recent MRCT guidelines,&rdquo; he concluded. </p> <p> <h2> Tender Impact </h2> <p> <p> Entering 2015, provinces in China have noticeably stepped up the pace of local tenders, resulting in some drug prices being slashed and sparking protests from impacted drug makers. </p> <p> <p> Meanwhile, the country&rsquo;s price-setting agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, has freed up most drug prices, replacing ceiling prices with reimbursement levels (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/5/11/homework-for-pharma-as-chinese-payer-flexes-muscles" target="_new">&quot;Homework For Pharma As Chinese Payer Flexes Muscles&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, May 11, 2015 5:38 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> However, there is a difference between a tender price and reimbursement price, pointed out Cho. While the former is the winning price to supply drugs to hospitals, the reimbursement amount is paid by the government payer, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. </p> <p> <p> Additionally, cut-throat price competition is again raising concerns over quality. For example, recently the CFDA ordered a multi-provincial recall of a traditional Chinese medicine injection product made by Jiangsu Suzhong Pharmaceutical Co. </p> <p> <p> Amid all the regulatory change in China, even the association Cho leads is facing challenges, with one of RDPAC&rsquo;s members, Japan&rsquo;s Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd., deciding to quit the association in April. </p> <p> <p> Although it hasn&rsquo;t disclosed the reasons, the move dealt a blow to the group, which so far has only seen one other member, GlaxoSmithKline PLC, exit due to the widely publicized bribery probe (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2013/10/22/china-anticorruption-investigations-leads-gsk-to-voluntarily-withdraw-rdpac-membership" target="_new">&quot;China Anticorruption Investigation&rsquo;s Leads GSK To Voluntarily Withdraw RDPAC Membership&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Oct. 22, 2013 4:22 AM GMT</a>). </p>
