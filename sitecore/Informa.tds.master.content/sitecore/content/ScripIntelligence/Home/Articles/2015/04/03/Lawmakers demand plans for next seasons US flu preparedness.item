<p>The heads of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on 9 March demanded answers from five US agency chiefs about what they were doing to ensure the nation was better prepared to handle the flu in 2015-16 after the failure of the current season's vaccine to protect Americans against a mutated strain of the H3N2 virus. </p><p>Representatives Tim Murphy (Republican-Pennsylvania), chairman of the subcommittee, and Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado), the ranking member, said their letters were follow-ups to their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Profits-didnt-drive-flu-vaccine-decisions-US-officials-356531" target="_new">3 February hearing</a>, where they grilled Obama administration officials about what led to the 2014-15 flu vaccine being so poorly matched with the predominant strain circulating in the Northern Hemisphere during the current season.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-vax-only-23-effective-12-most-adults-356168" target="_new">January</a> warned that the current seasonal flu vaccine was only 23% effective for the overall US population &ndash; much less so for most American adults, demonstrating only 12% effectiveness for those 18-49 years and 14% for those 50 years or older.</p><p>The agency has since <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-panel-drops-preference-for-MedImmunes-FluMist-357002" target="_new">revised</a> its figures, reporting late last month the vaccine was showing only 18% efficacy in the 2014-15 season for the overall population, with it dropping to only 15% protection for children.</p><p>Last week, the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee recommended the US adopt the same strains for 2015-16 that were proposed by the World Health Organization, which included two new strains: an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus, which is similar to the mutated H3N2 strain that's currently striking the US hard this season, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus.</p><p>The panel also unanimously advised keeping an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) like virus in 2015-16 flu vaccine &ndash; the same strain that first hit in 2009, causing a worldwide pandemic.</p><p>In addition, the committee recommended also not changing the second B strain for 2015-16 &ndash; keeping the B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage) for the quadrivalent vaccines.</p><p>If in the future there is another drift of influenza strain or a significant risk of a seasonal flu vaccine mismatch or low effectiveness, under what circumstances would the CDC support the production of an off-cycle monovaleant vaccine, Representatives Murphy and DeGette asked Dr Tom Frieden, the agency&rsquo;s director.</p><p>The two House members also wanted to know whether any CDC staff between 1 May 2014 and 1 November 2014 ever examined possible responses for the US to the drifted H3N2 strain and if so, who was involved at the agency, what were the potential responses considered and what was the basis for the decision on each of the proposed responses.</p><p>Among the series of questions the lawmakers asked Dr Frieden was what criteria the CDC uses to determine if an influenza strain targeted in a current vaccine has significantly drifted and may significantly lower the effectiveness of the current vaccine.</p><p>Representatives Murphy and DeGette also sent a list of questions to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Robin Robinson, the director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.</p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Profits-didnt-drive-flu-vaccine-decisions-US-officials-356531" target="_new">Profits didn't drive flu vaccine decisions: US officials</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule: Timing or economics?
