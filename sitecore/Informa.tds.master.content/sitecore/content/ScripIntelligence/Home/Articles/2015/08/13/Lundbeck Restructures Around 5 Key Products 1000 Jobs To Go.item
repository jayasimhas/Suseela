<p>Kåre Schultz, the new CEO at H. Lundbeck A/S, has wasted little time in making big decisions. Just three months after taking up the top job at the Danish pharma firm, following a dramatic exit from larger cross-town rival Novo Nordisk, he has announced that Lundbeck's previous restructuring attempts in Europe have not gone far enough. Lundbeck is going to focus on five key products, close early stage R&D programs, and cut 1,000 jobs.</p><p>The restructuring is move that "some anticipated albeit likely not on this scale," noted Jefferies analysts. However, it was well-received by the markets, with Lundbeck's shares trading around to 20% higher on the day (Aug. 21, 2015). </p><p>The five products that Lundbeck now intends to focus primarily on are: Abilify Maintena (aripiprazole) &ndash; a long-acting schizophrenia treatment partnered with Otsuka, its new antidepressant Brintellix (vortioxetine) &ndash; which Lundbeck hopes will pick up off-patent Cipralex's reins, Northera (droxidopa) &ndash; used to treat sudden drops in blood pressure caused by neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, the anti-seizure drug Onfi (clobazam), and the newly approved antipsychotic Rexulti (brexpiprazole). </p><p>But notably absent from the priority list is the alcohol dependence drug Selincro (nalmefene). "The products we have highlighted are seen as key in terms of their potential," Lundbeck told <i>Scrip</i>. "Selincro was approved two years ago, and sales have been modest, except in France and some regions in Spain. We have had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Germany-interrupts-Europes-Selincro-love-in-with-negative-IQWiG-outcome-355505" target="_new">difficulties in securing reimbursement</a>, and this has influenced sales. Selincro has not performed how we had hoped for, as certain countries are not willing to pay for innovation."</p><p>With regards to the R&D projects that are to be shuttered, Lundbeck noted that it has a policy not to comment on pipeline programs "until they are ready for Phase II and therefore hold real potential. This R&D that we refer to today as being identified for closure are early stage programs that we have not mentioned before."</p><p>The company plans to restructure all headquarter functions while expanding its newly established Business Service Center in Krakow, Poland. </p><p>The restructuring initiative will reduce the total cost base by about DKK3bn, says Schultz, with the full effect being seen in 2017. One-off charges of DKK1.7bn are to be booked in the third quarter of 2015, in addition to DKK4.8bn in R&D costs in the second quarter on now expensing the previously capitalized milestones paid for certain product rights.</p><p><b>Financials</b></p><p>In first half of 2015, revenue reached DKK7.19bn, an increase of 2% on the same period last year (a 7% decline in local currencies). "2Q revenues beat consensus by 4%, mostly on Northera and Xenazine, with other key products in-line or better," said Jefferies.</p><p>The performance was driven by the launch of new products (Abilify Maintena, Brintellix, Northera and Onfi) which grew 190% to DKK146bn, representing 20% of total revenue. This mitigated the effect of generic erosion on, eg, Cipralex.</p><p>Lundbeck has revised its financial guidance for 2015. It now expects revenue of around DKK14bn and core EBIT of around DKK500m. Lundbeck had previously guided DKK13.2-13.7bn in core revenue and around zero in core EBIT.</p><p><b>New CEO</b></p><p>Lundbeck's CEO Schultz was previously COO at Novo Nordisk, and was slated for the top job there. However, following a management shuffle in April this year, he left the company where he had worked for 26 years and took over at Lundbeck in May. </p><p>Schultz was hired to replace Ulf Wiinberg who was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lundbeck-CEO-resigns-6-key-questions-answered-355241" target="_new">forced to resign</a> as CEO in November 2014 following an inadvertent breach of the company's code of conduct. Håkan Björklund, chair of Lundbeck's board, covered the CEO duties while a successor was sought.</p><p>
