<p>"The strategy of being able to use immune-oncology to improve outcomes is being realized," Bristol-Myers Squibb head of oncology development Michael Giordano told <i>Scrip</i> on 12 January during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.</p><p>Dr Giordano said three recent events were crucial for immune-oncology: 1) US FDA approval of the Bristol-Myers programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) for melanoma in December; 2) the company's first biologic license application (BLA) in the US and marketing authorization application (MAA) in the EU for Opdivo in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and 3) demonstration of an overall survival benefit in lung cancer as of a recent interim Phase III clinical trial analysis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">23 December 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Bristol-Myers wowed investors with the news on 11 January that the CheckMate-017 trial's data monitoring committee (DMC) recommended an early end to the study, since Opdivo showed an overall survival benefit over docetaxel chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced or metastatic squamous cell NSCLC. The company's stock reached a new one-year high on 12 January of $62.18 per share, representing a 3.1% one-day gain.</p><p>Merck & Co traded as high as $63.50, which would have been a 1.5% one-day gain, after the company announced plans to accelerate its supplemental BLA (sBLA) filing in the US for its competing PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for lung cancer (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-ups-filing-pace-for-lung-cancer-HCV-drugs-356097" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>). Despite the planned mid-2015 Keytruda sBLA, Merck eventually closed down 0.4% at $62.30 after CEO Ken Frazier's presentation at the JP Morgan conference.</p><p>Merck chairman and CEO Ken Frazier said Keytruda is off to a great start in the first few months of its launch for the treatment of melanoma and the company is encouraged by the uptake, so far, by prescribing oncologists. However, Merck's sBLA for Keytruda in mid-2015 lags the sBLA for Opdivo, which was submitted to the FDA in late 2014.</p><p>Dr Giordano of Bristol-Myers said Opdivo's success to date, as well as progress for other PD-1 and PD-1 ligand (PDL-1) inhibitors, have been milestone moments in the evolution of cancer.</p><p>"We're seeing what [immune-oncology] can contribute to survival for more cancer patients," he said.</p><p>Tackling more indications, including hematological malignancies, and investigating PD-1 inhibitors in combination with targeted cancer therapies are the next frontiers for immune-oncology. </p><p>To that end, Bristol-Myers announced an agreement on 12 January with Seattle Genetics to test the CD30-targeting antibody-drug conjugate Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) with Opdivo in two Phase I/II clinical trials &ndash; one for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and another in relapsed or refractory B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).</p><p>Bristol-Myers reported early clinical trial results in December that showed an 87% overall response rate in Hodgkin's lymphoma patients who relapsed after treatment with Adcetris (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASH-2014-High-Hodgkins-lymphoma-responses-for-BMS-Merck-PD-1-inhibitors-355472" target="_new">6 December 2014</a>).</p><p>"A CD30 plus a PD-1 could be promising for Hodgkin's disease after patients have failed other therapies and also with the goal of replacing chemotherapy," Dr Giordano said in light of the clinical trial deal with Seattle Genetics.</p><p>Bristol-Myers also has partnerships to test Opdivo in combination with both approved therapies and drug candidates from Eli Lilly, Incyte, Novartis, Celgene and Pharmacyclics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bristol-Myers-Incyte-to-study-PD-1IDO1-combination-352007" target="_new">28 May</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-to-trial-own-drugs-with-BMSs-PD-1-354302" target="_new">6 October</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BMS-Pharmacyclics-Janssen-team-for-Opdivo-Imbruvica-study-354427" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Within the next three to six months, Dr Giordano said Bristol-Myers may have some data to share that indicate whether PDL-1 expression necessarily correlates to a response, but to date the company has reported responses in several clinical trials both in patients with or without high PDL-1 expression.</p><p><p><p><p>
