<p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has made decisions on six drugs, four of which it believes warrant reimbursement including Pfizer's Bosulif (bosutinib) and Celgene's Abraxane (paclitaxel). However, Janssen's Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma's BindRen did not make the cut.</p><h2>Zytiga rejection</h2><p>The SMC has rejected Zytiga for first-line use, prior to chemotherapy, in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The consortium said: "The submitting company did not present a sufficiently robust economic analysis to gain acceptance by SMC and in addition their justification of the treatment's cost in relation to its benefits was not sufficient to gain acceptance by SMC."</p><p>The SMC highlighted numerous problems with Janssen's economic model, which compared Zytiga to watchful waiting and best supportive care. Even with a patient access scheme, the consortium estimated that Zytiga would cost &pound;48,235 per quality adjusted life year (QALY).</p><p>The SMC rejected the drug despite input from its new, more flexible PACE (Patient and Clinician Engagement) process which allows patients and clinical specialists to express their views. The PACE group were in favor of recommending Zytiga for first-line use, listing a number of benefits including the fact that men can self-administer at home allowing them to continue leading normal lives, the fact that there are few side effects with the drug, and that there are few treatment options available to these patients other than watchful waiting which causes increased anxiety. </p><p>The SMC weighed this input against the other evidence, but ultimately concluded that the benefits did not justify the price. "It was noted that abiraterone was likely to be effective and increase quality of life but as there remained some uncertainty about the long-term benefits relative to the current treatment pathway it could not be considered a cost effective use of NHS resources," the consortium said.</p><p>Scotland's judgment is in line with that of NICE, the HTA body for England and Wales. NICE rejected Zytiga for first line use in August last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-rejection-of-first-line-Zytiga-angers-Institute-of-Cancer-Research-353393" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 15 August 2014). Both HTA bodies have accepted the drug for use in later lines of treatment.</p><p>Janssen said it is disappointed by the decision, and that it is determined to work with the SMC to find a way to make Zytiga routinely available in the first-line. "As an interim measure, patients in Scotland can still apply to receive abiraterone before chemotherapy via Individual Patient Treatment Request (IPTR)," the company said. "Janssen will maintain the current patient access scheme and existing discount while we continue to seek a long-term solution for patients. We are carefully considering a number of options and are meeting with the SMC this month to determine the next steps."</p><h2>Other decisions</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>SMC decision</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Comments</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Abraxane (paclitaxel)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celgene</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Pancreatic cancer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Yes</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celgene resubmitted Abraxane to the SMC to take advantage of the PACE process.

Nevertheless, the SMC said that because Abraxane met its criteria for an orphan drug, it was able to accept greater uncertainty in the economic case.</p><p>In contrast, NICE has rejected Abraxane in draft guidance (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Celgene-determined-to-fight-after-second-NICE-Abraxane-no-355887" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 30 December 2014</a>).
