<p>AC Immune has signed a license agreement with Johnson and Johnson subsidiary Janssen, worth a potential $509m, to develop its Alzheimer's disease vaccine candidates. </p><p>The companies will be developing phosphor-Tau targeting vaccines for the treatment of Alzheimer's and potentially other tauopathies. The lead compound included under the pact is ACI-35, which is currently in a Phase Ib clinical trial in Alzheimer's. </p><p>AC Immune will receive an undisclosed upfront payment and is eligible to receive research, development and commercialization milestone payments potentially totaling up to $509m. Additionally, the company is eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales for any approved products resulting from the collaboration. </p><p>The two firms will co-develop ACI-35 through Phase Ib completion but as of Phase II and onward Janssen will assume responsibility for the clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization of the vaccine. </p><h2>Crowded pipeline but a vacant market</h2><p>ACI-35 is an active therapeutic vaccine stimulating the patient's immune system to produce a polyclonal antibody response against phosphorylated Tau protein. It became the world's first anti-pTau Alzheimer's vaccine to enter a clinical trial, when AC Immune initiated a Phase I study in January 2014 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AC-Immune-raises-22m-initiates-worlds-first-anti-pTau-Alzheimers-vaccine-trial-349247" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 January 2014</a>). </p><p>It is estimated that 44 million people worldwide were affected by Alzheimer's in 2013, yet it has been over a decade since the last therapy to treat the disease was approved &ndash; Forest/Merz/Lundbeck's Namenda (memantine) in 2002. However, Datamonitor Healthcare notes that the number of candidates in development for Alzheimer's is at its highest ever level, featuring a variety of modes of action and a significant presence of big pharma companies. But as Datamonitor analyst Daniel Chancellor notes, "The vast majority of products in clinical development are in either Phase I or Phase II. The huge disparity between the number of drugs in Phase II and Phase III highlights the problem in developing novel therapies for Alzheimer's."</p><p>AC Immune also discovered humanized monoclonal antibody crenezumab, which is being developed under a partnership with Roche. The drug is currently in Phase II development for mild&ndash;to-moderate Alzheimer's disease and the prevention of early-onset Alzheimer's. </p><p>According to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, as of December 2014 there were 16 products in Phase III for the treatment of Alzheimer's; 39 in Phase II; and 47 in Phase I. BioMedTracker also has a recorded 127 products for which development in Alzheimer's has been suspended. Of these products there is one other Tau-targeting vaccine in development; Axon Neurosciences' AADvac1, which is in Phase I. </p><p>Novartis and Merck are also both developing Alzheimer's vaccines but the products, which are in Phase II and I respectively, target amyloid beta plaques.</p>
