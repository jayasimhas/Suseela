<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cleared Sun Pharma's plans to acquire Ranbaxy subject to the latter divesting all its rights and assets to generic minocycline hydrochloride 50mg, 75mg, and 100mg tablets to Indian competitor Torrent Pharmaceuticals.</p><p><p>Ranbaxy, Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Par Pharmaceutical Companies are currently the only three suppliers of these strengths of generic minocycline tablets in the US, while Sun is one of a limited number of firms expected to enter the market with its generic. </p><p><p>''Sun&rsquo;s acquisition of Ranbaxy would therefore deprive consumers of the increased competition and likely price reductions that would have occurred as a result of Sun's independent entry,'' the FTC said in its analysis of the agreement containing consent orders to aid public comment. The agreement is subject to public comment for 30 days through 3 March, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed consent order final.</p><p><p>Under the proposed settlement, Sun and Ranbaxy are also required to divest to Torrent generic minocycline capsule assets, to enable it to achieve regulatory approval for ''a change in ingredient suppliers'' for its minocycline tablets as quickly as Ranbaxy would have been able to do in the absence of the deal. </p><p><p>Sun and Ranbaxy would also need to supply generic minocycline tablets and capsules to Torrent until the firm establishes its own manufacturing infrastructure. The FTC has appointed an interim monitor to ensure that Torrent receives the support it needs from Sun and Ranbaxy during the divestiture process.</p><p><p>If the FTC determines that Torrent is not an ''acceptable'' acquirer or should the manner of the divestitures be unacceptable, the parties would be required to ''unwind'' the sale of rights to Torrent and then divest the products to a Commission-approved acquirer within six months of the date the order becomes final.</p><p><p>Sun and Ranbaxy on 2 February said that the FTC had completed its review of the proposed deal and had granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR Act).</p><p><p>The early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act satisfies one of the essential conditions to the closing of the Ranbaxy acquisition, both firms said in a statement. The Indian firms also confirmed that they had agreed to divest Ranbaxy&rsquo;s interests in generic minocycline tablets and capsules to ''an external third party''. </p><p><p>The landmark $4bn transaction announced in April last year will see the Ranbaxy-Sun combine emerge as the fifth largest global specialty generic pharma firm with operations in 65 countries and 47 manufacturing sites across five continents.</p><p><p>The Competition Commission of India approved the Sun-Ranbaxy combination proposal in December last year subject to certain preconditions such as the divestment of seven products. Investment banking sources have previously indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that significant progress had been made on the proposed divestment plans <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-Ranbaxy-near-brand-divestments-ahead-of-combination-356223" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 20 January 2015)</a>.</p><p><p>Ranbaxy's top brass noted during the firm's Q3 results announcement last week that the merger process with Sun was ''progressing well'' and the firms were working towards the completion of the ''pre-requisites'' (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ranbaxy-extends-losses-in-Q3-but-merger-with-Sun-on-track-356423" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 28 January 2015</a>). The hearing pertaining to the proposed merger at the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in India is likely on 2 February.</p><p><h2>Torrent fund raising</h2><p><p>Meanwhile, Torrent's recent proposed fund-raising plan has raised some speculation that the company may be readying for large inorganic growth opportunities.</p><p><p>On 28 January, the company said that it would seek enabling approval from shareholders to issue equity shares including convertible bonds/debentures through Qualified Institutional Placement or depository receipts not exceeding INR30bn. It also proposes to issue unsecured/secured redeemable non-convertible debentures/bonds by way of private placement for up to INR75bn, subject to an overall borrowing limit of INR100bn.</p><p><p>The funding plans are aimed to meet capital expenditure requirements, long term working capital, refinancing of existing borrowings and organic and inorganic growth, the company was reported as saying in local media reports. </p><p><p>Torrent acquired the branded domestic formulations business of the Indian firm, Elder Pharmaceuticals, for INR20bn <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Torrent-to-pay-324m-for-Elders-branded-formulations-business-beating-fancier-rivals-348776%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 15 December 2013)</a>. </p>
