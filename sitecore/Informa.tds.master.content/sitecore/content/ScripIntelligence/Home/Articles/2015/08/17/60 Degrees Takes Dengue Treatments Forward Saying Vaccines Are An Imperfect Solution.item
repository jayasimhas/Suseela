<p> 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals (60P) is launching a Phase II trial for its dengue fever candidates &ndash; aiming to develop treatments for those infected with the virus rather than a preventative measure. </p><p> 60P, a privately held company founded in 2010, announced on Aug. 20 that Singapore General Hospital has received a grant from Singapore's National Medical Research Council for $4.8m to fund a Phase II study for its dengue candidates, which is due to start in March 2016. 60P and Singapore General Hospital will be evaluating the safety and effectiveness of an antiviral, celgosivir, and a disease-modifying agent, modipafant, in the treatment of dengue, initially as monotherapies. </p><p> Washington, DC-headquartered 60P noted that previous animal studies suggest these drugs could prove effective in dengue fever patients. Meanwhile, Singapore General Hospital and Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School have already evaluated the efficacy of celgosivir in dengue patients, establishing its safety. </p><p> There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for dengue virus infection and treatment has been limited to supportive and symptomatic treatment. The most developed option for dengue treatment is a vaccine being developed by big pharma Sanofi. </p><p> However, 60P's CEO Geoff Dow told <i>Scrip</i> there will still be a vacant space in the market for its products. &quot;For [people] who contract dengue fever, dengue therapeutics offer the promise of reducing the duration of illness and risk of contracting severe dengue. Dengue vaccines are an imperfect solution because they can't be used to treat dengue fever and are only partially effective in preventing the disease,&quot; he said. &quot;Even with vaccines on the market, they will still be millions of dengue cases every year that will require treatment with dengue therapeutics.&quot; </p><p> 60P, a family-owned business, is targeting a regulatory submission date of 2021 or sooner for its dengue candidates. </p><p> Sanofi, which has been working on its dengue vaccine for more than 20 years, should see its product reach the market long before this. In <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Relief-as-Sanofis-dengue-fever-vaccine-performs-better-in-final-trial-353697" target="_new">September last year</a> Sanofi released data from a final Phase III study for its vaccine, which uses its ChimeriVax technology, that had stronger positive results than previous Phase III trials. </p><p> In addition to the overall significant reduction of 60.8% of dengue disease cases in the final Phase III trial, carried out in Latin America and the Caribbean, Sanofi's vaccine also demonstrated a &quot;clinically important&quot; reduction by 80.3% in the risk of hospitalization due to dengue during the study as well efficacy against dengue hemorrhagic fever. </p><p> As such, the vaccine, which utilizes yellow fever virus (YF) 17D vaccine strain capsid and non-structural genes to deliver the envelope gene of other flaviviruses as live-attenuated chimeric viruses, is still looking like it will be the first available options for dengue fever vaccination available worldwide. </p><p> As public health services expand in Asia, other competitors in the dengue R&amp;D space have emerged with earlier-stage vaccine candidates. These include Takeda, which has a Phase II vaccine product it plans to take into Phase III. However, the drug development for dengue virus therapies is not as busy. </p><p> 60P says on its website that, &quot;Dengue drugs will complement the use of [future] dengue vaccines by public health systems, provide relief to dengue patients, and substantially reduce economic costs associated with the disease.&quot; </p><p> <br><br><img src="-/media/FD1655267B15416C82ECF3F184112347.ashx"> <br><br><b> 60P's Recycled Compounds</b> <br><br> 60P's Phase II trial has an adaptive design, Dow told <i>Scrip</i>. &quot;Part 1 will evaluate one regimen of celgosivir and two regimens of modipafant. Assuming the benchmarks are met in Part 1, the best regimen will be moved forward into a confirmatory Part 2,&quot; he said. <br><br> The grant awarded by Singapore's National Medical Research Council will cover &quot;all of the Singapore costs of trial execution,&quot; 60P's chief said. However, the company is &quot;seeking additional funding from like-minded individuals and organizations to support our development plans.&quot; <br><br> Celgosivir is a glucosidase inhibitor, originally developed through Phase II by Sanofi/Migenix and other companies for hepatitis C/HIV, Dow noted. Meanwhile, modipafant is a platelet activating factor receptor antagonist, originally developed through Phase II by Pfizer for inflammation. &quot;Neither molecule is being developed commercially for the original indications at present and both are potentially eligible for an FDA priority review voucher,&quot; Dow told <i>Scrip</i>. <br><br> 60P is also developing a drug for malaria prevention for which the Phase III program is complete. <br><br> Dengue fever is a painful, debilitating and potentially deadly mosquito-borne viral disease. It infects an estimated 400 million people worldwide each year, causing 500,000 hospitalizations and creating a $12bn annual burden, 60P noted. It added that instances of dengue, which cause flu-like symptoms and can develop into lethal severe dengue, have increased 30 fold over the past few decades.  </p>
