<p>More possible competition is building for GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster salmeterol and fluticasone combination, with a second Indian firm teaming up with the Polish biopharmaceutical company Celon to produce a version of the product.</p><p>India's Glenmark Pharmaceuticals said that it has inked a pact with Celon to develop and market a generic version of GSK's Seretide Accuhaler (fluticasone/salmeterol) dry powder inhaler (DPI) in Europe, though some analysts say that substitutability will be critical in the segment that has already seen generic metered-dose inhaler (MDI) alternatives in parts of Europe.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, told <i>Scrip</i> that the value of the Glenmark-Celon deal potentially diminished to the extent that the Celon product may not be interchangeable [with Seretide], at least in some of the bigger markets like the UK.</p><p>"Interchangeability is the key to determine the real value," Mehta underscored.</p><p>Others, though, claim that substitutability may be less of an issue in some Eastern European markets.</p><p>In June, Mylan launched the first bioequivalent alternative to Seretide Evohaler (salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate) branded as Sirdupla in the UK. </p><p>GSK noted then that Mylan's pressurized MDI, available in 125/25 mcg and 250/25 mcg with 120 doses, is only indicated for treating asthma in adults 18 years and older. Seretide (Advair in the US), on the other hand, is approved for asthma and COPD, and licensed for use in children with asthma from the age of four years and more.</p><p>Sandoz's salmeterol/fluticasone product, AirFluSal Forspiro, has been approved in a number of European countries. AirFluSal was first approved in Denmark, and has now been launched in a dozen European countries, as well as South Korea and Mexico, Sandoz said in March.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ciplas-Advair-generic-hits-Europe-eyes-Breo-version-353665" target="_new">Cipla</a> has launched its generic Advair MDI &ndash; marketed as Serroflo in Germany and Salmeterol/Fluticasone Cipla in Sweden. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-gets-first-generic-approvals-for-Advair-MDI-349093" target="_new">Glenmark</a> had earlier received approvals for its generic Advair MDI in Mexico and the Philippines. </p><p>GSK's Seretide is among the top three pharmaceutical brands in Europe with sales of $2.24bn as per IMS data. GSK had earlier said that it expects global Seretide/Advair sales to continue to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-2014-revenues-fall-but-shares-climb-on-upbeat-respiratory-talk-356544" target="_new">decline</a> in 2015 given sustained price pressure in the US and Europe, generic competition in Europe and continued uptake of its new respiratory portfolio. </p><h2>Celon Deal Details</h2><p>Glenmark said that it has semi-exclusive marketing and distribution rights to the product across 15 European countries including the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Norway and Romania among others. </p><p>The distribution agreement is for a period of 10 years, with an option of a two-year extension.</p><p>Celon will receive from Glenmark an upfront payment followed by certain milestone payments during various stages of the product's development including royalties on sales. </p><p>Analysts anticipate that registration of the Glenmark-Celon product may be around two-three years away in some key markets and Celon could probably rope in an additional partner for some territories as well.</p><p>Earlier this year, Celon tied up with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-links-with-Polish-firm-to-jumpstart-Advair-generic-plans-356840" target="_new">Lupin</a> to jointly develop fluticasone/salmeterol DPI, under which Celon would make supplies to the Indian firm. Lupin is responsible for commercialization in the US, Canada, Mexico, and other key markets. </p><p>GSK was reported some years ago to have filed a copyright infringement suit against Celon though the latest position on this was not immediately clear. Celon was later reported as saying that its product (marketed as Salmex) is equivalent to Seretide.</p>
