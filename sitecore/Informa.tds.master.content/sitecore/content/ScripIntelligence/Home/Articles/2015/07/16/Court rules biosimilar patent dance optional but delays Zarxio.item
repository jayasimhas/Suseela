<p>Amgen might have won the battle, but it didn't win the war in a court fight involving Novartis unit Sandoz's Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) &ndash; the first biosimilar ever approved in the US.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on 21 July ruled that Sandoz must wait 180 days from the FDA's approval of Zarxio before the company can sell the biosimilar in the US &ndash; meaning, the drug can't enter the American market until 2 September.</p><p>But the court also gave Sandoz and other makers of biosimilars a major win &ndash; declaring the company took a path "expressly contemplated" by Congress and the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act </i>(BPCIA) and did not violate the law by not disclosing its 351(k) application and the manufacturing information by the statutory deadline, or in other words, the judges said it's OK not to engage in the so-called patent dance.</p><p>The ruling was the first time the BPCIA was put to the test at the Federal Circuit.</p><p>"We do our best to unravel the riddle, solve the mystery and comprehend the enigma," Circuit Judge Alan Lourie declared in describing the complexity of the BPCIA &ndash; stealing a quote from famed UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill.</p><p>BPCIA, enacted as part of the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> in 2010, is the law that created the regulatory pathway for the FDA to approve biosimilars.</p><p>Zarxio made history in March when it became the first biosimilar <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">approved</a> by the FDA for the US market.</p><p>But Amgen, whose human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) was the drug on which Zarxio was referenced, has tried to keep Sandoz from marketing its product &ndash; asserting in a lawsuit filed last October in the District Court for the Northern District of California that the Novartis unit had violated the "patent dance" disclosure and negotiation procedure requirements under BPCIA by "unlawfully" withholding its 351(k) and manufacturing information from the California biotech giant.</p><p>Amgen insisted the "shall" used in the information disclosure provision of the law meant mandatory, while Sandoz interpreted it as only a condition precedent to engaging in the information-exchange process.</p><p>The court concluded latter provisions in BPCIA indicated the use of "shall" in the disclosure provision did not mean "must." </p><p>"BPCIA has no other provision that grants a procedural right to compel compliance with the disclosure requirement," the judges said.</p><p>"We welcome the Federal Circuit's finding that the BPCIA's 'patent dance' is optional," Sandoz spokesman Eric Althoff told <i>Scrip</i> in an emailed statement. "As we have argued all along, the failure of a biosimilar applicant to provide its dossier as one step in the patent dance entitles the brand under the BPCIA to commence patent infringement proceedings, which Amgen has done here."</p><p>Dr Bertrand Liang, CEO of Pfenex and chairman of the Biosimilars Council, part of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, said the Federal Circuit's decision "provides important clarity" for biosimilar and reference product manufacturers. </p><p>"The ruling ensures that a biosimilar manufacturer can pursue the most expeditious avenue for resolving patent disputes, so that patients, supply chain stakeholders and the entire US healthcare system will benefit from timely access to more affordable alternatives to costly brand biologics," Dr Liang said.</p><p>He said the ruling also would improve business planning and decision making around the patent litigation process for biosimilar and reference product manufacturers.</p><p><b>After-license notice</b></p><p>Amgen acknowledged it lost on the patent dance question at the Federal Circuit, but in a statement to <i>Scrip</i>, pointed out it won on the requirement for product approval before a biosimilar maker gives the 180 days notice of commercial marketing of a biologic copycat.</p><p>In its lawsuit, the firm insisted that giving notice after FDA licensure provides time for innovator firms to seek a preliminary injunction and to resolve patent disputes in a timely fashion. </p><p>Allowing 351(k) applicants to give notice before the FDA licenses a biosimilar would be irreconcilable with the law's text and purpose, Amgen <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">argued last month</a> before the Federal Circuit.</p><p>Sandoz, however, contended the plain terms of the notice provision are satisfied when an applicant provides notice at least 180 days before it commercially markets its product.</p><p>It insisted it gave Amgen proper notice when it sent a letter to the company on 25 July 2014 acknowledging the FDA had accepted the Swiss firm's 351(k) application.</p><p>Sandoz contended that if the court gave into Amgen's pleas, the notice provision would be transformed, allowing an improper automatic additional six-month extension of BPCIA's 12-year exclusivity period.</p><p>But the Federal Circuit sided with Amgen &ndash; declaring that a 351(k) applicant "may only give effective notice of commercial marketing after the FDA has licensed its product." </p><p>"The statutory language compels such an interpretation," the court said. "We believe that Congress intended the notice to follow licensure, at which time the product, its therapeutic uses, and its manufacturing processes are fixed."</p><p>The court based its argument on the fact that when a biosimilar maker files its application, "it likely does not know for certain when, or if, it will obtain FDA licensure."</p><p>"The FDA could request changes to the product during the review process, or it could approve some but not all sought-for uses," the appeals judges said.</p><p>Therefore, the court said, Sandoz may not market Zarxio before 180 days from 6 March, which would be 2 September.</p><p>But the court also said the "extra" 180 days Amgen is getting "will not likely be the usual case," because expectations are that 351(k)s will often be filed during the 12-year exclusivity period for other products.</p><p>Sandoz filed its biosimilars application for Zarxio 23 years after Amgen obtained the FDA approval for Neupogen.</p><p>"A statute must be interpreted as it is enacted, not especially in light of particular, untypical facts of a given case," the court said.</p><p>The court also said it was extending to 2 September an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-court-delays-NovartisSandoz-biosimilar-Zarxios-marketing-358232" target="_new">injunction</a> Amgen won in May to keep Sandoz from marketing Zarxio &ndash; an action that essentially rendered moot Amgen's appeal of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-others-avoid-patent-dance-after-Sandoz-court-win-357429" target="_new">district court's dismissal</a> of the firm's unfair competition claim based on the alleged violation of BPCIA.</p><p>Amgen's lawsuit also accused Sandoz of violating Neupogen's '427 method patent.</p><p>But the Federal Circuit remanded the claim and counterclaims relating to the '427 patent infringement, validity and enforceability back to the district court.</p><p>Amgen did not comment on whether it would take the patent dance ruling to the Supreme Court, but court watchers have predicted the question &ndash; whether brought by the California company or another firm &ndash; could eventually end up with the justices.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
