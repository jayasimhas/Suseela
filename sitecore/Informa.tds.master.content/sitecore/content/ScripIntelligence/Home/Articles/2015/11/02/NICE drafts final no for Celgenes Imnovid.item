<p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, has issued final draft guidance rejecting Celgene's Imnovid (pomalidomide) for multiple myeloma. </p><p>The drug was reviewed in combination with dexamethasone as a third-line treatment after bortezomib and lenalidomide, but NICE found that it was not value for money. The institute said that: "ICERs [incremental cost effectiveness ratios] for pomalidomide presented were over &pound;50,000 per QALY [quality adjusted life year] gained compared with bortezomib, and over &pound;70,000 per QALY gained compared with bendamustine plus thalidomide and dexamethasone, and would further increase when a number of more realistic assumptions were included in the model." NICE's usual threshold for cost effectiveness in the case of drugs which extend the end of life, such as Imnovid, is &pound;50,000.</p><p>NICE was also not convinced about the drug's benefits. Its committee noted that "there was substantial uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of pomalidomide compared with current care."</p><p>Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE's chief executive, said: "NICE has already recommended a number of treatment options for multiple myeloma &ndash; thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide &ndash; which can greatly improve the length of time someone can live with the disease and their quality of life. Unfortunately we cannot recommend pomalidomide as the analyses from Celgene showed that the drug does not offer enough benefit to justify its high price."</p><p>The final draft guidance is not a huge surprise, as it is in line with NICE's earlier draft guidance (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-refuses-Dendreons-Provenge-Celgenes-Imnovid-in-draft-guidance-354510" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 16 October 2014). However, it is still a blow to Celgene. The company has forecast 2017 sales of $1.5bn from Imnovid (marketed as Pomalyst in the US), but the drug is currently a long way off that figure. Full-year sales for 2014 were $680m (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/4Q-EARNINGS-Celgene-growth-on-track-for-2015-and-beyond-356451" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 30 January 2015).</p><p>Luckily for Celgene, it has found some space in the UK market. The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently accepted the drug for use on the NHS despite concerns about its high price (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Scotland-reimburses-five-drugs-including-two-NICE-rejects-355529" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 9 December 2014). And following a cost-effectiveness assessment, the Cancer Drugs Fund has retained Imnovid for use in England (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cancer-Drugs-Fund-table-12-drugs-delisted-six-refused-entry-356128" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 13 January 2015). </p><p>Celgene still has an opportunity to appeal NICE's decision before binding final guidance is issued later this year.</p>
