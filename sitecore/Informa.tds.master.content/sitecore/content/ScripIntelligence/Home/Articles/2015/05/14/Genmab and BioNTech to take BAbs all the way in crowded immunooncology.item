<p>Two European science-driven companies that retain ambitions to grow into independent sales-based pharmaceutical firms are to collaborate in immuno-oncology. Genmab and BioNTech (which also recently announced a separate deal with Eli Lilly) announced on 19 May that they would jointly research, develop and commercialize bispecific antibody (BAb) products. Both firms told <i>Scrip</i> that they had each the will and resources to commercialize any resultant products without licensing out to larger pharmaceutical third-parties.</p><p>The deal funnels some 200 of BioNTech's well-characterized proprietary antibodies through Genmab's DuoBody technology platform to produce bispecific antibodies with dual functionality. Neither company would elaborate on the anticipated timeline for development. However, the deal is structured to allow product candidates that emerge to be taken forward jointly or by either partner independently if no agreement on co-development can be reached. </p><p>"We are focused on building a sustainably profitable company," said Jan van de Winkel, CEO of Copenhagen-based Genmab, "and I firmly believe the way to do that is to hold on to 50% or more of the rights to future products."</p><p>Genmab is well capitalized: at the end of March 2015, it had DKK2.945bn ($430m) in cash and equivalents with a revenue stream of DKK100-200m per quarter largely composed of milestone and royalty payments from products licensed to GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen and others. It last raised money through a DKK900m private placement in 2014.</p><p>BioNTech's CEO, Ugur Sahin, is equally confident that it can take products forward without the participation of Big Pharma: "BioNTech's plan is to develop the assets first and then raise the money for their full development," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Most of BioNTech's &euro;180m-plus funding comes from private investors, principally from ATS Beteiligungsverwaltung, the family investment firm of pharma billionaires Andreas and Thomas Str√ºngmann.</p><p>For BioNTech, after a gestation period of more than six years from the company's foundation in 2008, this is the second immunotherapy deal in eight days: on 11 May, it announced an R&D and out-licensing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mysterious-BioNTech-strikes-60m-plus-cancer-T-cell-deal-with-Lilly-358382" target="_new">agreement with Eli Lilly</a> on its T cell therapy assets. </p><p>Sean Marett, BioNTech's chief operating officer, stressed that there was no crossover between the Lilly agreement and the new collaboration with Genmab: "Lilly is about cell products, Genmab is about immunomodulatory antibodies. None of the targets are the same. It's completely different. There is no overlap at all."</p><p>The Genmab-BioNTech deal appear to be based on mutual respect for the fundamental science at the two companies and the need to reach beyond the first generations of immuno-oncology products based on PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p>"BioNTech has world class expertise in immuno-oncology and already demonstrated some amazing proofs-of-concept based on combined targeting of agonistic immune checkpoints," said Genmab's Dr van de Winkel. "We are impressed by their rigorous science-driven approach, which [&#8230;] fits with our mindset and way of working."</p><p>"We are aiming at the next level of immune oncology products." explained Professor Dr Sahin. "The reason to partner with Genmab is not the upfront fee [$10m from Genmab to BioNTech], but access to the Duobody technology. Immuno-oncology is going to be crowded, so we need to develop products that will compete even though they are not the first, second or third to market."</p><p>Professor Dr Sahin explained that, unlike some other bispecific antibody platforms, Genmab's Duobody system both facilitates early preclinical candidate selection and allows the rapid production of clinical grade products with properties that are familiar to manufacturers and regulators: "The products are like normal IgG antibodies," he said: "They have a long half-life, are stable, and have no artificial added domains." </p><p>He added that BioNTech had considered developing its own BAb platform but had concluded that a deal with Genmab would get products into the clinic 18 months sooner.</p><p>Beyond the $10m upfront fee paid to BioNTech and the prospect of another $5m if particular BioNTech assets progress, no financial or timing details on the deal were available.</p><p>
