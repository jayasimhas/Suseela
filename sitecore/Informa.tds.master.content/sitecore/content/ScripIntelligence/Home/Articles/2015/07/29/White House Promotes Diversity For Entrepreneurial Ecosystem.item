<p>It's not every day a small startup life sciences company gets invited to demonstrate its invention at the White House for the president of the United States.</p><p>But that's what happened to Joe Landolina, the CEO and co-founder of New York-based biotech Suneris, which is developing an algae-derived gel, known as Vetigel, which is intended to be used to stop traumatic bleeding in less than 10 seconds without the need to apply pressure.</p><p>Mr Landolina was among the leaders of about 30 other startups in the life sciences, high-tech and other sectors, who were joined by about 100 other innovators, gathered at the White House on Aug. 4 for its first-ever Demo Day.</p><p>President Barack Obama used the event to promote the need for more diversity in the US entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p><p>At the event, the president said he had gained the commitments from 45 venture capital firms, including Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Third Rock Ventures and Polaris Partners, representing $112bn in assets under management invested in nearly 7,000 startups to advance investment and other entrepreneurial opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities.</p><p>Those promises came in a letter to the president from the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), signed by the firms.</p><p>"Right now," President Obama lamented, "fewer than 3% of venture capital-backed companies have a woman as their CEO."</p><p>Another study, he said, showed that fewer than 1% of VC-backed firms have an African American founder. </p><p>"Yet we've seen again and again that companies with diverse leadership often outperform those that don't," President Obama declared, noting that startups and young firms account for almost 40% of new hires in the US.</p><p>Each of the VCs agreed to certain commitments in the Aug. 4 letter to Mr Obama, but they also had separate pledges they made.</p><p>For instance, J&J Innovation pledged to encourage portfolio firms to consider diverse slates and hires for company roles, including external board seats, and ensure diversity on panels and events it hosts or moderates, among other commitments.</p><p>Another life sciences VC firm, Polaris Partners, said it would promote inclusion and diversity in its company, portfolio and community by supporting, sponsoring and hosting conferences, symposiums and discussions designed and developed exclusively for women and minorities. </p><p>It said it also would partner with universities in the New England region in mentoring and educational programming to encourage women and minority students to pursue careers in entrepreneurship and innovation. </p><p>Polaris said it also would proactively sponsor and recruit diverse candidates for portfolio company executive positions and board seats at its firms, as well as at Polaris itself.</p><p>"The president is issuing a call to action to encourage all kinds of stakeholders to move the needle," Tom Kalil, deputy director for technology and innovation at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told <i>Scrip</i>. "We're delighted to see the strong response."</p><p>But Bobby Franklin, president and CEO of NVCA, acknowledged it's likely "going to take a long time and effort to make sure the venture industry and entrepreneurial ecosystem is more reflective of our population, more inclusive, not only for women, but for minorities."</p><p>The letter to President Obama with the commitments from the 45 VCs was only the "first step" towards getting to that goal, he told <i>Scrip</i> in an interview at the White House.</p><p>Mr Franklin, who noted overall VC investment currently is up, said his organization is working on sharing more tools, best practices and solutions to help venture capitalists "make a difference" in advancing more opportunities for women and minorities.</p><p>He said NVCA just last week launched a new <a href="http://nvca.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0PdcCdKotFVoKYB?utm_source=qualtrics&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=venture+census" target="_new">census survey</a> with Dow Jones VentureSource and CrunchBase to measure the diversity of the US startup ecosystem "to get a really good data set on where we are."</p><p>"You can't improve what you don't measure," Mr Franklin said. </p><p>He said NVCA is hoping to get as many responses as possible to the survey from startups, venture firms, accelerators and other supporting innovation.</p><p>Mr Franklin said the results of the survey are expected this fall.</p><p>As for Suneris, Mr Landolina, who developed his technology while he was a student at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in New York, said his company is working on commercializing Vetigel in the US and UK animal treatment markets. </p><p>But he said Suneris also is seeking to develop the product for human use in surgery and also in the emergency room and on the military battlefield. </p><p>Mr Landolina said he "stumbled onto the technology that became Vetigel" when he was 17 years old when he was "playing around with a lot of plant extracts."</p><p>"I realized I could get an extract of algae that would reassemble very quickly," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Mr Landolina said his original idea was to inject the product into bullet wounds to stop bleeding &ndash; essentially "plugging it up."</p><p>He said his firm, which currently is backed by private funds, plans to expand its facilities to a much larger FDA-compliant facility to support the production of Vetigel and future products. </p><p>Biotech entrepreneur Ignacio Pino Mayaguez, president of Puerto Rico-based CDI Laboratories, also was among the demonstrators at the Aug. 4 White House event, where he explained how his firm produces research-grade protein and antibody products intended to support scientific research on cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases. </p><p>Mr Mayaguez told <i>Scrip</i> his company is participating in a pilot program funded by the National Institutes of Health's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wacky-science-today-may-be-tomorrows-next-big-thing-352435" target="_new">Common Fund</a> called the Protein Capture Reagents Program, which is developing new resources and tools to understand the critical role the multitude of cellular proteins play in health and disease.</p><p>The resources from the program are intended to support a wide-range of research and clinical applications by enabling the isolation and tracking of proteins of interest, according to the NIH.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
