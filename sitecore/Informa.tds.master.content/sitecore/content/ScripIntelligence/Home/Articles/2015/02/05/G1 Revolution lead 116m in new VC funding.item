<p>Count G1 Therapeutics and Revolution Medicines among the biotechnology companies benefitting from a 2014 boom in venture capital funding that has spilled over into 2015.</p><p>Cancer-focused G1 in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina raised a $33m Series B VC funding round to advance its Phase I selective CDK4/6 inhibitor G1T28, while Third Rock Ventures was the sole investor in a $45m Series A round to accelerate Redwood City, California-based Revolution's discovery and development of therapies derived from natural products. Just a few days into February, biotech seems well on its way to exceeding the near-record $6bn in venture capital raised in 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-raised-6bn-in-2014-venture-capital-most-since-2007-356200" target="_new">17 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>G1 eyes Phase Ib/IIa starts in 2015</b></p><p>G1 Therapeutics CEO Mark Valleca said G1T28 has the potential to be a best-in-class drug, with reduced gastrointestinal and other side effects compared with more advanced CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as the Phase III candidates abemaciclib from Eli Lilly and LEE011 from Novartis and the recently approved Ibrance (palbociclib) from Pfizer (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-wins-early-Ibrance-approval-in-breast-cancer-356525" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>G1 completed a Phase Ia clinical trial for its intravenous formulation of G1T28 in healthy volunteers and the company will use its Series B cash to initiate a Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial in the second quarter of this year to test the IV drug in lung cancer patients as a chemoprotective agent meant to protect bone marrow from chemotherapy's effects.</p><p>"It essentially puts the bone marrow to sleep so the chemotherapy won't kill it," Dr Velleca said, noting that patients should experience reduced chemo-related side effects, such as anemia and neutropenia.</p><p>G1's new venture capital also will fund initiation of a Phase Ib/IIa trial in the fourth quarter of 2015 for an oral formulation of G1T28. The drug will be tested in combination with another targeted therapy in the treatment of a type of cancer that's yet to be determined. </p><p>Dr Velleca said G1 could have data from the IV study in early 2017 with results from the oral G1T28 study available about a year after the study's late 2015 initiation, depending on the cancer indication selected for the clinical trial. The company also may have enough funding to initiate an additional trial for both the IV and the oral formulations of G1T28.</p><p>Eshelman Ventures and RA Capital Management led the Series B round with participation from new investors Lumira Capital and Boxer Capital of Tavistock Life Sciences as well as Series A investors Hatteras Venture Partners, Mountain Group Capital and MedImmune Ventures (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MedImmune-venture-capital-arm-leads-financing-of-cancer-drug-developer-G1-347415" target="_new">16 October 2013</a>).</p><p><b>Revolution targets natural products in infectious and other diseases</b></p><p>Revolution, another startup from the frequent biotech company founder Third Rock, licensed a platform developed by chemistry professor Martin Burke from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to synthesize novel compounds that are analogues of complex natural products. Dr Burke's lab created chemical building blocks that can be modified and rearranged to simplify complex natural products and turn the molecules into more effective and safer therapies.</p><p>The lead therapeutic program is focused on amphotericin B, a broad-spectrum antifungal compound that is effective, but causes severe kidney side effects that limits its use to patients who are out of treatment alternatives.</p><p>"The mission of our company is redesigning evolution's products to treat diseases," Revolution president and CEO, and Third Rock partner, Mark Goldsmith said.</p><p>The company has a second set of natural product analogues that will be developed as antibacterial agents. A third set of natural product analogues includes molecules derived from microbes to be applied to various human disease targets.</p><p>Dr Goldsmith said Revolution is not providing any timelines for taking its lead program or one of its other two portfolios into the clinic. The company does not intend to license its technology platform to pharma or other collaborators, but it may consider development partners for individual compounds.</p><p>Revolution has 12 employees now and will hire several more people in 2015 and 2016 to support in-house research and development activities, which will be supported by Dr Burke in an advisory role.</p><p>"The aspirations of the company are big and in order to pursue multiple programs and a product engine, we need to build staff. This isn't the sort of company that would work well in virtual mode," Dr Goldsmith said. </p><p><b>Three more VC deals to kick off February</b></p><p>Among other recent venture capital financing deals during the first week of February:</p><p>? Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Lysosomal Therapeutics Inc (LTI) raised $20m in Series A financing from its existing investors, including Atlas Venture, Hatteras Venture Partners and Partners Innovation Fund as well as three corporate venture funds &ndash; Lilly Ventures, Sanofi-Genzyme BioVentures and Roche Venture Fund. LTI's angel investors also participated in the Series A, including Orion Equity Partners and company co-founders Henri Termeer (Genzyme's former president and CEO) with Bob Carpenter. LTI will use its lysosomal biology expertise to develop treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, including its lead program in preclinical development for Parkinson's disease. The company also has funding from the Michael J Fox Foundation to identify biomarkers that will be used to select clinical trial participants.</p><p>? WaVe Life Sciences in Boston and in Okinawa, Japan raised $18m in a Series A round led by RA Capital Management and Shinsangyo Sosei Investment with SNBL Ltd. The company is developing stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics, including antisense (RNA-based) therapies and exon-skipping drugs, across many therapeutic areas. WaVe will use its technology to design simpler oligonucleotide structures. All programs are in preclinical development.</p><p>? Miami, Florida-based Brickell Biotech raised a $10m Series C round for the development of new molecular entities for dermatology indications, including hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), atopic dermatitis and acne. The funding round was led by Brickell chairman Charlie Stiefel, former chairman and CEO of Stiefel Laboratories, which GlaxoSmithKline acquired in 2009. Prior Brickell investors, current managers and others also backed the Series C financing. The company has a Phase IIb study under way to test lead drug candidate BBI-4000, a novel topical soft anticholinergic, in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis.</p><p><p><p><p>
