<p><p>Repercussions of multiple clinical failures are finally coming down the pike for Xoma as the company is forced to cut 30% of its workforce to conserve cash as it searches for alternatives. </p><p>The biotech announced in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 25 that it cut 58 staff members from across its workforce earlier this week. About 134 people remain on staff. The cuts include Xoma's chief commercial officer &ndash; a position the company is unlikely to need at this point. </p><p>Xoma will pay out about $2.3m in severance and costs related to the workforce reduction. </p><p>Xoma's problems began in earnest in March 2014 when its lead compound, the interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta modulator gevokizumab failed in midstage studies to show a treatment effect, pushing the company to end programs in diabetes, acne and osteoarthritis. </p><p>Despite the poor results in those programs, Xoma and partner Servier pushed on in three Phase III studies of the drug in a variety of conditions including non-infections uveitis (NIU), Behcet's uveitis and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).</p><p>The first of those reported out in July and resulted in <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Xoma-sinks-on-1st-Phase-III-gevokizumab-failure-359577" target="_new">another failure</a> for the drug. Gevokizumab did not achieve the primary endpoint in EYEGUARD-B of improvement in time to first acute ocular exacerbation versus placebo. While the companies claim there was some clinical activity, it wasn't statistically significant. </p><p>The biotech has said previously that it is exploring strategic options; so far, no M&A activity has been presented to shareholders. With its lead asset failing in multiple indications, Xoma has little else to offer a potential acquirer. The company currently has a Phase I asset in diabetes and a preclinical asset for immuno-oncology and fibrosis indications &ndash; neither proven. </p><p>Xoma's stock dropped below $1 per share after the July news and has failed to cross that threshold again. The biotech had traded as high as $5.95 over the last year. </p><p><p>
