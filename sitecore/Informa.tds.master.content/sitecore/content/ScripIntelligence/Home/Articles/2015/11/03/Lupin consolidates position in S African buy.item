<p>Lupin is consolidating its holding in South Africa's Pharma Dynamics, the third largest generic firm in the prescriptions market there and a leader in the cardiovascular space.</p><p>Lupin is to acquire the 40% in Pharma Dynamics that it does not already own, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. It also noted that Africa was fast emerging as one of the "growth engines" of the future.</p><p>The South African firm's founders are to exercise their "put option" before 31 March for the 40% equity stake they currently hold, a statement from Lupin said. </p><p>In 2008, Lupin acquired a 60% holding in Pharma Dynamics, though the firm's founder Paul Anley retained significant equity.</p><p>Mr Anley has agreed to stay on as the firm's CEO, Lupin said. </p><h2>Pharma Dynamics</h2><p>Founded in 2001, Pharma Dynamics distributes a range of branded generic prescription medicines and over-the-counter (OTC) products in South Africa and certain key markets across the African continent.</p><p>It is the biggest supplier of cardiovascular medicines in South Africa by both value and volumes and also had products in the central nervous system, gastrointestinal, diabetes, gynecological and male health segments. 2013 saw the firm commence supplies of intravenous antibiotics to hospitals. The company filed for and registered 10 products during fiscal 2014 and reported revenues of ZAR638m ($51m; +28%), as per details in Lupin's annual report for 2013-14.</p><p>The South African pharmaceutical market is estimated at about $3.5bn, and the generics segment grew by 6% in value terms during fiscal 2014. The market has seen a spurt of activity over the recent past with GlaxoSmithKline recently selling about half of its 12.4% stake in South Africa's largest listed pharma firm Aspen Pharmacare <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-to-jettison-half-Aspen-stake-to-fund-reshape-357269%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 12 March 2015)</a>. Cipla, which sealed the 100% acquisition of Cipla Medpro in South Africa in 2013, said last month that it sees a "step change" in its portfolio there after the Competition Commission cleared its marketing collaboration with Teva. The deal gives the Indian firm access to 65 new molecules.</p>
