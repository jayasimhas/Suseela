<p>After decades of pursuing drug development in much the same way, one thing the biopharmaceutical industry has learned is "this stuff is hard" and it oftentimes has been a rough road going it alone, said Dr Mark McClellan, a senior fellow and director of the Health Care Innovation and Value Initiative at the Washington-based think tank the Brookings Institution. </p><p>Now, though, drug companies more and more are teaming up with others &ndash; be it the National Institutes of Health (NIH), patient advocacy groups and other nonprofits or other biopharmaceutical makers &ndash; in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Consortia-tide-rising-Does-it-float-your-boat-352571" target="_new">public-private partnerships</a> for their clinical trials, Dr McClellan, a former head of the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, noted during a 13 March Washington forum hosted by Brookings.</p><p>Indeed, those types of collaborations are even a key theme of the current legislative efforts in the House and the Senate aimed at improving and expediting the research, development and regulatory review processes &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">21st Century Cures</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">Healthier Americans</a>, respectively &ndash; with many of the proposals currently being discussed based on promising ideas and initiatives already underway as part of multi-stakeholder partnerships, he said.</p><p>Projects like the Lung Cancer Master Protocol (Lung-MAP) trial, the I-Spy 2 breast cancer study and the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP) are all examples of the willingness for clinical trials collaborations, Dr McClellan said.</p><p>But, he pointed out, those partnerships haven't happened quickly or easily.</p><p>"It's not a walk in the park," said Dr Jeff Allen, executive director of the Friends of Cancer Research, whose organization is one of the leading partners in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lung-MAP-aims-for-faster-more-precise-trials-352365" target="_new">Lung-MAP</a> trial, a collaboration of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), five drug makers and a group of nonprofits, which is using a master protocol approach for matching the most appropriate experimental medicine to the right patient. </p><p>"But I think as we get better at this and we understand how to collaborate better and understand what each organization and entity needs to put into these successful partnerships, hopefully they will be able to become more routine and get up and running even faster than they have today," Dr Allen said.</p><p>One of the greatest barriers public-private collaborations face is "getting over the 'it can't be done' philosophy," said Dr William Chin, executive vice president of science and regulatory advocacy at the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). </p><p>He said the NIH's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Aligning-cultures-putting-skin-in-the-game-Collins-explains-349818" target="_new">AMP</a> project &ndash; a $230m five-year venture with 10 biopharmaceutical companies and several nonprofits aimed at using biomarkers to accelerate the development of new diagnostics and targeted therapies, with the hopes of reducing the costs and increasing the chances those products will succeed &ndash; is one "phenomenal" collaboration that was able to get past that roadblock. </p><p>Trust must be at the center of any collaboration, declared Dr Pamela Tenaerts, executive director of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative, a public-private partnership involving government, industry, patient advocates and other stakeholders formed to identify and promote practices to increase the quality and efficiency of clinical studies.</p><p>"If you have trust, you can have the hard discussions," Dr Tenaerts said. </p><p>Part of that, she said, is making sure all players have a seat at the table, which ensures all voices are heard and "equalizes the playing field."</p><p>"Everyone has to agree we are going to do business differently and what the goal is," Dr Allen added.</p><p>While the costs per patient in LungMAP are about half those in traditional Phase III studies, Dr Allen emphasized that the point of forming a collaboration is to bring together critical expertise, not to replace resources.</p><p>The panelists at the Brookings Institute's 2015 Biomedical Innovation Conference all acknowledged public-private partnerships are not a fix-all for the problems currently plaguing the clinical trials process.</p><p>"There's a lot of agreement there are many opportunities to make clinical trials process more efficient, but there's some challenges getting there," Dr McClellan said.</p><p>PhRMA's Dr Chin noted that recruiting continues to be difficult, especially for minority populations, which "are greatly underrepresented" in clinical studies. </p><p>What would help, he said, is making primary care doctors part of the discussions and decisions for clinical trials and figuring out "How do we help physicians help us in this process."</p><p>"A critical part about this system is the healthcare providers," Dr Chin said.</p><p>Another barrier is the dearth of clinical scientists needed to conduct the trials, he said.</p><p>While there's been some progress in the US on training programs for those types of researchers at universities like Harvard and Duke and the NIH's Clinical Translation Science Awards, it's nonetheless been slow, Dr Chin said.</p><p>"It's hopeful, but it may not be enough," he said.</p><p>Using individual institutional review boards (IRBs) for studies also can cost time in getting a trial off the ground &ndash; eventually affecting the timeline for a drug to make it to patients, Dr Tenaerts said.</p><p>She urged greater use of a central IRB, also called a single IRB of record &ndash; something not currently being done.</p><p>Dr Tenaerts said another problem is making trials too complex.</p><p>An analysis by her organization showed that about 20% of procedures in clinical trials do not tie back to an endpoint.</p><p>"We need to not do things in a clinical trial that don't add to anything, that are never used in the evidence later," Dr Tenaerts said. "You need to think smartly about clinical trials. You need to think about what you are trying to do and don't just do things in the past just because they've worked."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Patent-office-gets-permanent-chief-after-2-year-vacancy-357297" target="_new">Patent office gets permanent chief after 2-year vacancy</a></p><p>The head of the US Commerce Department chose the annual South by Southwest original music, independent films, and emerging technologies festival in Austin, Texas on 13 March to swear in the new chief of the US Patents & Trademarks Office (US PTO) Michelle Lee, who was unanimously confirmed to the job five days earlier by the US Senate.
