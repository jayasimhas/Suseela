<p>Sangamo Biosciences touted the progress of its <i>in vivo</i> protein replacement platform (IVPRP) as it reported that Shire relinquished its rights to hemophilia programs under the companies' three-year-old collaboration, but investors were wary about the loss of an important alliance for two out or four partnered programs as well as the exchange of milestone fees for total control of preclinical assets.</p><p>Sangamo president and CEO Edward Lanphier said on Sept. 2 that the Richmond, California-based company's cash balance was not dependent on milestone fees that Shire was expected to pay under the partners' 2012 agreement, so their new deal will not affect Sangamo's ability to advance eight therapeutic candidates toward the clinic during the next 16 months. Despite the "all is well" message, investors sent the company's stock down 6.5% to close at $7.15 per share, nearing Sangamo's 52-week low of $6.65 and bringing its market cap to $499.5m.</p><p>"This has really no impact on our balance sheet," Lanphier told <i>Scrip</i>, since the company's prior guidance for $180m in cash at the end of 2015 is unchanged.</p><p>However, Jefferies analyst Chris Howerton pointed out in a Sept. 2 research note that Sangamo reduced its full-year 2015 revenue expectations to a range of $35m to $40m versus prior guidance of $60m to $70m and this year's operating expenses are now expected to total $90m to $100m versus $100m to $110m previously. </p><p>Howerton lowered his Sangamo stock price target from $22 to $12, because "timeline delays and [the Shire] decision to return rights for hemophilia suggest increased risks to these programs (such as increased competition or a potential technical issue)," he wrote.</p><p>Lanphier insisted that the there was no dissatisfaction with Sangamo's technology, only that Shire had refocused on rare diseases &ndash; particularly diseases involving the central nervous system &ndash; and Sangamo had refocused on its IVPRP platform. The companies' revised their partnership agreement to reflect each other's strategic focus.</p><p>Shire echoed the sentiment in a statement given to <i>Scrip</i>: "The restructured agreement with Sangamo is based on a specific portfolio of assets, aligned with the best interests and strengths of our two companies. Shire is committed to advancing important work for patients."</p><p><b>New Deal Terms</b></p><p>Shire will return to Sangamo exclusive worldwide rights to gene targets for zinc finger DNA-binding protein (ZFP) therapeutics for hemophilia A and hemophilia B, but Shire will retain rights associated with ZFP therapeutics for Huntington's disease and an unnamed gene target. Sangamo granted Shire a right of first negotiation to license the hemophilia A and B programs if Sangamo goes in search of a development partner based on future clinical trial results.</p><p>Shire will fund Sangamo's research costs for the remaining partnered programs in Huntington's disease and an unnamed genetic disease, but the Irish specialty pharma company will pay no more milestone fees for either ZFP therapeutic. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sangamo-receives-13m-upfront-in-Shire-haemophilia-deal-326564" target="_new">original deal gave Shire $13m up front</a> and up to $213.5m in milestone payments plus tiered, double-digit royalties.</p><p>Under the revised agreement, Sangamo will earn low single-digit royalties capped at an unspecified "modest" amount for any therapies that Shire commercializes. Sangamo also will owe Shire similar capped, low single-digit royalties on the hemophilia programs, presumably to compensate Shire for the investments it made in Sangamo's IVPRP platform during the first three and a half years of the companies' relationship.</p><p>Lanphier noted during a Sept. 2 conference call with analysts and investors to go over the restructured partnership that Sangamo's IVPRP platform was developed "with significant funding from Shire and [we] have leveraged that investment and strategy with considerable success for our own programs" in lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). </p><p>Sangamo's IVPRP platform for ZFP therapeutics involves the insertion of a corrective therapeutic replacement gene into a "safe harbor" site in the genome. The company's technology uses the albumin gene as a safe harbor for its zinc finger nucleases, which contain the DNA sequence for the therapeutic protein that each ZFP therapeutic is designed to express.</p><p><b>Eight INDs By Year-End 2016</b></p><p>Sangamo plans to file eight investigational new drug (IND) applications with the US FDA by the end of 2016, including six IVPRP programs and two assets partnered with Biogen Idec. </p><p>Sangamo received $20m up front in January 2014 and stands to earn up to $300m in milestone payments from Biogen under an agreement to develop <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BioNotebook-SangamoBiogen-AdamasForest-ZymeworksLilly-Sunesis-349218" target="_new">treatments for inherited hemoglobinopathies</a>, including sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. </p><p>Sangamo plans to file INDs for therapies to treat hemophilia B and Hurler syndrome by the end of 2015; for Hunter syndrome and the Biogen-partnered beta-thalassemia program during the first half of 2016; and for hemophilia A, Gaucher's disease, another LSD and the Biogen-partnered sickle cell program during the second half of 2016.</p><p>"There's enormous value that we think we can add in the next 12 to 24 months," Lanphier said.</p><p>The analyst Howerton said in his report that the impact of Sangamo's restructured agreement with Shire on the company's IND-filing plans is unknown, so Jefferies will not assign any value to the programs until the documents are on file with the FDA or the clinical trials are initiated.</p><p>Sangamo expects to report initial data from its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sangamo-HIV-therapy-gets-boost-from-cyclophosphamide-348612" target="_new">ongoing Phase II clinical trial</a> for its HIV immunotherapy known as SB-728 by the end of 2015 and final data will be available in 2016. The company will seek a partner to help finance Phase III pivotal studies. </p><p><p><p><p>
