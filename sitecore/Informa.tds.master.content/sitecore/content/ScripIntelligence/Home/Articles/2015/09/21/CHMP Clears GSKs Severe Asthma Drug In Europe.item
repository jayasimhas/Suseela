<p>The EMA's CHMP has issued a positive opinion recommending marketing approval for GlaxoSmithKline's mepolizumab, which is to be sold under the brand name Nucala, as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients. </p><p>If approved, mepolizumab will become the first biologic for asthma launched since Roche/Novartis's Xolair (omalizumab).</p><p>The product is a first-in-class interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody, and won the full <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-backs-GSK-severe-asthma-drug-in-adults-not-adolescents-358914" target="_new">support of an FDA advisory panel</a> in June this year for its use in adults. However, the biologics license application for Nucala in the US was submitted for patients aged 12 years and older, but the panel said it could not endorse the use of the drug in adolescents aged 12-17 years because of a lack of safety and efficacy data in that population. </p><p>"However the potential value of the use of mepolizumab in this sub population where there is high unmet need was recognized," a GSK spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>. "As I'm sure you are aware, the advisory committee provides non-binding recommendations for consideration by the FDA, with the final decision on approval made by the FDA."</p><p>In the EU, GSK submitted an MAA for adult patients only. "The proposed indications in the EU and US reflect the different guidance and discussions held with the respective regulatory authorities," explained the spokesperson. </p><p>Asthma is often characterized by an accumulation of eosinophils in lung tissue, and eosinophil levels often correlate with severity and frequency of exacerbations of asthma. IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival, and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. </p><p>Dave Allen, R&D head of GSK's respiratory therapy area, said in a statement, "For these difficult-to-treat patients there are very limited treatment options. Many struggle to control their asthma even when taking high doses of inhaled therapies and are often reliant on daily oral corticosteroids, which can cause serious long-term side effects. This positive opinion brings us a step closer to adding a targeted biologic therapy, specifically developed for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, to our respiratory portfolio."</p><p>Studies have indicated that measuring blood eosinophil count has been shown to be a reliable biomarker for identifying the patient population with severe asthma that is likely to benefit from mepolizumab treatment, GSK has noted.</p><p>
