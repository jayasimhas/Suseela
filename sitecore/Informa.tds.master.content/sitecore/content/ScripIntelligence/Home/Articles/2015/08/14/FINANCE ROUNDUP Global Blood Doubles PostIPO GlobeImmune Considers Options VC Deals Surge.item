<p>Global Blood Therapeutics launched an initial public offering at $20 per share and its stock price more than doubled to $43.11 at the end of its first day of trading on Aug. 12, proving that investors may be concerned about a biotechnology bubble, but they're not overly worried that it will burst soon.</p><p>Then again, while the South San Francisco-based sickle cell drug developer grossed $120m from the sale of 6m shares, it was the only biotech to complete an IPO in the US during the week of Aug. 10 to 14. And GlobeImmune, a company that struggled to price its first-ever offering in 2014, admitted that it's considering a sale or other strategic alternatives. But on the venture capital end of the biotech spectrum, deals surged with three large funding rounds to kick off a busy private financing week.</p><p><b>Mixed Reception For IPOs</b></p><p>Global Blood followed the path of a significant number of biotech firms by pursuing an IPO shortly after the company completed a venture capital financing to fund a proof-of-concept study for GBT440, a prophylactic sickle cell drug. Global Blood closed a $48m Series B round in January during a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-venture-capital-off-to-a-659m-start-in-2015-355964" target="_new">flurry of VC deals</a>, which included a $450m fundraising by Moderna Therapeutics.</p><p>But Benitec Biopharma, an Australian company with two programs in Phase I/IIa, recently had difficulty finding the right price for its US IPO. </p><p>Benitec proposed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Bubble-worries-heighten-after-another-big-Alzheimers-offering-359735" target="_new">an offering of 5m shares</a> at $13.06 each on July 27 for $65m in gross proceeds then said on Aug. 10 that it would gross $25.4m from the sale of almost 1.9m shares at $13.55 each, but the prospective IPO terms were lowered again on Aug. 13 to 1.5m shares at $10 each for $15m in proceeds. The company plans to sell warrants with each American depository share (ADS) that will allow investors to buy additional shares.</p><p><b>GlobeImmune Seeks Alternatives</b></p><p>Speaking of trouble with taking an IPO to market, GlobeImmune whittled its offering from $75m to $35m to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/TABLE-In-turbulent-week-2-IPOs-price-6-test-waters-352673" target="_new">$15m in gross proceeds</a> to list its stock at $10 per share on 1 July 2014. The Louisville, Colorado-based company's share price traded as high as $15 in its first month, but has closed below $11 ever since, falling into the $3 range in May after its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-partner-for-Gilead-after-GlobeImmune-failure-358623" target="_new">hepatitis B drug</a> in development with Gilead Sciences failed in a Phase II study. </p><p>GlobeImmune got a small boost in early August when it revealed that Celgene <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celgene-Opts-Into-GlobeImmune-Drug-359790" target="_new">exercised its option</a> for a Phase II cancer drug candidate under the companies' existing $540m-plus partnership. </p><p>But even with progress under the 2009 Celgene agreement and enough cash to fund its operations through 2016, since its partners are obligated to cover development costs for all current drug candidates, GlobeImmune said on Aug. 13 that it hired Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as a financial advisor to help the company evaluate "strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value."</p><p>GlobeImmune's stock fell 7.3% to $2.42 following the announcement.</p><p><b>Venture Capital Shines</b></p><p>But while the fortunes of publicly-traded companies are fluctuating, venture capital has become a bright spot in biotech as new investors pour cash into VC funds after seeing others reap the rewards of the industry's IPO boom.</p><p>After <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Three-IPOs-and-three-VC-rounds-359836" target="_new">venture capital rounds</a> for Metacrine, Antiva Biosciences and Cold Genesys raised $62m between Aug. 3 and 7, five companies raised $345m between Aug. 10 and 14. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Could-120m-Make-Editas-1st-in-Clinic-With-CRISPR-359904" target="_new">Editas Medicine</a> pulled in $120m in Series B cash, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lets-Make-a-Deal-Levins-Ovid-Raises-75m-359919" target="_new">Ovid Therapeutics</a> closed a $75m Series B round, and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shkrelis-Turing-Raises-90m-Buys-Daraprim-From-Impax-359906" target="_new">Turing Pharmaceuticals</a> put together $90m in Series A financing.</p><p>Also, Rhythm completed a $40m Series A round for its subsidiary Rhythm Metabolic and Checkmate Pharmaceuticals launched with $20m in Series A cash.</p><p>Boston-based Rhythm intended to go public in 2014, but entered into a partnership with Actavis (now Allergan) that gave the big pharma an option to acquire the company's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Deals-from-Five-PrimeGSK-ActavisRhythm-ApricusForendo-a-DARPA-collaboration-and-IPO-news-354667" target="_new">Rhythm Health</a> subsidiary, which is developing the peptide ghrelin agonist relamorelin (RM-131) for diabetic gastroparesis and other gastrointestinal disorders. </p><p>Rhythm Metabolic is developing the other program that its parent company hoped to finance with its IPO &ndash; setmelanotide (RM-493), a novel peptide MC4 agonist to treat Prader-Willi syndrome, POMC deficiency obesity and other forms of obesity caused by genetic deficiencies in the MC4 pathway. The subsidiary's new venture capital will fund two ongoing Phase IIa clinical trials, a third Phase IIa trial, and new clinical and business infrastructure.</p><p>New investors OrbiMed, Deerfield Management, Wellington Management Company and an undisclosed public health care investment fund backed Rhythm Medical's Series B along with prior investors MPM Capital, New Enterprise Associates, Third Rock Ventures, Pfizer Ventures and Ipsen.</p><p>Sofinnova Ventures and venBio financed Checkmate's Series A round, which will support development of novel approaches to cancer immunotherapy. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup has an exclusive license to use a virus-like particle (VLP) platform from Cytos Biotechnology, including the drug candidate CYT003, for the development of oncology programs.</p><p>CYT003 is derived from the CpG class of oligonucleotides and it activates the immune system via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). The drug candidate, which has been tested in more than 700 people, may be able to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and broaden the number of patients that can benefit from the immunotherapies.</p><p><p><p><p>
