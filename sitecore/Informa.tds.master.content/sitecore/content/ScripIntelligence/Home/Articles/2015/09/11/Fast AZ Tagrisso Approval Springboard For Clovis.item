<p><i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) action dates have become meaningless at the FDA's Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, which has almost consistently for the past year or two leaped ahead of those timelines and approved cancer medicines well ahead of schedule &ndash; the most recent being AstraZeneca PLC's lung cancer drug Tagrisso (osimertinib).</p><p>The FDA wasn't due to act on the Tagrisso application until Feb. 6, 2016, but gave its nod to the drug on Nov. 13, granting an accelerated approval of the once-daily oral tablet, which previously was known as AZD9291, as a treatment for patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.</p><p>"This represents one of the fastest development programs ever seen and one of the fastest approvals that was made by the FDA &#8230; not just in oncology, but ever," declared Dave Fredrickson, vice president of specialty care in the US for AstraZeneca.</p><p>Indeed, Tagrisso had gone from entering clinical trials to crossing the regulatory finish line in just over two and a half years.</p><p>Fredrickson noted that to help speed things along, the FDA had granted Tagrisso's application fast-track status and breakthrough therapy designation &ndash; both intended to expedite the R&D and regulatory processes.</p><p>It also was granted a priority review.</p><p>"This all speaks to the high unmet needs, but it also really speaks to the incredible data of Tagrisso and our dedication as a company to make sure this medicine got to patients as absolutely as quickly as possible," Fredrickson told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>When Tagrissio won the priority review in September, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the chances of the drug gaining the FDA's blessing at 96%, which was 14% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Wall Street analysts said the FDA's speedy action on Tagrisso bodes well for a competitor drug &ndash;Clovis Oncology Inc.'s rociletinib &ndash; which is fast on the AstraZeneca medicine's heels, with a PDUFA of March 30, 2016, a timeline analysts are anticipating may now be moved up.</p><p>Shares of Clovis got a slight boost of 1.5%, or $1.52, on Nov. 13, before closing at $99.43, up 2 cents.</p><p>AstraZeneca's shares did only slightly better &ndash; gaining 51 cents, or 1.65%, to close at $31.29, a bump of 44 cents, or 1.4%.</p><p><b>Marketing Tagrisso</b></p><p>Fredrickson said AstraZeneca won't disclose its price for Tagrisso until next week. But he insisted the drug would be priced "comparably to other oral cancer therapies."</p><p>"Every bit as important," he said, is coverage. </p><p>"The final determination of coverage rests with third-party payers, and therefore, can vary," Fredrickson said.</p><p>But, he added, "We really are confident based on a lot of the early conversations along the way that we've been having with third-party payers that Tagrisso will be covered by most commercial insurers. That is something we feel good about."</p><p>Fredrickson said AstraZeneca also has a program in place to ensure patients' affordability of Tagrisso is "front and center."</p><p>"As with all of our medicines, we really want to make sure that we help patients who are prescribed Tagrisso have affordable access so that they can stay on therapy," he said.</p><p>Fredrickson said AstraZeneca is launching an affordability program "so that no commercial patient will pay more than $25 in out-of-pocket costs per month for Tagrisso," which he noted demonstrated an objective response rate of 59% and duration of response of 12.4 months.</p><p>Along with Tagrisso's approval, the FDA also cleared a companion test from Roche Holdings AG's diagnostic unit, cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, which is intended to detect the T790M mutation.</p><p>Fredrickson said AstraZeneca already has a sales force in place to market Tagrisso &ndash; the same team that's currently working on the firm's other NSCLC drug Iressa (gefitinib), an EGFR TKI, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-breathes-new-life-into-AZs-lung-cancer-drug-Iressa-359417" target="_new">reentered the US market</a> this past July as a targeted first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic disease whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations, as identified through a companion diagnostic test from Qiagen NV.</p><p>Iressa actually had previously been on the market as a monotherapy after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies for the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, but AstraZeneca <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-makes-it-official-AstraZenecas-Iressa-Sanofis-Oforta-NDAs-withdrawn-329700" target="_new">withdrew</a> the application in April 2012 after the drug's required postmarketing studies failed to verify and confirm clinical benefit.</p><p>Using the same sales team, said UBS analyst Alexandra Hauber, should allow a fast launch for Tagrisso.</p><p>Fredrickson said Tagrisso would be at specialty pharmacies within a few days and other modes of distribution "where physicians are able to make sure it gets to patient."</p><p>"It is absolutely our number-one priority to make sure we make this available to patients as soon as possible," he said. </p><p>Along with the already established Iressa sales team, AstraZeneca has a full medical science liaison team focused on the lung cancer space that will help educate doctors about Tagrisso, Fredrickson explained.</p><p>"We will ensure that all efforts are being made to get education on our products out to physicians as rapidly as possible and that will be our focus in the days to come," he said.</p><p>Fredrickson declined to disclose the number of field representatives for Tagrisso &ndash; a figure he said AstraZeneca never reveals.</p><p>But, he said, "we are confident it is the right size for the number of physicians and it is competitive relative to what you would see in any other company launching a drug as important as Tagrisso is."</p><p><b>Broader Opportunity</b></p><p>Because Tagrisso gained an accelerated approval, continued marketing of AstraZeneca's drug may be contingent on the completion of a study aimed at confirming the safety and efficacy of the drug.</p><p>Andrew Coop, vice president of medical affairs for oncology at AstraZeneca, pointed out that study &ndash; an open-label randomized Phase III trial designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Tagrisso versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in patients with EGFR T790M positive, locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed following prior therapy with an EGFR-TKI &ndash; already is well underway and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016. </p><p>The drug also is being investigated in the adjuvant setting and in the metastatic first-line setting, including in patients with brain metastases, as well as in combination with other compounds.</p><p>UBS' Hauber had estimated that Tagrisso's 2016 US sales would be about $300m &ndash; $355m globally &ndash; rising to $540m by 2020, reaching $1.8bn worldwide in the currently approved indication.</p><p>But she also said that figure may be difficult to reach in the second-line setting because data reported in September suggested a somewhat less differentiated profile versus Clovis' rociletinib than earlier reported data.</p><p>And, Hauber said, AstraZeneca also provided updated epidemiology data at its second-quarter presentation, which she said suggested smaller patient numbers than quoted at the company's November 2014 capital markets day.</p><p>Nonetheless, she pointed out that the first-line opportunity &ndash; a $2bn to $3bn market &ndash; for Tagrisso is "firming up," based on the "impressive" data reported in September in a cohort of patients in AstraZeneca's Phase I/II study. </p><p>And, Hauber said, data reported just last week of the drug in leptomeningeal disease indicated it may also be able to treat and prevent brains metastasis, which she said should further enhance Tagrisso's potential in first-line lung cancer and also could be an important differentiating feature versus Clovis' experimental medicine, "which does not seem to penetrate" the central nervous system.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
