<p>Takeda's hopes for its first-in-class Aurora kinase inhibitor now rest on Phase II studies in lung cancer after the company pulled the plug on its Phase III trial in a rare form of lymphoma.</p><p>The Phase III study of Takeda's oral Aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib in relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was suspended after a pre-specified interim analysis showed it was unlikely to beat standard of care for progression-free survival, the primary endpoint. The drug candidate, which was suspended in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in 2013, remains in Phase II studies for non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>PTCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and patient numbers are relatively small (around 10-15% of all NHL cases in the US), so the discontinuation "doesn't represent missing a huge boat of commercial opportunity," commented Dr Joseph Hedden, senior analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare. </p><p>He believes Takeda was probably following the well-beaten path in hematological cancer and lymphoma drug development of picking a rare disease as a lead indication "with the hope of showing efficacy and the chance of an expedited approval (e.g. via FDA Fast Track status) and getting the drug to market very quickly," in the same manner as Janssen/Pharmacyclics' Imbruvica (ibrutinib) was approved for mantle cell lymphoma before securing the larger target indication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, at which point it "hit the ground running." Alisertib was granted orphan drug status in PTCL in the US and EU in 2012.</p><p>The decision to discontinue the trial of alisertib (also known as MLN8237) in PTCL following the pre-specified interim analysis will not necessarily have a negative effect on the prospects for the drug in NSCLC. "You only have to look at marketed drugs to see there is quite a clear divide &ndash; as a rule drugs approved for solid tumors aren't effective in blood/lymphomas and vice versa," said Dr Hedden.</p><p>Aurora A is involved in mitotic cell division and dysregulation and over-expression of this kinase has been observed in various cancer types. Although Takeda has been the front-runner with this mechanism of action through its Phase III PTCL trial, there are others developing Aurora kinase inhibitors. </p><p>CASI Pharmaceuticals has ENMD-2076 in Phase II studies in various solid tumors as well as in Phase I in a range of solid and liquid cancer indications. Nerviano Medical Sciences' danusertib is also in Phase II in a range of tumors types including breast, lung, ovarian and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Companies with products in earlier clinical development include Amgen (with AMG-900), Boehringer Ingelheim (BI 811283), Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences (chiauranib) and Otsuka (TAS-119).</p><p>
