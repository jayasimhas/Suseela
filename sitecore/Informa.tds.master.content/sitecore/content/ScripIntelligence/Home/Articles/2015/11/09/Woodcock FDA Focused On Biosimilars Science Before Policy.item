<p>Under fire from lawmakers, Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, took cover by insisting the reason the agency has yet to issue or finalize some of the most important biosimilars guidance documents industry has been waiting on &ndash; specifically, those on interchangeability and labeling &ndash; is because regulators must first "get the science right."</p><p>"We can't have problems with the first biosimilars out of the block," Woodcock declared during a Sept. 17 Senate subcommittee hearing. </p><p>The guidances, she said, are more about policy issues. </p><p>"They are not about the scientific standards" &ndash; where the FDA is first and foremost focused, Woodcock said.</p><p>She noted the FDA has issued eight biosimilars guidances &ndash; three final and five draft, with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-Letter-Word-FDAs-BiosimilarsBiologics-Distinction-360142" target="_new">naming document</a> the most recent of the bunch, which was accompanied by a proposed rule, under which biologics, including biosimilars, would carry a unique four-letter suffix as part of the nonproprietary names of the active drug substance.</p><p>But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) asserted the FDA has been lax in developing and issuing the biosimilars guidances &ndash; demanding to know when industry can expect them.</p><p>"To foster a robust biosimilars market, drug makers need to know the rules of the road so they know whether to enter this market," Warren declared, noting that a Rand analysis found that biosimilars have the potential to save Americans $44bn over the next 10 years.</p><p>"It has now been five years since Congress authorized the biosimilars pathway, but so far, the FDA hasn't produced draft guidance describing the standard for an interchangeable biosimilar," the Massachusetts lawmaker charged. "In addition, the FDA has not released the guidance on how the products will be labeled and has not finalized many other guidance documents that will help companies enter the biosimilars market."</p><p>Warren argued that for there to be "some confidence" the U.S. biosimilars regulatory scheme will work, "we have to have a plan in place."</p><p>Woodcock repeated a few times during the hearing the FDA was "working very hard" to get the documents completed, although she said "I never give a date for guidances because it's out of my hands. There's multiple clearances involved and these are very complex."</p><p>She said the FDA has been "highly fully occupied" with dealing with the 57 proposed biosimilar products referenced on 16 different innovator biologics and the "27 other groups that have come and talked to us about developing individual products."</p><p>Woodcock said the FDA has been "learning a lot" from those "one-to-one advice" discussions, which also has involved examining "how they will show interchangeability."</p><p>"I agree with the committee that the most important next guidances would be interchangeability and labeling and finalizing our naming guidance," Woodcock said, although she said the latter document really was more an issue for the "outside world" and "not a scientific issue, per se."</p><p><b>Bulletproof</b></p><p>The most important thing to the FDA right now, Woodcock said, is making the biosimilars scientific framework "bulletproof," so that the program can "earn the trust" of the prescribing community by ensuring the products are "safe and effective and have the same properties as the innovator."</p><p>"That's number one," she declared.</p><p>But Woodcock, who said she's personally been working on the biosimilars pathway since the 1990s &ndash; long before the 2010 <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i>, which gave the FDA the clear authority to approve the products, was enacted &ndash; also acknowledged "there's no doubt" completing the guidances was a "very important" task and pledged to "try to get them out expeditiously."</p><p>Woodcock was questioned about why regulators dropped language in a final guidance the agency initially had in a 2012 draft version of <i>Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product</i>, which stated that biosimilars labeling should clearly disclose they are indeed those types of products and whether the medicines have been found to be interchangeable &ndash; something for which AbbVie <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-Big-Biosimilars-Questions-Will-Senate-Get-Answers-360448" target="_new">raised questions</a> about in a citizen petition after the FDA approved Novartis unit Sandoz's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz), which is referenced on Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim).</p><p>But she insisted regulators "haven't really made a change," but rather did not put anything in that final guidance because "it wasn't really about labeling."</p><p>Regulators plan a separate document devoted specifically to labeling, Woodcock said, noting the FDA is considering what AbbVie has requested as the agency evaluates what to put into its guidance.</p><p><b>Statistical Guidance</b></p><p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), chairman of the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security, which is part of the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, questioned Woodcock about why the agency has not yet issued a guidance on statistical approaches to analytical similarity, which he said "has been the most problematic issue to deal with, due to the lack of transparency and what the requirements are."</p><p>That guidance, Cassidy contended, "is particularly important as it impacts initial approvability as a biosimilar under the 351(k)" application process. </p><p>Woodcock said that behind the interchangeability and labeling guidances, the statistical approaches to analytical similarity was the third most important on the agency's to-do list and acknowledged "we need to get it out as soon as possible."</p><p>"We have world-class experts working on this. They have consulted with the E.U. and we certainly are of like mind," she said, adding that European regulators "think our approach is sound."</p><p>When pressed by Cassidy about when the FDA would complete that document, Woodcock said "within the next six months."</p><p><b>Education</b></p><p>The lawmakers at the hearing also wanted to know what educational efforts the FDA has engaged in to ensure prescribers and patients know approved biosimilars are just as safe and effective as the innovator biologics.</p><p>Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-CT), the ranking member on the subcommittee, said that without that education, there would be "all sorts of opportunity for patent owners to flood the health care space with bad information about why you shouldn't take that biosimilar."</p><p>"It's d√©j&agrave; vu all over again," Woodcock declared, noting the early difficulties the FDA had in convincing prescribers that generics were just as safe and effective as brand-name small molecule drugs.</p><p>"We have laid out a plan of campaigns of education and also doing focus groups and other activities to determine what is the current level of understanding and what people need to know," she said. "We have a menu of educational activities planned out for several years."</p><p>Murphy also wanted to know how the FDA was engaging with state governments &ndash; pointing out that at least 31 have devised laws involving biosimilars so far.</p><p>"If we get a whole rash of state laws that erect barriers, it doesn't matter what education you do if the law prevents the usage of these biosimilars," the Connecticut Democrat charged.</p><p>Woodcock acknowledged "there's a patchwork" of laws, with some facilitating the use of biosimilars, while others "may cause barriers."</p><p>"We saw this at the dawn of generic age," she said. "It does take earning the trust and continuing to maintain the trust with the clinical community about this program that it is scientifically sound that their patients are not going to suffer if they get a biosimilar. They'll get the same clinical effect" as an innovator biologic.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
