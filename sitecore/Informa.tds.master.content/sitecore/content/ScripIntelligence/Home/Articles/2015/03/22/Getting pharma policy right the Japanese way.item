<p>If Japan needed any reassurance that it was pursuing the right policy path, at least in the pharma/biotech area, plenty was forthcoming at the BIO Asia 2015 conference in Tokyo.</p><p>Jim Greenwood, president and CEO of meeting organizer, the US Biotechnology Industry Organization, kicked things off by praising the recent Japanese reforms and landmark legislation on regenerative medicine, noting that there had been strong US interest in the legal framework enacted late last year.</p><p>There was also strong support from BIO for the efforts of Shinzo Abe's administration to encourage innovation and early access to therapeutics through measures to speed up approvals, improve the regulatory system and better co-ordinate oversight of research through the new Agency for Medical R&D.</p><p>Just what steps the country has made, and is still taking, to improve the regulatory system were outlined by Dr Tatsuya Kondo, chief executive of the national drugs and devices regulator, the PMDA. Under a mid-term plan started a year ago and running until fiscal 2018, the plan is to increase the body's total staff to 1,065, up from around 750 at the start of the plan.</p><p>Helped by this, "We are aiming for review times to become world top-level, with achievement rates of target review times [12 months for new drugs] set to improve from 60% to 80%," Dr Kondo said. Under the mid-term plan, the goal is also to raise the percentage of priority review product approvals granted within nine months from 60% to 80%.</p><p>But there appeared to be most audience interest in the planned new "sakigake" (pioneer) system, or "forerunner review assignment" as it is rather clumsily dubbed in English. The initiative to speed up the evaluation of innovative drugs, devices and regenerative therapies developed initially in Japan - either by local or foreign firms - was first unveiled last year, and will apply to high-need products for serious diseases.</p><p>"Products receiving the designation will have to show a big step up in efficacy [in early trials], but the status will not be restricted to treatments for life-threatening diseases or regenerative medicines," Dr Kondo clarified.</p><p>The idea is to conduct shortened, prioritized reviews by allowing early and prioritized consultation with the PMDA and the rolling submission of data for prior review ahead of the full submission of a Phase III package. The target is for reviews of sakigake products to be completed in six months, versus the 12 month target for standard products, the official told the meeting.</p><p>While he did not give a specific date, Dr Kondo said the system "will come into effect in early 2015" and that in general it will be comparable to the US FDA's breakthrough designation, which confers expedited review for products for serious disease that showing substantial improvements over existing therapies.</p><p><b>Positive Sentiment</b></p><p>There was also praise from other quarters for the positive policy developments in Japan over the past few years, which were seen as giving something back to the pharma industry as the biggest payer of corporate taxes in Japan, somewhat surprisingly ahead of other major economic sectors such as cars.</p><p>In a panel session, Dr Stephen Anderson, commercial attach√© at the US Embassy in Tokyo, noted that the two countries "had come a long way" in terms of policy confluence, with a "much more open dialog with the Japanese government" now taking place.</p><p>"The Abe Cabinet has been very responsive to the need for innovation, particularly in the regenerative medicine area&#8230;and the ministry [of health, labour and welfare] is open to dialog and trying to be part of a global network," he said.</p><p>Simon Collier, head of government affairs for Bayer Yakuhin in Japan and also representing the European industry federation EFPIA, added that there had been "a very positive story over the last five years in particular. There have been improvements at the PMDA, review times are much shorter, and the changes introduced in 2010 to protect new drugs from regular price cuts have led to more clinical trials in Japan, and more local subsidiaries being set up."</p><p>Although not mentioned at the session, other policies to encourage generic use are also bearing much fruit for companies in that sector, as the government looks to offset costs for new innovative drugs with greater generic uptake.</p><p>Collier noted a forecast for flat drug market growth in Japan over the next decade through a rebalancing of costs, in a study presented late last year by EFPIA, and questioned whether there would be any adjustment of drug prices in 2017 due to the scheduled general consumption tax hike. </p><p>Admitting that "things were still not quite perfect," Collier also expressed caution over ongoing discussions on a possible formal health technology system in 2016: "Given that drug costs are already under control, HTA shouldn't be used for this reason."</p><p>In line with foreign industry group views, the continuing 14-day prescription limit for new drugs was also viewed as outdated.</p><p><b>Concrete Policy Impact</b></p><p>In a separate BIO Asia 2015 panel session on the concrete impact of recent Japan policy changes, the view of Dr Gil Van Bokkelen, chairman and CEO of US venture Athersys was that: "Intelligent policy can have a transformational effect. The new Japanese regulations [on regenerative therapies] have provided clarity and certainty, encouraging companies to invest."</p><p>In fact the regenerative area, where Athersys has a pipeline presence, has the potential to drive a major shift in therapeutics, something that Dr Van Bokkelen said seemed to have been recognized by Japanese health policy officials several years ago. </p><p>"One of the main reasons for the policy changes given by officials in meetings with them was in fact the financial impact of an aging population, which their forecasts had shown might otherwise bankrupt the healthcare system."</p><p>Dr Hardy Kagimoto &ndash;president and CEO of Japanese induced pluripotent stem (iPC) cell venture Healios added that "the new [regenerative therapy] law accelerates development and gives confidence to investors," observing that his company had managed to raise around $100 million in funding.</p><p>Based on the new regulatory framework, Healios, which is working on an iPS cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration, "is planning to start a clinical trial program in 2017 and we have a 2020 approval target," Dr Kagimoto said. "We also have full confidence that we can expand development in the US and Europe."</p><p>Dr BT Slingsby, CEO and executive director of the Japan-based Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, said the creation of the fund - which focuses on supporting new therapies for neglected tropical diseases - was clearly the result of the new Japanese policies on supporting innovation.</p><p>The GHIT Fund, supported by several ministries and pharma firms in Japan along with the Gates Foundation, has so far funded 33 projects with around $35 million.</p><p>The public-partnership approach allows the development of new therapies that otherwise might not see the light of day, and "it is a model that could be clearly be used in other disease areas and for regenerative medicines," Dr Slingsby suggested.</p><p>While other Asian countries are at earlier stages of overall development, the conclusion of the panel was that Japan could provide a good template for positive policy formation in those markets looking to encourage healthcare innovation and investment.</p><p>
