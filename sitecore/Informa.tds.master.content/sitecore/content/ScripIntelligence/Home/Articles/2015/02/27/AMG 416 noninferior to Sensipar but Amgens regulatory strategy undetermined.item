<p>Amgen reported positive results from its third and final Phase III clinical trial for AMG 416, the successor to the company's Sensipar (cinacalcet), for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on hemodialysis, but a plan for regulatory submissions has not been established.</p><p>"While we are encouraged by the emerging efficacy and safety profile of AMG 416, it is too early to speculate on our regulatory filing. We will evaluate the Phase III data in its entirety and disclose next steps, including those with regulatory authorities, as appropriate," Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen's spokeswoman Kristen Davis told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Intravenous AMG 416 was non-inferior to oral Sensipar (Mimpara in Europe), which loses patent protection in the EU in 2015 and in the US in 2018, in Amgen's only head-to-head Phase III clinical trial for AMG 416. Previously, the drug proved superior to placebo in July and August (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Amgens-AMG-416-succeeds-in-second-Phase-III-study-353435" target="_new">19 August 2014</a>). AMG 416 is a calcimimetic agent that binds to and activates the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, as does the calcium-sensing receptor agonist Sensipar.</p><p>Non-inferiority to Sensipar was the 683-patient head-to-head study's primary endpoint based on the percentage of patients who achieved a greater than 30% reduction from baseline in mean pre-dialysis parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels during the efficacy assessment phase (EAP; weeks 20 through 27). </p><p>AMG 416 was dosed three times per week at the end of each dialysis session while Sensipar was dosed daily. All patients also may have received calcium supplements, vitamin D sterols or phosphate binders as prescribed by clinicians.</p><p>In terms of efficacy, Amgen said AMG 416 beat Sensipar on key secondary endpoints: the proportion of patients with greater than 50% PTH reduction from baseline during the EAP (52.4% versus 40.2%, respectively) and greater than 30% reductions (68.2% versus 57.7%). </p><p>In terms of safety and tolerability, there were no differences between the mean number of days of vomiting or nausea during the first eight weeks of treatment with AMG 416 and Sensipar, another secondary endpoint.</p><p>However, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 92.9% of patients in the AMG 416 arm and 90% in the Sensipar arm of the study. TEAEs in either arm included blood calcium decreased (68.9% for AMG 416 versus 59.8% for Sensipar), nausea (18.3% versus 22.6%), vomiting (13.3% versus 13.8%), diarrhea (6.2% versus 10.3%), symptomatic hypocalcemia (5% versus 2.3%) and cardiac failure (3% versus 0.6%). </p><p>Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for 25.1% of AMG 416 patients and 27.3% in the Sensipar group, but 2.7% of patients died in the AMG 416 arm of the study versus 1.8% in the Sensipar arm. </p><p>"There was an increased number of patients on [AMG 416] who had blood calcium decreases, which may contribute to the slightly increased number of patients with fatal or cardiac failure-related SAEs. We do not know whether this imbalance in adverse event rates is significant or whether it may preclude some patients with better-controlled PTH levels from receiving [AMG 416]," Sagient Research said in a 25 February BioMedTracker report.</p><p>Even so, Sagient raised the likelihood of US FDA approval for AMG 416 by 1% to 64%, which is 4% above average for drugs with similar indications that are in the same stage of development.</p><p>While Amgen's plans for regulatory submissions has not been determined, Opko Health could turn in an application for its competing drug Rayaldee (CTAP101) to the FDA before Amgen.</p><p>Opko said in September that it would submit a new drug application (NDA) by the end of 2014 based on two positive Phase III placebo-controlled studies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Amgen-competitor-Opko-plans-year-end-NDA-for-Rayaldee-354091" target="_new">23 September 2014</a>). The company has yet to announce an NDA submission, but Opko may provide an update on its regulatory strategy when it reports 2014 earnings on 27 February. </p><p>Sagient's likelihood of approval for Rayaldee is 62%.</p><p><p><p><p>
