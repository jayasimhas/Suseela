<p><p>With biosimilar Remicade entering the European market and on the verge in the US, Merck & Co discussed the threat of biosimilars to its franchises on its 28 July earnings call &ndash; and while Remicade sales are starting to take a hit, the firm is not seeing any impact on its follow-on TNF inhibitor Simponi. </p><p>Neither Merck nor Johnson & Johnson seem threatened by the entrance of Celltrion's biosimilar monoclonal antibody; Remicade (infliximab) is marketed as a joint venture between the two big pharmas. </p><p>Infliximab biosimilars were initially only sold in some Eastern European countries due to the companies' patents on Remicade, but those EU patents expired in February 2015, opening the door to market expansion. That should soon extend to the US: an application is currently pending with FDA from Celltrion and Hospira, but no word has been issued yet on an approval decision. </p><p>"With regard to biosimilars, right now, we are not seeing a major impact in products outside of Remicade. So for example, if you look at Simponi, we continue to see good Simponi sales and we haven't seen any significant impact to Simponi based upon Remicade being a biosimilar," said Merck's Exec VP and President of Global Human Health Adam Schechter during the company's second quarter earnings call. </p><p>Merck's share of the Remicade franchise is seeing more impact than J&J's, due to their geographies. Merck acquired the rights to the autoimmune disease blockbuster in its 2009 acquisition of Schering Plough. After much legal back and forth, Merck and J&J agreed to split the territories that the drug was sold, with J&J retaining full rights to the US and Merck keeping EU sales. At its height, Remicade brought in more than $7bn annually. </p><p>Merck reported sales of only $455m for the arthritis drug in the second quarter, down from $501m in the first quarter and down from $607m from the same period last year. Meanwhile, J&J reported sales of $1.67bn for Remicade earlier in the month. The two companies also split sales on Simponi (golimumab), which brought in sales of $169m for Merck during the second quarter, up from sales of $158m in the prior quarter. </p><p>"If you look at what's occurring in the marketplace, we've definitely seen an increased impact in our first full quarter since loss of exclusivity in the second wave, the core European markets. We are seeing mandatory price reductions based upon reference pricing impacts. And as I reported last quarter, biosimilar discounts we've seen as high as 45%," Mr Schechter said. </p><p>The executive asserts that Remicade still maintains 95% of market share, but isn't sure how long that could last. "Over time, we believe that as more new patients come into the market, we will lose market share &ndash; because we've been able to hold on to the vast majority, we've won most tenders for existing patients. So it really is the new patients coming in that over time we'll begin to lose," he added. </p><p>Ultimately, Merck expects the hit to Remicade from biosimilar competition to surpass growth from Simponi. </p><p><p>
