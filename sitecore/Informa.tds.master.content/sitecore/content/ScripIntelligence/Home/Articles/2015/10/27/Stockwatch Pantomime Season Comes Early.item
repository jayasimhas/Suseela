<p>The critiques and revelations surrounding the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">business practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals</a> International Inc. continued last week with a second successive Monday morning press conference to refute some of the more recent accusations levelled against it. This was followed by a Friday morning marathon press conference held by one of its biggest hedge fund shareholders in an attempt to recover some of the value lost from the fund's Valeant holding. The revelations and refutations concerning Valeant have come to resemble a pantomime with the company in the role of villain, and the list of traditional pantomime characters was bolstered by companies reporting their third-quarter earnings last week. </p><p>The arrival on stage of a billionaire hedge fund manager bleating about the attractiveness of Valeant did nothing last week to stem the slide in its stock price and the additional 15% drop on Friday cast this character more in the role of old pantomime dame than a Prince Charming. Significant investment focus had shifted to Valeant's debt burden which is currently so large as to preclude another acquisition &ndash; its typical method of sales growth. Lenders build a number of debt ratios into the legal agreements that a company enters into when they issue debt, one of these being net debt to EBITDA. The end-of-week cutting of ties to Valeant's specialty pharmacy chain Philidor Rx Services (and therefore the recording of its revenue below EBITDA in Valeant's income statement), and the removal of the revenues from the pharmacy benefit managers who also stopped using Philidor, may well reduce the denominator in this ratio and could trip the lending covenants that may ultimately force a wind-up of the company. Not exactly the fairy tale ending that all the analysts who maintain their 'Buy' recommendations on Valeant would have you (make) believe.</p><p>At the start of the week, Novartis International AG were vying with Valeant as the week's pantomime villain after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Entresto-Hurdles-Dog-Novartis-361259" target="_new">missing analysts' consensus estimates</a> of both sales and earnings. Like Johnson & Johnson two weeks before, Novartis had weak sales in all of its three main divisions. Not even a reaffirmation of its 2015 sales and income guidance could prevent about a 2% share price drop and I was left wondering what benefits, if any, had come from the recent asset swap with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. By contrast, last week's Prince Charming (in more ways than one) turned out to be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PfizerHospira-Epogen-Biosimilar-Rejected-Relief-For-Amgen-361258" target="_new">Pfizer, Inc. when it reported strong results</a> featuring the beating of consensus estimates of both sales and earnings which Novartis had missed a few days before. Like Gilead Sciences Inc., which reported a similar <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-HCV-Sales-Plateau-But-Maintain-Dominant-Market-Share-361271" target="_new">strong performance in sales and earnings</a> and resulted in a raising of its 2015 sales guidance, once the analyst discussion had gotten past last quarter's operating detail, the scene rapidly switched to a discussion of whom either company were going buy. Whilst the need for a good acquisition is obvious to both Pfizer and Gilead, like Roche the previous week, all the CEOs commented on the unrealistic expectations of their potential targets who were still living in a place far, far away, when their share prices were at mid-July levels. </p><p>With so many companies reporting their second-quarter financial results in such a short space of time, it was easy to group the strong financial results of Pfizer, with those of Merck & Co, Inc., Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. and GSK. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-Boosted-By-Opdivo-Sales-Growth-Prospects-361261" target="_new">BMS emulated</a> Gilead's third-quarter performance with a sales and earnings beat of consensus estimates, plus an increase in 2015 guidance which was driven from the recently-launched immuno-oncology antibody Opdivo (nivolumab). <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-Readies-To-Defend-Januvia-Keytruda-Franchises-361264" target="_new">Merck, on the other hand</a> started to look for a better role than that of the pantomime horse's head with revenues that met consensus estimates and earnings that beat estimates only after operational cost-cutting. Heading towards the other end of the horse, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-Likes-Its-Go-It-Alone-Strategy-Over-A-Mega-Merger-361280" target="_new">GSK's third-quarter results</a> were described as 'strong' by the analysts at JP Morgan, who noted a 1% beat of consensus sales estimates, but a beating of consensus earnings estimates by 19%, driven by savage operational cost-cutting. The analysts from Citigroup were more pragmatic in describing GSK's results as being 'flattered by SG&A cuts, phasing and mix' and retaining their neutral recommendation. Almost all of the other analysts I read on GSK appeared to sing as a chorus of "Oh no it isn't (low quality earnings)!" and were pitted against a few mumbles of "Oh yes it is!" from the Citigroup analysts and me. But for GSK, this quality of earnings issue is of much more relevance than other companies since it has just completed the divisional asset-swap with Novartis, the function of which, it now seems, may have been just to cut at the divisions it acquired.</p><p>Pfizer was confirmed in the role of Prince Charming late last week as word leaked out that it was in friendly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292" target="_new">merger discussions with Allergan</a> Plc. Whilst the case for the acquisition of Allergan by Pfizer ticks most of Pfizer's boxes for such a transaction including a lower corporate tax rate, the increase in volume from the anti-inversion orchestra is likely to awaken the president in the role of litigation-breathing dragon. An angry response remains the biggest barrier to this transaction and seems to be expected from President Obama who had probably been hoping for a quiet last year in office before he departs the stage (left of centre).</p><p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Novartis, Pfizer, Gilead Sciences, Merck, BMS and Allergan.</p><p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest. Mann Bioinvest is the investment adviser for the Magna BioPharma Income fund which has no position in the stocks mentioned, unless stated above. Dr Smith gives an investment fund manager's view on public life science companies.
