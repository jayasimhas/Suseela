<p>Esperion Therapeutics jumped 29.2% to a new all-time high of $99.60 per share on 17 March after the company reported that ETC-1002 lowered LDL cholesterol by up to 24% in combination with a low- to moderate-dose statin in a placebo-controlled Phase IIb clinical trial.</p><p>Already trading at a new high based on updated results from a prior Phase IIb clinical trial, which tested ETC-1002 versus and in combination with Merck & Co's Zetia (ezetimibe), Esperion's latest data propelled the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company's market cap above $2bn (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Brilinta-PCSK9-andexanet-alfa-ETC-1002-sound-bites-feed-stock-gains-357324" target="_new">17 March 2015</a>). With its stock value on the rise, Esperion also announced plans to raise up to $172.5m in a common stock offering to fund Phase III development of ETC-1002, signaling that the company is prepared to move forward without a big pharma partner.</p><p>CEO Tim Mayleben said during Esperion's conference call to discuss the Phase IIb trial results that the company has been approached by potential partners and it expects to hear from others, but Esperion will sign a deal only if it can find a collaborator that adds value to development of ETC-1002.</p><p>What's unknown, however, is how costly the drug's Phase III clinical trial program will be and whether it will require a pharma partner to fund a large, expensive outcomes study. Esperion has said since at least October when it revealed Phase IIb results versus and in combination with Zetia that it does not believe a large cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) will be required for approval of ETC-1002 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Esperions-ETC-1002-succeeds-in-Phase-IIb-but-Zetia-combo-could-be-key-354250" target="_new">2 October 2014</a>).</p><p>But the developers of PCSK9 inhibitors &ndash; Repatha (evolocumab) from Amgen and Praluent (alirocumab) from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, which have shown substantial LDL cholesterol-lowering ability and reasonably low adverse event rates in more than a dozen Phase II and III clinical trials each &ndash; were not able to seek US FDA approval for their biologics until they began CVOTs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ACC-2015-Amgen-RegeneronSanofi-make-case-for-PCSK9-inhibitor-safety-357299" target="_new">16 March 2015</a>). </p><p>And with PCSK9 inhibitor approvals expected this year &ndash; two years ahead of CVOT data for the therapies &ndash; it remains to be seen whether doctors will prescribe the injectable medicines without the long-term cardiovascular safety data.</p><p>Mr Mayleben noted during Esperion's conference call and in posts on Twitter that ETC-1002 has oral drug dosing and pricing advantages over PCSK9 inhibitors, which have been attacked by US payers CVS/Caremark and Express Scripts for their expected high cost, and he said ETC-1002 may have efficacy approaching the injectable therapies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">18 February 2015</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>). </p><p>Even so, Repatha and Praluent will hit the market years before the Esperion drug, giving the biologics time to establish doctor and patient loyalty while gaining favor with payers.</p><p>Like the PCSK9 inhibitors, ETC-1002 is being developed by Esperion to treat statin-intolerant patients. Mr Mayleben said the company's new Phase IIb data in combination with statins show that the market for its drug could be larger than the statin-intolerant population.</p><p>LDL cholesterol in statin-treated patients who received a 120mg dose of ETC-1002 was reduced by 17% at 12 weeks while the 180mg dose reduced LDL cholesterol by 24% versus 4% in the placebo arm (p=0.0055 and p<0.0001, respectively,="" compared="" with="" placebo).=""></0.0001,></p><p>The company reported no muscle-related adverse events &ndash; a statin side effect that keeps some patients from taking the drugs &ndash; and low study discontinuation rates in all arms of the study. One serious adverse event for a patient treated with ETC-1002 was not drug-related.</p><p><p><p><p>
