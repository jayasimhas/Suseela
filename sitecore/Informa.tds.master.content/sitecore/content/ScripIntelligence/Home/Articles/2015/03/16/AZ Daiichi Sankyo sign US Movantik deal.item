<p>AstraZeneca is teaming up with Daiichi Sankyo, using the Japanese pharma's US-based sales teams and expertise in the primary care setting to commercialize its first-in-class mu-opioid receptor antagonist Movantik (naloxegol) in the US. </p><p>Daiichi Sankyo will pay $200m upfront and up to $625m in sales-related milestone payments to AstraZeneca to market Movantik. Under terms of the deal AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing, will book all sales and will make sales-related commission payments to Daiichi Sankyo. Both firms will sell the product and there will be no change to AstraZeneca's previously announced financial guidance. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo have previously collaborated via a commercialization deal for Nexium (esomeprazole) in Japan. </p><p>The two pharma companies plan to launch Movantik &ndash; which won FDA approval as a treatment for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in September 2014 &ndash; in the US in early April.</p><p>Ken Keller, president of US commercial operations at Daiichi Sankyo, said the company would bring "primary care and specialty expertise to the collaboration." </p><p>AstraZeneca added that "The agreement reflects our evolving business model by building on our externalization activity while allowing us to retain significant interest in the commercial success of Movantik in our largest market."</p><p>Movantik, which AstraZeneca licensed from Nektar Therapeutics in 2009, is an oral PEGylated formulation of an analog of naloxone. It was descheduled by the US Drug Enforcement Administration in January 2015 and is no longer labelled as a controlled substance. Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database forecasts sales of Movantik will peak at $725.1m in the US in 2020. </p><p>OIC is a condition caused by prescription opioid pain medicines. Millions of patients are treated with opioids each year. The incidence of OIC in patients taking prescription opioid medicines for chronic pain is believed to be as high as 81%.</p><p>
