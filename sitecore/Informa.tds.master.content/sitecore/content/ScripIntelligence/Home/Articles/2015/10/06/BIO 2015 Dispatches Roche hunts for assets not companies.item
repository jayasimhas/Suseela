<p><p>Unlike some of the other big conferences of the year, the annual Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) conference is less about data and more about networking &ndash; even for big pharma. Roche's head of oncology partnering Jason Coloma noted that meetings like BIO &ndash; this year being held in the heart of Philadelphia &ndash; give the company a "great chance to have relationship building moments." </p><p>Roche is here scouting companies and assets to form external relationships. Currently, about a third of the big pharma's pipeline comes from these partnerships. </p><p>Yet, Sophie Kornowski-Bonnet, the company's head of partnering, admits that Roche is looking for assets and not to acquire biotechs. "We fall in love with drugs, we don't fall in love with companies," she said during an interview at BIO. While she says it's really about specific assets, she admits that Roche is flexible when looking at deal structures. "If a company has multiple assets that we like, then the economics make more sense [to acquire the biotech.]"</p><p>Both Coloma and Kornowski-Bonnet agree that dealmaking currently favors biotechs due to the strong market environment and the amount of cash flowing into the space from venture capitalists. A recent report released by consulting firm E&Y noted that the biotech sector has reached a record-breaking $123bn in revenues and nearly $15bn in net income. </p><p>"We realize that a deal has to be a win-win, as long as we respect the science," said Kornowski-Bonnet. "Historically there aren't that many assets out there when you have a defined 'want' list. The truth is today that many biotechs are well-funded, so they can go a ways into development on their own and many of them have more experience in dealing with big pharmas &ndash; so the bar has risen in terms of the quality of the deal dialogue."</p><p>Roche's partnering team includes 80 people that are located in Basel, Switzerland, San Francisco, New York City, Tokyo, Shanghai and one in Boston, says Kornowski-Bonnet. These teams are divided by therapeutic area &ndash; oncology, neuroscience, infectious disease, ophthalmology and immunology &ndash; and look at assets that run the gambit from academic-stage to early development to already-marketed products. </p><p>For the Swiss pharma, the general framework for its partnering strategy is "Want, Find, Get, Manage." Coloma says his team works closely with both the scientists in Roche's internal R&D departments, as well as with the executive teams to determine the list of "wants" and then his team uses meetings like BIO to go out and "find."</p><p>As for the company's closely-watched oncology portfolio, Coloma says that Roche is currently looking for three things: 1) assets that target dysregulation of cell signaling 2) drugs that affect the tumor micro-environment and 3) compounds in the immuno-oncology space that can complement its PD-L1 inhibitor. </p><p>Also top on the Roche partnering list of wants &ndash; biomarker identification tools. The company's goal is to have more than half of the drugs in its pipeline be linked to a biomarker, and currently all of the drug in its oncology portfolio use biomarkers to determine the proper patient population. </p><p>"The strategy is the right drug for the right patient at the right time," said Coloma. "In oncology, every program we have has a biomarker hypothesis attached to it and we see that as a differentiator for us. It's really going to play a critical role."</p><p><p>[Editor's note: Our daily BIO 2015 Dispatches draw on the combined forces of "The Pink Sheet" and Scrip Intelligence staff, reporting from the Philadelphia meeting.]</p><p><p>
