<p><b>In the latest in our series marking the European Medicines Agency's 20th anniversary, Ian Schofield looks at the agency's achievements &ndash; and areas where it has faced problems &ndash; over the past two decades</b>. </p><p>The EMA began life on 26 January 1995 as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA). Its role: to manage the new European regulatory system. </p><p>The new system, part of a wider drive to complete the European single market, came into being on the 30th anniversary of the founding pharmaceutical directive, No 65/65/EEC, which had laid down the principles for granting marketing authorizations for medicinal products in all member states. Triggered by the thalidomide catastrophe, that legislation required all medicinal products to be authorized on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data before they could be placed on the market. </p><p>A decentralized agency of the European Union, the EMA itself can trace its roots to the publication in 1990 of proposals to establish a centralized system for granting marketing authorizations. After two and a half years of discussions, this system became a reality through Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, which was adopted in 1993 along with three Directives modifying the existing human and veterinary medicines legislation. </p><p>Among the innovations in the new system were the creation of the EMEA and the transformation of the CPMP (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products), and its veterinary counterpart the CVMP, into two fully-fledged scientific committees within the agency. The EMEA would eventually become the EMA, while the CPMP would become the Committee for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). </p><p>Preparations for the new body began in earnest in 1993, when heads of state of the European Community (as it was then) decided the EMEA should be located in London. In 1994 the area of Canary Wharf &ndash; which would become London's new financial centre &ndash; was chosen for the agency's headquarters. </p><p>Staff recruitment began later that year, with 14 key management posts to be filled. The vacancies proved popular: 2,500 applications were received, and the selection committee completed its work in January 1995. The agency was formally inaugurated on 26 January, although it did not actually become operational until February. </p><p>In 1994, the agency's management board had elected Strachan Heppel, a senior UK civil servant, as the EMEA's chairman and Fernand Sauer as its first executive director. Mr Sauer, who held the post until 2000, had previously been with the European Commission's pharmaceuticals unit, where he pushed for the harmonisation of EU regulatory requirements and legislation and played a leading part in the setting up of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).</p><p>Having begun with just 16 staff, by the end of 1995 the agency had increased staff numbers to 67. Its first annual report announced: "Recruitment is planned to reach 100 by mid-1996. This represents a relatively small number of staff compared to other regulatory authorities around the world which employ several thousands of staff in the pharmaceutical sector." </p><p>Twenty years on, staff numbers have soared to around 900. Over the same period, the number of scientific committees has risen from two to seven, covering paediatric drugs, orphan medicines, herbal medicines, advanced therapies and, most recently, pharmacovigilance. The CHMP now has more than 30 working parties and scientific advisory groups in a wide range of scientific and regulatory areas. </p><p>From the start, the input of the national competent authorities (NCAs) was vital to the operation of the agency and the new system. The first annual report commented: "The success of the agency and the European system in 1995 is recognition of the enormous contribution of the experts working for both the national and European systems." </p><p><p>The EMA now interacts with a network of more than 4,500 European experts, including members of its committees, working parties and other groups. The network comprises more than 40 national regulatory authorities from the 31 European Economic Area countries (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p><h2>Transformations</h2><p>Since 1995, the agency has undergone a series of transformations, taking on new tasks and new personnel and expanding its oversight in the drug regulatory arena. In 2001, foreshadowing the later focus on pharmacovigilance as a key agency function in its own right, the EMEA split its human-use medicines evaluation unit into two operational units, one dealing with pre-approval aspects, the other with post-approval issues. It also created a new post: head of sector for pharmacovigilance and post-authorization safety and efficacy, under Noel Wathion, head of the post-authorization unit.</p><p>In January 2001, Mr Sauer was succeeded as executive director by Thomas Lönngren, a former deputy head of the Swedish Medical Products Agency who headed the EMA for two five-year terms until December 2010. Dr Lönngren oversaw the expansion of the agency's scope, seeing in the new committees on orphan drugs, paediatric medicines and advanced therapies. Under his watch, the agency also approved the first biosimilar medicine under the new regulatory pathway adopted in 2005.</p><p>In 2009, there was a second major overhaul under which the EMEA rebranded itself as the European Medicines Agency, complete with a new logo, colour palette and typography. At the same time it restructured and renamed the two human-use medicines units into human medicines development and evaluation, and patient health protection. A single sector was formed to manage product data and documentation relating to applications for both human and veterinary medicines. The agency rather coyly decided not to call itself the "EMA", preferring to wait and see whether the acronym "evolved naturally into a commonly accepted and widely used shorthand for our organization". It did.</p><p>The agency's involvement in drug safety monitoring took on a new impetus when the 2010 legislation on pharmacovigilance brought it a range of new responsibilities, many of which are carried out by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), which was set up in 2012.</p><p>The EMA's third executive director, Guido Rasi, was appointed in November 2011 (deputy executive director Andreas Pott having stood in for most of 2011). Professor Rasi is widely credited with having given more impetus to the involvement of patients in the EMA's evaluation activities, pushed through the clinical trial data disclosure policy that was adopted last October, and promoted the adaptive pathways initiative, which was launched in 2014 to promote earlier access to medicines.</p><p>However, Professor Rasi's tenure came to an abrupt end in November 2014 when he was forced to step aside following an EU tribunal ruling that annulled his appointment on procedural grounds. The position has again been temporarily taken over by Mr Pott (more on this below).</p><h2>Product Approvals</h2><p>A key part of the EMA's responsibilities is evaluating products submitted for approval through the centralized procedure (CP) and handling all the post-authorization activities relating to those products once they reach the market. In the first instance, the CHMP evaluates the evidence submitted by the applicant and issues an opinion either recommending or advising against approval. Positive opinions are sent to the European Commission which then issues the formal marketing authorization, usually after two or three months.</p><p>The first product to receive a centralized approval was Merck Serono's Gonal-F (follitropin alfa), in October 1995. Since then, some 975 human-use medicines have been recommended for approval by the EMA, and in the past 20 years, the kinds of products reaching the market have broadened as the EMA extended its scope of responsibilities, taking on paediatric, traditional herbal and orphan medicines, advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), generics, non-prescription drugs and biosimilar medicines.</p><p>The first two orphan drugs &ndash; (Genzyme's Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) for Fabry disease and Shire's Replagal (agalsidase alfa) &ndash; were approved in 2001. Some years later, in 2007, there were the first centralized approvals for off-patent drugs: Krka's generic olanzapine product Zalasta for schizophrenia and GSK's over-the-counter medicine Alli (orlistat) for weight loss. In 2010, Buccolam (midazolam) became the first product to receive a paediatric-use marketing authorization, a freestanding approval for an off-patent medicine with the same exclusivity rights as a new drug.</p><p>Reflecting the increasing complexity of drug development and regulatory science, the CHMP moved into the challenging territory of advanced therapies in 2009 when TiGenix's ChondroCelect, a cell-based product for autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee, marked the first go-ahead for an ATMP. This was followed in 2012 by the first gene therapy medicine, UniQure/Chiesi's Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec), for lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and most recently by Chiesi/Holostem's Holoclar for severe limbal stem cell deficiency, the EU's first stem cell medicinal product, which gained marketing authorization in February 2015.</p><p>In a move that inspired similar initiatives around the world, the EMA was the first regulator to implement a formal dedicated pathway for the evaluation and approval of biosimilar medicines. The question of how biosimilars should be assessed was first discussed around 2000, and in October 2005 a legal basis for processing the products was inserted into the Community Code (the human medicines directive No 2001/83), followed by a set of biosimilar guidelines for manufacturers.</p><p>The first biosimilar to receive approval under the new pathway was Sandoz's human growth hormone Omnitrope (somatropin), a version of Pfizer's Genotropin, in April 2006. Since then 21 more biosimilars have been approved, although two were subsequently withdrawn. The segment made something of a leap forward in 2013 when the first two biosimilars containing a monoclonal antibody (infliximab) was approved. As of the beginning of 2015, a total of 20 biosimilars held EU marketing authorizations, containing filgrastim (8), epoetin (5), somatropin (2), infliximab (2), follitropin alfa (2) and insulin glargine (1).</p><h2>More Regulatory Tools</h2><p>As well as expanding into novel product and therapy areas, the EMA has acquired a new set of new regulatory tools intended to ensure that novel drugs for unmet needs or difficult to treat diseases can get to patients as quickly as possible. One of these is conditional approval, where the full dataset is lacking at the time of initial approval and must be provided later, whereupon the conditional marketing authorisation can be converted into a full one. In 2014, two high-profile orphan drugs took this route: Chiesi's Holoclar, and PTC Therapeutics' Translarna (ataluren) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Conditional marketing authorization is expected to be a key regulatory tool in the EMA's adaptive pathways initiative, which is discussed below.</p><p>Another mechanism designed to speed access is approval in exceptional circumstances, which is used where full safety and/or efficacy data are unlikely ever to be available. The most recent example was Clinuvel's phototoxicity treatment Scenesse (afamelanotide), which gained a marketing authorisation last year. The EMA also now offers an accelerated assessment for products of major therapeutic interest, a route taken by three of the products given a positive CHMP opinion in 2014.</p><p>At the same time, the EMA has gradually built up its activities in terms of providing scientific advice and protocol assistance to companies developing new drugs, experimenting with parallel advice together with health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, and providing assistance and incentives to encourage innovation by small and medium sized companies, through the SME office that was established in 2005.</p><h2>Problems</h2><p>Of course not everything has been rosy in the regulatory garden. The EMA is no stranger to controversy, particularly in sensitive areas like conflicts of interest, transparency and the publication of clinical trial data.</p><p>The agency has made great efforts to open up its internal processes and gone a long way down the route of transparency. It now publishes the agendas and minutes of the scientific committees, including the CHMP, and the agendas and (non-confidential) outcomes of management board meetings. It has also implemented strict rules conflicts of interest of experts, staff and board members, and makes all interests publicly known.</p><p>There have been hurdles along the way. In 2011 the EMA came under fire for allegedly failing to follow procedures when the outgoing executive director Thomas Lönngren joined a private consultancy firm without a "cooling off" period. Critics claimed the agency had failed to properly check the possibility of a conflict of interest arising from Dr Lönngren's decision to move into the private sector, given the overlap between his previous activities and his proposed new roles.</p><p>The agency ran into more problems in 2011 and 2012, when the European Parliament, which has to sign off the agency's budget each year, raised a number of concerns regarding recruitment procedures and conflicts of interest. These concerns were addressed by, among other things, tightening up procedures on potential conflicts of interest and deciding to publish the minutes and agendas of its various scientific committees.</p><p>The EMA also faced scrutiny from the European Court of Auditors, which prepared a report at the request of parliament on conflict of interest issues at four EU agencies and found numerous shortcomings at the EMA. When the report came out in 2012, the agency said it would look carefully at its recommendations but noted that it had already made numerous changes to address the conflict-of-interest issues, and sent the court in an extensive response detailing the actions it had taken.</p><h2>Push for transparency</h2><p>More trouble was to come as the EMA pursued its efforts to increase the transparency of its operations by drafting new polices on access to documents and clinical trial data. In 2009, the EMA's draft transparency policy laid out its intentions for addressing the growing demand for information from civil society, introducing more openness on its decision-making processes, and taking a "more robust and consistent approach towards transparency in all areas of its operation".</p><p>Nonetheless, in 2010 the European Ombudsman (then Nikiforos Diamandouros) twice pulled the EMA up over its refusal to release documents, once relating to suspected ADRs with Roche's acne drug Roaccutane (isotretinoin), and the other time concerning CSRs/trial protocols for a number of obesity drugs.</p><p>The EMA subsequently published its policy on access to documents at the end of that year, saying it would, as a general rule, aim to release documents once procedures on a drug had been finalized, but with provision for exceptions and redactions. This policy was in line with the broader EU regulation on access to EU documents.</p><p>However, two companies &ndash; AbbVie and InterMune &ndash; filed lawsuits against the agency in 2013 to prevent it releasing clinical study reports (CSRs) for their respective products Humira (adalimumab) and Esbriet (pirfenidone), saying they contained commercially confidential information (CCI) that should not be made public. The EU's General Court awarded the companies injunctions against the disclosure, but these were later set aside by the Court of Justice of the EU which said the lower court had erred in law and that the companies had to prove that disclosure of the data would cause them "serious and irreparable harm". AbbVie eventually dropped its suit in April last year after it agreed with the EMA on a number of redactions before releasing the data. InterMune abandoned it suit later in the year.</p><p>In the meantime, controversy had flared once more in 2012 when the EMA published its draft policy on the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data. Hailed as a breakthrough by transparency campaigners, it offered almost unfettered public access to clinical study reports and allowed researchers to download and manipulate individual patient data for secondary analyses and the like. This naturally caused some consternation within the pharmaceutical industry, which raised concerns about the potential publication of sensitive data, particularly CCI.</p><p>In May 2014, though, the EMA came under fire from campaigners such as AllTrials and Health Action International when it circulated documents at a stakeholder workshop that appeared to restrict researcher access to patient data to CSRs to onscreen access only, with no downloading. The new European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, also stepped in, asking the agency for an explanation of what she called a "significant change of policy".</p><p>The EMA subsequently reinstated online access and downloading, and finally adopted the policy in October 2014, complete with clear Terms of Use and a set of redaction principles for deciding what CCI or other data should be excised from CSRs before they are made public.</p><p>This won't be the end of the transparency debate though, and we can expect countless arguments over just what constitutes CCI in each CSR the agency proposes to publish. An idea of the complications ahead can be gleaned from the detailed justifications provided recently to the Ombudsman by the EMA for the data it agreed to redact from the Humira CSR &ndash; much of which has since been released anyway.</p><p>Moreover, the EMA also has to implement certain transparency provisions of the Clinical Trials Regulation, which was approved in 2014 and is expected to apply from sometime in 2016. Under the CTR, the agency has to set up a clinical trial portal and publicly accessible database, and determine exactly how the transparency provisions should be applied to the information that is made available through the database &ndash; ie what information should be considered CCI. Early results from a consultation on this issue showed a predictable split between industry and transparency campaigners on what should and should not remain secret.</p><p>Other regulatory challenges loom. While the EMA's relationship with the NCAs remains the cornerstone of the EU regulatory network, the debate over how the NCAs should be remunerated for the services they provide has become highly charged.</p><p>About 86% of the EMA's budget comes from industry fees and charges, and the other 14% from the EU contribution. The total budget in 2014 was &euro;297.2 million. The NCAs are remunerated by the EMA for their services, but the payments have increased unequally depending on the type of procedure while at the same time workloads have risen substantially, leading to concerns over the sustainability of the system in the longer term.</p><p>At a meeting last year the EMA management board said that "a fresh, top-down approach" was needed, allowing the whole system to be reviewed before assessing the costs of individual activities by the national agencies in order to arrive at fair remuneration levels. The data resulting from this review will feed into a future legislative proposal from the commission to revise the fees regulation that was originally adopted in February 1995.</p><p>The agency's most recent setback came when Professor Rasi was forced to step aside after an EU civil service tribunal ruling annulled his appointment on procedural grounds. The case was brought in 2011 by another candidate for the job, the former head of the Bulgarian regulatory agency, ironically on the grounds that the procedure used to choose Professor Rasi was tainted by conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency.</p><p>The executive director post has been temporarily filled by deputy executive director Andreas Pott, who had earlier stepped in for some 11 months in 2011, between Dr Lonngren's departure and Professor Rasi's arrival. Professor Rasi was generally very highly regarded as a regulatory chief, so much so that the agency has created a special new job for him: principal adviser in charge of strategy, with responsibility for co-ordinating the scientific committees and "shaping the agency's strategy with respect to regulatory matters of international relevance".</p><p>The European Commission posted a vacancy notice in December 2014, and 36 people applied for the job. It's not known whether Professor Rasi is among them, and if so how his application will fare. We probably won't know for some time: the commission said the selection procedure could take up to six months to conclude.</p><h2>Extending its reach</h2><p>On a more positive note, the EMA has in recent years continued to extend its regulatory reach by launching the "adaptive pathways" initiative, and boosting collaboration with other regulators, health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, and patients.</p><p>The "adaptive pathways" approach (originally known as adaptive licensing) is aimed at new drugs for serious conditions with an unmet medical need, this is a life-cycle approach that will allow a product to be submitted early &ndash; say around Phase II or earlier &ndash; and to gain an initial licence in a small population based on a risk-benefit assessment and strong efficacy signals. The licence would later be broadened out to wider populations via successive phases of evidence gathering.</p><p>It is not a new regulatory path, but rather it relies on bringing together regulatory mechanisms already in place such as conditional approval, scientific advice, compassionate use rules, and patient registries. It involves "safe harbour" discussions among a wide range of stakeholders from companies and the EMA through health technology assessment and clinical treatment guideline bodies to patient and consumer organizations, healthcare professionals and researchers.</p><p>Launched in 2014, the first stage of the pilot project &ndash; involving the submission of proposals and discussions with the applicant &ndash; ended on 28 February. The second stage will involve more in-depth, face-to-face meetings with selected applicants. So far there is little information on just which companies and products have chosen to take part in this initiative, and it remains to be seen how this latest regulatory foray will progress, particularly as concerns have been raised over issues such as the implications for data and orphan drug exclusivity time points. If nothing else, it takes the EMA and its stakeholders into interesting, and doubtless challenging, new territory.</p><p>In another effort to improve patient access to new drugs, the EMA has since 2008 been working with the European network of national health technology assessment (HTA) bodies, EUNetHTA, to look at ways of bringing regulatory and health economic data together to help speed new drugs to market. </p><p>Their collaboration has covered areas like parallel scientific advice on drug development plans, information sharing, and the potential role of EUnetHTA partners in the adaptive pathways project. It has also been suggested that CSRs published by the EMA under its proactive trial data disclosure policy could be used by competitor companies to prepare dossiers for HTA bodies without breaching the policy's Terms of Use, and that HTA bodies could become involved in the drafting of certain EMA guidelines.</p><p>On the international scene, the EMA has expanded its collaboration with the US Food and Drug Administration, forming an agreement in 2001 to share information and form closer ties. These ties have covered topics such as parallel scientific advice and evaluation of orphan drug applications, as well as GCP and GMP inspections, which are an increasingly important component of the EMA's activities. Interactions are also developing with Japan in areas of mutual interest, including ATMPs, biomarkers, paediatrics, orphan drugs and GMP/GCP. The EMA also works with the World Health Organization on the quality of medicines and the development of international non-proprietary names (INNs), and gives positive opinions on medicines intended for markets outside the EU (mainly developing countries).</p><p>Moreover, building on links first forged in 2000, the EMA has gradually drawn patients and health professionals further into its ambit by giving them a seat on various agency advisory bodies. By 2014 patients had representation on four EMA committees and were sitting in on numerous scientific advisory group meetings and scientific advice procedures. Their involvement took a significant leap forward in 2014, when patients were invited for the first time to take part in the benefit-risk discussion at the CHMP on a specific product - Clinuvel's Scenesse. In October that year, the EMA launched a pilot project whereby patients can be invited to take part in such discussions on a more regular basis, giving them an even greater say in the evaluation of the benefits and risks of new products.</p><h2>Anniversary Conference</h2><p>Patients will be the focus of a special anniversary conference to be held in London on 18 March, looking at how to best support innovation in order to increase public health.</p><p>The invitation-only event, entitled "Science, Medicines, Health: Patients at the heart of future innovation", will examine how to best support innovation in order to increase public health. It will feature prominent figures such as outgoing FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg and Elias Zerhouni, Sanofi's president of global R&D, and Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser to the UK government, as well as representatives of the EMA and various stakeholders from industry, academia, patient bodies and the investment community.</p><p>The EMA has come a long way over the past 20 years, but "there is no room for complacency", Mr Pott notes in his introduction to the conference. Daunting regulatory challenges have still to be addressed: the growth in chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease, the threat of antimicrobial resistance, and the fact that there are still diseases for which no treatments are available. Shifts in healthcare systems and rapid scientific progress will change the way medicines are developed and brought to patients in the future, and regulators will have to respond accordingly.</p><p>The EMA may be proud of its achievements, but there is still more to do. As Mr Pott says, "We need to seize new opportunities and address challenges together with all our stakeholders so that we continue to deliver on our mission to foster scientific excellence in the evaluation and supervision of medicines, for the benefit of public and animal health".</p><p><i>Ian Schofield is a senior analyst specialising in European pharmaceutical regulatory affairs for Scrip Intelligence and Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>.</p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
