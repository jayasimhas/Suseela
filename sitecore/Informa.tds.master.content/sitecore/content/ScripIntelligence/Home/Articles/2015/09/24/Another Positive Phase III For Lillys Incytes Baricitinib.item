<p>Eli Lilly & Co. and Incyte Corp. reported on Sept. 29 that baricitinib bested the first-line rheumatoid arthritis (RA) standard of care methotrexate in a late-stage clinical trial, so now the partners must complete just one more Phase III trial before seeking regulatory approvals for the JAK inhibitor.</p><p>Baricitinib met the primary endpoint in the Phase III RA-BEGIN study by achieving non-inferiority compared with methotrexate based on ACR20 response rates at 24 weeks of treatment. Lilly's and Incyte's oral, once-daily selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 also performed better than the generic RA standby treatment. If approved, baricitinib will compete directly with Pfizer Inc.'s <i>Xeljanz</i> (tofacitinib), which is the first and only JAK inhibitor approved for RA, but the newer drug may be a safer oral therapy.</p><p>RA-BEGIN enrolled almost 600 patients with moderate to severe RA who had limited or no prior exposure to methotrexate and who never were treated with other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients were randomized into three treatment arms: once-weekly methotrexate, 4mg of once-daily baricitinib, or 4mg of baricitinib daily plus once-weekly methotrexate. </p><p>Lilly and Incyte did not reveal top-line data for the combination therapy arm. Detailed results from all RA-BEGIN treatment arms will be presented or published in 2015 and 2016.</p><p><b>Broad Treatment Potential</b></p><p>"The superiority of baricitinib over methotrexate in the treatment of patients with early RA adds to the positive data already seen for baricitinib in RA patients with inadequate responses to traditional DMARDs (RA-BUILD) and biological therapies (RA-BEACON)," Incyte chief drug development officer Rich Levy said in a joint statement from the company and Lilly. "If approved, we believe that baricitinib has the potential to be used across multiple lines of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis."</p><p>Xeljanz is approved in the US as a monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs to treat RA patients who've failed or are intolerant to methotrexate. The drug has a black box warning about serious infections, including tuberculosis, as well as lymphomas and other malignancies.</p><p>The RA-BEGIN top-line results in methotrexate-na&iuml;ve patient, suggest that baricitinib could be prescribed even earlier than Xeljanz before patients fail or find that they cannot tolerate methotrexate. The data, combined with results from Lilly's and Incyte's two previously completed Phase III studies, also suggest that baricitinib may be safer than Pfizer's drug.</p><p>Baricitinib's developers reported that the incidence of serious adverse events, including serious infections, was similar across all three treatment arms in the RA-BEGIN study with no cases of tuberculosis or gastrointestinal perforations. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse events were most frequent in the combination baricitinib-methotrexate arm. The most common side effects were described as similar to other baricitinib studies.</p><p><b>More Phase III Data Coming Soon</b></p><p>The previously completed Phase III RA-BEACON clinical trial enrolled 527 RA patients who failed treatment with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/First-PhIII-data-with-LillyIncytes-oral-JAK-inhibitor-impresses-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-355542" target="_new">at least one tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor</a>. The Phase III RA-BUILD trial enrolled 684 RA patients who had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/LillyIncytes-baricitinib-still-has-more-to-do-in-RA-358931" target="_new">inadequate responses to conventional DMARDs</a>. Both studies compared ACR20 scores at 12 weeks for baricitinib versus placebo</p><p>Lilly and Incyte expect to report data from a fourth Phase III clinical trial later this year. RA-BEAM will provide the last set of late-stage clinical data that the companies need to seek regulatory approvals in most markets. The study will compare baricitinib to placebo and to AbbVie Inc.'s <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab) in RA patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate. A fifth Phase III study also is under way to facilitate approval in China. </p><p>Baricitinib may be able to unseat Xeljanz as the top-selling oral JAK inhibitor for RA, if approved, but it could face competition in the future as well. AbbVie, Astellas Pharma and Galapagos NV each have JAK inhibitors in Phase IIb development for RA. </p><p>Galapagos claimed in August that based on Phase II data for its drug filgotinib, the company may have a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Galapagos-Boasts-Best-In-Class-With-Its-RA-JAK-Inhibitor-359921" target="_new">best-in-class JAK inhibitor</a>. However, AbbVie recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Money-Motivate-AbbVies-Galapagos-Decision-360694" target="_new">dropped its interest in filgotinib</a> to focus on its wholly-owned JAK inhibitor ABT-494.</p><p>Johnson & Johnson's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Janssen-returns-Astellass-JAK-inhibitor-355374" target="_new">Janssen subsidiary similarly returned its rights</a> to Astellas for the Japanese pharma company's JAK inhibitor ASP015K in December.</p><p><p><p><p>
