<p><p>Arrowhead Research got a bit of good news on 13 April when the FDA cleared a partial clinical hold for the firm's chronic hepatitis B infection drug ARC-520, allowing Arrowhead to go ahead with a planned Phase IIb study for the drug.</p><p>The multiple dose mid-stage study, dubbed Heparc-2004, hopes to enroll 12 patients with chronic immune active HBV infection maintained on entecavir or tenofovir therapy and will be randomize patients 2:1 with eight patients receiving 1 mg/kg of ARC-520 and four patients receiving placebo. Each patient will receive three total doses, once every four weeks. Patients will be followed through Day 147.</p><p> The primary goal of the study is to measure levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in response to the drug, while secondary endpoints will look at safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics. </p><p>"This notification from the FDA allows us to begin a multiple-dose Phase 2b study of ARC-520, and we are working diligently to get treatment sites up and running. Our goal is to gain site IRB approvals and perform site initiation visits to begin recruiting and enrolling patients for this study in about a month," said Dr Bruce Given, chief operating officer and head of R&D for Arrowhead, in a statement. "We are also working with various regulatory agencies outside of the United States to initiate additional Phase 2b studies."</p><p>The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Arrowhead-plummets-on-FDA-partial-hold-356098" target="_new">FDA put a partial clinical hold</a> on the trial in January when the company proposed conducting a parallel study design of 2mg/kg and 4mg/kg of the RNAi-based compound. Regulators requested additional information, including a final study report from the single-dose Phase IIa trial in patients who received 1mg/kg-4mg/kg ARC-520. That study currently is ongoing, with no serious adverse events or evidence of end organ toxicity reported to date, Arrowhead said.</p><p><p><p>
