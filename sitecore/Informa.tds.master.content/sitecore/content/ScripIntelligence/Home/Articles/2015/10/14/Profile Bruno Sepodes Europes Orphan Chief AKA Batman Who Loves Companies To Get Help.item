<p><b>Bruno Sepodes is the chair of the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, the body that effectively decides whether your product wins and keeps its orphan status. In Scrip's latest industry profile, he talked about helping companies chase their dreams, where they go wrong and how for 10 years he led a double life as a Body Balance instructor. </b></p><p><p>Bruno Sepodes</p><p>Not only does Sepodes sit on the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and Committee for Advanced Therapies, he is also a member of the medicines evaluation board at INFARMED, the Portuguese regulator. He is also professor of pharmacology and pharmacotherapy at the University of Lisbon.</p><p><b>Scrip: How did you get to be chair of the COMP: what is your secret? </b></p><p><b>BS:</b> There was a search for expertise in non-clinical research and some emphasis on reducing the use of animals in experiments, and I had experience in both. My PhD was in ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is an area where we have some orphan designations. Also, I'm trained as a pharmacologist, which was seen as an area of need. I was very lucky, and it was an honor to be chosen. </p><p><b>Scrip: Why did you go for a career as a regulator?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> That's a very good question. I think it's because I always wanted to teach and go into academia and being a regulator seems the logical way for an academic to continue learning. I did my degree in pharmaceutical sciences, then my masters in regulation and evaluation of medicines and health products and then my PhD in pharmacology. And as a regulator I have no conflicts of interest at all but I have access to all the knowledge produced by different companies. I think this satisfied my hunger for knowledge, especially knowledge that you don't find in books. Science is happening here and I see things that I would only read about in an article or in a book later on. That's one of the things I like about working with orphan drugs because you get products at a very early stage of development, you see some dreams and you have the ability to encourage those dreams when they are very good.</p><p><b>Scrip: What are your long-term hopes, beyond chair?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> My approach to life is very holistic, and I never disregard any possibility. But as long as I can serve the European Medicines Agency, I will do so. I believe in the agency's strategy and its ideas for the future &ndash; I'd like to be part of that future. </p><p><b>Scrip: Are there any misconceptions about regulators you think the industry has and you want to set right?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> There is one, there's a big misconception that starts in the universities and stays with people: that regulators are controllers. They think we are policemen. Of course we are guardians of the regulations but it's in our interest to help development and when there's a perfect interaction with industry, things work really well because the learning goes both ways. So I think the biggest misconception is the idea that we are the enemy or an adversary; I don't think so, I think we are all on the same path, dealing with different aspects of the same objective.</p><p><b>Scrip: Is there anything that frustrates you about industry?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> That developers don't use the incentives on offer, like protocol assistance: I don't get that. And also as chair of the COMP I see a lot of designations that don't go anywhere. Developers get the designation then it all stops and you don't know what's happening because you don't get any feedback.</p><p><b>Scrip: What have you learned from industry?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> A lot. I have met very intelligent people and seen very focused approaches to development. I like the organization I see in industry, the ability to trace a path and follow it, and the consistency of the work when it is well done. I like these aspects of industry because I don't think universities are ideal places to talk about organization, at least in my country. So as you can see I didn't choose to work in industry because I probably wouldn't fit there!</p><p><b>Scrip: What's been the COMP's biggest achievement under your chairmanship?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I think the biggest achievement has been facing the shift on our agendas to having an increasing number of discussions on maintenance of orphan status at the time of marketing authorization. That's a big responsibility because that's when you put something on the market and recommend whether the European Commission maintains the drug's orphan designation. This is where you see the result of all the work, like the protocol assistance and the advice you gave during development, and if it has paid off. You want to see if the company was able to fulfil all the criteria. I think that has been the big challenge.</p><p><b>Scrip: What advice would you give companies developing an orphan drug?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I would like them to be more focused on post-designation incentives and to always come for protocol assistance when they get the designation. Even if they don't have the orphan designation, they should seek scientific advice whenever there are doubts about development or problems that may surface at the time of marketing authorization assessment.</p><p><b>Scrip: What's the most frustrating aspect of your role?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> It's actually the fact that you see good drugs getting into the market, you see a lot of designations, but then access to drugs is something completely different from what we are doing. We are very happy when we designate a drug and then we see the development and then eventually see it go through the CHMP and wins marketing authorization. But then patients complain they have no access, so that's something Europe needs to deal with and that's something that's out of my reach and it's frustrating. But I think there are some initiatives that will help, like promoting the interaction between regulators and health technology assessment bodies, to do joint protocol assistance and scientific advice.</p><p><b>Scrip: Is there anyone in the industry or the regulatory world that you particularly admire?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I particularly admire Fernand Sauer, he was the first executive director of EMA. I learn so much every time he speaks, everything he envisioned has happened. He has very good knowledge and vision and I shape some of my views for the future based on his opinions because I really treasure them. [Ed's note: To read Fernand Sauer's review of the EMA on the occasion of its 20th anniversary, published in Scrip earlier this year, click <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Fernand-Sauer-reviews-the-first-two-decades-and-offers-advice-for-regulators-at-all-levels-357045" target="_new">here</a>]</p><p><b>Scrip: What was your first job?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I immediately joined academia, so my first job was an assistant at the University of Lisbon's Faculty of Pharmacy, teaching pharmacology. So, basically, I started there and progressed. </p><p><b>What are the key things that shaped you when you were growing up?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> Like all of us, most of them were personal. When I was growing up there were some economically challenging moments and I also had to deal with a family that was split all around the world. And I must confess I learned very early that I wanted to know more &ndash; that's why I think I became an academic. Knowledge is something that empowers you to change your life, so when you come up against challenges, what you realize is that the only way to get through this, is by gaining knowledge, by studying, and that's what I did. I worked very hard, I loved to study. I've always loved to study and learn.</p><p><b>Scrip: Who has been your biggest influence?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> It might sound like a clich√©, but it was actually my mother because she raised me alone from the age of three and she remains still today a beam of honesty, of strength, of justice in my life. She's also a teacher so I think I got the inspiration of becoming a teacher from her.</p><p><b>Scrip: What's the best advice you've ever had?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> Actually it was the fact that in our lives we will face many defeats but we should not let ourselves be defeated. I think this is something we all should think about because there will be negative moments for all and the way we face them makes the difference.</p><p><b>Scrip: How do you relax?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> That's easy, I live very close to the sea, so I love my walks by the sea. Cooking is my passion and that's related to my taste for chemistry and pharmacy. I also spend time with my dachshund dog, Ralph. He is actually my most important companion when I'm at home. If I could bring him to the meetings I would. Unfortunately it's not allowed yet, but if I was on the veterinary committee&#8230;</p><p><b>Scrip: Can you tell me something surprising about yourself?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> That's a tricky one. Not many people know that I'm a certified instructor for Pilates and Body Balance. I've taught Body Balance for 10 years, it's a mix of Tai Chi, Yoga and Pilates. I'm still a certified instructor by Les Mills, the program's founder. I still do my quarterly continuous education every three months. For 10 years I had a secret identity teaching a one hour class every week. In my career I was Bruce Wayne, but at night I was Batman: a fitness instructor that people only knew as Bruno.</p><p><b>Scrip: What gets you out of bed in the morning?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> As long as I have objectives I get out of bed in the morning very easily. I'm a morning person actually. We all have days where we don't want to get out of bed, but I fight them very easily with the goals that I set for myself. I was born in September, I'm a Virgo so I'm a little bit obsessed with goals, and I'm tough on myself.</p><p><b>Scrip: If you weren&rsquo;t Chair of the COMP what would you be?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I wouldn't see a change in in terms of career, I would remain an academic. If I weren't chair, but still a COMP member, I would take the time to be more involved with the SAWP, the Scientific Advice Working Party, to become more involved in protocol assistance. I would probably continue my work at the CHMP where I'm nominated by Portugal and I would also have more time to spend at the CAT. I would have still a lot to do, luckily, at the agency so that would be nice.</p><p><b>Scrip: What's your proudest moment been?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> There are two: being elected Chair of the COMP when I was 35 years old &ndash; I was the youngest member of the committee. It was a tough fight and it was a very proud moment for me. And the other one is related to my academic career. I always wanted to reach the top, and last year I did with my <i>Habilitation</i>, which you do after your PhD [in certain countries - ed.], it is the final public assessment of your abilities as a researcher and the highest academic qualification you can achieve. I was the youngest person to do it in Pharmacology and Therapeutics at University of Lisbon. I'm very proud of that and those are moments I will always treasure.</p><p><b>Scrip: What about your most difficult moment?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> I think all the difficult moments we have relate to envy and injustice. I don't deal well with injustice: I will defend a stranger because I hate injustice. For me, discovering that human beings are able to harm one another is terrible, so those aspects together might sum up some of the difficult moments I have had in my life.</p><p><b>Scrip: What was your favorite subject at school?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> Biology. Interestingly also history but then I had to choose and I'm a biology guy, a biology nerd actually. </p><p><b>Scrip: What are you reading at the moment?</b></p><p><b>BS: </b>The Harry Quebert Affair, by Joel Dicker. It's a very interesting story, but my favourite book is by Isabel Allende, The House of Spirits. It's remarkable. I read it every two years. I love the fact that there are so many different characters and you can follow them through different generations. </p><p><b>Scrip: And your favorite film?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> My favorite film is actually Amadeus, directed by Milos Forman, about how Antonio Salieri supposedly killed Mozart. It's from 1984 and I still adore it because of the music. It's also one of the first movies I recall besides animated films and cartoons. I could say the Sound of Music, but that's too old &ndash; we've all watched it at least 30 times or more.</p><p><b>Scrip: If you could meet anyone dead or alive who would that be?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> That is easy, I would love to meet Maya Angelou. She was a poet, an artist and a professor. She did a lot, and definitely made her mark on some of the biggest personalities in the United States. If you watch her talks on YouTube, you learn so much. She shared so much about racism, love, life, identity, how should you face adversity and how should you face your success. And I would really like to have a calm conversation with Pope Francis, I don't know if it will ever happen, but the truth is we have been very close, just 50 centimeters apart when I was at a General Audience in January, at the Vatican. I like the refreshed message he's bringing to the world. </p>
