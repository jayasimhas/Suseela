<p>AstraZeneca PLC has forged what is the latest in a string of clinical collaborations involving its anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab (MEDI-4736), announcing Aug. 24 a deal to evaluate the compound in combination with US biotech Peregrine Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s first-in-class agent bavituximab.</p><p>It is the second clinical collaboration disclosed by AstraZeneca for durvalumab this month, and the fifth specifically for the agent this year. AstraZeneca and Peregrine are banking on the different modes of action of durvalumab and bavituximab to bring something novel to cancer therapy; preclinical studies have shown combining the two compounds prolongs the time tumour-specific T-cells attack tumour cells, the two companies said. </p><p>Bavituximab, Peregrine's lead compound, is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against phosphatidylserine in the cell walls of vascular tissue. It is being evaluated by the US company in a variety of different cancers and in different combinations. The Phase III SUNRISE study is evaluating bevatuximab with docetaxel for the second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and a Phase II study in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 antibody Opdivo (nivolumab) in NSCLC is planned.</p><p>Phosphatidylserine has an immunosuppressive effect in the tumor microenvironment, but in healthy cells it is usually found on the inside of cell wall membranes where it is not able to exert this effect. However, cells that line tumour blood vessels often have exposed phosphatidylserine that suppresses the ability of T-cells to recognise and kill tumor cells.</p><p><p>
