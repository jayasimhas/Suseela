<p>Out-of-the-box hepatitis C therapy financing initiatives in India, previously known to have improved access to interferon alfa 2b, are now being tested in the competitive sofosbuvir market in the country.</p><p>G V Prasad, CEO of Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that the company was doing a pilot financing initiative with a partner &ndash; a small microfinance firm &ndash; for sofosbuvir, though it was early days still.</p><p>"We guarantee them payment and we are taking the risk," Mr Prasad told <i>Scrip</i> at the sidelines of a press briefing in Mumbai. </p><p>In March this year, Dr Reddy's entered into an agreement with the local firm Hetero to distribute and market sofosbuvir 400mg tablets under the brand name Resof in India. </p><p>Hetero and Natco Pharma are believed to be the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-Sovaldi-generics-saga-2-suppliers-and-falling-prices-357593" target="_new">only key suppliers</a> of sofosbuvir to most of the local firms including Strides Arcolab, Cipla, Zydus Cadila and Dr Reddy's Laboratories in India. </p><p>Last year Gilead entered into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">licensing deals</a> with seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Strides, Ranbaxy and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries. Biocon subsequently joined the list of licensees, followed by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Patent-challenger-Natco-is-now-Gilead-licensee-for-Sovaldi-357020" target="_new">Natco</a>, which had previously challenged the Sovaldi patent. </p><p>Mr Prasad believes that such financing models are important in India because people are often denied treatment because of affordability issues, unlike in some other markets that have insurance or government healthcare, where treatment may be delayed because of the "queues in the system."</p><p>"In India people actually forgo treatment because of the cost."</p><p>He underscored, though, that it was early days still and that the firm was running a number of pilots and "seeing what sticks&#8230; what the market wants/likes."</p><p>Finer details on the pilot financing initiative were not immediately available. India has over the recent past seen innovative social start-ups offer medical loans for those outside of the formal system, which typically requires collateral or income proof. </p><p>It's probably too early to gauge if Dr Reddy's efforts could potentially have a large impact on access or its product's sales in the sofosbuvir market, though some industry experts referred to what they claimed has been the waning success of past financing efforts in the hepatitis C segment. <i>Scrip</i> could not independently verify these claims immediately.</p><p>Some experts also predict future government involvement &ndash; subsidizing treatment &ndash; in such therapy areas as prices move downward. </p><p>Merck & Co's out-of-the-box hepatitis C therapy <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MSD-Indias-out-of-the-box-Hep-C-financing-how-why-and-what-next-352206" target="_new">financing initiative</a> in India &ndash; involving a clutch of other stakeholders including a financial credit firm and named Sambhav (meaning "possible" in Hindi) &ndash; was earlier said to have improved accessibility to its Viraferon Peg (interferon alfa 2b) in pockets of the country. Others like <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BI-wants-to-own-lung-therapy-space-as-India-priced-afatinib-debuts-358851" target="_new">Boehringer Ingelheim</a> India too have indicated that it is evaluating financing models for its oncology as well as other critical care products. </p><p>Mr Prasad also referred to Dr Reddy's early stage efforts to create services that help patients in their "journey from sickness to wellness." One such initiative was linked with the firm's darbepoetin brand and aimed at improving compliance.</p><h2>New ventures</h2><p>The Dr Reddy's CEO also touched upon the company's interest in looking at "related areas for health" such as technologies that enable the firm's core business or even things such as digital health and health records.</p><p>"We could even incubate ideas from internal entrepreneurs. We may do small investments in some areas, we may incubate the whole company in some areas," he added.</p><p> He, though, stressed that the new ventures business is still an idea, but could involve a "sizable" corpus.</p><p>"It will be new developments in the healthcare area&#8230; it could mean nutrition, health-IT, digital or just technology to make products."</p><p>Mr Prasad had, in a previous <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Interview-Dr-Reddys-CEO-on-move-from-curing-diseases-to-managing-health-356959" target="_new">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i>, noted how digital health was going to change the future of healthcare and companies like Google and lot of other start-ups were doing very exciting things. He then mentioned hiring a manager to think of this opportunity.</p><p>"As a CEO, when I look at the horizon, I can see this storm brewing...it's digital health, advances in genomics, the low cost of sequencing, big data that integrates all this. It's a perfect storm," he said at the time. </p><p>
