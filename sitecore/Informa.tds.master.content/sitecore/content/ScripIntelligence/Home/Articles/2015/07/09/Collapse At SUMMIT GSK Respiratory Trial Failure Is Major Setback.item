<p>The SUMMIT mortality trial conducted by GlaxoSmithKline plc and partner Theravance Inc. of their once-daily LABA/ICS therapy <i>Relvar/Breo Ellipta</i> (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has failed to meet its primary endpoint, initial data show. </p><p>This is a major setback for GSK's respiratory portfolio as positive data would have helped differentiate the product from other similar therapies, including GSK's <i>Advair</i> (fluticasone propionate), which is off-patent in some territories and is seeing plummeting sales. </p><p>GSK's CEO Andrew Witty has said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-GSK-will-focus-on-gigantic-pools-of-volume-says-Witty-358233" target="_new">he expects to see</a> the company's respiratory portfolio return to growth in 2016.</p><p>Since launch, Relvar/Breo has struggled to achieve GSK's and investors' expectations for commercial success. The SUMMIT trial had aimed to show that the drug reduced overall mortality: this would have "helped GSK market Breo's advantages &ndash; above and beyond its once-daily dosing &ndash; and argue for unencumbered reimbursement access," note analysts from Deutsche Bank. </p><p>The data showed a 12.2% lower risk of dying when on Breo, versus placebo, but the primary endpoint failed to reach statistical significance (p=0.137). A reduced rate of lung function decline was shown (8mL per year) (p=0.019) in the Breo arm, but given the primary endpoint was missed, statistical significance could not be inferred. Barclays analysts added that "the miss undoubtedly represents the removal of a potential positive catalyst."</p><p>GSK however was bullish. "[We] did not factor a positive result from the SUMMIT study into the forecasts or the guidance we gave at our investor day in May," a spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>. Talking at the May investor day, Abbas Hussain, global head of pharmaceuticals had said, "In our forecast for Relvar, we obviously cannot predict the study but we have not actually assumed any upside as a consequence of a positive SUMMIT study."</p><p>Regarding the primary endpoint failure, the spokesperson noted that "no other COPD medicine has been able to demonstrate a significant improvement in mortality." </p><p>In terms of data from the other endpoints, "ICS containing treatments are well established to reduce exacerbation risk (GOLD 2015), and there are data to suggest that ICS may have an impact on health-related quality of life (e.g. SGRQ) and rate of decline in FEV1." The SUMMIT study "provides further data to support the role of Relvar as an important COPD treatment demonstrating improvements on measures such as FEV1 and exacerbations, and also on lung function decline."</p><p>The SUMMIT involved 16,485 patients from 43 countries who had COPD with moderate airflow limitation (FEV1 50-70% predicted) and either a history of or increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><p>"We believe many analysts and investors had been optimistic over the SUMMIT trial," suggested Deutsche analysts. This is because a prior mortality trial of Advair (the TORCH study) had narrowly failed to show a benefit on survival. In addition, "the SUMMIT trial had been enriched for patients with high cardiovascular risk in an attempt to improve its potential for a positive outcome," noted the analysts. However, "we do not believe most analysts had factored this into Breo forecasts given uncertainty over the impact of the trial on the drug's potential. In particular, it is unclear if positive results from SUMMIT would simply have been perceived as a class effect." </p><p>Breo sales have been forecast to reach &pound;229m in 2015, growing to &pound;878m by 2019. </p><p>"The challenge GSK faces is to drive prescription volumes in Breo ahead of Advair's US patent expiry in August 2016 and while initial uptake was hampered due to the absence of asthma and reimbursement issues, the recent proprietary dynamic market shows an encouraging gain," conclude Barclays analysts.</p><p>GSK's share price slipped less than 1% in trading on the news (Sep. 9, 2015).</p>
