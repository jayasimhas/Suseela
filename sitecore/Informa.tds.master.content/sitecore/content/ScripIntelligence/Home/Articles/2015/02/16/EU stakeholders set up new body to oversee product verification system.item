<p>Industry, wholesaler and pharmacy bodies have formally established the European Medicines Verification Organisation (EMVO), a not-for-profit body that will oversee the supply chain security system intended to combat the trade in falsified medicines in the EU.</p><p>Based in Luxembourg and described by its stakeholders as "a key tool to combat the emergence of falsified medicines in the EU legitimate supply chain and improve patient safety", as required under the 2011 Falsified Medicines Directive, the EMVO will oversee the European Hub linking national verification systems across Europe. </p><p>The new system is being built up by a partnership known as the European Stakeholder Model (ESM), which was set up in 2011 and comprises associations representing the R&D-based pharma industry (EFPIA), generics companies (EGA), parallel traders (EAEPC), wholesalers (GIRP) and pharmacists (PGEU). </p><p>The associations said the EMVO was the "culmination of four years of intensive work towards a dependable and secure pharmaceutical verification system", and that it would allow end-to-end verification of medicine packs from the point of manufacture through wholesalers to pharmacy dispensing.</p><p>It involves packs carrying a 2D data matrix code based on international standards that will contain the product number, batch number, expiry date and a random serial number. Scanning of any unregistered code will alert the pharmacist to the possibility that the product is falsified. The data matrix also has the capacity to contain other information such as different national codes. </p><p>Wholesalers will not check packs routinely but only as required. Parallel distributors moving packs among EU countries will verify each pack before repackaging and generate a new number to be uploaded to the hub. </p><p>The first member state to link up fully with the system under the newly established EMVO will be Germany, whose securPharm system is already running under real-life conditions and uses the same verification technology as the hub. Other countries will be able to develop their own verification systems, or else use the "national Blueprint System Template" &ndash; the existing verification infrastructure developed by the EMVO.</p><p>John Chave, secretary general of the PGEU and the newly appointed spokesman for the EMVO, said the establishment of the organisation was "a major milestone in the implementation of the Falsified Medicines Directive", and showed stakeholders "working together to improve the security of the legitimate supply chain and, most importantly, to promote patient safety". </p><h2>Safety features</h2><p>The directive also requires the European Commission to issue special legislation &ndash; a "delegated act" outlining the technical specifications of the safety features, including tamper-evidence and a "unique identifier", to be applied to pharmaceutical product packs. </p><p>Not all products will have to carry the safety feature: the default, risk-based position is that most prescription drugs will, and most non-prescription medicines will not, but there is room for exceptions. The delegated act, which was originally due to be published in 2014 but is now expected sometime this year, will provide for a white list of prescription drugs that don't need a safety feature, and a black list of non-prescription medicines that do. </p><p>There has been some dispute over the criteria used to determine these exceptions, which include the product's price and sales volume, the number of previous incidents of falsification, the characteristics of the product, and the seriousness of the condition treated by the product. Member states were asked last year to submit proposals to the commission as to which products should be on the two lists, with a deadline for comments of 3 October 2014.</p><p>Arguments over which products should be subject to the safety feature also led the EGA to delay joining the ESM, which it finally did at the end of last year. The association had originally said that while generics companies were firmly behind moves to tackle falsification, they were concerned about the cost implications of a system that would predominantly be protecting higher-priced branded medicines. However, it said in December that an ongoing dialogue among the stakeholders had helped to "bring down costs, overcome misunderstandings and misleading facts, and encourage the ongoing expansion of the EMVO" (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/After-initial-doubts-generics-firms-join-European-anti-counterfeiting-scheme-355548" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 10 December 2014).</p>
