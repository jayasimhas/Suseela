<p>Merck & Co's single-pill HIV product Dutrebis (lamivudine/raltegravir) has received an approval green light in Europe. </p><p>The EMA's committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) has given the product a positive opinion in its first round of decisions this year. </p><p>The CHMP is recommending Dutrebis, 150 mg lamivudine/300 mg raltegravir, film-coated tablet be approved for the treatment of HIV 1 infection in adults, adolescents, and children from the age of six years and weighing at least 30kg. </p><p>The CHMP said the main benefit of Dutrebis was the improvement in dosing regimen. The combination product reduces the daily pill burden, while retaining comparable efficacy as compared to dosing with the individual agents, the committee said. </p><p>The most common side-effects observed during treatment with the individual components of Dutrebis were headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhea and cough.</p><p>Lamivudine, one of the two ingredients of Dutrebis, is an HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor while raltegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. Both are currently marketed as HIV treatments. </p><p>In the light of fierce competition, HIV drug developers are developing new strategies to promote their already marketed drugs. As such single-tablet regimens (STRs) for the treatment of HIV have begun to dominate the market space. According to Datamonitor Healthcare combined market share for STRs is predicted to increase from 30.8% in 2013 to 49.1% in 2022. Meanwhile, sales of HIV therapies, in general, in the US and five major EU markets are set to increase from $12.5bn in 2013 to $17.4bn in 2022. </p><p>As of January 2015, there were three other combination products in development for which new drug applications in the US or market authorization applications in the EU have been filed. They are: Bristol-Myers Squibb's reyataz/ cobicistat; Gilead Science's emtricitabine/ elvitegravir/ cobicistat/ GS-7340; and Johnson & Johnson's cobicistat/ darunavir. Meanwhile, in the HIV pipeline there are three drugs in Phase III trials, 24 in Phase II and 12 in Phase I. </p><p>However, Merck will mainly be competing in the space against ViiV Healthcare's single-dose Triumeq (dolutegravir /abacavir sulphate /lamivudine FDC), approved in the summer of 2014, and Gilead's market leading product Atripla (efavirenz /emtricitabine/ tenofovir). But Datamonitor Healthcare forecasts that Atripla's dominance will begin to recede in the near to mid-term future. </p><p>Merck is expecting a decision from the US FDA on Dutrebis's NDA, accepted by the regulator in June 2014, sometime between February and March this year. </p>
