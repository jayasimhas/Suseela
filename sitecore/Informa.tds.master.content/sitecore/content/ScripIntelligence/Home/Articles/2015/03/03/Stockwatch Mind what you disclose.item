<p>Not before time last week, the SEC fired a shot across the bows of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have been failing to accurately portray their dealings with the FDA. At the Annual Pharmaceutical Compliance Congress, SEC enforcement director Andrew Ceresney reportedly scolded biopharma companies over lapses in the accuracy of disclosures on their dealings with the FDA. Perhaps his words indicate that, after years of only scratching the surface of the problem, the SEC intends to get serious about addressing selective and misleading disclosure of material events, including biotech firms&rsquo; interactions with the FDA. </p><p>Orexigen obligingly provided the SEC with an object lesson in disclosure bias only a couple of days later. Ironically though, history has shown us that disclosure breaches may not produce the desired effect for the offending company.</p><p><p>I've always thought the rule stating that all discussions between the FDA and a drug's sponsor should remain confidential puts investors at a disadvantage. It allows the FDA to say to a sponsor something like "you can file your NDA on gold leaf if you like, but we'll still never approve this drug", and the company could report to investors that it had "a constructive dialogue with the FDA". The SEC's enforcement director specifically mentioned the accuracy of material disclosures in 8-K filings last week. Only two days later, an 8-K filing prompted firstly a 32% jump in the stock price of Orexigen Therapeutics, and then criticism from all sides, including both the SEC and the FDA (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orexigen-soars-on-CV-data-that-FDA-didnt-want-released-357057" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 04 March 2015</a>).</p><p><p>Orexigen filed its 8-K statement of a material event with the SEC to coincide with a patent publication that included the un-blinded results of a second interim analysis of the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes LIGHT study of Contrave (naltrexone and bupropion extended release tabets) in high-risk obese patients. The positive first interim analysis of the LIGHT study enabled Contrave's approval to treat obesity (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Contrave-OKd-in-obesity-multiple-trials-required-353812" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 11 September 2011</a>). It seems that in releasing results of a second interim analysis of the ongoing study, which was supposed to remain blinded to all but the CRO, the DSMB and the FDA, Orexigen may rile not just the FDA but also the SEC. Investors however, were overjoyed at the surprising demonstration of (interim, blinded and preliminary) efficacy. For me, the biggest surprise was that the FDA wanted the LIGHT study completed to determine whether Contrave had any additional cardiovascular toxicity, rather than whether it could help with weight loss. </p><p><p>Orexigen's determination, in the face of the now disclosed concerns by the FDA and its partner Takeda on premature disclosure and the corruption of study integrity, to release another positive interim analysis of the LIGHT study (which was never meant to be for public consumption), reminds me of another, similarly positive &ndash; but ultimately fatal &ndash; interim release of data by a biotechnology company. </p><p><p>I was attending the UBS healthcare conference in New York in September 2004, which got off to a bang with cardiovascular company AtheroGenics releasing positive interim Phase II data on arterial plaque deposit reduction from the CART-2 study of its lead anti-inflammatory compound AGI-1067. I remember sitting dejected in the hotel lobby and being consoled by other investors after AtheroGenics' breakout presentation because the CART-2 study had clearly failed (and I was almost ashamed at being an investor in the company). Meanwhile, though, the company's positive pronouncement of the data was propelling its share price to close up 64% on that day. My response was to sell my fund's holding in AtheroGenics, a trade that preceded its subsequent $200m convertible debt offering, the lawsuits claiming false representation of the CART-2 study (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/AtheroGenics-sued-after-amending-Phase-III-trial-68805" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 21 January 2005</a>), but also the global license of AGI-1067 to AstraZeneca (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/AstraZeneca-to-pay-up-to-1-billion-for-Atherogenics-lead-compound-68500" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 January 2006</a>). In the event, AGI-1067 convincingly failed in Phase III (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/AtherogenicsAstraZenecas-atherosclerosis-drug-misses-primary-endpoint-32927" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 March 2007</a>) resulting in the termination of the license with AstraZeneca and AtheroGenics' bankruptcy (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AtheroGenics-files-for-Chapter-11-3470" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 10 October 2008</a>).</p><p><p>It seems that the FDA and the SEC may be learning from their hands-off disclosure policies of the past: the former at least is reported to be considering penalties against Orexigen. There are lots of direct and indirect sanctions that the FDA can take against a drug's sponsor. Just ask Indian generics company Ranbaxy, which found its FDA approvals for generic Diovan (valsartan) and Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) withheld to its significant cost after it repeatedly cut corners on drug quality and ignored the FDA's Form 483 manufacturing inspection notices (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FDA-extends-consent-decree-terms-to-Ranbaxys-Mohali-unit-346631" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 17 September 2013</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-challenges-FDAs-yanking-of-generic-approvals-355121" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>).</p><p><p>However, the continuing drip feed of results from the LIGHT study may end up being a big storm in a tiny teacup since the prescription obesity market continues to be a commercial disappointment to all companies involved. Arena Pharmaceuticals and partner Eisai managed to sell only $10m worth of Belviq (lorcaserin) for obesity in the last quarter of 2014, whilst Vivus fared only slightly better, selling $12.7m of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate) in the same period.</p><p><p>The real purpose of this latest disclosure from the LIGHT study probably has nothing to do with either drug safety or efficacy. Rather it will be used to sell more stock at Orexigen's now inflated share price. Like AtheroGenics, the share offering will likely precede either the FDA's sanctions, the SEC's Wells notice or Takeda using it as an excuse to exit the smaller and more difficult than once thought prescription obesity treatment market. Sounds like another sell to me.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
