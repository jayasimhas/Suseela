<p>GlaxoSmithKline is investing $95m to create an independent research institute in the US dedicated to studying how genes are controlled and how a cell's operating system functions. </p><p>The institute, which will be based in Seattle and called the Altius Insitute for Biomedical Sciences, will be led by Dr John Stamatoyannopoulos, a professor of genome sciences and medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine.</p><p>The institute is expected to be up and running very quickly. In fact, according to Dr Stamatoyannopoulos, it will "fully operational before the end of the year."</p><p>Altius will be wholly independent from GSK, with its own management, board of directors and external advisors. However, GSK has signed a 10-year collaboration agreement with Altius to provide long-term support. During the first five years, GSK will provide over $95m in cash and other resources to advance the Institute's basic research and technology efforts, which are also expected to attract funding from public and other sources. </p><p>Additional GSK funding will be available for specific projects identified by GSK. Hoping Altius will prove to be a catalyst of innovation, GSK has retained first rights to option the Institute's inventions, and to invest in commercialization of its discoveries via spinout companies. </p><p>"This is a bold move [by GSK], but the time is right," Dr Stamatoyannopoulos told <i>Scrip</i>. "The technologies are here and getting more and more powerful, and the potential payoffs for GSK are huge - it will be the first to reap the benefits of seeing how drugs affect the control wiring of the cell, and how the wealth of new regulatory and functional genomics data and technologies can be used to identify and develop better targets."</p><p>"This is not an incremental change," said Lon Cardon, senior vice president of Alternative Discovery and Development at GSK. "We are aiming for transformative outcomes that could improve our ability to bring innovative and more effective new medicines to patients."</p>
