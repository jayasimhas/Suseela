<p>Days after investors battered the company's stock following a surprise three-plant FDA warning letter, Dr Reddy's Laboratories' CEO, GV Prasad, has emphasised that a "revamp" of the firm's quality systems and processes is a top organizational priority.</p><p>"Clearly we are not happy with the fact that we could not resolve the Form 483 observations to the agency's satisfaction. We have always taken quality and compliance matters seriously and we will continue to remain focused on the remedial measures," Prasad said in an investor call on Nov. 9.</p><p>A Form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p>Prasad said that the warning letter cites GMP violations primarily relating to documentation practices and control, laboratory testing procedure, incident investigation practices and some standard operating procedures (SOPs).</p><p>"At this time we feel confident in the safety and efficacy of our products. However, we plan to do a comprehensive assessment of any risk to the quality of our products," he said.</p><p>Currently, there is no directive from the FDA to stop manufacturing activity and shipment from the tainted sites.</p><p>On Nov. 6 investors bludgeoned the Dr Reddy's stock after the firm reported that the FDA had issued a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Three-Plant-FDA-Warning-Spooks-Dr-Reddys-Clouds-ANDAs-361410" target="_new">warning letter</a> dated Nov. 5 at its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) facilities in Srikakulam and Miryalaguda, as well as an oncology formulation manufacturing site in Duvvada. The sites are reported to account for an estimated 10-12% of the firm's revenues. </p><p>Analysts then said the development could potentially put at risk a string of important US generic approvals, plunging the firm into a "difficult" situation, at least in the short term.</p><p>At the Nov. 9 call, Dr Reddy's CEO said that while the company is looking at all aspects in the remediation plan, its first priority is products on the US market &ndash; how to ensure that the FDA and others are "assured" of the quality of the firm's products. </p><p>Dr Reddy's sales in the US crossed the $1bn mark in the financial year ended March 2015. </p><p>Prasad also indicated that the firm will need to perform "additional detailed third party assessments" of its quality systems and evaluate its global manufacturing operations to ensure compliance with cGMP regulations.</p><p>"While this work is on we will in parallel attempt to de-risk supplies by transferring select products to alternate sites. We've already taken steps to implement such transfers&#8230;there is a dedicated team actively focused on this," the CEO said. </p><p>He, though, added that given the "amount of work" involved in such transfers and capacity constraints, the company will prioritize only select products for this process.</p><p>Dr Reddy's had earlier launched generic <i>Nexium</i> (esomeprazole magnesium delayed release capsules) in the US, after effecting a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Plan-B-takes-Dr-Reddys-Into-Hot-US-Nexium-Market-360726" target="_new">site transfer</a>, following compliance concerns at Srikakulam. </p><p>Analysts have also been concerned about a potential delay in launch plans for generic <i>Gleevec</i> (imatinib mesylate), among others, in the wake of the FDA action.</p><p>The Dr Reddy's top brass, though, only clarified that the API for its Gleevec generic is from an "external source" but did not comment on the certainty of a potential launch.</p>
