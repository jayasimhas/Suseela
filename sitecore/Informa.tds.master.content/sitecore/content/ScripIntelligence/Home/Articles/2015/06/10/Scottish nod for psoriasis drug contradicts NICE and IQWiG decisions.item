<p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has published advice accepting four new medicines for use in NHS Scotland. One of these medicines has been given a thumbs down from NICE &ndash; the HTA body for England and Wales &ndash; in preliminary guidance.</p><p>Two of the medicines given the green light in Scotland are for the treatment of psoriasis and one of them has also been accepted for psoriatic arthritis. The remaining acceptance covers treatments for hepatitis C.</p><p>Celgene's apremilast (Otezla) will be available in Scotland for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. A patient group submission supported the apremilast submission. Scotland has been <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/How-patients-are-helping-Scotland-say-yes-to-more-medicines-358741" target="_new">leading the way</a> in greater patient involvement in the reimbursement decision-making process.</p><p>The SMC noted that, as an oral tablet, apremilast is more convenient for patients than many other treatments used at this stage of therapy and may also mean fewer appointments at outpatient clinics. The SMC also accepted apremilast for treating a related condition, psoriatic arthritis. </p><p>NICE, the HTA body for England and Wales, did not recommend apremilast in preliminary guidance citing a short follow-up period for one of the trials, high withdrawal rates and a low percentage of patient eligibility for the drug. The appraisal committee will meet again on 1 July to consider comments from consultees and other evidence. Germany's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Celgenes-psoriasis-drug-Otezla-gets-thumbs-down-from-IQWiG-358491" target="_new">IQWiG said</a> apremilast offered "no additional benefit" over currently available treatments.</p><p>The second medicine accepted by the SMC this month was Novartis's first-in-class IL17A inhibitor secukinumab (Cosentyx). It is also indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. NICE has issued <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Novartiss-step-change-Cosentyx-likely-to-compete-well-after-NICE-nod-358662" target="_new">final draft guidance</a> also recommending the drug, but a final positive decision hinges on a confidential patient access scheme that offers the drug at a discount to the NHS.</p><p>Also accepted for use in Scotland were AbbVie's ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Viekirax) and dasabuvir (Exviera), two medicines which can be used to treat certain types of chronic hepatitis C. NICE will be issuing its initial guidance on the products in September. However, NHS England issued a new clinical commissioning policy statement this week recommending the products in the interim.</p>
