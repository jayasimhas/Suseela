<p>Novo Nordisk has reported positive results from the first of six Phase III studies of its once-weekly, modified formulation of market leading diabetes therapy Victoza (liraglutide). </p><p>In the Phase IIIa SUSTAIN1 trial semaglutide &ndash; a long acting GLP-1 analogue with a structure based on liraglutide &ndash; met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.1%, people treated with doses of 0.5mg and 1.0mg of the drug achieved superior improvements in HbA1c of 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively, compared with no change in HbA1c in the placebo group.</p><p>Overall, 74% and 73% of the people treated with 0.5mg and 1.0mg semaglutide, respectively, achieved the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) treatment target of HbA1c below 7% compared with 25% of the people treated with placebo.</p><p>Furthermore, from a mean baseline of 92kg, people treated with semaglutide in both doses experienced a superior weight loss of 3.8kg and 4.6kg, respectively, compared with a weight loss of 1.0kg for people treated with placebo.</p><p>SUSTAIN1 is a 30-week efficacy and safety trial of semaglutide versus placebo in 388 drug-na&iuml;ve people with type 2 diabetes. Novo Nordisk expects to announce headline results of the five remaining SUSTAIN trials within the next nine months. </p><p>If approved Novo's once-weekly type 2 diabetes offering will directly compete against Lilly's once-weekly therapy Trulicity (dulaglutide), which is already available in the US and Europe. However, Novo's product is not expected to reach the market until <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Lillys-dulaglutide-arrives-in-Europe-Novo-Nordisk-quakes-355262" target="_new">2017</a>.</p>
