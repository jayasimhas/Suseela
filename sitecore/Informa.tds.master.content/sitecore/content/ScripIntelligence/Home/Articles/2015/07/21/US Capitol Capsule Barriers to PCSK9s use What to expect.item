<p>While Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said the FDA granted what the companies perceived as a "pretty broad label" for Praluent (alirocumab) &ndash; the first proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor approved in the US to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when statins are not enough &ndash; the firms said they anticipated some barriers to the drug's use in the US.</p><p>And what goes for Praluent also could be true for Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab), which is expected to also gain US approval by 27 August, and Pfizer's Phase III-stage product bococizumab.</p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron estimated that 8-10 million adult Americans are likely eligible to receive Praluent under the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">24 July approval</a>.</p><p>But, said Robert Terifay, senior vice president of commercial at Regeneron, not all those patients are expected to be candidates for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy "for a variety of reasons," which likely will <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Praluent-Repatha-FDA-guinea-pigs-to-market-trailblazers-359580" target="_new">reduce the size</a> of the actual market for the medicine and others in the class coming after it, including Repatha and bococizumab.</p><p>For instance, Mr Terifay said during a 24 July conference call with investors and analysts, some physicians are likely to be resistant to using biologic therapy for LDL-C reduction.</p><p>Doctors also may be reluctant to take on the responsibility of providing the documentation insurers demand for "prior authorization" before paying for PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent, he said. In addition, Mr Terifay added, some patients are likely to be unwilling to inject themselves with the drug, which comes as a prefilled pen or as a prefilled syringe, intended to be self-administered.</p><p>And, he said, the lack of urgency by some physicians and patients to get LDL-C under control is likely to contribute to Praluent and other PCSK9 inhibitors not being used.</p><p>Mr Terifay also said the companies' anticipated that their educational and promotional efforts on appropriate statin use and adherence would result in more patients getting to their LDL-C goal with use of those drugs.</p><p>Therefore, he said, "there could be fewer patients who need additive lipid-lowering therapies beyond statins," which could potentially limit the patient population eligible for PCSK9 inhibitors.</p><p><b>Cost hurdle</b></p><p>Analysts said cost also could be a big factor in who gets Praluent &ndash; with the firms setting a higher-than-expected wholesale acquisition cost at $40 per day, or $1,120 every 28 days, or about $14,600 per year, for both the 75mg and 150mg doses.</p><p>"We expect the reimbursement environment for Praluent to be complex and carefully managed," Mr Terifay said.</p><p>He said the companies are working to ensure payers and healthcare providers understand the value the PCSK9 inhibitors can offer to patients.</p><p>"We are working with the various stakeholders involved in providing Praluent to appropriate patients," he said.</p><p>But Mr Terifay acknowledged "it will likely take several months for some commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin processing patient claims." </p><p>Therefore, he said, "we expect an initial gradual uptick at launch."</p><p>Victoria Carey, vice president and head of commercial for Praluent at Sanofi, said the companies could not comment on whether they would wait for Amgen's approval before going through the formulary reviews.</p><p>But, she said, the formulary reviews are "really up to each different customer to determine, and we are in constant conversations with them."</p><p>"We spent a lot of time meeting with the senior executives from the various payers &ndash; all the major ones &ndash; and I think we have much more in common than we had apart," said Dr Leonard Schleifer, president and CEO of Regeneron. </p><p>He said he hopes the process with pharmacy benefit managers will be more of a partnership than a war, like it's been with other products.</p><p>Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said he anticipated Praluent's higher-than-assumed price would drive payer restrictions, including requirements for patients to try high-dose statins, like Pfizer's Lipitor (atorvastatin) or AstraZeneca's Crestor (rosuvastatin) in combination with Merck's Zetia (ezetimibe) before adding a PCSK9 inhibitor. </p><p>Mr Terifay said the companies would not comment on the magnitude of any rebates. </p><p>But, he said, "I do think that payers will be more comfortable with a label that really focuses on the very high-risk patients."</p><p><b>Interpreting the label</b></p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron had sought a much <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9s-are-coming-But-who-will-get-them-359579" target="_new">broader label</a> for Praluent than what the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">granted on 24 July</a> &ndash; one of the most watched decisions by the agency this year.</p><p>In their application, the companies asked for the FDA's blessing to market Praluent as a long-term treatment for adults with primary hypercholesterolemia &ndash; non-familial and heterozygous familial (HeFH) &ndash; or mixed dyslipidemia, including patients with type 2 diabetes, to reduce LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, and lipoprotein and to increase HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1.</p><p>But the FDA trimmed that indication back, approving the drug instead as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with HeFH &ndash; a genetic condition that causes unusually high levels of LDL-C, often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of LDL-C.</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr Schleifer assured investors and analysts that about 90% of the patients in the companies' placebo-controlled Phase III ODYSSEY program, on which the FDA's approval was based, had either HeFH or ASCVD.</p><p>"So the label matches fairly well," Dr Schleifer declared, calling what the firms won a "pretty broad label."</p><p>Dr Jay Edelberg, head of PCSK9 development at Sanofi, noted the ASCVD definition is based on the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, which defined the condition as acute coronary syndromes or a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack or peripheral artery disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origins.</p><p>While the positive opinion the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use granted to Praluent, which also came on 24 July, specifically called out patients unable to take statins in the indication, the FDA-approved labeling for the drug "only states that patients should be on the maximal tolerated dose of a statin and it's up to a physician to determine what is the maximal tolerated dose of the statin in the US," said Dr Ned Braunstein, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Regeneron.</p><p>So, Dr Schleifer said, "the statin-intolerants are sprinkled in."</p><p>"The maximally tolerated dose of statins is what we've all aimed for in medical practice," said Sanofi's Dr Edelberg said. "I think that physicians are very much going to be used to this and that the systems will be able to work with them based on different definitions for this. But I think that this is part of clinical practice today and will just simply be more institutionalized."</p><p>"Doctors are going to have to sort this out," Dr Schleifer added.</p><p>"Ultimately, we believe that the label is left to a substantial amount of interpretation by physicians but that it still sets up a fairly large total addressable market for the PCSK9 inhibitors," said JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov.</p><p><b>Ready to launch</b></p><p>The companies are wasting no time in promoting Praluent &ndash; starting that process 27 July, with trade product available by 29 July. </p><p>"We believe that with the availability of Praluent for use in appropriate patients, Regeneron and Sanofi will be bringing significant value to the healthcare system," Mr Terifay said.</p><p>He said when patients were treated with and took maximally tolerated statins and were not at goal, Praluent lowered LDL-C by an incremental 43% to up to 58%, "enabling most of the patients to reach their goals."</p><p>Sanofi CEO Dr Olivier Brandicourt noted Praluent is the fifth drug launch in the past year for his firm, while Regeneron's Dr Schleifer said the new medicine is the fourth FDA approval his firm has received since the company was established in 1988.</p><p><b>CVOTs, label expansion</b></p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron are now awaiting the results of their 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT), known as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, which will determine whether Praluent actually prevents cardiovascular events like heart attacks, strokes and CV-related death.</p><p>The study is expected to report results in late 2017 &ndash; about the same time Amgen anticipates data from its 27,500-patient CVOT for Repatha, known as FOURIER.</p><p>"Once we do have outcomes data, we can and will try and broaden the label to include more patients who might benefit," Dr Schleifer said.</p><p>He said he was "not a big subscriber to forecasting," noting that predictions were way off about how well the firm's ophthalmology drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Regenerons-Eylea-wins-US-OK-bests-Lucentis-in-pricing-dosing-323867" target="_new">Eylea</a> (aflibercept) would sell in the first year &ndash; with many anticipating $80m "when it sold for $800m."</p><p>"Things can go in either direction," Dr Schleifer said. "We've got plenty to do to keep us busy without worrying about actually trying to predict exactly how many patients are out there. We know there are plenty and we're going to go try and get to the doctors and explain the product."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">Sanofi/Regeneron win 1st US PCSK9 OK with Praluent</a></p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on 24 July pulled off the first US approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor &ndash; gaining the FDA's nod for Praluent (alirocumab).</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Praluent-Repatha-FDA-guinea-pigs-to-market-trailblazers-359580" target="_new">Praluent, Repatha: FDA guinea pigs to market trailblazers</a></p><p>Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Praluent (alirocumab) and Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) are expected to be trailblazers in the marketplace for what's coming behind them &ndash; notably Pfizer's bococizumab, which is catching up fast to the two leaders.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9s-are-coming-But-who-will-get-them-359579" target="_new">PCSK9s are coming: But who will get them?</a></p><p>FDA watchers would have been shocked had US regulators not approved the first application for a PCSK9 inhibitor &ndash; Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Praluent (alirocumab) &ndash; but the verdict is still out for Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab).</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">Court rules biosimilar 'patent dance' optional, but delays Zarxio</a></p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on 21 July ruled that Sandoz must wait 180 days from the FDA's approval of Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz) before the company can sell the biosimilar in the US &ndash; meaning, the drug can't enter the American market until 2 September.
