<p>With the unexpected popularity of the inter partes reviews (IPRs), the US Supreme Court must move swiftly to determine whether the US Patent & Trademark Office (US PTO) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is using the correct standard for the proceedings, the first company to bring such a case to the high court said in a petition filed this week.</p><p>Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC is contending that the PTAB should not have applied the so-called broadest reasonable interpretation standard in claim construction in its IPR, in which the board invalided one of the firm's patents for obviousness. </p><p>If the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Supreme-Courts-New-Term-What-Biopharma-Should-Expect-360809" target="_new">Supreme Court takes up the case</a> and decides the PTAB has been using the wrong standard, it potentially could call into question the results of a number of IPRs, said Washington lawyer William Jay, a partner at Goodwin Procter and a co-chair of the firm's appellate litigation practice.</p><p>IPRs are trial proceedings that were created under the <i>American Invents Act of 2011</i> to be a faster and more affordable alternative to litigation for challenging patents. </p><p>While biopharmaceutical firms initially were slow to pursue IPRs, there's been a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Patent-Challenge-Landscape-Shifting-Inter-Partes-Reviews-Climb-360075" target="_new">significant uptick</a> in the past year in the number of petitions filed involving drug makers' patents, which has more than doubled from 4% the previous two years to 9%.</p><p>Petitioners may challenge patent claims only on novelty or obviousness grounds and only on the basis of prior art consisting of patents or printed publications.</p><p>The petition must identify with particularity the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim.</p><p>The patentee then has the right to file a preliminary response to the petition that sets forth reasons why no IPR should be instituted.</p><p>Within three months after the patentee's preliminary response is due, the US PTO must decide whether to grant the petition and institute an IPR trial &ndash; a decision that is final and non-appealable.</p><p>Patent challengers have filed close to 4,000 IPR petitions, with nearly 85% of the proceedings resulting in the cancellation of some or all claims in the patent under review.</p><p>The Cuozzo case stems from one of those decisions involving the firm's '074 patent, which covers certain components used in global positioning systems. </p><p>Garmin International Inc. and its subsidiary Garmin USA Inc. filed an IPR petition challenging claims 10, 14 and 17 of the Cuozzo '074 patent.</p><p>The PTAB determined the claims were "obvious" and invalidated them. The board also denied Cuozzo's motion to amend the '074 patent by substituting new claims.</p><p>On appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a three-judge panel held that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the decision to institute the IPR and affirmed the PTAB's final determination &ndash; finding no error in the board's claim construction under the broadest reasonable interpretation standard, its obviousness determination and its denial of Cuozzo's motion to amend.</p><p>Cuozzo filed a petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i> by the full Federal Circuit, which was supported by numerous <i>amici</i>, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Eli Lilly & Co., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Sanofi SA. </p><p>But the Federal Circuit in July declined to rehear the case. </p><p>Cuozzo wants the Supreme Court to decide whether the Federal Circuit erred in holding that, in IPR proceedings, the PTAB may construe claims in an issued patent according to the broadest reasonable interpretation rather than their plain and ordinary meaning.</p><p>The company also has asked the justices to rule on whether the Federal Circuit erred in holding that, even if the PTAB exceeds its statutory authority in instituting an IPR proceeding, the board's decision whether to hold a trial is "judicially unreviewable."</p><p>"You can go to the Federal Circuit, but only to decide whether the board's decision is a correct application of obviousness or anticipation in the grounds the board relies on," Goodwin Procter's Jay told <i>Scrip</i>. "The decision to cancel a patent is reviewable, but the decision to have an IPR proceeding at all is not reviewable" under the Federal Circuit's reading of the statute.</p><p>He said the broadest reasonable interpretation question has the potential to change the outcome of a number of the obviousness and the anticipation decisions that the board has issued.</p><p>"The construction of the claims really can matter for the outcome of an IPR," Jay said.</p><p>While patentees may say their patents are valid because they are only claiming "X" and "Y," under the broadest reasonable interpretation, the PTAB could declare the patent also claims "A," "B" and "C," which runs into the prior art, so therefore, the patent is deemed invalid, he explained.</p><p>One issue the Supreme Court is going to have to sort through in considering the broadest reasonable interpretation question is finding an appropriate vehicle, Jay said. </p><p>"Sometimes the Supreme Court thinks a case is a poor vehicle even when some [Federal Circuit] judges are willing to vote it <i>en banc</i>," he said.</p><p>But Cuozzo argued in its petition to the Supreme Court that its case is an "excellent vehicle that would allow the court to resolve both the scope of the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction and the claim construction standard that applies in IPR proceedings."</p><p>Cuozzo contended that even if the court were inclined to stay its hand on the reviewability question, it nevertheless should grant the claim construction question, which the company argued is entirely separate and independently merits review.</p><p>"Given the clear importance of the issue, this court's review will be needed at some point, and there is no reason to await a further headcount of the court of appeals," Cuozzo said.</p><p>"The petition pushes very hard on the idea that there needs to be a definitive answer to this question, meaning whether the broadest reasonable interpretation standard should continue to govern because the volume of IPRs is significant and the longer everyone has to wait for a definitive answer, the more risk that more cases will be upset if the Supreme Court ultimately takes the issue and reverses," Jay said. "So that's why even though this is the first case in which the Federal Circuit has really spoken to this issue, the petitioner is arguing the Supreme Court needs to grab this issue and decide it authoritatively now because there will be more disruption if you ultimately decide there is a problem and you take it up and reverse."</p><p>He noted, however, the Supreme Court doesn't usually take an issue the first time it is decided by an appellate court, although Jay said it's possible it could take up this case.</p><p>The respondent in the case is actually US PTO Director Michelle Lee, who intervened at the court of appeals to defend the decision of the PTAB after Garmin reached a settlement with Cuozzo and withdrew from the case. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
