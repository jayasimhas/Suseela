<p>Bayer AG's pharmaceutical division delivered strong sales in the third quarter, though blood thinner <i>Xarelto</i> (rivaroxaban) missed expectations. </p><p>In 3Q, group sales for Bayer were 2% below consensus coming in at &euro;11bn. However, pharma sales met expectations reaching &euro;3.4bn for the quarter, and EBITDA for the division of &euro;1.1bn beat estimates by 4%. </p><p>Bayer put the pharma unit's success down to five of its newer products: Xarelto, <i>Eylea</i> (aflibercept), <i>Stivarga</i> (regorafenib), <i>Xofigo</i> (radium-223) and <i>Adempas</i> (riociguat). Of these products ophthalmology drug Eylea performed the best in the third quarter with sales of &euro;320m (beating consensus estimates by 6%). </p><p>Xarelto saw a miss of 6%, coming in at &euro;571m. However, Bayer's chair and CEO Dr. Marijn Dekkers said in an Oct. 29 earnings call, that people "should not look too closely at just one quarter". Sales for Xarelto are up 31% compared to the same period in 2014. </p><p>Bayer said these five products would continue to see strong growth in 2016 and that it was still expecting combined 2015 full sales for the drugs to reach &euro;4bn. "We do not believe maximum sales potential has been reached yet for these products," Dekkers added. </p><p>Predicting headwinds for 2016, the CEO said, "Everyone has older products that no longer have patent protection and we will continue to see some products eroding over time." He noted though, that while it is "hard to undo erosion, we try to see it happen as slowly as possible."</p><p>In 3Q Bayer's CropScience division performed better than some analysts predicted with sales of &euro;2.bn but Consumer Health fell short &ndash; delivering sales 6% below consensus at &euro;2.2bn. However, Bayer is still in the process of transitioning many over-the-counter products it acquired via its buy of Merck & Co.'s consumer business earlier this year. Analysts at Berenberg Bank said: "The Consumer Health miss may be a phasing issue as full-year guidance is unchanged."</p><p>Net profit for the quarter was &euro;999m, compared with &euro;826m during the corresponding period last year, which was above expectations. However, Bayer has still lowered its full year expectations slightly: it now expects sales for the year in the region of &euro;46bn, down from a previously estimated &euro;47bn.</p><h2>Xarelto Class Action Suits</h2><p>Talking about anticoagulant drug Xarelto, Bayer's chief noted that while the third quarter was not as strong, the last nine months of 2015 have seen steady growth for the drug. "There is a global market share of 36% for this product; we are doing extremely well with Xarelto." He added, "Of course there are competitors, but we by far have the biggest product with the greatest market share."</p><p>Xarelto is currently the subject of a number of class action lawsuits in the US, with complainants alleging negligence over side effects of the drug. In Bayer's 3Q earnings call, chief financial officer Johannes Dietsch noted that the number of cases in these class actions is decreasing. He said, "We don't expect the first cases to reach the courts until 2017, so at this point we are not discussing any settlement options."</p>
