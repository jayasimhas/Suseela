<p>The European Commission has granted marketing authorization to Otsuka Pharmaceutical for Jinarc (tolvaptan) for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults who have chronic kidney disease (CKD). The US FDA rejected an NDA for the product in this indication in 2013, citing the need for additional data.</p><p>Tolvaptan becomes the first pharmaceutical therapy to be licensed in Europe for the treatment of the underlying pathophysiology of ADPKD. Jinarc is a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that has been proven to slow cyst growth and renal function decline in patients with ADPKD in CKD stage one to three with evidence of rapidly progressive disease. The marketing approval is based on data from the Phase III TEMPO 3:4 trial. </p><p>Tolvaptan was first approved for patients with ADPKD in Japan in March 2014 and in Canada in February 2015. There are believed to be around 200,000 suitable patients in Europe. In the US, tolvaptan is approved under the brand name Samsca for the treatment of hyponatremia, but in 2013 the US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/REJECTED-FDA-demands-more-data-for-Otsuka-kidney-drug-tolvaptan-346153" target="_new">rejected Otsuka's application</a> to extend its use to the treatment of ADPKD. </p><p>The EMA's CHMP issued a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Otsukas-Jinarc-gets-CHMP-nod-for-ADPKD-356993" target="_new">positive opinion</a> in February for the use of tolvaptan to treat ADPKD.</p>
