<p>Japan has approved a batch of new drugs including Gilead's Sovaldi as part of the first all-oral therapy for HCV genotype 2 in the country, Eisai's Lenvima for thyroid cancer, and the world's first once-weekly DPP-4 inhibitor from Takeda.</p><p>The products granted formal approval by the ministry of health, labour and welfare on 26 March included Gilead Sciences's highly effective but costly hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy Sovaldi (sofosbuvir). </p><p>The once-daily nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor &ndash; which will be Gilead's first self-marketed product in Japan &ndash; is indicated for the suppression of viremia in genotype 2 patients with chronic disease with or without compensated cirrhosis.</p><p>It is used in combination with Chugai's ribavirin product Copegus, which was also approved for use in the new regimen for 12 weeks as the first all-oral, interferon-free type 2 HCV regimen in Japan.</p><p>More than a million people are estimated to be chronically infected with HCV in the country, of whom 20-30% are genotype 2 and currently require 24-48 weeks of injected therapy. The Phase III Japanese trial used to support the approval showed 96% of patients had a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after completing therapy.</p><p>Sofosbuvir is also awaiting approval in Japan as a single tablet combination with ledipasvir for genotype 1 HCV.</p><p>Eisai Co. Ltd.'s oral multi-kinase inhibitor Lenvima (lenvatinib) was approved for the orphan indication of unresectable thyroid cancer including differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma (1-2% of cases) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.</p><p>The Japanese firm said that there are 13,000-29,000 thyroid cancer patients in Japan, with no well-established therapy. Lenvima, given once daily, was approved for refractive differentiated thyroid cancer in the US in February and is awaiting approval in the EU and several other markets in this initial setting.</p><p>Other trials are underway in hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>Also in oncology, the ministry cleared Eli Lilly's VEGFR2-blocking antibody Cyramza (ramucirumab) as a single-agent therapy for advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, used in combination with paclitaxel. </p><p>There were around 123,000 gastric cancer patients in Japan in 2008, and some 49,000 deaths from the disease in 2012, according to official data cited by Lilly, making it one of the main malignancies in the country.</p><p>The approval was supported by various international trials including the RAINBOW program, which showed overall survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab group versus placebo plus paclitaxel (a median of 9.6 months compared with 7.4 months).</p><h2>First Monthly DPP-4 Inhibitor</h2><p>Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. described the approval of Zafatek (trelagliptin), the world's first once weekly (as opposed to once daily) DPP-4 inhibitor for type 2 diabetes, as "a very important milestone." </p><p>Some analysts are more guarded however, with Datamonitor Healthcare seeing limited potential for the product given that other commonly co-administered drugs must still be taken once a day, and intense competition from SGLT2 inhibitors as well as cheaper DPP-4 inhibitors. </p><p>Datamonitor sees Japanese annual sales peaking at around $366 million and possible competition from Merck & Co. Inc.'s omarigliptin from 2019. Takeda does not list the drug as being in development in any markets outside Japan.</p><p>Other approvals included Celgene's Pomalyst (pomalidomide) for the orphan indication of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which in common with several of the other approved products received a positive recommendation several weeks ago.</p><table><h2>Products approved in Japan on 26 March</h2><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Abilify (aripiprazole)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Otsuka Pharmaceutical</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>extended release intramuscular injection for schizophrenia</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cerdelga (eliglustat)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Genzyme</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of adults with Gaucher disease type 1 (orphan)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Duac Gel (clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GlaxoSmithKline</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>acne vulgaris</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Eklira Genuair (aclidinium bromide)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Kyorin Pharmaceutical(licensed from Almirall) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>long-acting muscarinic antagonist for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>sublingual dust mite allergen</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Shionogi (licensed from Stallergenes)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>allergic rhinitis</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>NovoThirteen (catridecacog)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Novo Nordisk</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>prevention of bleeding in patients with congenital Factor XIII A-subunit deficiency (orphan)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Oldoreb (colistin sodium methanesulfonate)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Onetram (once-daily tramadol)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Nippon Shinyaku</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>new formulation for cancer pain and chronic pain</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Opsumit (macitentan)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Actelion Pharmaceuticals(co-promotion with Nippon Shinyaku) </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>oral endothelin antagonist for pulmonary arterial hypertension</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>influenza HA prototype vaccine (cell cultured)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Kaketsuken (Chemo-Sero Therapeutic Research Inst.)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>pandemic flu (orphan)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Synflorix</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Japan Vaccine (50:50 joint venture between Daiichi Sankyo and GSK)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>prevention of pneumococcal infection</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>All the new drugs still require reimbursement price listing before they can be included in Japan's national health insurance scheme, which allows launch, and all eyes will be on how the pricing of Sovaldi compares with elsewhere, given its regimen cost of close to $100,000 per course in the US.</p><p>Gilead entered into an agreement with several Indian companies for lower cost supplies of sofosbuvir in developing countries last year.</p><p>This article first appeared in PharmAsia News. </p>
