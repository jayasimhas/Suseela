<p>Before lawmakers got into the serious business of considering nearly 30 amendments to the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> (HR 6) on 8 July, there was a lot of camaraderie and even some brotherly love being shared &ndash; a "bromance" that nearly brought the House Rules Committee chairman, Representative Pete Sessions (Republican-Texas), to tears in expressing his fondness for the bill's lead author, Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan).</p><p>Even those members of the committee that had some hesitation about the legislation, which is expected to be voted on by the full House on 10 July, were exceedingly cordial in expressing their reluctance about fully backing the bill, particularly concerning the proposed added funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA.</p><p>Indeed, while it may have been a self-described "lovefest" during the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">21 May</a>House Energy and Commerce markup of the bill &ndash; where it got a unanimous vote to advance the legislation, which is intended to overhaul the US biomedical enterprise, with the aim of accelerating the discovery, development and approval processes &ndash; it was a downright love affair at the Rules Committee. </p><p>Even the White House has embraced certain parts of the bill &ndash; praising lawmakers for including support for President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> and biomedical research.</p><p>But the White House was not completely satisfied with the legislation &ndash; declaring the administration was especially concerned with the amount of new responsibilities lawmakers want to impose on the FDA, which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said would exceed the resources provided in HR 6 for the drug and device agency &ndash; leaving regulators unable to fully implement the programs established by the Cures bill.</p><p>The White House even said the amount of funding the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">president requested</a> in his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal &ndash; which House <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-closer-to-gaining-added-funding-is-it-enough-359314" target="_new">appropriators rejected</a> on 8 July, calling for instead $116m less &ndash; would not be enough to cover the added chores lawmakers would task the FDA with under HR 6.</p><p>Lawmakers have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">proposed</a> providing the FDA $110m each year over five years under Cures &ndash; or $550m.</p><p>But the FDA told <i>Scrip</i> the agency would need closer to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">$1bn to cover its costs</a> of implementing the provisions in Cures.</p><p>The White House also raised some concerns about using oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a source for funding HR 6. </p><p>"The administration reiterates the critical importance of making the investments necessary to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and ensure it continues to support US energy security," OMB said.</p><p>The bill initially called for the Department of Energy to sell 8 million barrels of crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve for each year over eight years &ndash; from 2018 through 2025 &ndash; which was estimated to bring in $5.2bn.</p><p>But Representative Upton made a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">last-minute change last week</a> to the bill &ndash; calling now for 80 million barrels to be sold over the same eight years, which had some Democrats at the Rules Committee session concerned.</p><p>Some Democrats also expressed their displeasure the $10bn Innovation Fund initially promised to the NIH was being trimmed down to $8.75bn under last week's surprise revisions.</p><p>The White House also said it disagreed with the provision in the bill that would extend by six months the exclusivity of approved drugs that win an added indication for a rare disease &ndash; a measure Representative Paul Gosar (Republican-Arizona) called a "really big giveaway" to the biopharmaceutical industry.</p><p>The Arizona lawmaker introduced an amendment at the Rules panel meeting to try to kill the exclusivity provision, but his measure failed to make it out of the committee.</p><p>Of the 29 amendments that were proposed, eight were permitted to go forward for debate, including a measure by Representative Dave Brat (Republican-Virginia) that is seeking to make the $8.75bn for NIH and $550m for the FDA discretionary budgeted dollars rather than mandatory under Cures &ndash; an idea for which the Biotechnology Industry Organization said on 8 July it disagreed.</p><p>The Cures bill has garnered the support from the House Republican leadership and is expected to be adopted, although it's unclear how many members may end up supporting the move from mandatory spending to discretionary for the NIH and FDA.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
