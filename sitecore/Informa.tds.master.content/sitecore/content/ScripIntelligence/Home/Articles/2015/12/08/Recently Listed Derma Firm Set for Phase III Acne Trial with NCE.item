<p>Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA spin-off Cassiopea SpA, the Swiss-listed, dermatology-focused company that raised CHF175.6m ($180m) in an initial public offering (IPO) in early July this year, is set to begin Phase III trials with its lead product candidate, a first-in-class acne treatment, in October. Some analysts have forecast $350m in peak US sales for <i>Winlevi</i>. </p><p>"Our physician channel checks suggest possible rapid and widespread adoption, mostly as an integral part of the combination regimens typically prescribed to treat this multi-faceted disease," say Jefferies analysts.</p><p>Earlier this month the US FDA agreed to the Phase III clinical protocol in a special protocol assessment for the anti-androgen treatment. The agreed primary endpoints to be assessed for each treatment group at Week 12 are: Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) success defined as scoring 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear) plus at least 2-grade improvement from baseline; absolute change from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts (NILC); and absolute change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (ILC).</p><p>Assuming an October start, data are expected in 2017. Valeant Pharmaceuticals has a right of first refusal to Winlevi (previously called CB-03-01) should Cosmo decide to license out the drug after completing its development. This amendment to an existing agreement was struck when Valeant decided not to pick up its option to Winlevi following the release of Phase II data in 2014.</p><p>In a 360-patient Phase IIb study, Winlevi met both its co-primary endpoints, inducing a two point reduction in the IGA endpoint and a reduction in total lesion count compared to placebo.</p><p>Cassiopea has a pipeline of four clinical assets, Winlevi and CB-06-01 for acne, Breezula for androgenic alopecia (AGA), and CB-06-02 for anogenital warts.</p><p>Cassiopea's second clinical candidate, Breezula for the treatment of AGA, is currently in Phase II. It consists of a different formulation and dosage strength of the same NCE as in Winlevi. In a recent Phase I/II proof of concept study, Breezula increased hair shaft diameter and had a positive impact on scalp hair follicle density. The ongoing 90-patient, three-arm placebo and standard-of-care controlled Phase II study is 90% enrolled with data expected by the end of 2015.</p><p>"The two currently approved drugs for androgenic alopecia both have modest long-term effect, suggesting a substantial opportunity for Breezula," note the Jefferies analysts. They estimate peak US sales of $205m.</p><p>CB-06-01, for acne, is currently in Phase II with clinical results expected in the first half of 2016. "We anticipate that this NCE will be very complementary to Winlevi should both reach market," said the company. "The drug has shown very potent and selective activity in bacterial strains responsible for acne that are resistant to some other antibiotics."</p><p>Cassiopea's fourth clinical compound, CB-06-02 for the treatment of genital warts, is currently in Phase II with data expected in first half of 2016. It is a tellurium-based topical product which has shown potent anti-viral activity on cutaneous viral warts. </p><p>Cassiopea was initially funded by $50m from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, which then reduced its 97% stake to around 45% in the July IPO. Much of the offering was reserved for existing Cosmo shareholders such as dievini Hopp GmbH & Co KG and Heinrich Herz AG/Logistable Group, and members of Cosmo's management team.</p><p>Cassiopea intends to hire a US salesforce and commercial organization to launch its dermatology portfolio, while out-licensing rights to other geographies.</p><p>"The initial &euro;50m from parent Cosmo should be sufficient for spend until YE17E (around the end of 2017), in our view, by which time the Winlevi Phase III trials should be completed, in addition to Phase II studies for Breezula, CB-06-01, and CB-06-02 for anogenital warts. These data could enable ex-US partnership deals to crystallize value," concluded Jefferies.</p>
