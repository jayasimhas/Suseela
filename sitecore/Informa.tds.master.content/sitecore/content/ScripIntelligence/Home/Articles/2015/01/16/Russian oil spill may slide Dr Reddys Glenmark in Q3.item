<p>The devaluation of the rouble is expected to hurt the fiscal Q3 earnings of a clutch of leading Indian firms, with the negative effect potentially spilling over into the fourth quarter as well, some analysts say.</p><p>Plummeting crude prices had earlier fuelled a sell-off in the rouble, with the Russian currency falling to a record low against the dollar in December 2014 and declining by more than 40% last year &ndash; its worst performance since 1998 when Russia defaulted on local debt, agency reports said. Sanctions against Moscow amid the Ukraine crisis only added to these woes. </p><p>Oil prices recently breached a low of $45 a barrel briefly before clawing back, and efforts to buoy the rouble &ndash; Russia's central bank hiked interest rates and President Vladimir Putin underscored in his 2014 year-end news conference his faith that the Russian economy will rebound &ndash; appear to have had little effect on the currency, at least for now.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that the third-quarter results of companies such as Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Glenmark &ndash; firms that draw a significant part of their revenues from the Russian region &ndash; could be dented by the rouble's recent fall.</p><p>''You could see a hit at the EBITDA [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] level &ndash; whether partial or a full one, '' Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>One analyst with an Indian brokerage, who declined to be identified, added that some firms were, as a matter of abundant caution, only exporting to customers in Russia if sure of payments, while some smaller firms had put part of such exports on hold. </p><p>''I see this persisting for a couple of quarters,'' the analyst told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Glenmark confirmed that the devaluation of the Russian currency had impacted the performance of its rest of the world region, where Russia was the largest contributor. </p><p>''We are evaluating the market situation closely in Russia and other emerging markets where currencies have been volatile. We have received [a] few product approvals in Russia in the last six months which augurs well for the growth of the Russian business in the next financial year in local currency,'' Glenmark told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Dr Reddy's declined to comment citing the silent period ahead of results. Dr Reddy's CEO GV Prasad was, however, recently reported to have said that the impact of the rouble's decline would be quite significant. ''It will be a number in couple of 100 crore at least,'' Mr Prasad was quoted as saying. A hundred crore is equivalent to around $16.2m.</p><p>Mr Prasad, though, referred to some hedges, which would mitigate some part of the hit during the quarter.</p><p>Both companies have, however, reported rouble woes in the previous quarter as well. </p><p>While Glenmark Russia performed ''reasonably well'' in the local market, the company at the time of its second quarter results last year noted that the devaluation of the currency and the subdued business environment had an overall impact on the business. As per IMS year-to-date August 2014 data, Glenmark Russia grew by 21.4% in value versus overall market growth of 11.8%, the company then said. Glenmark Russia was ranked 50th as per IMS data for the 12 months to March 2014 and also launched Kerwort (imiquimod) and Sertamykol (sertaconazole) during the second quarter.</p><p>Dr Reddy's, on the other hand, reported an 11% decline in revenues from Russia at INR4.1bn in the second quarter, primarily on account of the rouble devaluation. In constant currency the growth was flat, the company then said. However, Dr Reddy's was the fourth fastest growing OTC company in the top 25 (volume wise) in Russia with a growth of 14% against a market growth of 1.4% as per IMS year-to-date August 2014 data.</p><h2>Venezuela</h2><p>Significantly, analysts are also keeping an eye on Venezuela, another lucrative market for some Indian firms. Jefferies said earlier this month that Venezuela, which depends on oil for more than 90% of its export revenues, risks insolvency.</p><p>''While profits may decline, the general business growth in the region for firms like Dr Reddy's may compensate for the value decline,'' Mr. Mehta added, referring to the Venezuelan market.</p><p>Venezuela has been one of the fastest growing rest of world geographies for Dr Reddy&rsquo;s with a growth of 53% in 2013-14 compared to the previous year. </p><p>Dr Reddy's top brass noted during the investor call at the time of the second-quarter results last year how Venezuela continued to deliver superior growth both on volumes and price realization. ''It's turning out to be a high potential market providing substantial upsides, whilst the possible currency devaluation is always a strong headwind,'' Dr Reddy's chief operating officer, Abhijit Mukherjee, said at the time <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Expense-hit-Dr-Reddys-set-for-first-NDA-filing-354767" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com, 31 October 2013)</a>. </p><p>In Q2, Glenmark's Venezuela subsidiary grew more than 300% and received three new product approvals. Venezuela accounts for around 10-15% of Glenmark's Latin American revenues, which was about INR2.3bn in the second quarter ended September 2014.</p>
