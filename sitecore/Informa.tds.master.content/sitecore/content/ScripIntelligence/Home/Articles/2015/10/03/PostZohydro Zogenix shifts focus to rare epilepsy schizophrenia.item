<p>With Zogenix&rsquo;s $100m sale of its extended-release hydrocodone drug Zohydro ER &ndash; a deal that has the potential to garner the firm $283.5m in development and sales milestones &ndash; the company is shifting from the pain market to focusing on a rare disease, Dravet syndrome, a form of epilepsy that causes severe seizures, which starts in the first year of life, often leading to cognitive and development impairment.</p><p>The company, which is selling its Zohydro business to Pernix Therapeutics, also can now put more of its attention on its subcutaneous formulation of risperidone, known as Relday, to treat of schizophrenia.</p><p>But Zogenix investors were unhappy with the deal &ndash; driving shares of the San Diego firm down as low as 30% on 11 March, before closing at $1.22, down 45 cents, or 27%.</p><p>Pernix's shares, however, leaped 11%, before closing at $11.62, up 1 cent.</p><p>Pernix's up-front $100m payment to Zogenix includes a minimum of $30m in cash and $20m in shares of common stock based on the closing price on 9 March.</p><p>The agreement also calls for Pernix to issue a 6 month $50m promissory note to Zogenix, which accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR + 3%. </p><p>Zohydro, the first pure form of hydrocodone to be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Zogenix-soars-on-FDA-Zohydro-OK-1st-single-entity-hydrocodone-347647" target="_new">approved</a> by the FDA, was cleared for the US market in October 2013 and launched a year ago.</p><p>But from the get-go, the drug brought trouble to Zogenix &ndash; with pushback from some on Capitol Hill, patient advocacy groups and others, including the now-former governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, who tried, but failed, to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Judge-Massachusetts-Zohydro-ban-unconstitutional-351332" target="_new">ban</a> the drug from his state. </p><p>About 30 other states voiced opposition about Zohydro, as did the FDA's own panel of outside expert advisers, who <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-zaps-Zogenix-Zohydro-Rough-road-ahead-for-other-ER-opioids-338014" target="_new">voted</a> 11-2, with one abstention, against permitting the single-entity hydrocodone to enter the US market before it had an abuse-deterrent mechanism.</p><p>Some groups and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Powerful-senator-seeks-Zohydro-ban-Zogenix-reinforces-its-defense-350357" target="_new">lawmakers</a> even called for the dismissal of FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg for allowing the controversial medicine to be approved &ndash; insisting she was helping to fuel the prescription opioid addiction problem in the US. </p><p>In late <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-new-Zohydro-formulation-abuse-deterrent-claims-pending-356480" target="_new">January</a>, Zogenix won approval from the FDA to market its new formulation of Zohydro, which uses an abuse-deterrent technology, known as BeadTek. But the agency did not permit the firm to make the claim in labeling that its drug deters abuse &ndash; something competitor Pursue Pharma is able to tout for its recently approved single-entity hydrocodone <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-clears-Purdues-harder-to-abuse-hydrocodone-Hysingla-355182" target="_new">Hysingla</a>. </p><p>Zogenix had planned to submit data in the second half of this year to the FDA to support an amended product label, including abuse-deterrent claims, consistent with the agency's current draft guidance, <i>Abuse-Deterrent Opioids &ndash; Evaluation and Labeling.</i></p><p>During a late-day 10 March conference call with investors and analysts, Zogenix CEO Roger Hawley said his firm would provide assistance to Pernix in the development and regulatory approval of future abuse-deterrent formulations of Zohydro ER, including amending the current labeling with abuse-deterrent claims, and seeking approval of a new tablet abuse-deterrent formulation of single-entity extended-release hydrocodone, known as for ZX008, which is in development with Altus Formulation.</p><p><b>New strategic focus</b></p><p>The past year, said Mr Hawley, is one "I'll never forget."</p><p>But now, he said, Zogenix has a "new strategic focus," which includes turning the California firm's attention to its investigational drug ZX008 for Dravet syndrome, for which there are few treatment options and nothing available to treat the disease long term.</p><p>Zogenix obtained ZX008, formerly known as Brabafen, a low-dose formulation of fenfluramine, through its acquisition of Brabant Pharma in October 2014. </p><p>"We believe ZX008 has the potential to be a significant new option based upon the existing long-term data from the ongoing open label European study, which has showed that 67% of patients were seizure-free and 87% had a greater than 90% reduction in seizure frequency during an average treatment period of more than 12 years," said Dr Stephen Farr, president and director at Zogenix. "To our knowledge, no available treatment options or those in development for Dravet syndrome have demonstrated this level of effectiveness."</p><p>Dr Farr said Zogenix has received "a great deal of interest" about ZX008 from pediatric neurologists, families of Dravet syndrome patients and advocacy groups.</p><p>"We view this as indicative of the true patient need and positive reputation built by Brabant Pharma and the European investigators prior to our acquisition of the product candidate," he told investors and analysts.</p><p>Zogenix is now preparing to launch in the third-quarter two separate multicenter, double-blind parallel group placebo-controlled studies of ZX008 as an adjunct therapy in Dravet syndrome in the US and Europe, Dr Farr said.</p><p>Each study is expected to enroll between 50 and 60 patients, he said.</p><p>Results of the studies are anticipated to be available around midyear in 2016, Dr Farr said.</p><p>He noted that ahead of the Phase III studies, the investigators from the ongoing open-label trial of ZX008 have submitted to present an update of their results in May at the European Pediatric Epilepsy Conference. </p><p>For now, the company's next steps include working on optimizing the synthetic production of fenfluramine, formulation development and finalizing the Phase III clinical trial design, Dr Farr said. </p><p>He said the firm has hosted a key opinion leader advisory board in the US and has a similar one scheduled for Europe next month.</p><p>"Overall, we have made excellent progress to date and remain on track with our timelines," Dr Farr declared. </p><p><b>Schizophrenia R&D</b></p><p>Zogenix recently initiated enrollment in a 20-week multidose clinical pharmacokinetic and safety trial testing 60mg, 90mg and 120mg doses of Relday in treating schizophrenia. The study also will include an active control group receiving Risperdal Consta. </p><p>The firm expects to report top-line data from the study in the third-quarter, Dr Farr said.</p><p>"These clinical data will allow us to progress into an end of Phase II meeting with the FDA and will also be the catalyst for potential partnering opportunities," he said.</p><p>Dr Farr noted the US market for long-acting injectable treatments for schizophrenia has been estimated to reach $3bn by 2020. </p><p>"It's an attractive commercial opportunity when you consider the concentrated number of psychiatrists prescribing these products and the unique profile of Relday amongst other long-acting injectable therapies for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia," he said.</p><p>Relday, a subcutaneous injection, which is intended to be administered once monthly, is "unique" in being able to achieve therapeutic levels on the first day after the very first injection, Dr Farr said. </p><p>"Our previous studies have demonstrated Relday achieved dose dependent therapeutic plasma levels of drug within eight hours of initial dosing and therefore removes the requirement for supplementation of oral drugs or complicated dosing regimens typically associated with long-acting injections of antipsychotic drugs," Dr Farr explained.</p><p>He said subcutaneous injection has the potential advantages of better tolerability and safety, versus intramuscular injections.</p><p>Dr Farr said Relday and ZX008 &ldquo;represent exciting opportunities&rdquo; for Zogenix. </p><p>&ldquo;We look forward to advancing these programs over the course of the year," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
