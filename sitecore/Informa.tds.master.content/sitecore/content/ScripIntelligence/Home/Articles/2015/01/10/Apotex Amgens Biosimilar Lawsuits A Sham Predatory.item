<p>Amgen's patent infringement lawsuit filed in August against Apotex involving its pegfilgrastim biosimilar, which is referenced on the former company's long-acting human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neulasta, is a "sham" and part of an "overall predatory scheme to monopolize the relevant market," the latter company charged in court documents filed this week.</p><p>In its answers and counterclaims, Apotex said the lawsuit's intent is to "delay, hamper, hinder and impede" the company from entering the market with its pegfilgrastim biosimilar.</p><p>Amgen's "exclusionary, anticompetitive and unlawful activities" threaten to damage Apotex by "forestalling, frustrating and preventing" its ability to complete, the biosimilars maker contended.</p><p>Apotex also said the lawsuit would cause it to suffer anticompetitive harm because it would incur substantial litigation costs, and the mere filing of the litigation may deter customers from buying the pegfilgrastim biosimilar.</p><p>The company also inferred that the lawsuit may chill contracting for the biosimilar product because of the fear of a recall. </p><p>"They don't say that expressly, but that's the implicit allegation," said Boston lawyer Elaine Herrmann Blais, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter LLP.</p><p>Like Amgen's lawsuit against Novartis unit Sandoz involving that firm's biosimilar <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">Zarxio</a> (filgrastim-sndz) &ndash; the first approved in the US &ndash; the case involving Apotex could provide more clarity on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Fights-Over-Interpretation-Of-Biosimilars-Law-Disruption-To-Markets-Future-359974" target="_new">interpretation</a> of the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), the 2010 law that gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars.</p><p>Amgen and Sandoz are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-Amgen-Sandoz-Tango-Across-Old-Ground-360426" target="_new">waiting</a> for a decision from the full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on whether it will <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">rehear</a> the firms' arguments after a three-judge panel on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">July 21</a> gave each side a win, but also each side a loss.</p><p>But Amgen's lawsuit against Apotex, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida, is different in that the two firms actually engaged in the BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures &ndash; the "patent dance."</p><p>Indeed, beginning in December 2014, the two companies agreed through their exchanges to include two Neulasta patents, known as '138 and '784, in their litigation process.</p><p>Apotex, however, sent Amgen a letter on April 17 of notice of commercial marketing.</p><p>So Amgen accused Apotex of violating the BPCIA's requirements by sending the notice before the FDA had licensed the pegfilgrastim biosimilar.</p><p>Amgen is insisting that notice was ineffective. It also accused Apotex of infringing the '138 and '784 patents. </p><p>But Blais pointed out that the '784 patent is due to expire on Oct. 20.</p><p>Apotex already has said it has no plans to launch its pegfilgrastim biosimilar, whose 351(k) application is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-biosimilar-of-Amgens-Neulasta-under-FDA-review-355732" target="_new">under review at the FDA</a>, until after the '784 patent expires, she told Scrip.</p><p>So essentially, Apotex said it's got no idea why that patent has been asserted because it's going to soon be moot, Blais said.</p><p>The patent '138, however, is of more interest, since it was just issued this past February, and therefore is a long ways away from expiring, she said.</p><p>In Apotex's pleadings, it said it told Amgen during the patent dance it hadn't infringed '138 and showed the company through its detailed statement it wouldn't infringe because the concentration of the filgrastim critical intermediate in the refold buffer does not fall within the protein concentration range and the refold buffer strength does not fall within concentration range required by all of the patent's claims.</p><p>Apotex also insisted it had provided "conclusive and irrefutable proof" of that fact.</p><p>"What Apotex is essentially saying here is that's what's going on is Amgen is seeking to keep us off the market using patents that shouldn't keep us off the market," said Blais' colleague, New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, also partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter.</p><p>But Apotex also is arguing that because it engaged in the patent dance, it is under no requirement to give the 180-day notice of commercial marketing, Blais said.</p><p>She said the three-judge Federal Circuit's panel's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">decision in July</a> in <i>Amgen v. Sando</i>z has left the question open about whether notice of commercial marketing is required and when it must be given if the dance is engaged in, "and this case squarely raises that question." </p><p>"Apotex is arguing that where you've danced you have a choice: You can give notice of commercial marketing or you can risk litigation on any patent that was included in the original list provided by the product sponsor. It's their option," Blais said, noting the company reiterated that argument throughout its pleadings filed this week.</p><p>She noted that Apotex also filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration from the court that the BPCIA is clear that because the firm danced, it's not required to give notice and therefore, the 180-day provision does not kick in.</p><p>Apotex also is seeking a declaration that there's no injunctive relief available under the BPCIA, Blais said.</p><p>Essentially, the company said that when the biosimilar applicant elects not to provide a notice of commercial marketing, the only remedy is the one provided in the BPCIA, "which is the reference product sponsor can sue on other patents, but there's no remedy that says you get enjoined," she said.</p><p>With <i>Amgen v. Apotex</i> currently on a fast track at the Florida court, the questions raised by the case could reach the Federal Circuit faster than <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amgen-Covering-Its-Bases-In-Hospira-Biosimilars-Suit-360602" target="_new">other lawsuits</a> currently at the district court level, Cerwinski said.</p><p>Amgen has 21 days to respond to Apotex's pleadings. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
