<p> Bayer Healthcare's Xofigo (radium-223 dichloride) is in but Ferring Pharmaceutical's Firmigon (degarelix) is out according to the latest draft guidance from the UK's health technology appraisal body NICE. </p> <p> Both products are approved in Europe for the treatment of prostate cancer but NICE, the body responsible for deciding which new drugs will be used by the region's National Health Service, only thinks Bayer's product shows enough benefit for its cost. </p> <p> NICE is recommending Xofigo as a treatment for some people with prostate cancer which has stopped responding to hormone therapy (known as hormone relapsed) and has spread to the bone. The draft guidance says the drug appears to be particularly effective for those who have already been treated with the chemotherapy drug, docetaxel. However, in later rounds of discussion NICE will be pushing for a discount on the drug's price in the form of a patient access scheme. </p> <h2> re-review for Firmagon backfires </h2> <p> Meanwhile, Ferring's hormone-dependent prostate cancer offering has not fared as well. </p> <p> The most recent NICE draft guidance says its product, Firmagon, is not a cost-effective drug compared with the currently available standard treatment &ndash; LHRH agonists &ndash; and there is also no way of identifying the people who would benefit the most from it. </p> <p> Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said, &quot;Clinical experts highlighted that degarelix could be particularly beneficial to people whose prostate cancer had spread to their spine and who might develop spinal cord compression.&quot; However, she said the evidence and inputs from experts concluded that it was not possible to identify this particular set of patients, so NICE is not recommending it. </p> <p> Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Dr Joe Hedden said not being able to clearly identify which patients would benefit from Firmagon would likely mean it would be overprescribed. </p> <p> This negative NICE response is bad news for Ferring as the company had been given a positive recommendation for this subset of hormone-dependent prostate cancer patients in <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-gives-Ferrings-Firmagon-lukewarm-recommendation-351304">April 2014</a>, but the company requested a re-review in <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-to-re-review-Ferrings-prostate-cancer-drug-353438">August that year.</a> Now it seems NICE doesn't think Firmagon is suitable for use on the NHS even in this population. </p> <p> Dr Hedden said Firmagon and LHRH analogs, of which there are more, both achieve the same endpoint of castration testosterone levels. But while there might be some data to suggest better safety with Firmagon, &quot;it didn't carry enough weight to get it through NICE,&quot; he said. &quot;They [NICE] will probably look at the landscape and say there are a few choices of LHRH available, what more does this really offer?&quot; </p> <p> Steve Howson, general manager of Ferring UK, said when the re-review for Firmagon was granted that, &quot;Treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer are limited and NICE has continued to restrict access to new treatments. Firmagon has distinct advantages over other first-line recommended treatments in advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer and is offered at a comparable cost, which is why Ferring, alongside representatives of healthcare professionals and patients, appealed against NICE's recommendations.&quot; </p> <p> Ferring was not immediately available for comment on the latest NICE decision. </p> <p> Firmagon is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist administered as a subcutaneous injection. </p> <p> The draft guidance for both Xofigo and Firmagon are now open for consultation. Once the consultations close, the NICE appraisal committees will consider all comments received and develop further draft guidance for both drugs. </p>
