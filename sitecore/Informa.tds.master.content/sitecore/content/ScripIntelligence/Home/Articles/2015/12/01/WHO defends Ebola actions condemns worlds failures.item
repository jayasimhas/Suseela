<p>In a 14-chapter report released on 15 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) defended the actions it took in responding to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, while condemning the world for failing to heed recommendations issued more than four years ago by a panel convened by the health group to strengthen public health emergency preparedness.</p><p>The WHO's report takes a more defensive tone than a document leaked this past October, in which officials with the agency admitted that "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."</p><p>In response to the leak, WHO issued a statement on 18 October 2014 declaring the internal document, which it said was part of its ongoing analysis of its response, was a "first draft of a small team documenting the chronology of the Ebola outbreak events for future review," and said the agency would not explain its details, but would issue a full review and analysis once the outbreak was under control.</p><p>In the report posted on WHO's website on 15 January, the agency said only 64 of 194 member nations had essential surveillance, laboratory, data management and other capacities in place to fulfill their obligations under the international health regulations, and as a result, the health group "went into battle against this virus with no army of reinforcements to support a sustained response, no war chest to fund a surge and weapons that date back to the Middle Ages."</p><p><b>Late identification</b></p><p>Although the current Ebola epidemic started in Guinea in late December 2013, claiming as its first victim an 18-month-old boy who died from the disease, it took WHO until late March to identify the virus as the cause of the outbreak, which by then had spread to neighboring countries Liberia and Sierra Leone, where it "smoldered for weeks, eventually becoming visible as chains of transmission multiplied, spilled into capital cities, and became so numerous they could no longer be traced," the agency said.</p><p>Health officials first thought the illness spreading in Guinea was cholera.</p><p>But the relief organization MÃ©decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which has been highly critical of WHO, sounded the alarm on 31 March 2014 that Guinea was "facing an unprecedented epidemic in terms of the distribution of cases now scattered."</p><p>WHO alerted the media on 8 April during a Geneva press conference that "one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks that we have ever faced" was underway in West Africa, in which there already was a "wide geographical dispersion of cases in both Guinea and Liberia" and a "high level of public fear, anxiety, rumors and misperceptions" at that point. </p><p><b>Ebola spreads</b></p><p>By early June, it was clear "large and fluid population movements over exceptionally porous borders were interfering with control measures, most notably contact tracing and monitoring during the 21-day incubation period," WHO said.</p><p>But it was not until 8 August 2014 that WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a public health emergency of international concern &ndash; determining the spread of the virus constitutes an "extraordinary event" and a public health risk to other states (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-declares-Ebola-international-public-health-emergency-353262" target="_new">08 August 2014</a>).</p><p>At an emergency session, the United Nations Security Council on 18 September 2014 declared the "unprecedented extent" of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa a "threat to international peace and security" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-Threat-to-international-peace-security-354026" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>).</p><p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that day also established the UN Mission for Emergency Ebola Response, or UNMEER, which was tasked with increasing the scale and coordination of the international response and facilitate its logistics.</p><p>On 30 September 2014, the first-ever case of Ebola was diagnosed in the US in a man from Liberia, who had traveled to Dallas, Texas a week earlier, although his diagnosis was initially botched. The man, Thomas Eric Duncan, died on 8 October 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gambling-on-Ebola-1st-US-case-sparks-stock-fervor-354228" target="_new">01 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Botched-Texas-Ebola-case-may-indicate-US-not-fully-prepared-354255" target="_new">02 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">8 October 2014</a>).</p><p>A healthcare worker in Spain became the first person to contract Ebola outside West Africa. She has since recovered (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Spanish-nurse-1st-known-Ebola-transmission-outside-Africa-354321" target="_new">07 October 2014</a>).</p><p>A Dallas, Texas nurse became the first person to contract Ebola in the US after she provided care to Mr Duncan. A second nurse also was later diagnosed. They both survived (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">12 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Texas-hospital-admits-mistakes-in-Ebola-cases-354551" target="_new">20 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/2nd-Texas-nurse-survives-Ebola-discharged-from-hospital-354730" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>).</p><p><b>Vaccines, drugs</b></p><p>WHO dedicated a chapter in its report noting the quick pace at which the global effort came together to develop vaccines and drugs against Ebola &ndash; a disease that had largely been ignored up until then by the biopharmaceutical industry (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-A-market-failure-353355" target="_new">13 August 2014</a>).</p><p>At an 11 August 2014 WHO-convened meeting, a special panel of medical ethicists and other experts concluded it was ethical to use unproven Ebola treatments, and the effort got underway full force, although the US and Canadian governments and a handful of drug and vaccine makers had already been engaged in pursuing products (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-panel-Use-of-unproven-Ebola-treatments-ethical-353340" target="_new">12 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Now, efficacy trials of two vaccines from the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline and NewLink, Merck and the Canadian government are set to start this month in West Africa, with another vaccine from Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic not far behind (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Edge-for-3rd-place-JnJ-in-Ebola-vaccine-race-356065" target="_new">11 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Several drugs also are in development, including Chimerix's brincidofovir and Fujifilm's favipiravir, which are in clinical testing in West Africa (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Africa-trials-underway-testing-Chimerix-Fujifilm-Ebola-drugs-355963" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Lessons learned</b></p><p>WHO said many lessons have been learned about Ebola because of the epidemic in West Africa, including a better clinical understanding of the virus' pathology and ways to improve survival.</p><p>One of the greatest lessons was countries with weak health systems and few basic public health infrastructures in place cannot withstand sudden shocks, whether from a changing climate or a runaway virus.</p><p>"No single control intervention is, all by itself, sufficiently powerful to bring an Ebola epidemic of this size and complexity under control," WHO declared.</p><p>The agency praised the "generosity of the international community, the dedication of scientists and the ingenuity of the pharmaceutical industry" for helping to find solutions against Ebola.</p><p>"Research aimed at introducing new medical products needs to continue at its current accelerated pace," WHO said, noting that pharmaceutical industry executives have expressed their view that all candidate vaccines must be pursued until they fail and that the "world must never again be taken by surprise, left to confront a lethal disease with no modern control tools in hand."</p><p>WHO said its executive board plans to meet on 25 January to discuss the Ebola epidemic and what needs to be done to bring it under control. </p><p>As part of WHO's reform efforts currently underway, the agency said its executive board is expected to consider the extent to which the health group should be operational in the field during extended emergencies, with its staff directly coordinating or supervising the response, or whether its role should be confined to technical guidance and advice. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
