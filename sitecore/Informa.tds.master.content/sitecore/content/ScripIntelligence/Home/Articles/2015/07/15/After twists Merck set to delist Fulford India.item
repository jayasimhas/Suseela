<p>After a series of twists and turns, Merck & Co finally appears to be on its way to delist its subsidiary, Fulford India, from the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</p><p>Merck arm, Dashtag UK, which earlier this year made a voluntary delisting offer to acquire up to 976,763 equity shares representing 25.05% of the share capital of Fulford India from its public shareholders, indicated that it had crossed the 90% shareholding threshold required for such delisting and was also in compliance with other regulatory requirements.</p><p>Dashtag said that it had accepted the discovered price of INR2,400 ($37.8) per share (exit price) and will acquire all shares tendered through valid bids at or below the exit price. Fulford India closed at INR2,341 (+0.91%) on the BSE on 20 July.</p><p>Sources indicated that the Merck group now holds about 91% of Fulford, post closure of the bidding process. The remaining public shareholders have a one year window from the delisting date should they want to tender their shares to the acquirer at the same exit price. Dashtag held 74.95% of the share capital of Fulford prior to the offer.</p><p>"The delisting offer is successful in terms of regulation 17 of the Delisting Regulations as the equity shares validly tendered at or below the exit price in the delisting offer together with the equity shares already held by the acquirer [Dashtag] would cross 90% of the share capital of the company [Fulford] and the acquirer is in compliance with the proviso to Regulation 17(2)," Dashtag said in a notice to the BSE.</p><p>Under Indian delisting regulations and the reverse book building process, the minimum price payable by an acquirer is the price at which the maximum number of shares are tendered (the discovered price) pursuant to the reverse book building process. The discovered price cannot, however, be lower than the floor price, which in the case of the Fulford offer was set at INR701.71.</p><p>MSD India declined to comment on the offer and delisting details.</p><p>Fulford is the only listed arm of the Merck group in India &ndash; both MSD Pharmaceuticals and Organon India are unlisted. Dashtag had previously maintained that full ownership of Fulford would provide enhanced operational flexibility to its business in India.</p><h2>Twists and turns </h2><p>Dashtag's acceptance of the discovered price is significant in the backdrop of the tough stance it had taken over the recent past in view of the surge in Fulford's share price.</p><p>Dashtag, which in April last year announced its intent to make a voluntary delisting offer for Fulford, then set the "indicative" price for the offer at INR1,150 ($19.16 then) per share and a floor price of INR701.71. </p><p>However, in June that year Dashtag cautioned shareholders that the spurt in the share price of Fulford India after the announcement of the proposed delisting of the company's shares was made public, is not, in its view, reflective of the "business fundamentals" of the company. </p><p>Dashtag then stated that it followed "stringent financial discipline" and does not intend to make acquisitions that do not satisfy its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Fulford-India-on-tailspin-after-parents-tough-stance-352404" target="_new">financial expectations</a>. </p><p>Last December, Dashtag decided against going ahead with the public announcement of the delisting offer in view of the share price of Fulford being "substantially higher" than the indicative price of INR1,150. </p><p>Dashtag, though, said that in the event that market conditions align with its financial expectations, it may decide to proceed with the public announcement of the delisting offer, failing which it may consider other strategic alternatives in relation to its ownership of shares in the Fulford.</p><p>In May this year, Dashtag went through with the Fulford delisting offer announcement. </p><p>The delisting offer also faced some last minute hiccups after Dashtag in June this year said that the offer letter to all public shareholders had been successfully delivered to 3,772 shareholders but remained undelivered in the case of 69 public shareholders despite its efforts. </p><p>The Bombay Stock Exchange had on 10 June instructed Dashtag to seek an exemption from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) concerning compliance with the delivery condition.</p><p>Dashtag had then filed an appeal before the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on 15 June for appropriate relief and also filed an exemption application with SEBI as instructed by BSE.</p><p>On July 16, the SAT disposed of the appeal in view of a SEBI clarification on the issue and also extended the period to comply with the offer related requirements as per the delisting regulations by three weeks.</p>
