<p>Already very active in deal-making for fibrotic disease companies and candidates in the past year, Bristol-Myers Squibb ponied up $150m in upfront cash on Aug. 31 for an option to acquire Promedior Inc. and its mid-stage biologic for myelofibrosis (MF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).</p><p>Privately held Promedior is developing PRM-151, a recombinant form of human pentraxin-2 protein, in both indications, and has completed the first stage of a Phase II trial in MF and a Phase Ib study in IPF. New Phase II trials for both indications have been approved by Bristol and will initiate near-term, with the New York pharma holding an option to acquire Promedior upon the completion of either trial.</p><p>Promedior CEO Suzanne Bruhn would not specify whether Bristol beat out other competition for the deal around PRM-151, but said the compound has produced significant interest with trial results to date suggesting that it could be a disease-modifying drug in MF and/or IPF. </p><p>Neither of the two drugs approved to treat IPF in the US &ndash; Roche's <i>Esbriet</i> (pirfenidone) and Boehringer Ingelheim's Ofev (nintedanib) &ndash; or the only one approved for MF &ndash; Incyte Corp.'s <i>Jakafi</i> (ruxolitinib) &ndash; offer patients the potential to turn back the impact of their disease, she noted in an interview.</p><p>"We've gotten a lot of excitement about PRM-151 as something that is novel and differentiated in this field of fibrosis," she said. "Bristol is an ideal fit for us because they have been really clear about fibrosis as part of their R&D strategy, so the strategic alignment between us and Bristol was without question very, very strong."</p><p>Bristol's size and scope also could mean that PRM-151 will be investigated in other diseases beyond IPF and MF, both of which are orphan indications, Bruhn said. Data from stage one of the Phase II program for PRM-151 in MF presented last November at the American Society of Hematology meeting validated the candidate as an anti-fibrotic, she added.</p><p>"We saw reduction in bone marrow fibrosis, reversal of the underlying pathology that was accompanied by improvement in the tissue function," the executive said. "We [also] saw reduction in anemia and thrombocytopenia."</p><p>In the Phase Ib trial in IPF, PRM-151 demonstrated improvement in forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1). </p><p>"This is a disease that is terribly progressive; people get sicker and sicker," Bruhn noted. "We're hoping that if we can show people getting better, that would be pretty exciting for patients, and I think in combination with the data in MF where we show the reversal of that scarring, if we could show that in the lung as well, that would be pretty exciting."</p><p><b>Competing With Oral Therapies</b></p><p>IPF is the larger patient base with about 130,000 patients in the US compared with about 18,000 MF patients, but determining which disease offers the bigger economic opportunity is harder to characterize, she said. </p><p>PRM-151, a monthly intravenous infusion, would be competing with existing oral therapies in both indications, but Bruhn said she's confident that clinical benefits beyond symptom reduction would easily overcome any concerns about ease of administration. </p><p>Promedior will test three different doses of the drug in the upcoming Phase II study in MF, but the one-month dosing frequency is a settled question.</p><p>The company designed the pair of new Phase II trials on its own, but Bristol signed off on them. The deal specifies that Promedior will run the trials with Bristol holding the option to acquire the company at preset terms upon the conclusion of either study, Bruhn said.</p><p>The company plans to initiate the second-stage Phase II study in MF within the next few weeks. It will be a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study of about 84 patients with either grade 2 or grade 3 bone marrow fibrosis or thrombocytopenia. In IPF, the coming Phase II trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using six months of treatment in about 117 patients, who can be taking either of the approved IPF drugs or be treatment-na&iuml;ve.</p><p>In terms of timing, Bruhn would say only that data should be available by 2017 at the earliest. If Bristol opts to buy Promedior, the Lexington, Massachusetts-based biotech's shareholders would get an exercise fee and could earn clinical and regulatory milestone payments. </p><p><b>Acquisition Options Help Grow Pipeline</b></p><p>The deal, which ultimately could yield up to $1.25bn for Promedior's shareholders, resembles one Bristol signed last November when it made an undisclosed upfront payment for the option to buy Denmark's Galecto Biotech AB and its Phase I galectin-3 inhibitor for IPF. </p><p>Galecto and Bristol mutually agreed to the design of a Phase Ib trial of TD139, with the pharma holding a right to buy the Danish biotech up to 60 days after completion of the study. Total consideration under that deal could reach $444 million.</p><p>About two months after signing that deal, Bristol reached an agreement for exclusive global development, manufacturing and commercial rights to preclinical small-molecule anti-fibrotic candidates discovered by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BMS-signs-research-deal-to-expand-fibrosis-offering-355970" target="_new">California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr)</a>. That arrangement, for which financial details were not disclosed, also established a fibrotic disease R&D collaboration between the two entities.</p><p>Promedior has raised about $76 billion in private equity capital over its lifetime, most recently bringing in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Promediors-new-21.5M-series-D-helps-advance-fibrosis-portfolio-including-IPF-and-mylelofibrosis-327799" target="_new">$21.5m in Series D financing</a> in March 2012, which was expanded to $24.5m six months later.</p><p>The Promedior option agreement was one of two deals announced by Bristol at the start of the week. The company said on Aug. 30 that it signed a research collaboration and licensing deal with Australia's QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute to collaborate on the discovery of novel therapeutic antibodies against an undisclosed immuno-oncology target. No financial terms were disclosed.</p><p><p>[Editor's note: This story is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" DAILY</a>.
