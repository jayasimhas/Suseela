<p><p>Incyte and Merck & Co. have decided to move a combination of their respective immunotherapies into a pivotal Phase III trial as a first-line therapy for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. The trial, set to begin in the first half of 2016, will combine Incyte's IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat with Merck's already-approved programmed death-1 (PD-1) antagonist <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab). </p><p>Financial details of the collaboration were not disclosed. </p><p>The pair inked their original deal in February 2014 to test the combination in a Phase I/II study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. As part of the expansion of the deal, the pair agreed that neither company will test their respective drugs with any from the other class for the next two years. </p><p>Both companies have signed a slew of research collaborations to test compounds in their pipeline with other immunotherapies. The industry is working under the assumption that combination therapies will be the key to unlocking a cure for the variety of cancers that exist. </p><p>Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. have been leading the way in the immuno-oncology space with the approval of their PD-1 antagonists. Several other big pharmas have jumped into this space and all of the companies have been signing deals left and right in order to find the right combination for each patient population. </p><p>
