<p>Cipla is tweaking senior personnel responsibilities and aligning certain markets within its overall spread as it gears to up its play in the global respiratory space and leverage synergies across the business.</p><p>As part of these efforts Timothy Crew, who has had stints with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Teva, and currently leads Cipla's North American business, will now get additional charge of the Indian firm's Europe business. </p><p>This, in turn, would mean that Frank Pieters, Cipla's current head of the European region and the global respiratory business, will now largely be focused on the latter part of his responsibilities. Mr Pieters, previously senior vice-president, southern Europe region, in Teva Pharmaceuticals, joined Cipla in July 2012 <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-builds-global-people-pipeline-putting-ex-Teva-exec-in-EU-respiratory-role-332479%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 4 July 2012)</a>. </p><p>Cipla confirmed these plans but clarified that these were not a recalibration but a ''normal course of correction''.</p><p><p>''As we look to maximise delivery of our plan for the next three years and beyond, we continuously look to create a structure to ensure we have the right balance and focus on both delivering day-to-day performance and driving the overall strategic agenda for the business, '' the company told <i>Scrip</i>, referring to the personnel-related tweaks.</p><p><p>Cipla added that as its global respiratory and specialty business such as vaccines were projected to be a ''significant driver'' of growth, Mr Pieters would now assume the role full time of global head of respiratory and specialty. </p><p><p>''Tim Crew will head our North America (including Mexico) and Europe businesses,'' it said.</p><p><h2>Respiratory portfolio</h2><p>Mr Pieters appointment was seen as significant against the backdrop of products like GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster asthma/COPD treatment, Advair/Seretide (salmeterol/fluticasone), losing patent protection across various markets. </p><p>Cipla has been keen to develop a global strategy for its generic version, Seroflo, and had put in place a respiratory portfolio team. </p><p>For 2014-15, Cipla has underscored plans to focus on, among other, its European respiratory launches and the ''proactive'' exploration of partnership opportunities to monetize its assets. Cipla's managing director and global CEO Subhanu Saxena has previously told <i>Scrip</i> that Europe could well constitute 20% of the company's business by 2020 <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-CEO-Sharp-gains-in-Europe-soon-but-not-yet-353710%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 4 September 2014)</a>. </p><p>Last year, Cipla launched a "cost-efficient" generic version of Advair in Germany and Sweden and speculation has been rife that the Mumbai-based firm may have also set its sights on developing generic versions of products like GSK's Breo (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol; <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ciplas-Advair-generic-hits-Europe-eyes-Breo-version-353665%5d" target="_new">scripintelligence.com 2 September 2014)</a>. The company had also introduced its ipratropium metered-dose inhaler in the UK and nasal mometasone in the Netherlands.</p><p>Whether the management rejig is in view of the flurry of activity anticipated in the respiratory category or rather because Cipla's Europe plans may not have panned out at the anticipated pace is unclear, though analysts have been upbeat about launches in the respiratory space in the EU.</p><p>CIMB Securities said in September last year that Cipla appeared ''well positioned'' to monetize the combination inhalers opportunity in the EU, with an approval in the UK anticipated in the first quarter of 2015.</p><p><p>''We expect Cipla to garner at least 10-15% market share in FY16 for generic Advair metered dose inhalers (MDI) given the lack of competition,'' CIMB said.</p><p><p>Cipla is expected to roll out dry powder inhalers (DPIs) in 2017/18 in the EU and enter the US by 2018/19 across the product portfolio, CIMB added.</p><p><p>On speculation that Cipla may be reviewing plans in markets like Russia and Mexico, in part in light of the Rouble's fall, the company said that both were important markets and that it was currently developing its strategy for enhancing patient access there. </p><p><p>''Cipla continues to operate in Russia through our partners. To enable greater focus and alignment with the North America business, the Mexico business is now under the leadership of Tim Crew,'' the company told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p><p>Russia and Latin America currently form part of Cipla's rest of the world business, which contributed about 24.5% of global revenues in 2013-14.</p>
