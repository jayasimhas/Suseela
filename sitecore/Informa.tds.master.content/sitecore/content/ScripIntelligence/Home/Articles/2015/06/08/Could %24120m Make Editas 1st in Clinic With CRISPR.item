<p>No company working with the genome-editing technology known as CRISPR has taken a therapeutic candidate into the clinic, but Editas Medicine has raised $120m in Series B private financing to refine its platform and prepare its first potential products for human testing.</p><p>The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company hasn't set a timeline for when it will begin clinical trials, but Editas CEO Katrine Bosley told <i>Scrip</i> that the Series B cash will help the company solve problems such as delivery and specificity before Editas moves multiple programs into the clinic. The company's investors &ndash; a mix of crossover funds, venture capital firms and other equity providers &ndash; showed a lot of confidence in Editas's ability to overcome those and other CRISPR challenges by backing one of 2015's largest private financing rounds to date for a biotechnology company.</p><p>"This gives us a very strong financial foundation to develop multiple programs and the platform," Bosley said. "We have some exciting near-term opportunities for the technology, but we don't want to only do those. This will allow us to work on some tougher, longer-term opportunities."</p><p><b>Investors Go All In</b></p><p>The investor syndicate behind the company's Series B round was led by Boris Nikolic, who previously served as chief science and technology advisor for software billionaire Bill Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation &ndash; itself a frequent biotechnology investor. Nikolic raised cash from the Gates Foundation and other global family offices with long-term investment horizons to create a fund known as bng0 just to invest in Editas.</p><p>The company's other new investors include Deerfield Management, Viking Global Investors, Fidelity Management & Research Company, funds and accounts managed by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Google Ventures, Jennison Associates on behalf of certain clients, Khosla Ventures, EcoR1 Capital, Casdin Capital, Omega Funds, Cowen Private Investments and Alexandria Venture Investments. </p><p>Investors that supported Editas's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Series-A-rounds-abound-Editas-ARMO-Allergen-348349" target="_new">$43m Series A round</a> &ndash; Flagship Ventures, Polaris Partners, Third Rock Ventures and Partners Innovation Fund &ndash; also participated in the Series B financing.</p><p>Deerfield alone invested $20m from its new $550m <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Deerfield-Foresite-raise-1bn-to-fund-health-care-companies-359732" target="_new">Deerfield Healthcare Innovations Fund</a> in Editas, because of the transformative effect that gene editing may have on patients across a variety of diseases, the investments firm's managing partner Jim Flynn said in a statement.</p><p><b>A 'Big Idea' For New Therapies</b></p><p>"There's no question in my mind that genome editing is one of the very few 'big ideas' to come along in the last few years. Investors focused on that and the ability to bring it to possibly a wide range of diseases," Editas chief financial officer Andrew Hack told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He said Editas will use the private capital raised so far to build the company prior to another funding round or an initial public offering to further progress Editas's CRISPR platform.</p><p>CRISPR stands for clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. The technology uses CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), which is bound to specific RNA molecules to deliver the protein to a particular section of DNA that needs editing &ndash; to turn on, turn off or selectively edit the gene that's responsible for a disease. </p><p>Editas is considering adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, lipid nanoparticles (as used for RNA-based therapies) and other available options for delivering its therapies.</p><p>"The platform that we are developing at Editas really has a broad applicability," Bosley said.</p><p>She noted that CRISPR technology can be applied across many therapeutic areas for diseases with no available treatments, but said that the company's funding will help its scientists expand the kinds of diseases that its technology can address and broaden the platform's capabilities. </p><p>One of the first genetic diseases for which Editas is developing a CRISPR therapy is a form of leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) with no available therapies, but the company has not revealed other specific diseases for which it is running preclinical tests.</p><p>It's important to note that Editas will use CRISPR to edit disease-specific genes in humans. The company's platform will not be used to edit the human germline &ndash; genetic information passed on during reproduction &ndash; an area of gene-editing research that recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/White-House-gene-editing-research-raises-serious-urgent-questions-358604" target="_new">came under fire</a> for ethical reasons.</p><p>Bosley said CRISPR will be something new for the US FDA and other biopharma regulators to consider in terms of regulating and reviewing proposals for novel therapies. But while the agencies are well-equipped to understand the science, she noted that companies working in the field are responsible for putting forward strong data to back up their programs.</p><p>And while there have been some patent disputes in the CRISPR/Cas9 field, Editas believes that its intellectual property position is strong. The company, like many of its competitors in the field, has licensed broad patent portfolios from <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Four-deal-updates-a-venture-funding-round-and-a-milestone-fee-355431" target="_new">academic and research institutions</a>: the Broad Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Duke University. Editas also will seek patents for CRISPR work done in its own labs.</p><p><b>Competition is Growing</b></p><p>Several other companies are rushing forward with CRISPR platforms, but none have taken a therapeutic candidate into the clinic. Intellia Therapeutics debuted with a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/VC-UPDATE-Polaris-closes-450m-fund-in-biotech-friendly-US-market-355269" target="_new">$15m Series A round</a> in November and Caribou Biosciences closed an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Caribou-brings-in-11m-for-CRISPR-tech-357663" target="_new">$11m Series A funding round</a> in April. CRISPR Therapeutics followed Caribou's fundraising news with an announcement a few weeks later that it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CRISPR-Therapeutics-raises-64m-validating-uncertain-patent-position-358131" target="_new">raised $64m in additional Series A and B funding</a>, bringing total investment to date to $89m.</p><p>Novartis revealed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-to-use-gene-editing-tool-with-CAR-T-therapies-355979" target="_new">licensing agreements with Intellia and Caribou</a> in January for their CRISPR technology, followed a few weeks by AstraZeneca's announcement that it signed deals with <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-deals-take-CRISPR-to-its-drug-discovery-heart-356437" target="_new">four academic and commercial partners</a> for their CRISPR expertise. GlaxoSmithKline's venture capital arm SR One and Celgene backed the additional fundraising by CRISPR Therapeutics in April.</p><p>Editas and Juno Therapeutics entered into an agreement in May to collaborate on the development of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) and T-cell receptor (TCR) therapies &ndash; the focus of Novartis's agreement with Intellia and Caribou. Juno and Novartis are <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-CAR-T-cell-therapies-generate-buzz-355536" target="_new">close competitors in the CAR-T field</a> and the companies settled a patent dispute in April that entitles Juno to single-digit royalties from sales of Novartis CAR-T therapies.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
