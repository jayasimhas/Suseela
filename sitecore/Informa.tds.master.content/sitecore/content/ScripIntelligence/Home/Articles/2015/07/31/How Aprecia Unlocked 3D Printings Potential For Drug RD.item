<p>While three-dimensional printing (3DP) &ndash; an additive manufacturing process in which successive layers of material are laid down under computer control &ndash; has been around since about the early 1980s, Aprecia will forever be known in the history books as the first company to use the technology to successfully bring a drug to the US market. </p><p>That medicine, Spritam (levetiracetam), is indicated as an adjunctive therapy to treat partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy four years or older weighing more than 20kg; myoclonic seizures in patients 12 years or older with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 6 years or older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.</p><p>The drug was approved under the FDA's 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which means the company could rely on safety and efficacy data already on file with the agency.</p><p>Aprecia had to conduct a PK bridging trial to show its dosage form was comparable to the rate and extent of the absorption as the reference levetiracetam product, UCB's Keppra.</p><p>Like other antiepileptics, Spritam comes with a warning about the potential for suicidal thoughts or actions.</p><p>The drug, which is available as 250mg, 500mg, 750mg, or 1,000mg tablets that are spearmint flavored, disintegrates in a patient's mouth into small particles in about 11 seconds &ndash; or from 2 to 27 seconds &ndash; when taken with a sip of water or other liquid, Aprecia CEO Don Wetherhold explained.</p><p>That particular delivery form is intended to provide "precision, high-dose loading and immediate dispersion" of a medicine to patients who may have challenges for one reason or another of swallowing large pills, Mr. Wetherhold told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>An easier-to-swallow product would help patients achieve better medication adherence, he added.</p><p>But Spritam is manufactured under a process much different than other medicines.</p><p>"Our formulations are assembled one layer at a time," Mr. Wetherhold said. "Essentially, we repeat the steps of spreading powder, and then in a very precise way, depositing liquid on to that powder, which then bonds together multiple layers until the desired shape is fully formed."</p><p>He noted that a typical build cycle for the Spritam tablets may be 20 to 40 layers of powder stitched together with the aqueous fluid using the firm's patent-protected 3DP manufacturing technology.</p><p><b>Persuading FDA on 3DP</b></p><p>Mr. Wetherhold said his company, which was formed in 2003, started off early in trying to convince the FDA to approve a 3DP-formulated drug &ndash; no small achievement in a highly regulated industry.</p><p>He said Aprecia had a "well-attended and well-received" lunch and learn, "where we communicated more broadly to anybody who was willing to come and hear about 3D printing and we talked a little bit about our manufacturing process."</p><p>The firm's 505(b)(2) new drug application was accepted by the FDA last October, with the agency setting a <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date of Aug. 1, Mr. Wetherhold said.</p><p>Over that review period, the FDA inspected the firm's manufacturing facility, where Aprecia's commercial-scale 3DP production system is housed, he noted.</p><p>The key to unlocking the 3DP platform for pharmaceuticals, Mr. Wetherhold declared, "was to design and build proprietary equipment."</p><p>The company was able to do that under its exclusive worldwide license to a patent estate owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>While 3DP is typically used to make highly customizable products, for Aprecia's pharmaceutical manufacturing use, the equipment and machinery had to be designed to make the same thing "thousands and thousands of times, over and over again," and do it in a controlled way at commercial scale, Mr. Wetherhold said.</p><p>He noted Aprecia's commercial-scale 3DP equipment uses off-the-shelf printer heads, but the programming behind them and what they do is customized and proprietary.</p><p>Using its ZipDose 3DP platform, Aprecia, which holds the rights to more than 50 patents on its technology, believes it can innovate and generate multiple products, he said.</p><p>Mr. Wetherhold said Aprecia is focused on bringing drugs to patients in high unmet needs where a easier-to-use dosage form is demanded.</p><p>But David Emm, a principal security researcher at UK-based cyber-security firm Kaspersky, said that while the 3DP production method allows for precise dosage creation of pharmaceutical products, he warned the technology could become vulnerable to hackers if the computer-based systems were ever linked up to the Internet, where the formulations could be altered with the intent of causing harm.</p><p>Stringent controls and checks would need to be put in place to prevent malicious or accidental tampering of such systems, he said.</p><p>Mr. Wetherhold, however, said that's not a concern for his firm for now because Aprecia's 3DP system is not connected to the Internet.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
