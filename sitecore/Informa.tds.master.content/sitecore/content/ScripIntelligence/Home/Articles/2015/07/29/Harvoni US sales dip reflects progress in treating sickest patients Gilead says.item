<p><p>In the midst of another sterling quarterly earnings report, Gilead Sciences nonetheless felt a need to explain why US sales of hepatitis C fixed-dose combo drug Harvoni declined slightly from the first to the second quarter this year.</p><p>Generally, Gilead&rsquo;s product sales trend continued its upward climb in the second quarter financials unveiled 28 July, with product sales totaling $8.1bn for the three months, up from $6.4bn in the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) brought in $3.608bn worldwide on the quarter, up slightly from the first quarter, but US sales dropped by slightly more than $200m sequentially to $2.826bn.</p><p>Domestically, there were roughly 60,000 new patient starts on Harvoni during the second quarter, down from 70,000 starts during the first quarter. During a same-day call on the quarter, Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Paul Carter attributed some of that decline to the first quarter total representing a peak in treatment levels, while the current numbers indicate that many of the patients who had been warehoused to await Harvoni had been treated.</p><p>Overall, the roughly 130,000 US patient starts on Harvoni during the first half of the year is nearly equivalent to the entire total of starts in 2014 for Sovaldi-based regimens, he added.</p><p>The flat US sales for Harvoni were more than offset by increased sales in Europe and the rest of the world, Chairman and CEO John Martin noted during the call. EU sales were up by about $146m from the first quarter to $623m. The drug is now approved in 40 countries, compared to 51 for its predecessor Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), whose decline in sales was expected with the launch of Harvoni.</p><p>Harvoni recorded $1.1bn in EU sales over the first six months of 2015, representing roughly 30,000 treatment initiations. Spain, Portugal and Italy are the strongest European markets for the combo to date, Carter said.</p><p>Sovaldi still brought in $1.291bn globally during the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter, but down substantially from the $3.481bn total one year earlier. In the US, Sovaldi sales for the quarter were $615m, compared to $3.031bn during the second quarter of 2014.</p><p>Carter said the imminent launch of Sovaldi in the UK, delayed due to pricing negotiations, would be a boon for Gilead&rsquo;s HCV franchise in the near term, and was likely to be followed quickly by a Harvoni launch in the UK, as well.</p><p>Martin said about 470,000 HCV patients have been treated globally with a Gilead regimen since Sovaldi&rsquo;s initial approval in 2013. He added that the company filed three supplemental NDAs for Harvoni during the second quarter &ndash; to add HIV/HCV co-infected patients, patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6 of the virus, and treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients to the product&rsquo;s label. All have been accepted by FDA for priority review, with decisions expected by mid-November.</p><p><p>
