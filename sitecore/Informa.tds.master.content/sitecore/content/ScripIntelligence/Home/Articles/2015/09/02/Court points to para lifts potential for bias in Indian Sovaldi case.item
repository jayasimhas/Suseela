<p>A recent Delhi High Court order that set aside the rejection of one of Gilead's key patent applications for its hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), in India has made some seemingly embarrassing observations on how the patent office may have been potentially ''influenced'' by material placed on record by pre-grant opposition applicants.</p><p>Justice Rajiv Shakdher, in a written order, noted that a perusal of the impugned order indicates not only the presence of ''typographical errors'', which find a reflection in the opponents' application, but also that certain parts of the opponents application had been ''lifted and incorporated'' in the order.</p><p>''The reading of the impugned order thus suggests that there was every possibility, or, in the very least, the potential of respondent no.2 [the patent office] being influenced by the material placed on record by Natco and I-MAK. In that sense, the presence of typographical errors and lifting of para and verse from opponents application, is a tertiary point (though it is a measure of influence), as it was sought to be explained as happy coincidence. What is critical though, is the availability of the material on record,'' the order dated 30 January but only recently uploaded said.</p><p>The Indian government counsel had underscored that the patent office had not taken recourse to the objections and/or the material supplied by the opponents, but the High Court indicated that it was not impressed as the availability of the material at hand had ''the potentiality of injecting bias'' in the proceedings conducted by the patent office.</p><p>The court, though, acknowledged that it had no means of ''discerning'' whether in actuality the patent office was influenced by the material placed on record by Natco and I-MAK. ''The test, therefore, can only be, whether the circumstances which obtained in this case, would throw up the possibility of the final outcome being influenced, by virtue of availability of material on record, which is undoubtedly inimical to the interest of the petitioner,'' it observed.</p><p>Hardev Karar, Deputy Controller of Patents and Designs at the Delhi patent office, last month rejected one of Gilead's patent applications for Sovaldi essentially on the grounds that it falls under section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act and failed to meet the conditions therein <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-Sovaldi-patent-rejection-what-now-and-next-356154%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 15 January 2015)</a>. The order, however, acknowledged the novelty and inventive step of the present set of claims concerning the sofosbuvir patent. </p><p>Natco and the US based non-profit group, Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK) had previously filed pre-grant patent oppositions against the Sovaldi patent <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/India-set-to-hear-Sovaldi-patent-objections-case-352584%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 30 June 2014)</a>. I-MAK has also collaborated with the French charity MÃ©decins du Monde's (MdM; Doctors of the World) patent attorney to write the dossier for the European opposition against one of the Sovaldi patents <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Charity-seeks-to-overturn-European-Sovaldi-patent-356676%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 10 February 2015)</a>.</p><p>Gilead had opposed the order of the Indian deputy controller and claimed a ''complete breach of principles of natural justice'' since it took into account the grounds of opposition and material supplied by parties which had submitted applications for pre-grant opposition.</p><p>Gilead's counsel also said that once notice had been issued to the company for a hearing under Section 14 of India's Patent Act, to consider whether it ought to be granted a patent, the patent office should also have heard the petitioner ''qua objections raised'' in the applications filed, under Section 25 [concerning opposition to the grant of a patent] of the Act. Section 14 concerns a report of the examiner received by the Patent Controller that may be adverse to the applicant or requires an amendment of the application.</p><p>Gilead had contended that while documents in opposition filed by the entities under Section 25 of the Act were supplied, no opportunity had been given to meet the objections raised by them.</p><p>Justice Shakdher in his order has now remanded the matter for a fresh decision by the Patent Office and urged it to fix a date of hearing both for Sections 14 and 25 proceedings. He has sought that notice be issued in all pending applications under Section 25 of the Act, and those that may be filed hereafter. </p><p>''Respondent no 2 [the patent office] will send written communication in this respect to all concerned parties including the petitioner [Gilead]. Respondent no 2 shall also ensure that all concerned and affected parties are given access to the objections and material filed by their opponents,'' the court order said. It is not immediately clear whether this process has been set in motion.</p>
