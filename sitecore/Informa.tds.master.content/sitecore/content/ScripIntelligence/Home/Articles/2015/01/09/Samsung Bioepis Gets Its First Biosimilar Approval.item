<p>Within just three and a half years since its establishment, Samsung Bioepis has received its first regulatory approval for a biosimilar, meaning the Samsung Group affiliate is now set to release its version of Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis blockbuster Enbrel (etanercept) in South Korea late this year or early next. It will be the fourth locally developed biosimilar to hit the domestic market and is expected to be priced at about a 30% discount.</p><p><p>South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) has granted approval for Samsung Bioepis Co. Ltd. to launch its biosimilar, <i>Brenzys</i> (previously known as SB4), for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis, which are the same indications as the originator drug.</p><p><p>Brenzys is the fourth biosimilar product developed by a domestic pharma firm to get approval from the MFDS, and is the second approval in the country for an Enbrel biosimilar. Hanwha Chemical Corp. received approval for Davictrel, its biosimilar of Enbrel, in 2014.</p><p><p>Elsewhere in the biosimilar space, Celltrion Inc. received MFDS approval for Remsima, its biosimilar of Remicade (infliximab), in 2012, and for Herzuma, its biosimilar of Herceptin (trastuzumab), in 2014. Samsung Bioepis had applied for the approval in South Korea of the production and sales of SB4 in March 2015.</p><p><p>In 2014, Enbrel had global sales of $8.94bn. Amgen co-promotes the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor in the US and Canada under a profit-sharing agreement with Pfizer Inc., while Pfizer has rights to sell Enbrel in other territories, with Amgen receiving a royalty.</p><p><p>As part of the partnership between Samsung Bioepis and Merck & Co. Inc. reached in February 2013, MSD Korea will handle the commercialization of Brenzys in South Korea. The South Korean firm said the timing of the product launch was likely to be at the end of this year or in early 2016 after its reimbursement price is determined.</p><p><p>In South Korea, biosimilar prices are normally set at about a 30% discount to the current originator price.</p><p><h2>Clinical Program</h2><p><p>Samsung Bioepis has conducted Phase I and III clinical trials in multiple countries to confirm that Brenzys has the same pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety as the originator drug. A total of 596 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis participated in the Phase III program conducted at 73 hospitals in 10 countries for 24 weeks, while 138 healthy men participated in the Phase I study conducted in Germany.</p><p><p>The company hopes to receive approval for the product in Europe in the first half of next year. It also expects to receive approvals in South Korea and Europe for SB2, its infliximab biosimilar candidate, around the same time as SB4, after submitting a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency on Mar.19.</p><p><p>For the rest of its biosimilar pipeline, it will start to apply for approvals from next year, a company official has said.</p><p><h2>Biosimilar Pipeline</h2><p><p>Samsung Bioepis and Merck have a total of five biosimilars in Phase III development and plan to file them for approval in 2015 and 2016.</p><p><p>Samsung Bioepis is in the final stage of a Phase III global clinical study for SB9, its biosimilar version of Sanofi's blockbuster Lantus (insulin glargine), for which an approval filing is planned in the US in the latter half of this year and in Europe early next year.</p><p><p>The company has a pipeline of six biosimilar products, including trastuzumab, adalimumab, bevacizumab and insulin glargine, which is the biggest biosimilar pipeline at any South Korean firm.</p><p><p>Samsung Bioepis itself is a joint venture with Biogen Idec, under which Samsung is aiming to take advantage of its partner's expertise in protein engineering, biologics manufacturing and commercialization. Samsung Bioepis's sister company Samsung BioLogics plays the role of a contract manufacturing organization.</p><p><h2>Samsung's Big Plans</h2><p><p>Biomedicine is one of the sectors that the Samsung Group, South Korea's biggest business conglomerate, has been aiming to grow and its goal is to become a leader in the global market. The group aims to invest KRW2.1tn ($1.75bn) in the biopharma sector by 2020.</p><p><p>During a recent investor relations meeting in Incheon, South Korea, Samsung Bioepis said it was seeking to list its shares in Nasdaq market in the first half of next year to grow as a world-class biopharmaceutical firm.</p><p><p>The company will be the first Samsung Group affiliate to directly list shares in the US.</p><p><p>"Through listing in Nasdaq, where most of the top biopharmaceutical firms are listed, Samsung Bioepis will be able to reevaluate its corporate value. We expect the company to be valued at KRW8tn to KRW10tn after listing its shares," Christopher Hansung Ko, CEO of Samsung Bioepis, has said.</p><p><p>The company has reportedly selected Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Global Markets Korea Securities as joint lead managers and Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse as co-advisors for the initial public offering.</p><p><p>A version of this article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.
