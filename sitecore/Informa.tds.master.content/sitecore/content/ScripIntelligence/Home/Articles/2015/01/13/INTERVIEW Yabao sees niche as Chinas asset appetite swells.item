<p><p><b>Bagging four alliance deals in one year including one with Lilly for diabetes, Yabao Pharma sees a wide opening for international collaboration on early stage drug development in China, driven by rising domestic demand for innovative drug candidates, says president of R&D Peng Wang in an exclusive interview.</b></p><p><p>Established and publicly listed Yabao Pharmaceutical has many attractions to offer in a collaboration negotiation, Dr Wang declared. Among these, the Shanxi-based company has a national sales network, sufficient funding and clearance from a US FDA good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspection for its solid formulation production line in Beijing. </p><p><p>In addition, a shift in its R&D strategy, which puts a long-term focus on international partnerships and joint development, provides a clear roadmap, Wang told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> in his Beijing office on the last day of 2014.</p><p><p>The executive has accumulated R&D experience from working for over a decade at a major pharma company in the US and then at a contract research organization (CRO) and a major domestic drug maker. Obtaining his PhD from Tokyo University, Dr Wang first worked for Schering-Plough for 18 years. He then joined WuXi AppTec in China and later became chief scientific officer for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group.</p><p><p>During his tenure at Simcere, Wang helped the Nanjing firm negotiate its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb for the rheumatoid arthritis treatment Orencia (abatacept).</p><p><p>In 2013, he assumed his current position, with a goal to help Yabao to transform its R&D strategy. Established in 1978 and listed in Shanghai in 1992, Yabao's best-selling product is a pediatric patch preparation, which sold CNY600m ($96.5m) in 2013 and is estimated to reach CNY800m in 2014.</p><p><p>While in the short and medium term the company is looking to expand in both the domestic and international markets, and to register generic drugs in the US and Europe, the longer term goal is international drug development collaborations.</p><p><p>"We combine our product commercial experience with drug R&D quality; by collaborating with multinationals a product development cycle can be shorted by four years on average, and also the risks are lowered," Dr Wang said.</p><p><p>To that end, Yabao in April established a subsidiary in Suzhou which is devoted to new drug R&D. Why Suzhou? Dr Wang said that the city represents the best and strongest pharma innovation, and additionally, several Suzhou companies have successfully obtained funding for new products (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hot-money-fuels-China-biotech-me-different-ambitions-355863" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 29 December 2014</a>).</p><p><h2>A year of deal-making</h2><p><p>"We are looking to license assets from overseas and jointly develop them," Dr Wang said, adding that the compounds should also have international market prospects.</p><p><p>The Shanxi firm attracted international attention by inking a deal in July with Lilly to develop the latter's antidiabetic glucokinase activator (GKA), LY2608204, which has completed Phase I studies in the US. </p><p><p>Again in July, Yabao and Lawson Health Research Institute in Canada signed an agreement for the development of preclinical stage Annxin A5 for sepsis. The drug will be developed to US FDA standards in China, where Yabao will retain the rights, while Lawson retains the ex-China rights.</p><p><p>Then in August Yabao signed on with Changzhou Le Sun Pharmaceuticals to co-develop Le Sun's preclinical oncology PLK/PI3K dual inhibitor LS-008. Le Sun was founded by University of South Australia professor Shudong Wang.</p><p><p>In November, Yabao received exclusive rights from the UK independent charity MRC Technology to a Parkinson's disease drug in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, while MRC retains rights in all other markets. </p><p><h2>Collaboration for success</h2><p><p>There are several aspects to a collaboration that can lower the risks and increase the chances for success, Wang pointed out.</p><p><p>The first aspect is the selection of assets. Large companies are constantly reviewing their R&D pipelines, and generally prioritize them into three categories: top-tier assets, those that companies have less time to devote to, and assets whose development is halted.</p><p><p>Dr Wang primarily focuses on candidates in the second category, citing a shortened development time and lowered risks. In addition, the projects should have overseas market potential, as the market size could be much bigger, he added.</p><p><p>Through joint development, Yabao contributes funds and human resources, and the partners will help design and supervise work to ensure high quality, he noted. "Yabao serves as an extension for companies so they can further pursue the candidates [they have less time to concentrate on]."</p><p><p>Although no financial details of the deals are being disclosed, the upfront and milestone payments are either none or few, Wang disclosed. "With less cost, Yabao obtains the rights to high-quality and low risk projects."</p><p><h2>Cost-effective virtual development</h2><p><p>The second key aspect of Yabao's deal-making is close ties with partners. In some of the deals, Yabao requires a certain percentage of international market royalties, which is a key to tie each partner together, he emphasized.</p><p><p>"The more each partner gets involved, the easier it becomes to achieve a thing," he continued. "I put more emphasis on the success [of a project] than the amount it brings."</p><p><p>Yabao has plans to develop the assets inside China quickly, via a virtual and open collaboration platform, and then out-license upon reaching the late or commercial stage. Having worked at a major CRO himself, Dr Wang aims to develop the compounds like a virtual company. The core is to having a team with plenty of local experience.</p><p><p>"The team is not relying on returnees, but people who know how to manage projects in China, the people with varied knowledge in all aspects."</p><p><p>When needed, experts will be contracted to provide advice, making it more cost-effective. In comparison, overseas development costs can be much larger: nearly $10m for preclinical and $50m for investigative new drugs.</p><p><p>In China though, the regulatory process is lengthy. To accelerate the process, the alliance plan could include conducting early stage studies in Australia or in the US, he said.</p><p><p>Being a listed company, Yabao also provides strong financial support and compliance that multinationals recognize, which has helped bankroll the recent series of deals, Dr Wang pointed out, adding that a strong balance sheet and marketing capability attracted Lilly, which was eyeing product co-promotion in China.</p><p><p>Developing projects in China to international standards is another area of focus of Yabao. For overseas academic institutions, they are looking to maximize the value of their compounds to meet unmet needs, so Dr Wang sees his track record in R&D as helping to ink the deals.</p><p><p>Yabao is not alone in seeking new partners however. As the Chinese government is encouraging innovation with original intellectual property, Dr Wang observed that "more and more domestic companies are searching for new projects."</p><p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
