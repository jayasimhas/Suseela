<p>Purdue Pharma will diversify its pain-focused portfolio by paying up to $213m plus royalties for the right to develop and commercialize VM Pharma's selective tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) inhibitor VM-902A and associated compounds.</p><p>The deal, which includes an undisclosed upfront payment, will give Purdue a foothold in the pain therapy market beyond opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The company, which is best known for its controversial chronic pain drug OxyContin (oxycodone), said VM-902A represents "a new and attractive therapeutic approach to address pain symptoms." </p><p>Fremont, California-based VM Pharma was spun out of VM Discovery Inc. to develop allosteric kinase inhibitors for pain, cancer and other diseases with another spinout called VM Oncology taking the lead on cancer drug candidates. </p><p>VM Pharma has treated 72 people with VM-902A in Phase I single- and multiple-ascending dose clinical trials. And Purdue Pharma isn't standing still with VM-902A &ndash; the private company plans to begin enrolling patients in a Phase II trial in early 2016.</p><p>The transaction with VM Pharma was the second deal that Purdue announced in slightly more than a week. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company said on Aug. 31 that it will share in the development of Eisai Inc.'s dual orexin receptor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Eisai-Purdue-Join-Up-To-Take-Insomnia-Drug-Into-Phase-III-360209" target="_new">lemborexant for insomnia</a> and potentially other indications. </p><p>Until its recent dealmaking to diversify its pipeline of drug candidates, Purdue was in the news for winning US FDA approval for OxyContin &ndash; a highly addictive opioid used to treat extreme chronic pain &ndash; for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/OxyContin-Opens-Door-For-Broader-Peds-Opioids-Market-359950" target="_new">children and adolescents</a> between the ages of 11 and 16.</p><p>However, Purdue decided in June to take more time analyzing its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Purdue-More-OxyContin-analyses-needed-before-FDA-advisory-review-359201" target="_new">extended-release formulation of OxyContin</a> before pursuing endorsements from FDA advisory committees.</p><p><p><p><p>
