<p>The European Medicines Agency says it expects to name its new executive director on Oct. 1 at an extraordinary meeting of its management board. The successful applicant will be selected from a shortlist of candidates drawn up by the European Commission.</p><p>The post has been vacant since Guido Rasi was forced to step down in November 2014 after the EU's civil service tribunal annulled, on purely procedural grounds, the commission's 2011 decision establishing the shortlist.</p><p>This meant that the decision by the EMA board to select Rasi from the shortlist and appoint him director general in October 2011 was also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/EMA-head-forced-to-step-down-355062" target="_new">annulled</a>. The post has been filled in the interim by deputy executive director Andreas Pott, with Rasi having been given the new position of principal adviser in charge of strategy at the agency.</p><p>While the commission is giving nothing away as to who has been shortlisted this time, it's not out of the question that Rasi might be on the list. The EMA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/EMA-Rasi-can-apply-to-get-his-job-back-355438" target="_new">said in December</a> that the tribunal's ruling concerned a "procedural formality" and did not reflect in any way on Rasi's competence to run the agency, and that he would be able to apply for his job back.</p><p>At the Oct. 1 management board meeting, the names of the candidates will be announced and they will then be interviewed by the board. After discussing the interviews, the board will vote and the successful candidate's name will be announced (although in certain circumstances the board may require more time to fully consider the information presented and can postpone its vote to a subsequent meeting). </p><p>He or she will then be invited to appear before the European Parliament on Oct. 13 to make a statement and answer questions from MEPs. Following this hearing, if all goes according to plan, the new executive director will be appointed.</p>
