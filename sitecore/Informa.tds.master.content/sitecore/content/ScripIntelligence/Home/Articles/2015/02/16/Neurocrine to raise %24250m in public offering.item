<p> Neurocrine Biosciences is planning to raise $250m through a public offering of 6.9 million shares, in order to fund its R&amp;D operations and expected commercialization efforts for lead drug NBI-98854. </p> <p> The San Diego-based firm has priced its stock at $36 per share; the offering is expected to close on or around 24 February 2015. </p> <p> Neurocrine has one product in Phase III of which it is leading development: NBI-98854 is being tested as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia &ndash; a condition often caused by antipsychotic drugs. Patients with TD experience involuntary sudden jerky or slow twisting movements of the face and/or body. The condition can occasionally occur in people who have never been treated with antipsychotic medication. </p> <p> NBI-98854 received a breakthrough therapy designation from the US FDA in October 2014, based on results of the Phase IIb Kinect and Kinect 2 studies. Meanwhile, analysts at BioMedTracker have given the product a 55% likelihood of approval rating &ndash; 3% above the average rating for a product at the same stage of development. </p> <p> Top-line Phase III data for the product are expected in the second half of 2015, and Neurocrine plans to file a new drug application with the FDA in 2016. </p> <p> Data from the Phase IIb Kinect study of NBI-98854 in 80 patients showed that the drug administered at a dose of 50mg once daily for up to 12 weeks was associated with a statistically significant reduction in TD severity. Neurocrine also noted that TD patients with underlying schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder appeared to tolerate the study drug well. </p> <p> The trial saw no treatment-related serious adverse events and no evidence for emergent parkinsonism, akathisia or suicidal ideation. There were no clinical hematology, chemistry or ECG safety signals. </p> <p> There is currently no approved treatment for tardive dyskinesia and only one other drug is in the clinic for the movement disorder &ndash; Synchroneuron's Phase I candidate SNC-102 &ndash; which targets the NMDA glutamate receptors and GABA receptors. </p> <h2> R&amp;D cash boost </h2> <p> Neurocrine said as well as preparing for commercialization activities, it would use the cash raised in this financing for R&amp;D operations. Other programs in its pipeline include: </p> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Product </b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Indication</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Development stage</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> NBI-98854 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> tardive dyskinesia </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Elagolix (partnered with AbbVie) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> endometriosis </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase III </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Elagolix (partnered with AbbVie) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> uterine fibroids </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase IIb </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Urocortin 2 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> acute decompensated heart failure </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> NBI-77860 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> PTSD </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> NBI-77860 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> congenital adrenal hyperplasia&nbsp; </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase I/II </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> NBI-98854 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> tourette's syndrome </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Phase I </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> NBI-77860 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> alcohol dependence </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> investigator initiated </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> </table> <p> <p> The firm last raised large capital in February 2014, when it made $142m in an offering of 8 million shares of common stock, priced at $17.75 per share (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Aegerion-Questcor-Depomed-4Q-updates-Neurocrine-offering-350280" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 February 2014</a>). </p> <p> Over the past 12 months Neurocrine has seen its stock maintain a steady rise &ndash; up more than 100% from February 2014. </p>
