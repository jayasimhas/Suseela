<p> If there's one area of pharmaceutical R&amp;D guaranteed to stay in the spotlight over the next few years it's immuno-oncology &ndash; this is one of the most promising and quickest-growing areas of cancer research, as well as one of the most active areas for licensing deals and acquisitions. </p> <p> But the field is complex and fast-moving, making it tricky for a non-specialist to get a handle on it. What is the difference, for example, between a checkpoint inhibitor and an adoptive T-cell therapy? What ever happened to cancer vaccines? And which areas are thought to be most promising? To help answer these and other pertinent questions, <i>Scrip</i> has teamed up with colleagues from Datamonitor Healthcare and Sagient's BioMedTracker to bring a handy overview of the field for those readers without advanced degrees in cancer immunology. </p> <p> <b>Why is everyone so excited about immuno-oncology?</b> </p> <p> Mainly because it is a new approach to cancer therapy that looks like it has the potential to make huge improvements to treatment outcomes across a range of cancers, including common threats like melanoma, lung and breast cancer, as well as hematological cancers. The pioneering IO product Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab) became the first to improve survival in metastatic melanoma patients in over 30 years when it was launched in 2011, and the benefits seen in its pivotal trial were long lasting. Not only did the drug attack the tumors but it looked like it could prevent them from recurring, generating hopes of cures among oncologists. Since then, the launch of other promising IO-based products like Merck &amp; Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and BMS/Ono's Opdivo (nivolumab) and positive clinical data from a range of other candidates has added to the optimism, and brought with it a vast amount of investment capital to the field. </p> <p> <p> <b>But what is immuno-oncology exactly?</b> </p> <p> Simply put, IO is the branch of medicine focused on the development of therapies to improve the body's immune response against cancer. The immune system can normally detect and destroy abnormal cells like cancer, but when this fails and a rogue cell manages to develop into clinical disease, the growing tumor finds a variety of ways to subvert this process. What IO aims to do is to counteract these mechanisms and tip the balance back in favour of the immune system. </p> <p> This is a departure from the slash-and-burn approach of traditional chemotherapy as well as from the more modern targeted cancer therapies that seek to prevent cancer cell growth by blocking the signals that tell the cells to divide, or by blocking a tumor's ability to induce angiogenesis or invade tissues. IO widens the focus of cancer treatment from the tumor cell to the microenvironment in which the cancer cell is growing within the host. And each IO product has the potential for being effective across a range of tumor types. </p> <p> <p> <b>So how does a cancer cell evade the immune system?</b> </p> <p> Broadly speaking, there are two branches of the immune system which work together to protect the body: the innate immune system (which isn't specific to a particular antigen) and the adaptive immune system (which is). And it is thought that every known innate and adaptive immune mechanism is involved in some way in tumor recognition and control. </p> <p> The innate immune system includes cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic and NK (natural killer) cells, and is the body's first line of defence. These cells play a crucial role in sparking off the adaptive immune response to produce antigen-specific T cells and B cells against a particular threat, such as a tumor cell. This is a complex process controlled via a range of signalling systems which are mediated through receptors and their ligands found on the tumor cell and immune cell surfaces &ndash; Figure 1 below shows just some of these. </p> <p> When evading the immune response, the tumor can employ a range of tactics to disrupt key components of this system within its microenvironment. It can hamper antigen-presenting mechanisms, disrupt pathways controlling T-cell inhibition and activation, recruit immunosuppressive cells and release factors to suppress immune activity. But by the same token, these processes provide myriad potential targets for the new IO therapies, which is partly what makes it such a complicated area of drug research. </p> <p> <b>Figure 1</b>: Receptors and ligands involved in cell surface-mediated molecular signalling systems that control immune response </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_diagram_249961a.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/D41E41BD3D424E7197314D2D2E4DE5F9.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_diagram_249961a.jpg"> </a> </p> <p> <i>Source: Datamonitor Healthcare</i> </p> <p> <b>What are the targets for the IO therapies?</b> </p> <p> To date, IO therapies can be divided into five broader categories, depending on how they work (see table 1): </p> <table> <h2> Table 1: Types of IO therapies and their targets </h2> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Type of immuno-oncology therapy</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Targets/cell therapy</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="4"> <p> Checkpoint inhibitors </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> CTLA-4 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> PD-1/PD-L1 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> TIM3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> LAG3 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2"> <p> Tumor-necrosis factor- receptors </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> OX40 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> CD40 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="2"> <p> Adoptive T-cell therapy </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> CAR-T cell therapy </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> TCR </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Cancer vaccines </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Dendritic cell therapy </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan="3"> <p> Other immuno-oncology targets </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> CSF1R </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> IDO </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> CEA </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <p> Source: Datamonitor Healthcare </p> </table> <p> <i>Checkpoint inhibitors</i> &ndash; Immune checkpoints are inhibitory pathways built into the immune system to prevent it from attacking the host (self-tolerance), and for modulating the duration and amplitude of a legitimate immune response to prevent collateral damage. Tumors are able co-opt these mechanisms especially against T-cells specific for tumor antigens to elude the immune response. Fortunately many checkpoints are initiated by the classic ligand-receptor interaction beloved of drug developers and can be relatively easily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of either the ligand or the receptor. Indeed the IO forerunners Yervoy, Keytruda and Opdivo all fall within this class. </p> <p> Targets here include CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4), a protein receptor that is thought to have a negative regulatory role in T-cell activation. Inhibiting CTLA-4 interferes with CTLA-4 mediated T-cell suppression to enhance the immune response against tumors. </p> <p> Bristol-Myers Squibb's CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy is already approved in melanoma and in Phase III for prostate cancer and non-small cell and small cell lung cancers. Other CTLA-4 inhibitors in development include AstraZeneca's tremelimumab at Phase II. </p> <p> But the CTLA-4 inhibitor class is expected to lose market share to the PD-1 inhibitors, with Merck &amp; Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) already approved for melanoma (and also NSCLC for Opdivo). </p> <p> Another way for tumors to evade the immune system is to up-regulate (ie produce more of) the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) which is expressed on the surface of cancer cells and which binds to the PD-1 receptor on activated T-cells (see Figure 2). The interaction of the ligand and its receptor inhibits T-cell proliferation survival and effector functions (such as cytotoxicity and cytokine release) and induces apoptosis of tumor-specific T-cells. For IO purposes, both parties to the interaction can be targeted: Opdivo and Keytruda both act on the PD-1 receptor on the T-cell surface, while investigational products including Roche's atezolizumab (RG7446) act on the ligand found on the face of the tumor cell. </p> <p> <b>Figure 2:</b> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_PD_inhibitors_di_249962a.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/78AA11AFFD124E8CADB8FBB62A5B9D36.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_PD_inhibitors_di_249962a.JPG"> </a> </p> <p> Other targets for checkpoint inhibitors include TIM3 and LAG3. TIM3, or T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3, is a molecule selectively expressed on T helper 1 cells. When it engages with its ligand, this receptor suppresses the activation on Th2 cells, so targeting it with a monoclonal antibody prevents this dampening of the immune response. </p> <p> LAG3, lymphocyte activation gene, is another cell surface molecule expressed on activated T cells, NK cells, B-cells and dendritic cells and interacts with its main ligand, the major histocompatibility complex (class II), which is thought to play a role in dendritic cell function. Antibodies against LAG3 have been shown to enhance T-cell proliferation and effector cell functions, but products here are further back in preclinical development. </p> <p> <i>Adoptive T-cell Therapies (CAR-T)</i> </p> <p> The checkpoint inhibitors may be the most advanced class, but it is the CAR-T cell therapies that have provoked most activity both in the clinic and in the boardroom over the past year or so. These products come under the broader class of adoptive T-cell therapies whereby patients are infused with modified T-cells to eliminate a tumor and prevent its recurrence. The T-cells can either be sourced from the patient (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic) and are engineered to improve their response against tumor cells </p> <p> Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technology involves engineering a patient's T-cells so that they can recognize and attack specific surface molecules in tumor cells. T-cells are extracted from the patient and a chimeric antigen receptor which recognizes a specific tumor antigen is added to the T-cell surface using a viral vector. The engineered CAR-T cells are then expanded in the laboratory to produce a population in the billions which is then infused into the patients, where the cells multiply further and kill the cancer. </p> <p> The first CAR-T therapies added just the specific cancer targeting antibody (for example against CD19), but the second and third-generation products have also included one or two intracellular co-stimulatory domains to ramp up the immune response further (see Figure 3). </p> <p> Also bi-specific or tandem CAR-Ts are being investigated that add a second antigen receptor to the cell surface which may reduce the incidence of treatment resistance. Still other candidates add in a &quot;suicide switch&quot; to allow for tuning of CAR-T levels if necessary, eg in the case of severe cytokine release syndrome. </p> <p> <b>Figure 3:</b> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_CD19_CAR-T_diagr_249963a.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/20EA62CCF3B246BE8EBA6684A088AC34.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_CD19_CAR-T_diagr_249963a.JPG"> </a> </p> <p> The most advanced of these products is Novartis's CD19-directed CTL-019 in Phase II for various blood cancers, but biotech company Juno Therapeutics has three products at the Phase I/II stage &ndash; this company completed an IPO worth $265m last year on the back of (some say over-enthusiastic) investor interest in their potential. Other players include Cellular Biomedicine and Kite Pharma which are courting attention from big pharma firms like AstraZeneca and Pfizer. </p> <p> A related approach within adoptive T-cell therapies is T-cell receptor gene therapy whereby T-cells are genetically engineered to recognize cancer-specific antigens. The alpha and beta protein genes of the T-cell receptor are optimized to improve their affinity towards a specific MHC peptide &ndash; this means that they will be better able to recognize and respond to cancer-specific antigens. Kite Pharma is the most advanced company here, with a product at Phase II for solid tumors, but Adaptimmune and Juno are also active. </p> <p> <i>Tumor Necrosis Factor agonists</i> </p> <p> Tumor necrosis factor (or TNF) is a well-known and highly successful target in rheumatology, with neutralizing antibodies or receptor fusion proteins against TNF-alfa being among industry's top-sellers, but as its name suggests, the broader TNF superfamily of receptors and ligands plays a wide role in a range of biological processes against cancer. These functions range from the induction of cell death, to the production of co-stimulatory signals that help mount an effective immune response. Some of these TNF receptor/TNF ligand pairs have gained prominence as possible targets in cancer immunotherapy, including CD40L/CD40 and OX40L/OX40. </p> <p> The CD40 (cluster of differentiation 40) TNF receptor is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells such as B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells and also on tumor cells in B-cell malignancies and solid tumors including lung, breast and colon. It interacts with the ligand CD40L which is express on the surface of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells leading to the proliferation of B cells and the generation of memory B cells. The most advanced candidate in this class is Novartis's lucatumumab in Phase I/II for lymphomas. </p> <p> OX40 is a TNF receptor expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that transmits a potent costimulatory signal when bound to its ligand to enhance T-cell functions such as cytokine production, expansion and survival. AstraZeneca's MEDI6469 in Phase I/II for prostate cancer and other solid tumors appears the most advanced of these in development. </p> <p> <i>Cancer vaccines</i> </p> <p> Back in 2010 Dendreon's Provenge (sipuleucel-T) hit the headlines when it became the first approved cancer vaccine but despite its therapeutic efficacy its subsequent commercial failure has cast a cloud over this area which has only thickened with the series of late-stage failures of other candidates such as Stimuvax (Merck KGaA/Oncothyreon's tecemotide), Vical's Allovectin (velimogene aliplasmid) and GlaxoSmithKline's MAGE-A3. </p> <p> Cancer vaccines are designed to treat cancer by strengthening the immune response to the tumor cells. They introduce tumor antigens into the body which activates B-cells and T-cells to recognise and act against specific types of cancer cell &ndash; the idea being that cancer vaccines will help the immune system overcome the mechanisms the tumor cells use to subvert it. Provenge is a dendritic cell therapy, a system of antigen-presenting cells in the innate immune system that bridge to the adaptive immune system co-ordinating the two responses. </p> <p> But the class is by no means dead: a whole raft of dendritic cell therapy vaccines are still in development by companies including Argos Therapeutics and Northwest Biotherapeutics and experts say the class's fortunes may be reversed by their use in combination with other IO therapies, in particular the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, by blocking a major evasion mechanism to allow an enhanced vaccine response. </p> <p> <i>Other targets</i> </p> <p> A number of other approaches to IO are being tried. They include inhibitors of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) pathways that drive the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the tumor environment. An increased density of TAMs around the tumor is associated with a poor prognosis in common cancers like breast, prostate and ovarian. </p> <p> IDO inhibitors block the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of tryptophan &ndash; tryptophan is needed by T-cells undergoing antigen-dependent activation. And CEA inhibitors stop the action of the carcinoembryonic antigen family involved in an apoptotic pathway, the overexpression of which can enhance metastatic seeding, and which is involved in T-cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity. </p> <p> There are candidates at the Phase II stage for each of these IO classes, and generally they are expected to form part of combination therapies. </p> <p> <p> <b>You weren't joking when you said there were lots of potential targets. But which are the most promising?</b> </p> <p> There are more than 60 companies currently developing IO therapies across these drug classes, according to Sagient's BioMedTracker, with around 80 candidates in the clinic. </p> <p> At the moment, the most popular class in this field in terms of number of potential products in R&amp;D is the CAR-T cell therapies followed by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and then dendritic cell therapies. The other candidates are spread thinly among the rest of the potential classes (see Figure 4). </p> <p> <b>Figure 4:</b> </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_No_of_products_i_249964a.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="-/media/A1EA00BE60084947BDEB89FF517820EB.ashx"></a><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00249/IO_No_of_products_i_249964a.JPG"> </a> </p> <p> But popular isn't the same as lucrative. In terms of financial performance, the anti-PD-1/PD-L1s are predicted to be the most commercially successful class. Not only are they expected to expand their range of indications beyond melanoma and NSCLC to a wide variety of cancers, they are also expected to form the backbone of most future IO drug combinations. Thanks to their efficacy and relatively manageable toxicity they are deemed an excellent choice to pair with other IO drugs as well as other targeted cancer therapies. Furthermore, as mentioned, they are seen as the potential saviours of the cancer vaccine class. </p> <p> <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/OpdivoYervoy-combo-could-be-new-standard-in-melanoma-357968" target="_new">Recent clinical data</a> looking at the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo and the CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy achieved excellent results and this combination is likely to be the first PD-1 inhibitor based IO combination to reach the market, though by no means the last. As a class the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are being tested with TNFRs, adoptive T-cell therapies, cancer vaccines and other types of IO therapies, although the jury is still out on which particular combination will prove most effective. </p> <p> By contrast, despite response rates hovering around the 90% mark for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia for the leading CD19 targeted CAR-T treatments from Novartis, Juno and Kite, the promise of the CAR-T therapies could be hampered by technical issues. Early CAR-T therapy adoption will be driven by the academic centers that have conducted the CAR-T trials and other specialist centres. Hospitals without the laboratory facilities to deal with cryopreserved cells and experience in treating blood cancer patients are unlikely to rush to adopt these therapies, especially in the early days post-approval. </p> <p> <p> <b>Enough of the science. Can we talk money now?</b> </p> <p> Certainly. While it is too early to make sensible sales predictions for the earlier candidates, the more advanced products are expected easily to pull in multi-blockbusting sales by 2023 (see Table 2): </p> <table> <h2> Table 2: Estimated worldwide sales of leading IO products in 2023 </h2> <tr> <td> <p> <b>Drug</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Company </b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>Class </b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> <b>W/W sales 2023E ($M)</b> </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Yervoy (ipilumumab) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Bristol-Myers Squibb </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> CTLA-4 inhibitor </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 1,871 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Opdivo (nivolumab) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Bristol-Myers Squibb/Ono </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> PD-1 inhibitor </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 4,714 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> Keytruda (pembrolizumab) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Merck &amp; Co </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> PD-1 inhibitor </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 3,132 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> MEDI-4736 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> AstraZeneca </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> PD-L1 inhibitor </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 1,499 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p> atezolizumab (RG7446) </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> Roche </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> PD-L1 inhibitor </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> <td> <p> 2,498 </p> <p> &nbsp; </p> </td> </tr> <p> Source: Datamonitor Healthcare </p> </table> <p> <p> Deal-making activity has been brisk.
