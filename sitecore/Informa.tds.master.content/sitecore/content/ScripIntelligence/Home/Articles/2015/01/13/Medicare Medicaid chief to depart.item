<p>Marilyn Tavenner, the embattled administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), has handed in her resignation and plans to depart her job by the end of next month, she revealed on 16 January in a memo to her staff.</p><p>Ms Tavenner was appointed in 2013 to the top CMS job after serving as acting chief for two years, after Republicans refused to confirm President Barack Obama's choice to lead the agency, Dr Donald Berwick, who stepped down in December 2011 from his recess-appointment as the CMS administrator (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Berwick-steps-down-as-CMS-chief-Obama-taps-agencys-deputy-as-new-leader-324014" target="_new">24 November 2011</a>).</p><p>While Republicans warmly embraced Ms Tavenner &ndash; granting her an easy confirmation in May 2013 &ndash; it was downhill from then on, with one entanglement after another involving the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Few-bumps-to-confirmation-for-new-Medicare-chief-343295" target="_new">16 May 2013</a>).</p><p>Indeed, Ms Tavenner was grilled in several hearings over the botched launch of the ACA's online marketplace, known as HealthCare.gov &ndash; with almost daily calls by lawmakers in fall 2013 for the CMS chief to step down (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shutdown-drama-exchange-trauma-Obama-said-thered-be-days-like-this-346988" target="_new">2 October 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lawmakers-fury-shifts-from-ACA-website-debacle-to-dropped-policies-347712" target="_new">30 October 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Apologies-rhetoric-shifts-and-some-hyperventilating-Another-ACA-hearing-347741" target="_new">31 October 2013</a>).</p><p>But Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell defended Ms Tavenner, insisting she will be remembered for her leadership in opening the ACA health insurance marketplace.</p><p>"In so doing, she worked day and night so that millions of Americans could finally obtain the security and peace of mind of quality health insurance at a price they could afford," Ms Burwell said in a statement. "It's a measure of her tenacity and dedication that after the tough initial rollout of HealthCare.gov, she helped right the ship, bringing aboard a systems integrator and overseeing an overhaul of the website."</p><p>This article may also be read at US Capitol Capsule <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
