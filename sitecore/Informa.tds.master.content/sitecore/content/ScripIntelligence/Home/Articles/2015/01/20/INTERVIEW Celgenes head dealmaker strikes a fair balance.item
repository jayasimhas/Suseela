<p>Celgene is known among biotechnology firms for being a disciplined buyer and an ideal collaborator &ndash; a reputation in which the company's head dealmaker George Golumbeski takes a lot of pride.</p><p>"More than any other company I know of, we are willing to build a deal structure that accommodates [our partners'] needs and expectations and our needs and expectations," Dr Golumbeski, Celgene's senior vice president of business development, said in a recent interview with <i>Scrip</i> during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference this month in San Francisco.</p><p>The JP Morgan meeting began as a venue for health care investors to meet with executives from companies in which they've invested huge sums of money, but it also has become the first big event each year where biotech and pharmaceutical companies can catch up with existing partners or strike deals with new collaborators. Dr Golumbeski said his JP Morgan schedule gets more crowded each year.</p><p>But business development has been crucial to Celgene's success and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future. Four of the big biotech company's seven marketed products came from external sources and Celgene is likely to continue sourcing more than 50% of its drug candidates from outside of the company in the future.</p><p><b>External R&D</b></p><p>"It's a strategy of distributed research and development. We collaborate with as many high-quality companies as we can," Dr Golumbeski said.</p><p>Celgene chairman and CEO Robert Hugin previewed the company's 2014 financial performance and 2015 forecast, and outlined financial targets for 2017 and 2020 during his presentation at the JP Morgan conference. Celgene's product sales are expected to total $7.56bn in 2014, which is 19% higher than in 2013; $9bn to $9.5bn in 2015, a 22.3% increase from 2014 at the mid-point; $13bn to $14bn in 2017; and more than $20bn by 2020.</p><p>The company's long-term guidance, including $14.8bn in hematology product sales in 2020, takes into consideration programs from external collaborations that have shown human proof of concept. </p><p>Recent examples are the Agios Pharmaceuticals cancer drug AG-221 and Acceleron Pharma's luspatercept and sotatercept for patients with beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, which posted positive clinical trial results at the 56th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celgene-Agios-extend-collaboration-as-AG-221-impresses-at-ASH-2014-355512" target="_new">9 December</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ASH-2014-Acceleron-drugs-improve-anemia-in-blood-disorders-355510" target="_new">9 December 2014</a>).</p><p>Dr Golumbeski is adamant that no company, including Celgene, can ever have too many assets in their pipeline, so there's always capacity to do deals that make scientific sense.</p><p>"We have said very explicitly that we've built a portfolio and we don't expect everything to work," he said. "Even if we looked at 2020 and said we had enough [in the pipeline], what about 2025?"</p><p>Still, deals have to be based on good science executed by partners that are excited about moving promising programs forward with financial terms that are reasonable for both sides. That's where Celgene's reputation as a disciplined, but creative partner comes in handy. </p><p><b>Creative dealmaking</b></p><p>The company negotiates standard license agreements with upfront, milestone and royalty payments as well as traditional acquisitions. However, Celgene's also been known to buy equity in a biotech partner and negotiate an option to buy a company or asset when a program hits a specific development milestone &ndash; all depending on its partners' and its own needs. </p><p>The price has to be right too; Celgene's declined to execute a few recent deals, because competitors were willing to offer more money than the company could justify paying.</p><p>Dr Golumbeski said Celgene doesn't necessarily prefer collaborations over acquisitions, but often a licensing deal or option agreement makes the most sense for everybody involved.</p><p>"If you go back to Agios, it was a two-year-old company and it had no molecule yet, so for us and for them it didn't make sense for us to buy them," he said. "We wouldn't be able to give them enough value to satisfy their investors and we wouldn't be able to drive value for the program that they have 20 people dedicated to work on." </p><p>Celgene negotiated an option to license drugs discovered by Agios after the smaller biotech company completes Phase I development under a 2010 collaboration agreement focused on cancer metabolism that the partners recently extended through 2016 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Celgene-and-Agios-to-target-cancer-metabolism-in-250-million-deal-245497" target="_new">16 April 2010</a>). To date, Celgene has licensed AG-221 and AG-120 under that agreement.</p><p>Celgene tends to reserve its acquisition dealmaking for late-stage or marketed products, such as the company's 2010 acquisition of Abraxis Bioscience for $2.9bn (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-to-acquire-Abraxis-Bioscience-for-2.9-billion-up-front-298709" target="_new">30 June 2010</a>). The deal gave Celgene the cancer drug Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel), which produced an estimated $848m in 2014 sales and is expected to generate $1.5bn to $2bn in sales by 2020.</p><p>Dr Golumbeski said it's necessary to be flexible in negotiating deal terms for attractive early-stage assets, whose value is harder to determine, but in reality most transactions are just a variation on a standard licensing or acquisition structures.</p><p>"It's important to innovate on deal structures to be competitive," he said. "For me and my partner, [president of Celgene Early Research and Development] Dr Tom Daniel, both of us have run small biotechs. We know that for a small company CEO if somebody won't give you a new wrinkle on a deal structure there is someone else who will."</p><p>Celgene's second drug discovery agreement with Forma Therapeutics was particularly creative. The deal gave Forma $225m up front for the first partnership under the agreement and up to $375m in upfront fees for two more partnerships. Celgene has an option to acquire the company if all three partnerships are executed (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-in-1-deal-Forma-grabs-225m-from-Celgene-350995" target="_new">2 April 2014</a>).</p><p><b>A deal laboratory?</b></p><p>"I wish we had a deal laboratory where we came up with new structures," Dr Golumbeski said. "In reality, we bend a structure because of something a partner needs, but we have to run it by [the legal department]."</p><p>Celgene's 13-member, including Dr Golumbeski, business development team recruits two-third of its dealmakers from within the company &ndash; young, high-potential individuals who are selected to go through business development training that acquaints them with all of Celgene's departments (legal, R&D, regulatory affairs, etc.). The other third are interns recruited from masters of business administration (MBA) college degree programs.</p><p>"We have my experience partnered with the drive of young, talented people," said Dr Golumbeski, who inherited Celgene's business development training program when he began working for the company six years ago. "I was skeptical when I came in, but it's been a key to our success."</p><p>Looking ahead, he's optimistic about Celgene's capabilities and the business development team's chances for successful dealmaking in 2015, because the quantity and quality of potential scientific collaborations is high.</p><p><p><p><p>
