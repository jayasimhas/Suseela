<p><p>After making a headlong dive into cystic fibrosis in recent years, Vertex Pharmaceuticals is adding to its position in the space with an $80m investment in an early-stage North Carolina biotech. </p><p>The big biotech announced 04 June that it is paying $80m upfront, as well as $490m in development and commercial milestones and tiered royalties to Parion Sciences for the worldwide development and commercialization rights to the smaller company's epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors. </p><p>The deal includes P-1037, a Phase IIa drug for cystic fibrosis regardless of genotype, and P-1055. The pair intends to test P-1037 in combination with Vertex's lumacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in patients with the F908del mutation. </p><p>Parion has the potential to receive an additional $370m in development and regulatory milestones if Vertex chooses to develop either of the drugs in non-CF indications. The biotech is also eligible for another $230m in milestone payments should Vertex decide to opt into any of Parion's other ENaC inhibitors. </p><p>Vertex told investors during its fourth quarter call in January that 2015 will be a transition year for its cystic fibrosis franchise. The last three years have been rocky for Vertex as it shifted gears from a flailing hepatitis C franchise to garnering its first FDA approval in CF with Kalydeco. After being somewhat of a Wall Street darling, Vertex had to do a somewhat abrupt about-face after its blockbuster hepatitis C drug became completely irrelevant with the advent of Gilead's clinical cure for the disease. The company has been working to add to sales of Kalydeco by increasing the number of approved indications &ndash; each time showing the drug, or a combination with the drug, is effective for patients with a certain genetic mutation. Sales of Kalydeco are expected to top $560m this year. </p><p>Only 2,200 patients worldwide were eligible to use Kalydeco when it was initially approved in 2012, but that number increased to 3,100 patients by the end of 2014. </p><p>The bigger patient opportunity is from the 28,000 patients worldwide that have some form of the F508del mutation. Vertex is hoping to capture some of that population with the combination of Kalydeco and lumicaftor (formerly VX-809), which was submitted for approval in the U.S. and EU in November. The combo product has a PDUFA date of 05 July in the U.S. and approval is expected in the fourth quarter in the EU. The US approval is expected to add 8,500 patients. </p><p><p>
