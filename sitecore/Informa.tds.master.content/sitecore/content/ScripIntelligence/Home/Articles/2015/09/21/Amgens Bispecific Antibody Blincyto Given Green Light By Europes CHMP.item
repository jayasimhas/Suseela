<p><p><p>Nine months after gaining US approval, Amgen Inc.'s bispecific antibody <i>Blincyto</i> (blinatumomab) has received a positive opinion from Europe's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (AML). </p><p>Blincyto was one of two anticancer products from Amgen granted positive opinions by the European Medicine Agency's top scientific advisory panel Sept. 25; <i>Kyprolis</i> (carfilzomib) was also cleared for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Final European approval for the two drugs is expected over the next two to three months.</p><p>Blincyto was recommended under the EU's conditional approval procedure that allows early patient access for medicines that fulfill unmet medical needs, usually when a disease is rare. In the top-five largest EU countries, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, there are around 600 patients with Ph-relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. Blinatumomab was granted orphan drug status in 2009.</p><p>A conditional approval is converted into a standard approval once post-licensing commitments are fulfilled, usually the collection of additional clinical data.</p><p>Blincyto is a modified antibody that binds both to CD19 antigens on the surface of B-cells and CD3 antigens on the surface of T-cells, thereby bringing into close proximity immune cells and cancer cells - Amgen acquired the bispecific T-cell engager (<i>BiTE</i>) technology used in Blincyto from Micromet Inc. when it bought the company for $1.16bn in January 2012. Blincyto is believed to be the first bispecific antibody to reach the market. </p><p>The cancer therapy was recommended for conditional marketing approval on the basis of the open-label single-arm Phase II Study '211, involving 189 patients, and the open-label, multicenter dose-escalation Phase II Study '206, in 36 patients.</p><p>The CHMP said blinatumomab increased the proportion of patients who have complete remission and molecular remission within the first two treatment cycles. These effects are associated with better relapse-free survival and overall survival rates, the committee added. And patients who receive stem cell transplants during the period of complete response or molecular response have a higher chance of reaching a cure.</p><p>Side effects of the product noted by the CHMP include infusion-related reactions, pyrexia, headache, febrile neutropenia, peripheral edema, nausea, hypokalemia, constipation, anemia, diarrhea, tremor, fatigue and chills. </p><h2>Accelerated Approval In The US</h2><p>Blinatumomab was granted accelerated approval by FDA on Dec. 3, 2014, only three months after the marketing application was submitted. The US label has a boxed warning about patients developing cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicity. </p><p>The post-approval commitments in Europe have not been disclosed but as part of the accelerated approval process in the US, Amgen agreed to conduct a Phase III confirmatory trial with the primary endpoint of overall survival.</p><p><p><i>This article is also being published in "The Pink Sheet" DAILY.
