<h2>COMPANY SPECIFIC</h2><p>*Celgene executives were grilled by analysts on 14 July about why the company is paying $7.2bn for San Diego-based <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-diversifies-with-7.2bn-Receptos-buy-359431" target="_new">Receptos</a>, which has a potentially best-in-class sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator in Phase III development for relapsing multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis that could generate $4b to $6bn in peak annual sales in those two indications alone. Analysts on Celgene's 23 July earnings conference call will try to extract more details about the company's plans for ozanimod and they may inquire about Celgene's never-ending buying and licensing spree. An end to the company's prolific dealmaking seems to be nowhere in sight.</p><p>*There probably is a 100% chance that Gilead Sciences executives will be asked when the company will spend its massive and rapidly growing cash stockpile to license new assets or acquire companies. Foster City, California-based Gilead had $14.5bn in cash and securities on its balance sheet as of 31 March versus $11.7bn a year earlier. Investors want to know how Gilead will reinvest the billions of dollars that it is earning from the hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) after agreeing to buy <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-completes-Pharmasset-tender-offer-325805" target="_new">Pharmasset</a> for $11bn. They'll also want to make sure that Sovaldi and Harvoni sales, which totaled $4.6bn during the first quarter, continued to rise in the second quarter despite payer price pressures.</p><p>*Analysts and investors likely were preparing to push Hospira during its 29 July earnings call about the status of the US biosimilar 351(k) application for CTP13, also known as Remsima, filed by the company's partner, Korea-based Celltrion. But now they won't get that chance because Hospira revealed on 15 July that because of its pending merger with Pfizer, it won't be holding a call when it releases its second-quarter earnings. The FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee was set to review the application for CTP13, which is an infliximab biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson's Remicade, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-FDA-adcomm-be-lucky-for-Celltrion-infliximab-biosimilar-356630" target="_new">in March</a>. But the agency on 25 February postponed the meeting "due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application." The FDA reportedly has asked for more details on Celltrion's statistical analysis data and wants more information about the microbial sampling, amino acid composition and oligosaccharide analysis methods used during CTP13's manufacturing process. J&J has tried to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-seeks-to-block-Celltrions-infliximab-biosimilar-357239" target="_new">block</a> CTP13 from coming to the US market, if the FDA approves the biosimilar application.</p><p>*Expect Sanofi to talk about the approval (or potential rejection) of its PCSK9 inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Praluent</a> (alirocumab) during its 30 July earnings call. The drug is slated to face an approval decision from the FDA by 24 July and investors will be keen to hear about potential launch plans for the cholesterol drug. </p><p>*Similarly, Amgen, which is also due to report earnings on 30 July, will be grilled on launch plans for its rival PCSK9 inhibitor <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Repatha</a> (evolocumab) following the FDA's decision on Praluent. Repatha's PDUFA target action date is 27 August.</p><p>* Biogen's 24 July earnings call will likely include an update on the big biotech's Alzheimer's disease candidate BIIB037. Data for the 6mg dose cohort will be presented two days earlier at a medical meeting on 22 July &ndash; expect investors to have questions about the data and its impact on the overall program. </p><p>*Analysts are expecting Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries to beat consensus estimates on 30 July because of strong overall growth in the generics sector. Goldman Sachs is predicting generic sales will be up 0.8% in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year. EPS is expected to be $1.33 for the quarter, up from $1.23 in the second quarter of 2014. However, this may be tainted as Teva is currently experiencing loss of patent protection for its lead, branded product Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection) in several regions. Earlier this quarter the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated the last remaining patent on the 20mg once-daily dosage of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug. A stronger impact from this court decision is not anticipated until 3Q 2015. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted, however, that the company has been preparing for an influx of Copaxone generics. Teva has successfully converted approximately 70% of patients from the 20mg formulation of the drug over to the 40mg dose of the product &ndash; and it is unclear when generic versions of that will be available. But those patients still on the 20mg version have other options arriving. Sandoz and Momenta gained US approval in April of the first generic form of the 20mg once-daily dosage of Copaxone, which is being sold as Glatopa. They've priced the drug at $173.13 per injection, or $63,000 annually, which analysts noted is only a 3% discount to Copaxone 20mg daily, but is a 15% discount to the 40mg three times per week dosage. Mylan and Natco also are pursuing copycats of Copaxone.</p><p>* Investors will be on the lookout for indications that Novo Nordisk's first obesity offering, Saxenda (liraglutide 3 mg), really can shake up the listless obesity market and bring in more than a block-busting $1bn in revenues for the firm. Saxenda hit the US market in April and is touted as a brand new revenue stream and an important milestone for the company. Novo will share its first six months results on 6 August and its second quarter results the following day. </p><p>* We can expect to see continued growth of <b>Shire</b>'s ADHD franchise, with Vyvanse and its new binge-eating disorder indication offsetting decline of older products Adderall and Intuniv. Shire generally is looking in good shape, with Fleming Ornskov ensuring the company looks like a successful standalone enterprise after the collapse of the planned AbbVie acquisition last year. </p><p>* <b>AstraZeneca</b> is expected to continue to report significant sales' decline with Nexium in the US the key drag. The pharma major has had a challenging Q2 which saw the departure of two key executives: Briggs Morrison (CMO and head of late-stage drug development) and James Ward-Lilley (head of its respiratory, inflammation and autoimmunity product and portfolio strategy). In addition, partner Amgen pulled out of development of the anti-inflammatory brodalumab putting its future in doubt, and the UK's HTA NICE expressed concerns over the cost-effectiveness of the novel PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib). More worryingly, CEO Pascal Soriot's vision of $43bn in sales by 2023 seems even more fantastical than when he first revealed it during his defense against Pfizer's takeover attempt last year. A <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-pharma-to-add-60bn-in-sales-by-2024-359453" target="_new">recent industry report</a> suggested a $25bn sales forecast was much more realistic.</p><h2>INDUSTRY</h2><p>*Consolidation! The industry has continued to consolidate over the past year so there is likely to be talk of further M&A. This topic will be especially relevant when Allergan &ndash; the former Actavis &ndash; reports its first quarter as the new company on 6 August.</p><p>* Biosimilar competition for TNF inhibitors is out of the blocks with the launch in Europe of biosimilar infliximab, Johnson & Johnson/Merck & Co 's Remicade being the original product that lost patent protection in Europe in February 2015. Second-quarter reporting will give an early indication of the impact of biosimilars, not just on J&J/Merck & Co, but also on other companies that market anti-TNF biologics, including AbbVie with the world's top-selling drug Humira (adalimumab), Pfizer/Amgen/Takeda with Enbrel (etanercept) and UCB with Cimzia (certolizumab pegol).</p><h2>MACRO</h2><p>The strong dollar whacked nearly eight percentage points off Johnson & Johnson's reported revenues in the second quarter. Expect other companies that report in dollars, incur costs in the US and reap significant revenues outside the US to experience similar pain in their year-on-year second-quarter comparisons. In contrast, EU firms reporting in euros with a major revenue base in the US will likely report a boost to second-quarter sales.</p><h2>INDIA</h2><p>Compliance issues and progress made therein are likely to be keenly watched as Indian pharmaceutical firms head into Q1 FY16 results season. The US FDA has, over the recent past, raised GMP compliance concerns of varying degree at firms such as Wockhardt, Ipca, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy's Laboratories. In addition to ANDA approvals, all eyes will also be on domestic sales momentum despite continuing headwinds from India's price cap policy.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
