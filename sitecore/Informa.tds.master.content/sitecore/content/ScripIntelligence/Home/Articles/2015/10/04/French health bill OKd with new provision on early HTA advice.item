<p>The lower house of the French parliament has approved the bill on the reform of the healthcare system, which among other things will introduce new provisions on dealing with drug shortages and bring French legislation into line with the new EU clinical trials legislation.</p><p>MPs introduced a number of new articles, including one that would bring companies together with the health technology assessment (HTA) body, the HAS, at an earlier stage of innovative product development. </p><p>Under a new Article 37b, the HAS would be able to organize "early consultations at the request of companies developing innovative pharmaceutical products with a new mechanism of action and for an insufficiently covered medical need". This, the article says, would happen before the start of clinical trials.</p><p>The bill already contained a couple of provisions regarding the HAS that would allow it to draw up guides on the proper use of certain medicines to "allow their place in the therapeutic strategy to be defined", although this would not include anticancers, for which the National Cancer Institute would take responsibility for proper use guides.</p><p>The HAS would also be called upon to draw up a guide on "the most efficient diagnostic and therapeutic strategies as well as lists of medicines that "should preferably be used" in the cancer area.</p><p>Another new article (43(5) introduced by the lower house would allow the drug pricing committee (CEPS) to draw up agreements with bodies representing patients so that they could consult and exchange information on the setting of prices of reimbursed medicines and other health products. Any organizations wishing to do so would have to provide a declaration of any direct or indirect links with companies whose products fall within the remit of the CEPS. </p><p>As already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/French-health-reform-bill-to-address-drug-shortages-clinical-trials-356628" target="_new">reported in February</a>, the bill contains a whole raft of measures intended to modernize the French healthcare system in the interests of public health, including provisions on dealing with shortages, particularly of high-value medicines.</p><p>The French law firm, PDG Avocats, said that that the lower house added a new provision under which the obligation to ensure an appropriate and continuous supply of medicines will apply not only to the marketing company but to the marketing authorization holder as well. "This is an important addition to the current text since an MA holder which exploits the product in France through its local subsidiary may be held liable according to this new provision," the law firm said.</p><p>Other proposals in the bill include allowing class actions where large numbers of patients claim their health has been damaged by a particular medicine, and allowing wider access to patient health data for use by bodies such as the health insurers. </p><h2>Third-party payments</h2><p>A central plank of the bill, and one that has caused uproar amongst doctors, is a proposal to extend the "tiers payant" (third-party payment) system, under which the healthcare insurers pick up the bill directly for the reimbursed part of patients' treatment so that they don't have to pay up front. </p><p>The bill would extend the system to cover the medical consultation fee so that the doctor would have to claim back the cost of the fee from the relevant health insurer rather than being paid directly by the patient. Doctors complain that this will make the system excessively bureaucratic and encourage patients to visit the doctor more than they need to.</p><p>To try to allay their fears, the health ministry says the new system would be introduced gradually, starting in July this year for patients on low incomes who benefit from assistance in buying complementary health insurance. Doctors could voluntarily apply it to all patients with 100% health insurance coverage from July 2016, and from the end of 2017 it would become a "right" for all patients. </p><p>Nonetheless, the notoriously militant doctors' associations are still up in arms. One of them, the CSMF, says that doctors were never consulted in the drafting of the bill and has called on all doctors to refuse any move towards an "obligatory" third-party payment system, to lobby MPs and senators (the bill goes next to the Senate), to take action at local level, and to inform patients about "this law that is bad for their health".</p><h2>Clinical trials</h2><p>One provision in the bill is intended to bring French practices in line with the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, whose provisions are due to apply sometime after 28 May 2016. Article 37 says that there is a need to streamline trial approval times and procedures in order to reduce delays in starting up trials. </p><p>In parallel with this provision, the regulatory agency ANSM has just published a new version of its 2009 notice to trial sponsors which among other things simplifies and clarifies the form used for the initial application to conduct a trial, and makes it easier to send to the agency. By the end of 2015 ANSM also plans to release an updated volume two of the notice to sponsors on pharmacovigilance in clinical trials.</p>
