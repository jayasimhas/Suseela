<p>Isis Pharmaceuticals is not a company that automatically springs to mind when discussing diabetes therapies, but the firm has several programs in development and is pursuing a novel strategy that might see it become an important team player in the future of diabetes treatment. </p><p>Thinking "If you can't beat them join them," Isis has jumped into the highly competitive diabetes area and is focusing on the development of insulin sensitizers. The company is developing three Phase II diabetes programs as well as a treatment for obesity. But rather than fighting to compete in the premier league, the company is targeting a harder-to-treat patient population of moderate-to-severe type 2 diabetes, and it is navigating its R&D towards therapies with specific added benefits that could be used in combination with existing diabetes treatments. </p><p>Dr. Sanjay Bhanot, Isis' vice-president of clinical development and translational medicine, told <i>Scrip</i> in a recent interview<i>:</i> "If you look at most of the recent drug classes in diabetes, they all work but with modest efficacy. The way we have steered our portfolio is not necessarily to compete with or go after the initial type 2 diabetes population, where there is a good half dozen available therapies that can be taken either as single agents or as combinations, but focus on the more severe forms of the disease."</p><p>He added, "Our goal is to be able to show early on that our drugs have multiple properties outside of glucose control &ndash; such as an influence like weight loss." Bhanot explained further that the company is hoping to create products able to "synergize and add to other therapies."</p><p>Bhanot highlighted that, there is less competition in insulin sensitizers than other areas of diabetes treatment: "Currently there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of insulin sensitizers that are being developed and those in development have met with quite a few safety issues, which have decreased their potential a lot. When Isis thinks about the market for either diabetics that require insulin sensitizers to make their therapy work better or that are uncontrolled on existing therapies, we see a lot of opportunity."</p><p>Isis's products, all of which are antisense drugs, include two products designed to reduce the production of glucagon receptors, ISIS-GCCR and ISIS-GCGR; ISIS-PTB1B, which reduces the production of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B; and ISIS-FGFR4, its obesity drug, which is designed to reduce the production of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. </p><p>The company will be presenting more Phase II data for ISIS-PTB1B at the upcoming European Association for the Study of Diabetes conference in Stockholm, Sept. 14-18. But Isis is hoping to produce "key" Phase IIb data for all its programs that might entice a partner or two. "Isis is not a company set up to do big multi-thousand patient studies," Bhanot said. He added that the company has already had interest from potential products for its antisense diabetes drugs. "People are interested in seeing our data come in."</p><p>"We have the initial data on two of our compounds that tell us they are real drugs that can work in the diabetic landscape. We are trying to address the further data for each of these drugs that we feel a partner would need to move forward into Phase III," he said. </p><h2>Not Concerned About Lilly, Merck Failures</h2><p>One of these two drugs, ISIS-GCGR, is in the same class of glucagon antagonist products being developed by Eli Lilly & Co. and Merck & Co. However, both big pharmas have suspended development of their drugs because of liver safety concerns. </p><p>Lilly's product, LY2409021, was "lost through attrition" the company said in its second quarter earnings report. </p><p>These failures had led analysts to wonder if the safety issues were a mechanism of action based phenomenon. But Isis doesn't share the same concern. Indeed, Bhanot told <i>Scrip</i>, Lilly's failure has "made us even more confident in our product."</p><p>Lilly's drug, in his opinion, had a few basic issues. He noted that a major problem for Lilly was that 40% of patients did not respond to low doses of the product. And even at a higher dose, Lilly saw discontinuations of around 15-20%. "So they had discontinuations because the drug did not work. In the study we have completed that we have already reported on we did not have a single patient who did not respond to our drug," he said. Bhanot noted that this was important because it means Isis can use a lower dose for treatment, leading to fewer side effects.</p><p>"The other thing that makes us believe our drug will be best-in-class is that we have a much more sustained compound." He said the long life of ISIS-GCGR means less frequent dosing for patients. "The patient can take it once-a-week currently and I predict with this drug, it has the potency to cut down to once-a-month treatment."</p><p>Isis will start a study focused on dose selection for this product in the coming four weeks. Bhanot said this trial will show "that we can go low on dose and keep the efficacy".</p><p>Meanwhile, Bhanot also cleared up some concerns about Isis' ISIS-PTP1B diabetes therapy, which in latest Phase II results only had a modest effect on A1c hemoglobin levels (0.5%) compared to placebo. Bhanot said, "I think in another study, and we are planning a nine month study, we should see greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c over time." He added that the company hoped to see A1c difference reach more than 1% in future, longer-term studies. "We are very optimistic about this," he said. </p><p>
