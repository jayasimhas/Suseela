<p>If all goes to plan, Symphogen &ndash; the Danish biotechnology company developing antibody mixture therapies to treat cancer &ndash; expects to need more cash within a year, despite raising &euro;67.5m via a convertible debt facility from existing investors this week. The round was led by Novo A/S and the Danish pension fund PKA.</p><p>The total raised by Symphogen to date is &euro;316.5m, which includes a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Symphogen-raises-100-million-and-buys-development-time-for-cancer-portfolio-308145" target="_new">&euro;100m financing round in 2011</a>, and a further <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Preclinical-Symphogen-raises-41m-of-VC-cash-342878" target="_new">&euro;41m in 2013</a>.</p><p>"We've been around for more than 15 years and we have built a differentiated antibody company from scratch. I think we are good value for money," CEO Dr Kirsten Drejer told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Symphogen's cash reserves, which currently stand at around &euro;110m, will be used to progress the company's pipeline, specifically lead compound Sym004 &ndash; a mixture of two antibodies (futuximab and modotuximab) that is in Phase IIb in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Sym004 had been the subject of a licensing agreement with Merck Serono, but <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Symphogen-goes-solo-after-Merck-KGaA-returns-rights-to-cancer-antibody-356465" target="_new">full rights were returned</a> to Symphogen at the start of this year.</p><p>"It did come as a surprise when we heard that Merck was reprioritizing away from Sym004," Drejer revealed. "But at the same time it was an exciting opportunity for us, and I do think that as a result [of Merck's decision] Symphogen is a more valuable company than it was a year ago."</p><p>On regaining rights to Sym004, Symphogen continued a Phase IIb trial of the product in mCRC patients with disease resistance or disease refractory to anti-EGFR antibody therapies. The data read-out is expected in a year's time, and if successful, Symphogen will again be looking for further funding. "We will consider various options. An IPO is a possibility, as is monetizing one or more of our assets," said Drejer.</p><p>In addition, funds are earmarked to advance to the clinic both of the company's other fully owned assets, the pan-HER product candidate, Sym013 &ndash; a mixture of six antibodies targeting each of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 &ndash; and its MET product candidate, Sym015, a mixture of two antibodies targeting the MET receptor for treatment of patients with MET-amplified tumors.</p><p>Symphogen is also using its antibody mixing platform to its immuno-oncology research programs. "Here we hope to sign a strategic partnership and discussions are ongoing," Drejer revealed. The lead immune-oncology program, which is still in the early discovery phase, is a mixture of three checkpoint inhibitors, one of which is a PD-1.</p><p><b>About Sym004</b></p><p>Lead product candidate Sym004's two antibodies that are designed to block ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling and also elicit removal of the EGFR receptors from the cancer cell surface by inducing EGFR internalization and degradation. </p><p>Positive efficacy findings for Sym004's study in patients with mCRC and with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibody were reported in the June 2015 issue of Cancer Discovery. </p><p>Two other clinical trials with Sym004 are planned: one in glioblastoma patients via an investigator-sponsored study in conjunction with Duke University Medical Center in the US, and another testing a combination of Sym004 and a chemotherapy.</p><p>"If the glioblastoma trial demonstrates efficacy, that could potentially be a fast route to market," explained Drejer. "The chemotherapy trial is important also because if we can demonstrate tolerability with chemotherapy, we can look into using Sym004 as a much earlier stage treatment. At the moment it is last-line. If the combination with chemotherapy goes well, we could be looking at second-line, maybe even first-line."</p><p>
