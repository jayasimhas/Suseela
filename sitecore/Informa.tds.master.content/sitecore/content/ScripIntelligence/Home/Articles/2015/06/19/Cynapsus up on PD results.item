<p><p>Just days after debuting on the NASDAQ, Cynapsus Therapeutics announced positive results for its Parkinson's disease drug that pushed the stock up. </p><p>The Toronto-based company released data from three early-and mid-stage studies that showed APL-130277 improved symptoms of the disease and helped turn patients from Off to On. </p><p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by periods of immobility and unresponsiveness called Off times &ndash; these periods are a significant unmet need for patients with the debilitating disease. </p><p>APL-130277 is a thin apomorphine film that is put under the tongue and is being developed for use on demand to shorten Off times. Results from CTH-2105, CTH-104 and CTH-103 were positive and have convinced the company to begin a Phase III program for the drug. </p><p>"Phase 1 and Phase 2 data presented at the Congress demonstrated that APL-130277 can achieve the appropriate apomorphine plasma levels needed to rapidly and reliably convert a patient from the Off to the On state. In addition, APL-130277 was safe and effective for the acute treatment of Off episodes in PD patients," said Dr Jordan Dubow, VP of Medical Affairs at Cynapsus. </p><p>In Phase CTH-105, 19 patients who experience at least two hours of Off time daily were treated with APL-130277. Of those patients, 15 showed a full On response. Cynapsus noted that two of the patients that didn't respond administered the drug incorrectly. Of those patients that responded, 100% of them converted to an On state within 30 minutes and 40% of them responded in 15 minutes. Nine of the responders remained in the On state for at least 60 minutes. </p><p>APL-130277 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated with similar rates of adverse events as dopamine agonists. CTH-104 and CTH-103 were both Phase I studies that evaluated the safety and tolerability of the drug, as well as its pharmacokinetic profile. </p><p>Cynapsus priced its US IPO on 17 June at $14 per share. The stock closed at $17.63, up 4.38%, on 25 June. The company is already a publicly-listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It's largest investors, Dexxon, put $10m into its US offering. </p><p><p>
