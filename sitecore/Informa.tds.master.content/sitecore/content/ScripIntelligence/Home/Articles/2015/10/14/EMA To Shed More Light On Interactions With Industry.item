<p>The European Medicines Agency has been interacting with its various stakeholders since it was set up in 1995, and has had formal rules on its relations with patients and health professionals in place for some years.</p><p>But there are no such rules governing its engagement with the pharmaceutical industry, even though communicating with this stakeholder group is a major part of its daily business, from innovation task force meetings through early scientific advice, to workshops, drug development and regulatory filings, and information exchange on new EU legislation and guidance.</p><p>Now more light is about to be shed on those relationships, after the EMA released a new framework that it says will formalize and structure its interactions with industry associations. The overall aim, it says, is to foster dialogue, improve communications and information provision, and ensure that all interactions are in line with the agency's transparency and accountability principles. </p><p>The reason for implementing this framework now is the growing diversification of the EMA's dealings with the pharmaceutical industry. For example, both the size and complexity of its operations have grown, and at the same time firms other than those carrying out innovative R&D &ndash; including the generic and non-prescription medicine sectors &ndash; are increasingly becoming involved in the EMA's work, as was pointed out in the agency's <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2011/01/WC500101373.pdf" target="_new">Road Map to 2015</a>.</p><p>But the way it engages with industry has not kept pace, and its approach to stakeholder management has become "fragmented", the EMA says. With the exception of activities related to small and medium-sized enterprises and business pipelines, contacts with industry bodies have generally been managed by particular operational units throughout the organization.</p><p>All this has made it difficult to co-ordinate and allocate its resources. Taking a more centralized approach to interactions with industry, it says, will allow it to "build a consistent approach to this stakeholder group in a transparent manner."</p><p>The question of agency/stakeholder relations is a hot topic at present, as the nature of drug development changes and regulators seek closer involvement with companies developing innovative new drugs at ever earlier stages of development. </p><p>The importance of these changing relations was highlighted recently at a <a href="http://www.rajpharma.com/productsector/pharmaceuticals/Friends-Or-Foes-The-Changing-RegulatorIndustry-Relationship-In-Europe-360874?autnID=/contentstore/rajpharma/codex/69bbd0dc-6d22-11e5-91ab-c94c2ef2f9d3.xml" target="_new">conference in Brussels</a> marking 50 years of the EU pharmaceutical legislation, where one session was devoted to issues such as trust and transparency and whether regulators can be both gatekeepers and partners with industry.</p><p>The framework just published by the EMA covers interactions between the agency and industry bodies that have an interest in, or are affected by, the work of the agency and its partners, including organizations working in both the human and veterinary medicines fields. It has been developed by the new corporate stakeholder department that started work within the EMA's communications division in August 2014.</p><h2>Key Objectives</h2><p>The agency says that the key aims of the new framework are to:</p><ul><li>Provide a platform to exchange views and promote dialogue with stakeholders on topics concerning medicines for human and veterinary use.</li><li>Improve communication and provide efficient, targeted and timely information in a proactive manner.</li><li>Enhance stakeholders&rsquo; understanding of the EU medicines regulatory framework and the role of the regulators, and enrich the EMA&rsquo;s understanding of issues that are pertinent from the industry perspective for product development and licensing.</li><li>Build on existing interactions between industry (including SMEs), academia and other stakeholders in the science, medicines and healthcare arenas by co-operating with established networks and alliances, such as the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP).</li><li>Increase the transparency of stakeholders engaging with the EMA and report on their interactions. </li></ul><h2>Transparency And Conflicts Of Interest</h2><p>Understandably, given the agency's efforts to maximise transparency and minimize conflicts of interest, openness in these relations is a key theme of the framework. "Transparency and accountability are essential to effective engagement since explaining and reporting on stakeholder relations will reinforce management of risk and reputation," the EMA says. </p><p>"Due care and attention", it says, will be paid to mitigating potential risks such as conflicts of interests that could affect the independence and impartiality of the agency and its experts, the participation of stakeholders not representing the broader industry stakeholder landscape, and "contention between participating stakeholders." </p><h2>Choosing Eligible Organizations</h2><p>The agency will set up a public register of eligible organizations and the criteria for eligibility, establish principles and levels of interaction, set up forums for communicating and interacting with industry bodies, and report on these interactions. The eligibility criteria will ensure that associations taking part "represent the broadest array of relevant pharmaceutical industry stakeholders." Surveys will be conducted among industry associations to hear their views on this new approach. </p><p>While the agency will mainly seek to establish contacts with European umbrella organizations, it will also consider contacts with national or regional bodies, as well as with international industry organizations where appropriate.</p><p>These will include trade associations representing pharmaceutical companies, associations of professionals or service providers supporting the general interests of industry (not of a particular company), organizations engaged early in the innovation life-cycle, associations with multiple stakeholders including industry members, and stakeholders operating in areas related to pharmaceuticals, such as medical devices or health technology assessment.</p><p>Once the framework has been endorsed by the EMA management board, the agency says it will implement it based on a defined action plan and taking into account the general principles for stakeholder consultation outlined in the European Commission&rsquo;s Staff Working Document on "<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/docs/swd_br_guidelines_en.pdf" target="_new">Better Regulation Guidelines</a>", which was adopted in May 2015 and covers all regulatory activities at EU level. </p>
