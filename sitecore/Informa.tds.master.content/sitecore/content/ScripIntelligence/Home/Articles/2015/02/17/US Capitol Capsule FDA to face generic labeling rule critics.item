<p>After the FDA stirred up a hornet's nest in November 2013 when it proposed allowing generic drug makers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes &ndash; just like brand-name manufacturers do already &ndash; the agency now plans to confront the critics of that idea face-to-face next month at a public forum.</p><p>Regulators said their proposed rule, which the FDA had initially intended to finalize in December 2014 but has since delayed, is aimed at more quickly getting the latest safety information into the hands of patients who take generic medicines, which account for 80% of the prescription drugs dispensed in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">11 November 2013</a>).</p><p>The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen had actually pushed in August 2011 through a citizen petition for the FDA to put the onus on generic drug makers to add safety updates in their labeling.</p><p>But generic companies didn't want the responsibility, with their trade group, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), confessing it was concerned such a rule could expose its members to liability when patients have adverse reactions to those firms' copycat medicines &ndash; something those companies currently are protected against under two ruling by the US Supreme Court, known as <i>Pliva v Mensing</i> and <i>Mutual Pharmaceutical v Bartlett</i>.</p><p>In <i>Pliva</i>, the high court ruled 5-4 in June 2011 that generic drug makers do not have the same obligations as brand-name manufacturers to update product labeling when new risks come to light (scripintelligence, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Supreme-Court-to-weigh-generic-drug-liability-patent-burden-of-proof-standards-313148" target="_new">27 June 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-House-adopts-patent-reform-but-fee-change-could-be-trouble-for-Senate-317676" target="_new">28 March 2011</a>).</p><p>In <i>Mutual</i>, the Supreme Court, also in a 5-4 ruling, said state law design-defect claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under the Pliva decision (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-FDA-OK-preempts-state-flawed-design-liability-laws-344350" target="_new">24 June 2013</a>).</p><p>Generic makers joined innovators in declaring the FDA's plan also would result in safety information varying among agents with the same active ingredients &ndash; ultimately confusing doctors and patients (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Liability-unleashed-FDA-generics-proposal-could-mean-lawsuits-ahead-348008" target="_new">11 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GPhA-Survey-evidence-FDA-generics-rule-would-confuse-prescribers-352415" target="_new">19 June 2014</a>).</p><p>At the behest of GPhA and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the FDA plans to hold a public meeting at its Silver Springs, Maryland headquarters on 27 March on the generics safety labeling matter.</p><p>The agency also reopened its comment period until 27 April.</p><p>Last March, <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/" target="_new">PhRMA</a> suggested the FDA require an "expeditious prior-approval process" for all safety-related labeling changes, regardless of whether the requests come from innovators or makers of copycat medicines.</p><p>Such a plan would actually take away innovators' autonomy in adding safety updates. </p><p>By requiring the agency's prior approval for all safety-related labeling changes in the "multisource" environment, where drugs are made by innovators and generic makers, the FDA could serve a pivotal role in ensuring that information is provided in a consistent manner, PhRMA contended in 11 March 2014 comments to the agency.</p><p>GPhA recently signed on to that idea &ndash; insisting at an 8 September 2014 <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/" target="_new">meeting</a> with regulators there be an expedited FDA review and final approval of any labeling change prior to implementation and affirming to FDA Commissioner Dr Margaret Hamburg in a joint 14 November 2014 <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/" target="_new">letter</a> with PhRMA, which was made public last week, the two trade associations had agreed on their alternative "expedited agency review" (EAR) plan. </p><p>Even though all drug makers must inform the FDA about all adverse event reports the firms receive, currently only brand-name companies are permitted to independently revise their safety information in drug labeling on their own by submitting a so-called changes being effected (CBE) supplement to the FDA. </p><p>The CBE changes are a narrow exception to the general rule that labeling changes require the FDA's approval before implementation.</p><p>If regulators sign off on CBE safety updates, then generic drug makers are required to include the same revisions in their labeling.</p><p>But when a generic company becomes aware of a potential risk, it cannot update its product labeling without first submitting supporting information to the FDA, which then determines if the labeling should be revised for those medicines and the innovator drugs.</p><p>In its comments last year, PhRMA noted the CBE process was created by the FDA in 1965 when communication between the agency and manufacturers &ndash; and subsequently between drug makers and healthcare professionals &ndash; was slower and more cumbersome.</p><p>Although the CBE process allows innovators to implement changes before US regulators approve them, PhRMA pointed out the determination of whether labeling revisions are necessary is, "in the end, squarely and solely FDA's."</p><p>And, the branded drug trade group noted, before using the CBE process, innovators often consult with the FDA to seek the agency's agreement to significant labeling changes to avoid implementing something with which regulators ultimately may disagree.</p><p>An EAR, PhRMA and GPhA said in documents posted online last week, would establish defined time parameters for the FDA to take action on a labeling change made following the agency's receipt and review of new safety information from a brand-name or generic manufacturer or after regulators review data from the Sentinel System &ndash; a collaborative project between government agencies and the private sector aimed at using existing and planned databases to track, collect and analyze adverse event reports about drugs, vaccines and medical devices &ndash; or other databases, including global sources that are suggestive of a need for a label change. </p><p>They proposed to have the EAR replace the CBE process.</p><p>Under the PhRMA/GPhA proposal, innovators or generic makers who believe data they submit to the FDA may constitute new safety information could request an EAR or the agency could begin the process on its own initiative based on information it posses from its sources. </p><p>If a drug maker requests an EAR, the FDA must make a decision on the appropriateness of a labeling change within certain number days or even sooner if regulators determine the circumstances warrant a more expedited action. </p><p>Once the agency has made a decision to implement a new safety labeling change &ndash; whether the EAR was initiated by the FDA or a manufacturer &ndash; drug makers would be given 30 days to follow through, unless regulators determine an action is required sooner. </p><p>PhRMA and GPhA also said that implementation should be facilitated through electronic labeling.</p><p>"The public health benefit of e-labeling is clear as it will speed up the availability of accurate, real-time and consistent labeling of marketed products for pharmacists, physicians and patients," the trade groups said.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>Oops! US feds goof on 800,000 Obamacare tax forms</b></p><p>Just when the Obama administration thought the nightmare of the disastrous 2014 Obamacare glitches was behind it, now comes word an erroneous form was sent out to 800,000 Americans who are seeking to claim tax credit subsidies aimed at lowering their insurance premium payments. </p><p>The Obama administration chose a blog posted on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website to notify those Americans of the goof.</p><p>The administration said 20% of the tax filers who had signed up for private health insurance plans in 2014 offered under the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> (ACA) through the 37 exchanges run by the federal government and used the tax credits would now be receiving an updated form because the original version listed an incorrect benchmark plan premium amount. </p><p>The government wants those Americans who got the wrong forms to hold off until the first week of March to file their 2014 federal taxes &ndash; meaning if those people are owed a return, they'll have to wait longer for it, which likely won't sit well with families in desperate need of those dollars.</p><p>In the unsigned blog posted on 20 February on the CMS website, the administration insisted that up to 95% of those 800,000 people have not yet filed their 2014 taxes anyway.</p><p>But it acknowledged as many as 50,000 likely have filed their 2014 tax paperwork with "Uncle Sam." </p><p>The US Treasury Department will provide information "soon" to those people, the administration said.</p><p>The government emphasized that 80% of Americans who enrolled in Obamacare in 2014 got the correct "1095-A" form and are not affected by the latest glitch &ndash; another stain on the ACA, which started off its very first enrollment process in October 2013 plagued by crashing state and federal websites, although President Barack Obama ultimately got to declare victory with more than 10 million Americans covered through the plans or under Medicaid expansion (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shutdown-drama-exchange-trauma-Obama-said-thered-be-days-like-this-346988" target="_new">2 October 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-Im-sorry-347959" target="_new">8 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-We-fumbled-but-game-not-over-348158" target="_new">15 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-Obamacare-woes-Leakers-hackers-political-attackers-348235" target="_new">20 November 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Website-fix-goal-met-but-salvaging-ACA-credibility-tougher-348439" target="_new">2 December 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-ACA-hits-8m-time-to-forcefully-defend-351375" target="_new">18 April 2014</a>).</p><p>On 18 February, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced that about 11.4 million Americans had enrolled and selected ACA plans for 2015 through the federal and state marketplaces (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obamacares-11.4m-enrollees-means-new-pharma-customers-356824" target="_new">18 February 2015</a>). </p><p>Biopharmaceutical manufacturers stand to gain from the large enrollment numbers because it means patients will have coverage for their prescription drugs they otherwise may not have been able to afford.</p><p>Because there was a Valentine's Day glitch with the HealthCare.gov website and others were still trying to finish their enrollment by the midnight deadline on 15 February, the administration gave those Americans until 22 February to complete the process.</p><p>Under pressure from various advocacy groups and some lawmakers, the Obama administration also revealed on 20 February it was allowing another "special" enrollment period from 15 March to 30 April &ndash; this one for Americans who were surprised to learn they owe a tax penalty because they failed to obtain health insurance in 2014, even though the fee had been warned about for years and even fought over at the US Supreme Court in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Supreme-Court-Affordable-Care-Act-constitutional-under-Congress-taxing-powers-332248" target="_new">28 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Constitutionality-declared-Surgery-or-hammer-time-next-for-health-reform-332278" target="_new">29 June 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Post-SCOTUS-HHS-moves-forward-with-ACA-but-Republicans-push-back-332329" target="_new">2 July 2012</a>).</p><p>In a statement, CMS said the special enrollment period would allow those individuals and families who were unaware or didn't understand the implications of the new tax requirement to enroll in 2015 plans to avoid the penalty when they file next year's paperwork with the Internal Revenue Service. </p><p>Secretary Burwell had been hinting for the past week the administration was considering the additional special enrollment period, telling reporters on 18 February a decision was coming soon. </p><p><b>Ignored in Ebola's shadow, NIH gives TB new focus</b></p><p>With much of the global attention in the past year centered on Ebola, other diseases, like tuberculosis, have been given short shrift.</p><p>But the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other groups are now putting new focus on TB &ndash; with the US biomedical research agency pumping $105.3m over the next seven years into its Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) intended to drive innovation. </p><p>Although TB illnesses and deaths have slowly been declining in recent years, the global burden of the disease remains substantial, the NIH pointed out.</p><p>In 2013, about nine million people worldwide became ill with TB, with 1.5 million of those dying from the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). </p><p>TB infected more than 500,000 children in 2013 &ndash; killing 80,000, WHO reported.</p><p>About one-third of the world's population actually carries latent TB bacteria, the global health agency said. </p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH, said TB remains especially entrenched in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>The new investment in the TBRU, he said, "will help us to improve our understanding of this ancient disease and how best to diagnosis, treat and ultimately prevent it."</p><p>The TBRU program was established in 1994 with the aim of integrating basic and clinical research to study TB in countries where the disease is endemic. </p><p>The NIH funds will be used to integrate epidemiology, immunology and microbiology by four awardee institutions &ndash; Boston Medical Center, Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital, Emory University and Weill Cornell Medical College &ndash; which will work together to examine how mycobacterium TB interacts with the human host and the immune system to cause disease. </p><p>Through animal studies and clinical research, the TBRU program will focus on TB latency and persistence and their relation to active TB disease in humans, the NIH said. </p><p>The nonprofit TB Alliance also revealed last week it was starting a Phase I trial of a new TB drug candidate, TBA-354, an investigational nitroimidazole compound.</p><p>Nitroimidazoles have been shown to be effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB.</p><p>The study plans to enroll 50 US volunteers for the randomized, double-blind Phase I trial, which will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and dosing of TBA-354.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
