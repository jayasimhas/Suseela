<p>Analysts are expecting much less jubilation at this year's European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) International Liver Congress, due to start on April 22 in Vienna, Austria, compared with last year. Largely, this is because it is hard to improve on the near-100% cure rates seen with the new wave of hepatitis C therapies that were highlighted 12 months ago in London &ndash; specifically Gilead's Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) and AbbVie's Viekira Pak (paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir + dasabuvir).</p><p>However, <i>Scrip</i> has put together a quick roundup of what is likely to be of interest at EASL 2015. </p><p>The most eagerly awaited data is probably from Merck & Co, via its presentations on the Phase III C-EDGE trials with its grazoprevir/elbasvir combination.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock says he will be looking closely to see if the combination matches the efficacy of Gilead's and AbbVie's regimens, "but I don't think anybody is expecting it to be better," he noted. </p><p>Merck has been on a roller coaster in recent months with the grazoprevir/elbasvir regimen. Earlier this month, the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-replaces-rather-than-rescinds-Mercks-breakthrough-status-357726" target="_new">reversed course</a> on its intention to rescind the breakthrough therapy status it had awarded in October 2013 for the combination.</p><p>Leerink analysts said the pre-released abstracts from EASL suggest that the combination shows overall similar efficacy to Harvoni and Viekira Pak "but appears to allow nearly all of the major populations to be treated with a 12-week regimen." In contrast, 24 weeks of Viekira Pak is indicated for GT1a patients with cirrhosis. "Interestingly the KOL does not expect the lack of an 8-week option (as is available with Harvoni) to be a disadvantage and suggested that many physicians including himself would rather use 12 weeks of Harvoni to ensure a higher SVR rate and the lack of Phase III data with 8 weeks of the Merck regimen could be an advantage as payers would not push for its use," the analysts commented.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare's Mr Haydock said he would also be keeping an eye on any updated EASL treatment recommendations. "Presumably Gilead's and AbbVie's regimens will be recommended, but will the guidelines still recommend restricting treatment to ?F2 (METAVIR score) patients due to the high costs of treatment?" Mr Haydock suspects that they will, "given that Harvoni/Viekira Pak are still undergoing reimbursement negotiations and therefore prices are uncertain."</p><p>Achillion Pharmaceuticals will be presenting early data with ACH-3422 &ndash; its Phase II-stage NS5B nuc inhibitor. In February it <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Achillion-Regulus-chase-shorter-HCV-regimens-but-can-they-beat-Gilead-356631" target="_new">revealed data</a> that might support shorter treatment times versus Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), which initially got investors excited before reality hit: Gilead and others have drug combinations in later stages of development that may show efficacy with shorter durations of treatment in large pivotal trials before Achillion is able to report detailed results for its drug. "It's still interesting as Achillion is being quite ambitious with shortened treatment durations," said Mr Haydock.</p><p>With such high cure rates now achieved in hepatitis C, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Are-there-any-early-phase-opportunities-left-in-hepatitis-C-356222" target="_new">ultimate goal</a> is clear: a pan-genotypic, shortened treatment regimen. Gilead believes it may have this wrapped up with its sofosbuvir/GS-5816 + GS-9857 regimen. Early data are due to be presented at EASL.</p>
