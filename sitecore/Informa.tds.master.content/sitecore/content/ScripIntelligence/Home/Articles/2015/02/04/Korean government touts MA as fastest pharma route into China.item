<p>Amid the South Korean government's recent drive to encourage pharma firms to shift their focus to overseas markets, an official at the country's state-owned health industry institute has suggested the industry should seek mergers and acquisitions or joint ventures to advance into the rapidly growing Chinese pharma market.</p><p>During an industry briefing on 6 April to discuss ways for the health industry to advance into China following an expected bilateral free trade agreement, Kim Ji-su, General Director of the Korea Health Industry Development Institute's (KHIDI) China branch, said that the fastest way for South Korean firms to enter the Chinese pharma market would be through mergers with Chinese pharma or wholesale firms rather than simply exporting drugs.</p><p>Other alternatives are to seek cooperative or equity joint ventures with Chinese partners during the new drug development stage, seek cooperation with China's medical industry complexes, or set up joint ventures with South Korean pharma firms that have already advanced into China, she said.</p><p>South Korean firms have difficulty exporting drugs to China because getting approval for generic can take about seven to eight years in the world's second largest economy, so the firms will no longer be competitive when they launch the drugs, the official noted.</p><p>"China has a huge domestic market and one third of the global population. Not only South Korean pharma firms, but global pharma firms are all striving to advance into the Chinese market," Kim told Scrip's sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i>.</p><p>She said some large South Korean pharma companies like Green Cross and Hanmi Pharmaceutical had already made inroads into China years ago, but for those companies which are looking to newly advance into the country, M&As will be the fastest way to enter the market.</p><p>"If they are capable of taking over small Chinese pharma firms that have production capacity, products and sales networks, that will be the fastest way," she said, adding that some Chinese pharma firms which fail to meet the new GMP standards may have to sell their factories due to high compliance costs.</p><p>The Chinese government is seen as creating an environment in which firms that cannot wait for the lengthy time required for the approval of generics fall behind or are forced to merge with bigger rivals. In fact, the number of drug materials or finished product manufacturers is falling amid the Chinese government's policy to encourage mergers among pharma firms.</p><h2>Growing China Demand</h2><p>Health-related demand and people's interest in health mean the relevant market is rapidly growing in China due to the country's increasing per capita GDP. Such growth is offering more opportunities for pharma firms amid the aging population, expansion of the national health insurance scheme, urbanization and easier access to hospitals.</p><p>According to the KHIDI, China's total medical market is expected to rise to about CNY1.3tn ($209.7bn) this year from CNY956.4bn in 2012. The Chinese government is targeting to boost the health service industry to CNY8tn by 2020.</p><p>Total production of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry rose to $375.7bn in 2014 from $349.3bn in 2013. As of 2013, there were 4,875 raw materials and medicine manufacturers in China.</p><p>About 95% of Chinese people are covered by the basic health insurance system, and the KHIDI expects China's medical market to further grow going forward due to rising income and improvement in medical infrastructure. The top 10 foreign pharma firms operating in China have not only boosted their commercial presence but also the number of their R&D centers in China, to 30 in 2012 from five in 2005, the KHIDI noted.</p><p>Green Cross already operates a plant in China producing plasma derivatives and on 6 March signed a memorandum of understanding with the Guizhou provincial government in China for an investment in the cell therapy sector. Under the MOU, the company will build a production facility in the southwestern Chinese province in order to produce and distribute cell therapy products in the country.</p><p>Hanmi Pharm has also advanced into China through its affiliate Beijing Hanmi Pharmaceutical which was established in 1996. Bejing Hanmi, which has an R&D division, production and sales network, is selling about 20 items in the country.</p><p>The South Korean government expects to sign the official bilateral free trade agreement with China in the first half of this year.</p><p>The article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p><p>
