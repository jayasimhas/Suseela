<p>Following rumors a few weeks ago, Takeda Pharmaceutical has now formally agreed to settle most of the US product lawsuits relating to its diabetes drug Actos, for a total of around $2.4bn but with no admission of liability, in a move that will see the firm post a full-year loss.</p><p>In an agreement it expects to resolve "the vast majority" of pending product liability suits for Actos(pioglitazone), Takeda said it would take a $2.7bn charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (which ended 31 March) for the settlement and other legal costs related to ongoing cases and associated litigation. A small number of suits in other countries have been brought.</p><p>The settlement offer will only apply if 95% of current litigants and claimants in the cases accept it, at which point $2.37bn would be paid into a fund, rising to a total pot of $2.4bn if at least 97% of claimants accept the settlement. Payouts will be made if certain criteria are met, and the threshold for the settlement suggest that further legal from defendants appears unlikely.</p><p>The Japanese firm reiterated its stance all along on the cases: "Takeda believes these claims made in this litigation are without merit, and does not admit liability," adding that it believes it acted responsibly over the type 2 diabetes drug and that it stands behind the substantial data confirming the oral thiazolidinedione has a positive risk/benefit profile.</p><p>In a statement, Takeda said the settlement was decided upon to "reduce financial uncertainties for the company" by resolving most of the cases, allowing it to "fully focus on developing innovative medicines." The settlement will not have any impact on dividend payouts, the firm stressed.</p><p>Talk of a potential settlement surfaced earlier this month, when a media report suggested Takeda was considering paying out around $2.2nn over the claims, which relate to Actos's possible links to bladder cancer, and whether the company provided sufficient warnings after the drug's US launch in 1999. </p><p>The FDA revised the label warnings in 2011 to clarify such risks following a year of use and warning that past bladder cancer patients should not take Actos, which continues to be marketed in the US and close to 100 countries worldwide.</p><p>In the US, around 3,500 suits have been consolidated into multi-district litigation in Louisiana, while some 4,500 other cases are pending in both federal and state courts. Five of eight suits that have come to hearings were settled in Takeda's favor (but are being appealed), while multi-million dollar damages have been awarded in two cases.</p><p>The settlement appears to be a pragmatic attempt by new CEO Christophe Weber &ndash; who assumed the post at the beginning of April &ndash; to clear the slate and refocus on Takeda's core business, as well as to avoid the risk of further negative judgments and the sizable legal costs involved in fighting the cases.</p><h2>revised guidance</h2><p>In a new financial forecast for the fiscal year just ended, Takeda raised its sales guidance by JPY50 billion to JPY1,775bn ($14.93bn), while an operating loss of JPY130bn, and a net loss attributable to owners of the company of JPY145bn, are expected.</p><p>Product liability insurance will be booked as an asset and the net of this with the settlement recognized as other operating expenses. The resulting negative impact on operating and net profit is around JPY270bn and JPY180bn respectively.</p><p>Other financial items behind the revised guidance include impairment losses and the write-off of deferred tax assets. Previously announced dividends (JPY180 per share for the year) remain unchanged.</p><p>The announcement of the settlement came on a public holiday in Japan at the start of the Golden Week vacation period, meaning that local stock markets were closed.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/4/29/takeda-offers-24bn-nofault-settlement-of-actos-suits" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>. </p>
