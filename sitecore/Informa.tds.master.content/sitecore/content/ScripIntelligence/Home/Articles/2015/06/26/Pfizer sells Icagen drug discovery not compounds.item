<p>Four years after Pfizer acquired Icagen for $56m, the big pharma sold the drug discovery firm to XRpro Sciences for up to $11m, which would seem to be a big discount if the deal gave the buyer access to compounds generated by Icagen's ion channel biology platform.</p><p>The transaction notably does not include PF-05089771, a pain drug candidate that blocks the sodium channel Nav1.7, which was at the center of a dispute between Pfizer and certain Icagen shareholders when the pharma company pursued the drug discovery firm in 2011. But even though Pfizer is holding on to PF-05089771 and other Icagen-discovered compounds, the company still will access the firm's drug discovery technology after the sale.</p><p>XRpro will pay Pfizer $500,000 between now and 1 March and $500,000 on the second anniversary of the Icagen deal if the new discovery firm reaches $4m in annual revenue. XRpro also will give Pfizer 10% of its quarterly revenue starting in 2017 with a maximum aggregate of $10m. </p><p>Concurrently, Pfizer agreed to pay $1m annually for drug discovery work conducted by XRpro, which will adopt the Icagen name, for at least two years.</p><p>XRpro will combine its label-free X-ray fluorescence technology with Icagen's scientific expertise, portfolio assays and cell lines to provide drug discovery services to biopharma companies. Icagen scientists &ndash; researchers who've worked with the likes of Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Johnson &Johnson &ndash; will continue to work from facilities in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, while XRpro employees will remain in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p><p>"We look forward to once again operating as an independent company &#8230; without limitations on the therapeutic areas or ion channels of interest," Icagen chief scientific officer Douglas Krafte said in a statement from XRpro. However, he noted that being part of Pfizer "enabled us to significantly grow our technology resources and gain unique insights into large company perspectives about drug R&D that will serve our clients as we go forward."</p><p>Previous Icagen drug discovery work has generated compounds for cardiac arrhythmias, sickle cell anemia, asthma, epilepsy and pain. Pfizer's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Protesting-Icagen-VCs-want-to-know-what-Pfizer-knows-319846" target="_new">PF-05089771</a> is in Phase II development for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
