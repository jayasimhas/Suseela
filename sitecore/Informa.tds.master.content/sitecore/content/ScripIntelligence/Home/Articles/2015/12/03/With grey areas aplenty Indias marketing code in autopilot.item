<p>Ambiguities in India's new Uniform Code of Pharmaceuticals Marketing Practices (UCPMP) appear to have stretched early compliance deadlines via autopilot mode.</p><p>India's UCPMP, which is effective initially voluntarily for six months starting 1 January 2015, had earlier suggested that self-declaration of compliance be made by the managing director/CEO of a company within two months of the issuance of the UCPMP <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indian-marketing-code-puts-onus-on-CEO-355821%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 24 December 2014)</a>. </p><p>While the initial deadline may have ended 1 March, few declarations appear to have been made so far, if early interactions with leading industry bodies by <i>Scrip</i> are anything to go by. </p><p>Most leading Indian firms do not appear to have made such declaration, but say that neither has the initial deadline been extended, at least officially.</p><p>The Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), which represents leading foreign firms, said that it had spent "considerable time", in consultation with its members, studying the code and discussing any potential challenges in compliance. </p><p>"We have detailed our concerns and suggestions for the Department of Pharmaceuticals, to help resolve ambiguities and gain the clarity we need to better adhere to this code,'' OPPI director general Ranjana Smetacek told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>The OPPI also underscored that the UCPMP is initially a voluntary code and pending clarity on specific aspects, its members continue to adhere to the OPPI Code of Pharmaceutical Practices, which is based on the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations Code. </p><p>''Our code ensures that OPPI members conform to high standards of ethical practice in pharmaceutical marketing and it covers most aspects of the UCPMP, often with greater stringency,'' Ms Smetacek suggested.</p><p>An official reaction from the department of pharmaceuticals on the deadline issue could not immediately be got, though industry suggests that the government may be open to considering a more rational approach in some areas. Some industry experts had previously claimed that the new code was, in part, a "reflex action" to the alleged bribery case concerning Eris Lifesciences. The Medical Council of India was earlier reported to have summoned around 300 physicians across the country to Delhi to respond to an anonymous complaint of bribery by the Gujarat-based drug firm <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-collar-crime-Does-India-need-to-do-a-China-to-curb-bribery-355278" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 26 November 2014)</a>. </p><p>UCPMP also mandated that industry associations upload procedure to lodge complaints under the code and form an ethics committee for handling such complaints. </p><p>The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA), which represents leading local firms, told <i>Scrip</i> that it was ready with the "first draft" and would consider and adopt the same in consultation with the government. "It may take a couple of months," the IPA said.</p><p>The OPPI said that it already has a working group focused on ethics and compliance and a "robust" adjudication system to address complaints and concerns.</p><h2>Grey Areas</h2><p>But experts point to a clutch of grey areas in UCPMP that need to be addressed promptly.</p><p>Sample these: Would a simple meal offered to healthcare professionals (HCP) at a medical conference violate UCPMP? Would a calendar or a humble pen or brand reminders provided to a HCP constitute a ''gift'' under the code? Or then is it rational to bar the sampling of antidepressants or sedatives to physicians?</p><p>There's very little clarity on some of these aspects in the UCPMP currently, these experts suggest.</p><p>UCPMP, which bans, among others, gifts and ''pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind'' to persons qualified to prescribe or supply drugs by a pharma firm or any of its agents, also clarifies that physicians participating in seminars and meetings by drug firms for promoting medicines or disseminating information should do so at their ''own cost''. Few industry officials were clear about the strict conditions laid down for providing samples to physicians, with sample packs to be limited to ''prescribed dosages'' for three patients for a required course of treatment''. </p><p>But while industry awaits clarifications, one expert referred to vital lessons from previous studies that compare physician and patient attitudes toward pharmaceutical industry gifts. </p><p>A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in 1998 that surveyed 196 patients and 268 physicians indicated that patients didn't trust doctors who were perceived to have received favors from the industry. </p><p>An industry expert with a leading foreign firm told <i>Scrip</i> that while there was a difference attached to the value of the "service" by physicians &ndash; pens were considered less influential than trips &ndash; patients didn't really differentiate between services as much. </p><p>"It is this perception by the lay person that pharma needs to be worried about, especially now when alternative media have created many new opportunities of engaging with them. If this perception could be created in the pre-social media era, imagine what it could do now. The stakes are too high for pharma to ignore this perception," the expert said.</p><p>The study indicated, among others, that 31% of patients saw a gifted pen as influential (versus just 8% of physicians), while 56% of patients and 42% of physicians surveyed saw a "trip" as being influential.</p><p>The expert also suggested that pharma needs to leverage the entire value chain, including partnering with channels and engaging with pharmacists, but stressed that such approaches must steer clear of seeking "exclusivity" or creating "uncompetitive" practices. </p><p>"Tremendous value can be created for patients if pharma begins to leverage the entire value chain rather than focus on doctors alone. If it thinks of engaging patients through pharmacies, payers and caregivers, a whole host of services can emerge. There are many start-ups which have sprouted to fill the void that pharma has refused to acknowledge," the expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p>
