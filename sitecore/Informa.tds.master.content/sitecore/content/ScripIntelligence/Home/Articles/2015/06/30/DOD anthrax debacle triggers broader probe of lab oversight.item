<p>A search for answers about how a Utah military facility shipped live anthrax to numerous labs has sparked a broader investigation into the oversight of the US Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP), which oversees the possession, use and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public, animal or plant health or to animal or plant products.</p><p>Leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 6 July told Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel Levinson he had until 20 July to disclose how many referrals for enforcement actions his agency has received from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about labs that have violated FSAP rules and how many of those entities had civil monetary penalties levied against them.</p><p>The E&C's demand comes just as the Department of Defense (DOD) has completed a comprehensive review of its laboratory procedures, processes and protocols after it was discovered in May that a lab at the US Army's Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah sent inactivated <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> to what is now believed to be 84 private, academic and federal laboratories in 20 US states and the District of Columbia and five foreign nations &ndash; Australia, Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the UK.</p><p>The DOD is expected to makes its findings public within the next two weeks.</p><p>Initially, DOD said the mishap involved only <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Live-anthrax-may-have-reached-numerous-US-labs-358624" target="_new">18 labs in nine US states</a> and an American military base in Korea. </p><p>The Pentagon said at least 22 people &ndash; seven US civilians and 15 DOD employees &ndash; currently are being treated with post-exposure prophylaxis antibiotics in the event that were exposed to anthrax, which is down from the 31 the CDC had reported in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lawmakers-expand-anthrax-probe-69-labs-affected-358934" target="_new">mid-June</a>.</p><p>The E&C opened its investigation into the DOD's anthrax troubles on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Lawmakers-troubled-over-anthrax-mishap-demand-answers-358649" target="_new">28 May</a>.</p><p>The committee already had an ongoing investigation underway involving near-calamities that occurred last year at labs at other government agencies, including the CDC, National Institutes of Health and the FDA, involving <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-anthrax-mishap-puts-spotlight-on-biosafety-lab-vulnerabilities-352431" target="_new">anthrax</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Smallpox-discovery-triggers-FBI-probe-NIH-lab-search-352714" target="_new">smallpox</a>, the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Anthrax-smallpox-and-H5N1-Bad-beyond-Walter-White-352849" target="_new">H5N1</a> influenza virus and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-reports-another-lab-mishap-this-time-Ebola-355849" target="_new">Ebola</a>.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
