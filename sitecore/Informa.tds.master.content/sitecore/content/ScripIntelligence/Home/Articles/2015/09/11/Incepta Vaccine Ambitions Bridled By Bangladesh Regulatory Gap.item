<p>Bangladesh's Incepta Vaccine Ltd is gearing for a larger play with vaccines for pneumonia and human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pipeline, but a non-functional national regulatory authority (NRA) could stymie its ambitions in terms of large scale supplies of other products to Unicef, at least in the short-term.</p><p>Incepta's chairman and managing director, Abdul Muktadir, told <i>Scrip</i> that the firm's pneumonia and HPV vaccine "will come within a year's time" and that the company already manufactures influenza, meningococcal and measles and rubella vaccines, among others.</p><p>In general, Incepta's vaccines are available at a discount of 40-50% to the reference product, he said.</p><p>On whether Incepta's HPV vaccine would be able to match Merck's Gardasil or GSK's Cervarix in terms of strains covered and efficacy, Muktadir said: "We are evaluating both the options." </p><p>Gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine directed against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, while Cervarix is a bivalent vaccine directed against 16 and 18.</p><h2>Supplies To Unicef</h2><p>Incepta's growth ambitions, though, would also hinge on the speedy functionality of Bangladesh's national regulatory authority (NRA).</p><p>Muktadir noted that Incepta's vaccine site in Zirabo (near Dhaka) cannot apply for World Health Organization (WHO) inspection unless the NRA becomes functional.</p><p>"NRA functionality is essential for Incepta to be able to supply to Unicef," he declared.</p><p>Incepta is the first human vaccine manufacturing company in Bangladesh and the chairman explained that most of the firm's vaccines are "fill-finish in nature", which means that the antigens are imported and then formulated into the final product. </p><p>"Simultaneously we have developed our own vaccines indigenously and are also getting help from Hilleman, the International Vaccine Institute (IVI) etc. We have made cholera and typhoid [vaccines] with the help of IVI whereas we developed rabies, meningococcal, pneumonia, diphtheria, hepatitis B in our own research lab," Muktadir added.</p><p>Hilleman is an equal joint-venture partnership between Merck & Co and Wellcome Trust.</p><p>In November 2014, Hilleman Laboratories signed a memorandum of understanding with the Bangladesh-based icddr,b (formerly the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh), an international public health research organization, and Incepta Vaccine, to fast-track clinical trials and product licensing and commercialization of its cholera vaccine.</p><p>The IVI partnership was initiated with technology transfers for an oral cholera vaccine and a typhoid conjugate vaccine from the institute to Incepta in 2014. Both cholera and typhoid are major public health concerns in Bangladesh and a local manufacturer committed to these vaccines is expected to bolster the fight against these diseases.</p><p>Bangladesh's Extended Programme on Immunization currently procures vaccines through Unicef.</p><p>NRAs are generally responsible for ensuring that products released for public distribution (normally pharmaceuticals and biological products, such as vaccines) are evaluated properly and meet international standards of quality and safety. For prequalification of vaccines for UN supply, it is typically a prerequisite that a NRA responsible for the product is "functional" as per the assessment performed using the WHO's established indicators, industry experts explained.</p><p>Muktadir said that efforts towards making Bangladesh's NRA functional have progressed "significantly" as physical facilities of new laboratories are in place. </p><p>"WHO needs to pay attention in terms of training and gap analysis," he added. </p><p>Industry experts from Bangladesh had earlier indicated that the WHO and Bangladesh's Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) are working closely to ensure compliance with all the WHO indicators.</p><p>Previously, Hilleman's CEO, Dr Davinder Gill, in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hilleman-CEO-On-Tackling-Regulatory-Challenges-For-Vaccines-361339" target="_new">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i>, has underscored that it was vital to get the NRA functional as quickly as possible so that not just the joint venture's product but other vaccines that are being made in Bangladesh can seek WHO prequalification and be made available for global use. </p><p>Incepta's vaccines are currently sold primarily in Bangladesh's private market, though Muktadir indicated that exports have commenced to certain countries that have approved the firm's plant/products. </p><p>
