<p>Premium priced Tresiba (insulin degludec), Novo Nordisk's ultra-long acting once-daily insulin, appears to have made striking gains in the basal analogues market in India &ndash; a segment dominated by Sanofi's Lantus (insulin glargine).</p><p>If Lantus, launched more than a decade ago in India, has held strong, reporting robust growth, then Tresiba, which some analysts estimate has an average monthly patient "run rate" of around 3,000, has established "market acceptance".</p><p>While Novo Nordisk said it was not possible to accurately state the exact number of patients on any product, it indicated that Tresiba currently had a market share of 15.2% in basal analogues as per IMS data for the 12- months to March 2015. </p><p>"This is the best penetration by new analogues launched in the last few years," the company told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Tresiba, which was launched in India in September 2013, is currently available in 23 countries across the world &ndash; most recently Brazil, Slovakia, Chile, Russia and Italy. The product has done "very well" across markets and is growing steadily, the Danish multinational said.</p><p>What probably makes Tresiba's India run special is that the product commands a significant premium in the basal analogues segment &ndash; adding an interesting dimension to the differential pricing debate in an ultra-price sensitive market. </p><p>Tresiba's India launch price of INR1,800 ($29 or &pound;18 then) for a single pre-filled pen/cartridge (100 IU/ml) was said to be at a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Premium-priced-Tresiba-starts-on-strong-note-in-India-348893%5d" target="_new">premium</a> to even certain Western markets, though it isn't clear how much of the pricing was related to the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Novo Nordisk had, at that time, told <i>Scrip</i> that it did not have a differential pricing approach for any new product. "For established products, we do have a differential pricing policy," it then said. </p><p>Lantus100IU/3ml cartridges, on the other hand, comes with a price tag of INR493 and Sanofi maintained that while many insulin brands "had a price rise" in 2014, the price of Lantus continues to remain the same. Last year Lupin announced <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-to-market-LG-Lifes-glargine-in-India-353230%5d" target="_new">plans to market</a> the South Korean firm LG Life Sciences' insulin glargine on the Indian market, where biosimilar glargine versions from Biocon (Basalog) and Wockhardt (Glaritus) are already available. </p><p>Novo gave no specific response when asked whether it expects to implement any innovative patient access plan for Tresiba or then consider a differential pricing approach. </p><p>It merely reiterated the patient and clinical benefits of its basal insulin, including that Tresiba was associated with significant improvements in overall physical health, bodily pain and vitality in a meta-analysis of studies in people with type 2 diabetes starting on basal oral therapy.</p><p>"The significant clinical benefits and innovation that Tresiba provides to people with diabetes and the value they see in the product is clearly reflected in the market acceptance," it underscored.</p><p>Significantly, Novo Nordisk's combination product, Ryzodeg (insulin degludec and insulin aspart) launched in India in January 2015, has garnered a market share of 6.7% within the analogue premix segment in just a short span of three months.</p><h2>Lantus</h2><p>Sanofi, though, emphasised that diabetes is a key business driver for Sanofi India, and that the company "has not looked back" since it launched Lantus in 2003.</p><p>Lantus has reported 30% growth on a moving annual turnover (MAT) basis as per IMS data for January 2015 and the company attributed this growth to "dedicated efforts" to increase awareness about the role of basal insulin in effective diabetes management.</p><p>But there's little denying that competition in the basal analogues segment is intense and Sanofi is keen to stay well ahead.</p><p>The company told <i>Scrip</i> that it had in the last two years "upsized" the insulin team in order to reach more doctors across Class 1/1A towns. </p><p>Then there have been multiple medico-marketing initiatives conducted on a regular basis aimed at equipping healthcare practitioners in India with the latest scientific updates in the prevention, treatment and management of diabetes. </p><p>"Dedicated medico marketing activities on basal insulin were also initiated to educate doctors who prescribe human insulin regularly," the company said.</p><p>Sanofi also referred to AllStar, its reusable insulin pen, which is said to have extended the benefit of Lantus to many more patients by giving them convenient access to international standards through an affordable solution. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-develops-cut-price-Indian-insulin-device-for-emerging-markets-336042" target="_new">AllStar</a> was the first indigenously-manufactured, reusable insulin pen from a multinational company in India and the first such cut-price device made outside of the French multinational's facility in Frankfurt, Germany. More than one million AllStar pens have been manufactured in India since its launch in 2012.</p><p>Sanofi added that it was also extending free pen support to "deserving" patients on the recommendation of treating doctors &ndash; also seen by some analysts as part of commonly used "powerful" marketing tactics. </p><p>"For patients who are on a basal-bolus regimen, the second teal-colored AllStar for use with Apidra (rapid-acting insulin) cartridges was launched in July 2014. This has also helped improve patient initiation and compliance," Sanofi said.</p><p>These efforts have clearly paid off. Lantus has a market share of 29.2% in the analog category and 13.1% in overall insulin market. In the basal analog market it commands a whopping 69% share. </p><p>Asked whether the apparent shift of a chunk of new patients in India to Tresiba at a steady pace has been a cause for concern, Sanofi underscored the "trust" Lantus has built amongst doctors and patients over many years, both worldwide and in India as well. </p><p>"The real cause for concern is the fact that almost 30 million diabetics are undiagnosed and 15 million are not in control of their condition. There is indeed a need for many patients to receive treatment, and therefore, offering scope for growth to insulins as a category," it added. In the analog category, Lantus continues to be at number one position. </p><h2>Programs</h2><p>Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi have also built strong programs around physician engagement and patient support. </p><p>Novo Nordisk's public-private partnership &ndash;the Changing Diabetes Barometer program - includes raising awareness of diabetes, building healthcare professionals&rsquo; capabilities and educating patients and has made strong strides in India. </p><p>"Here, the Novo Nordisk Education Foundation, state governments and other partners convene around enabling people with diabetes to live healthy lives. As of March 2015, the project has trained almost 3,000 healthcare professionals and reached out to over 650,000 people. The programme has had a high impact on breaking down the barriers to better diabetes care," Novo Nordisk said.</p><p>Similarly, Sanofi's Saath 7, which means ''together'' in Hindi, is one of the industry's longest- running patient support programs. The Saath 7 team of counsellors continues to support patients in their diabetes management, through home-visits, tele-counselling services and educational material as per guidance of treating physicians.</p><p>All eyes are also on <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Why-Novo-may-need-to-watch-Sanofis-Indian-sugar-clinics-play-354320%5d" target="_new">Sanofi's tie up with India's Apollo Hospitals group</a> to collaborate on the expansion of Apollo Sugar Clinics that provide integrated diabetes care programs in India. "The Apollo Sugar Clinics initiative is directly aligned to our vision of becoming a 360-degree partner in diabetes management in India," Sanofi said.</p>
