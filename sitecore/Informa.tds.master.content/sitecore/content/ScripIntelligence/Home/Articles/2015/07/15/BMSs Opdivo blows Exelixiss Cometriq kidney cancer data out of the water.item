<p>Just as Exelixis was finally basking in the glow of positive Phase III progression-free survival data for its anticancer Cometriq in renal cell carcinoma, Bristol-Myers Squibb rained on its parade by stopping the CheckMate-025 study early on positive overall survival data with its immuno-oncology giant Opdivo (nivolumab) in the same setting.</p><p>Exelixis announced earlier today that its multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor Cometriq (cabozantinib) had improved progression-free survival and was already showing hints that it might improve the all-important overall survival against everolimus (Novartis's Afinitor) in the Phase III METEOR study, in top-line data. </p><p>The data follow a major disappointment for Cometriq <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Major-setback-at-Exelixis-as-Cometriq-fails-in-prostate-cancer-353667" target="_new">last September</a>, when it failed to produce an overall survival benefit in the key indication of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the Phase III COMET-1 trial; this led to a 70% reduction in Exelixis's workforce. The product is already on the market for the much smaller indication of progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer, where sales were just $25.1m last year. After the mCRPC failure, renal cell carcinoma became its expected biggest earner. </p><p>But just an hour or so after Exelixis's announcement, BMS reported (in a tale of David vs Goliath gone wrong) that it had stopped early its open-label, Phase III study of Opdivo, also against everolimus in previously treated advanced or metastatic patients, because it had met its endpoint of better overall survival. </p><p>"The results of CheckMate-025 mark the first time an immuno-oncology agent has demonstrated a survival advantage in advanced renal cell carcinoma, a patient group that currently has limited treatment options," said BMS's senior vice president and head of development for oncology, Michael Giordano. He added that the company aimed "to redefine treatment expectations for patients with advanced RCC by providing improved survival". </p><p>These words will be cold-comfort for Exelixis, whose product so far, has only confirmed a PFS benefit over everolimus. Data from the first 375 patients out of a planned 658 in METEOR show that cabozantinib reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 42% compared with everolimus (hazard ratio=0.58, 95% CI 0.45-0.75, p<0.0001), as="" determined="" by="" an="" independent="" radiology="" committee.=""></0.0001),></p><p>Exelixis added that, while the overall survival data were still immature, a pre-specified interim analysis, triggered by the primary analysis for PFS, showed a trend favoring cabozantinib (HR=0.67, unadjusted 95% CI 0.51 - 0.89; p=0.005). The pre-specified p-value of 0.0019 to achieve statistical significance was not reached, but the trial will continue to the final OS analysis expected next year, Exelixis said. </p><p>President and CEO Dr Michael Morrissey added: "With these data now in hand, Exelixis's highest corporate priority becomes the submission of US and EU regulatory filings, which we intend to complete in early 2016." Shares in the firm initially nearly doubled to peak at $7.5 than on the news, but fell back following BMS's announcement. Nonetheless, they are still trading up by 42% at $5.55 in mid-morning trading on Nasdaq.</p><p>Analysts agree that all is not lost for Cometriq in RCC. Dr Colin White of Datamonitor Healthcare commented: "The news that Opdivo had improved OS in the second-line RCC setting has somewhat taken the wind from Cometriq&rsquo;s sales. The results of Cometriq&rsquo;s METEOR Phase III trial were positive and the reduction in risk of disease progression or death compared to Afinitor was impressive. Cometriq still looks set to have a role to play in the second-line setting but it has been overshadowed by Bristol-Myers Squibb's announcement that Opdivo improved OS in this setting. Cometriq has a trend towards improving OS but Opdivo has been shown to improve it in the same treatment setting against the same comparator and Opdivo now looks set to become the standard of care for patients in this setting."</p><p><p>
