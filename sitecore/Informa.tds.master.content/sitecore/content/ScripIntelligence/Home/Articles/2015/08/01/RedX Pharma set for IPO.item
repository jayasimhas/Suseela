<p>RedX Pharma, an expanding drug discovery company focused on the development of cancer therapeutics and anti-infectives, is aiming to raise &pound;20m (approximately $30.2m) through an initial public offering. </p><p>The company, established in 2010, said it intends to begin trading on the UK's AIM (Alternative Investment Market) and will use the proceeds from the IPO to progress its pipeline and support the launch of a third therapeutic subsidiary focused on immunology. </p><p>CEO Dr Neal Murray said: "The placing and admission to AIM is another important milestone in Redx's development. It will strengthen the business and support our objectives of progressing our programs and achieving early profitability."</p><p>He told <i>Scrip</i>: "The board has been discussing options over the last 12 months and we feel that the time is right to access the public markets&#8230;and we think that the AIM market is the best market for the company at its current stage of development."</p><p><i>Scrip</i> reported in our <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pharma-Grapevine-some-chairs-sack-the-CEO-others-just-break-354911" target="_new">Pharma Grapevine</a> column November last year that the UK company was considering a stock market listing; RedX had at the time made a series of promotions and appointments, including the addition of Dr Frank Armstrong as chair of the company. </p><p>Dr Murray thinks the market is in pretty good shape at the moment. "There were a number of biotech floats on AIM over the last 12 months and we look forward to joining that band," he said. </p><p>RedX's believes it is ideally positioned to address the need of established large pharmas to populate a shrinking pipeline. In the past RedX has worked with pharma partners as well as the UK's NHS, and academic institutions. In 2014, the firm signed deals with AstraZeneca and Pierre Fabre Laboratories. Its current pipeline consists of 13 programs, at different stages of development. </p><p>Shore Capital and Corporate Limited and Shore Capital Stockbrokers Limited are acting as nominated adviser and broker in relation to the offer.</p>
