<p>Stockholm-based Karolinska Development has announced that CEO Bruno Lucidi has left the company, less than four months after his permanent appointment to the position. Mr Lucidi's departure has been chalked-up to a "difference of opinion" between the former CEO and the company's board or directors over the implementation of the company's strategy. He has been replaced by deputy CEO Terje Kalland until a new, permanent CEO can be appointed, the company said. Karolinska has begun a search for a permanent successor. Mr Lucidi is also stepping down as CEO for KDev Oncology and Karolinska Development's portfolio companies Aprea and Akinion Pharmaceuticals.</p>
