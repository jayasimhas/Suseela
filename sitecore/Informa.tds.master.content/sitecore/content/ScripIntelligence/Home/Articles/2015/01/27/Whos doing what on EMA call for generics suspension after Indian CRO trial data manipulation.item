<p>The European Commission says that "within roughly a month" it will make its decision on the European Medicines Agency's recommendation that hundreds of formulations and strengths of generic medicines whose European marketing authorizations relied on clinical studies performed by Indian contract research organization GVK Biosciences be suspended in the EU. </p><p>Some member states &ndash; and some companies &ndash; have already taken interim measures to suspend medicines that appear on the 120-page list issued by the EMA. If the commission accepts the EMA's conclusions, all member states will be forced to act. "The decision will apply to all Member States irrespective of whether or not they have taken interim measures to suspend medicines," the commission told <i>Scrip's </i>sister publication<i> Scrip Regulatory Affairs</i>. </p><p>The EMA began its review in September 2014 of medicines for which authorization in the EU was primarily based on clinical studies conducted at GVK's site in Hyderabad, after an inspection by the French medicines agency (ANSM) revealed data manipulations in studies conducted at the site. The EU-wide review was requested by the commission so as to ensure a consistent approach throughout the EU to deal with the issues raised by the French inspection. All the products were approved nationally. The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) examined over 1,000 pharmaceutical forms and strengths of generic medicines. The CHMP cleared more than 300 of the products it examined as having sufficient supporting data from other sources. It recommended the suspension of the others, unless they are of critical importance because alternatives will not be able to meet patients' needs. </p><p>The list includes hundreds of dosage strengths and forms of tens of substances sold by around 100 companies across the EU. Companies include Actavis, Dr Reddy's, Glenmark, Generics (UK), Lupin, Mylan, Ranbaxy, ratiopharm, Sandoz, Teva, Torrent Pharma and Wockhardt. Medicines include atorvastatin, candesartan, clopidogrel, desloratadine, donepezil, escitalopram, esomeprazole, fluconazole, metformin and tacrolimus. For medicines that are considered critical, companies will be given 12 months to submit additional data. </p><p>It seems from the comments the commission gave to <i>SRA </i>that it will agree with the EMA. The review, the commission said, "ensures adequate reaction by the regulatory authorities based on robust scientific assessment of the facts". In terms of timing, the commission said: "In view of the conclusion of the [CHMP], which recommends suspension for a certain number of marketing authorizations, Commission services will proceed swiftly with the drafting of the Commission decision. This implies that the Commission would adopt its decision within roughly a month."</p><p>The commission reiterated the EMA's statement that there was "no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness with any of the medicines linked to studies conducted by GVK". Patients are advised to keep taking their medicines as prescribed.</p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>While the commission works on its decision, <i>SRA</i> has been looking at the reactions of some of players &ndash; GVK, regulators, generics companies with products on the list, generic medicines industry groups, and the Indian CRO sector.</p><p><u><b><u>GVK</u></b></u></p><p>The only party to comment on the merits of the CHMP decision appears to be GVK itself, which described the action as "unprecedented and highly disproportional". </p><p>The data concerns center on evidence of systematic manipulation of electrocardiogram records during the conduct of nine generic medicines studies over a period of at least five years. "Their systematic nature, the extended period of time during which they took place and the number of members of staff involved cast doubt on the integrity of the way trials were performed at the site generally and on the reliability of data generated at that site," said the EMA. </p><p>GVK argues that the EMA's recommendation is "highly disproportional" given that the ANSM had said that "the ECGs inspected are not essential given the demonstration of bioequivalence". The CRO also cites the ANSM as saying that "the observations made should not be extrapolated to other trial-related activities at the same site (bioanalytical, pharmacokinetic and statistical activities) or to [its] other site in Ahmedabad".</p><p>According to GVK, which describes itself as "Asia's leading CRO", the EMA has extrapolated the findings to all studies conducted at the Hyderabad facility "on basis of a 'doubt'". "There is no direct impact of 'check-out' ECGs [which are conducted before volunteers leave the clinic as an additional safety test] on the bioequivalence studies," insists GVK.</p><p>The EMA stands by its conclusions and notes that the current review applied only to generic medicines for which studies had been conducted at the Hyderabad site.</p><p><u><b><u>Teva</u></b></u></p><p>Teva was the most forthcoming of the generics companies contacted by <i>SRA</i>. It had, it said, "a total of one currently-marketed molecule&#8230; offered in two forms across a small number of markets" on the EMA's list. </p><p>Of the two forms, Teva withdrew one from the market in December. This was desloratadine 5mg film-coated tablets. "[It was] marketed only in France, [and] we complied with a French regulator request last month to cease supply." </p><p>The other form was desloratadine 2.5/5mg orodispersible tablets, which was marketed in EU countries including Austria, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Spain and Portugal. "We complied with a Belgian regulator request last month to cease supply there. For other markets, we have voluntarily decided to cease supply of this single product temporarily, until bioequivalence has been demonstrated."</p><p>Teva said it ceased supply "even though the advice we received from the European Medicines Agency confirms our own in-depth health risk assessment that this issue has no impact on patient safety." "Even so," the company added, "we will work closely with the authorities to resolve any potential issues prior to the reintroduction of the very small number of affected Teva products."</p><p><u><b><u>Sandoz</u></b></u></p><p>Sandoz also provided some detail. "The EMA has recommended suspension of European marketing authorizations that were granted on the basis of bioequivalence studies conducted at GVK Biosciences in Hyderabad, India. While this involves a substantial number of products across the industry, there is potential impact for three Sandoz products, including Trimetazidine, and Clobazam and Clonazepam which are both marketed only in the Netherlands. Like all companies affected, Sandoz will work with the relevant national authorities to identify the most appropriate course of action. Patient safety and well-being are our primary concern and will guide all of our decisions."</p><p><u><b><u>Mylan</u></b></u></p><p>Mylan said "a select number" of its products were affected. The company highlighted the EMA's assertion about there being no evidence of harm or lack of effectiveness relating to the medicines involved and the agency's advice that patients continue to take their medicines as prescribed. </p><p>"At Mylan, we are committed to enforcing one high global quality standard and have a more than 50 year track record of providing access to high quality medicine," the company told <i>SRA</i>. "We have collaborated with European and national authorities to address this issue with the best interest of patients in mind.&rdquo; </p><p><u><b><u>Dr Reddy's</u></b></u></p><p>Dr Reddy's said it was "currently in the silent period and would not be able to respond to your query". It suggested it would be in a position to respond in the first week of February.</p><p><u><b><u>Actavis</u></b><b><u>/</u></b><b><u>BGMA</u></b></u></p><p>Actavis in the UK said it was referring all enquiries to the British Generic Manufacturers Association, "as this is an Industry matter".</p><p>The BGMA provided this statement from its director general, Warwick Smith: &ldquo;Patient safety and quality of medicines are critically important priorities for our members and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole. We have created the Quality Forum in the UK where our members, their suppliers and the MHRA can discuss issues and act pre-emptively to drive medicines quality. We maintain regular dialogue with regulators and will continue to work with them if precautionary suspension measures are recommended due to the GVK Biosciences investigation to ensure the broadest possible continuous access to safe and effective medicines for British patients.&rdquo;</p><p><u><b><u>Member state regulators</u></b></u></p><p>In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it would await the commission's decision but stressed that the EMA action was precautionary. If the recommendation is adopted, "we will work with our colleagues at the Department of Health to ensure people have access to the medicines they need," said Dr Samantha Atkinson, deputy director of the MHRA's inspection, enforcement and standards.</p><p>Other member states including Germany, France, Belgium and Luxembourg had already suspended products. Germany's regulator BfARM is reported to view the EMA announcement as an endorsement of its own decision last December to ban the sale of 80 generic drugs on account of "substantial deficiencies" in clinical trials conducted by GVK.</p><p>Italian regulatory AIFA said that its technical-scientific committee had decided "as a precautionary measure to begin procedures to suspend the products identified by the EMA that are marketed in our country". The agency commented that the products in question represented only a &ldquo;marginal share&rdquo; of the Italian market. </p><p><u><b><u>India's regulator</u></b></u></p><p>The Indian regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. In the wake of the German action, it was reported that the CDSCO had initiated its own investigation. </p><p><u><b><u>EGA</u></b></u></p><p>In the wake of the EMA recommendation, the European Generic medicines Association called for a strengthening of international inspection capabilities in the area of good clinical practices (GCP) "in order to avoid such issues affecting multiple companies in the future".</p><p>The EGA said that it valued and supported a strong EU GCP and good laboratory practices (GLP) system "as a cornerstone for ensuring the quality of the clinical data supporting marketing authorisations". It wants "a renewed dialogue" with the EMA, the co-ordination group for mutual recognition and decentralised procedures &ndash; Human (CMDh) and EU member state competent authorities on the oversight of GCP and GLP compliance for clinical trials.</p><p><u><b><u>I</u></b><b><u>S</u></b><b><u>CR</u></b></u></p><p>The Indian Society for Clinical Research has defended the quality of drug research being conducted in India. While it could not comment on the specifics of the GVK case, the ISCR told <i>Scrip</i> that such incidents should "not be allowed to tarnish the image of India as a high quality destination" for clinical research. The ISCR's members include several leading foreign firms and clinical research organizations.</p><h2>No other referrals</h2><p>Asked whether any other investigations similar to the probe into GVK were under way, in India or elsewhere, the EMA said that "information about ongoing inspections is confidential as it would undermine the purpose of such inspections".</p><p>This CHMP review followed a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83, which deals with matters of EU interest regarding quality, safety or efficacy. The EMA told <i>SRA</i> that, in terms of referrals to the CHMP, "there is no other such referral ongoing at this time". </p><p><p><p>
