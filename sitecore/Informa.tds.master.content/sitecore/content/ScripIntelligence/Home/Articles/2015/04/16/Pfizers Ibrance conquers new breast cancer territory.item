<p>Pfizer's new CDK4 and 6 inhibitor Ibrance (palbociclib) has hit its progression-free survival primary endpoint in the Phase III PALOMA-3 study in a new breast cancer population, stopping the trial early.</p><p>The drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-wins-early-Ibrance-approval-in-breast-cancer-356525" target="_new">received accelerated US FDA approval in February</a>, two months ahead of schedule, for use in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole (Novartis's Femara) as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease.</p><p>Now it has shown top-line efficacy, this time in combination with AstraZeneca's estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant (Faslodex), in delaying further disease progression in the second-line setting: ie, in women with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer following disease progression during or after endocrine therapy.</p><p>The adverse events seen with the palbociclib/fulvestrant combination in PALOMA-3 were generally consistent with their known adverse event profiles, Pfizer said. The full data will be presented at ASCO. </p><p>Pfizer is now talking to health authorities regarding its regulatory path in this additional indication. The accelerated approval in the first-line setting was based on PFS data from the Phase II PALOMA-1 trial, and its efficacy needs to be verified in a confirmatory Phase III trial, PALOMA-2, which is now fully enrolled. </p><h2>added benefit</h2><p>Credit Suisse analysts say the new data should drive much broader uptake of the product. "The initial Ibrance prescription data has been very encouraging and should allow for upside to current estimates, at least in the near-term. However, our due diligence suggests that Ibrance use to date has been limited predominantly to medical centers and select thought leaders while many physicians have been waiting for more robust Phase III data sets on the product before adopting it broadly in their practice."</p><p>Analyst Mark Schoenebaum at Evercore ISI said the new data were not likely to add much to Ibrance's peak sales by themselves "as most patients will elect to instead take Ibrance first line rather than second line &ndash; but this trial should in the short term only add to what already appears a strong early launch by adding second line patients (and facilitating payers' reimbursement of 2nd line patients)".</p><p>He added that the trial adds to the overall probability of success for confirmatory PALOMA-2 study supporting full approval in the first-line setting. This event-driven trial is expected to report sometime in late 2015.</p><p>Ibrance is the first CDK inhibitor to reach the market and its potential is seen as boosting efficacy in indications where current therapy is less than adequate. In the PALOMA-1 trial it increased PFS by 10 months, compared with the letrozole-only arm: 20.2 months vs 10.2 months. </p><p>Consensus peak sales for the product are around $3.8bn in 2020. </p><p>Other CDK inhibitors in development are trailing palbociclib by some years. Lilly's abemaciclib (LY2835219) and Novartis's ribociclib (LEE011) are both in Phase III for breast cancer </p><p>"Beyond [the PALOMA] studies, we look for data in other tumor types and from combination studies, as well as developments from competitors in the CDK-4,6 space (Lilly, Novartis) to more fully appreciate the long-term potential of the drug and the class," said the Credit Suisse analysts.</p><p><p>
