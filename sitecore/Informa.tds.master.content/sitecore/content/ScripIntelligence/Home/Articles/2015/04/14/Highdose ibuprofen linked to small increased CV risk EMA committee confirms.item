<p>A European Medicines Agency committee has confirmed that there is a small increase in the risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks and stroke in patients taking high doses &ndash; 2,400mg or more &ndash; of ibuprofen, and has recommended that the labelling of products containing the anti-inflammatory drug should be updated to reflect this risk.</p><p>The Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) said that the risk with high-dose ibuprofen was similar to that seen with some other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDSs) including diclofenac and the COX-2 inhibitors, and concluded that the benefits of ibuprofen continue to outweigh its risks. </p><p>But it said that doses over 2,400mg should be avoided in patients with serious underlying heart or circulatory problems such as heart failure and heart disease, and in those who have previously had a heart attack or stroke. </p><p>It added that doctors should carefully assess a patient&rsquo;s risk factors for heart or circulatory conditions before starting long-term treatment with ibuprofen, particularly if high doses are required. Risk factors for these conditions include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes and high blood cholesterol, the committee advised.</p><p>The PRAC also looked at data on the interaction between ibuprofen and low-dose aspirin when the latter is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. It noted that ibuprofen has been shown in lab studies to reduce the anti-clotting effects of aspirin, although "it remains uncertain whether long-term use of ibuprofen in clinical practice reduces the benefits of low-dose aspirin in preventing heart attacks and strokes," the EMA said. Occasional use of ibuprofen should not affect the benefits of low-dose aspirin, it added.</p><p>It therefore recommended that updated advice on the cardiovascular risk of high-dose ibuprofen be included in the product information of ibuprofen medicines, along with information on the available evidence on the interaction between ibuprofen and aspirin. </p><p>The recommendations for ibuprofen also apply to dexibuprofen &ndash; a high dose of this product is 1,200mg per day or more.</p><p>All medicines containing ibuprofen are authorized nationally, so the PRAC's recommendation will be sent to the co-ordination group for the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures (CMDh), which will adopt a final position. If the CMDh reaches agreement by consensus, it will be directly implemented by those member states where the products are authorized for marketing, but if the vote is only by majority, the European Commission will take a legally binding EU-wide decision.</p><h2>Not the first review</h2><p>This is far from the first inquiry into the cardiovascular safety of ibuprofen: two previous reviews of the non-selective NSAID class, including ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac, were conducted in 2005 and 2006, and led the EMA to conclude that despite a risk of thrombotic events, the products' benefit-risk balance remained positive. </p><p>These findings were confirmed in a further review in 2012, when the EMA's scientific committee, the CHMP, said that current treatment advice on ibuprofen and naproxen "adequately reflects the knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of these medicines", although the latest evidence "appears to show a consistent but small increase in the risk of cardiovascular side-effects for diclofenac compared with other NSAIDs, similar to the risks of COX-2 inhibitors".</p><p>But worries emerged about the CV risks associated with the use of high doses of ibuprofen. The PRAC began its review in June 2014 after the UK regulator, the MHRA, triggered a referral as a result of "concerns that high doses of ibuprofen could have a similar cardiovascular risk to that of COX-2 inhibitors and diclofenac", the EMA said. The review was based on data on ibuprofen from various publications including combined analyses of numerous clinical trials and data from population-based studies. </p>
