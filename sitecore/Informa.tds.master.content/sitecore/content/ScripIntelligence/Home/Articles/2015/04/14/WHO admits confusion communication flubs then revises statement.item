<p>Leaders of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 20 April admitted the group was ill-prepared to handle a large and sustained disease outbreak like the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, in which about 26,000 people have been infected with the virus and more than 10,700 have died. </p><p>Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, her deputy director and the organization's regional leaders said they had "learned lessons of humility" and "seen that old diseases in new contexts consistently spring new surprises."</p><p>The director-general and her colleagues said they had "taken serious note of the criticisms of the organization" that "the initial WHO response was slow and insufficient, we were not aggressive in alerting the world, our surge capacity was limited, we did not work effectively in coordination with other partners, there were shortcomings in risk communications, and there was confusion of roles and responsibilities at the three levels of the organization."</p><p>WHO's leaders also fessed up to their "shortcomings in risk communications," and said "there was confusion of roles and responsibilities at the three levels of the organization."</p><p>But an hour after that statement was sent to reporters on 20 April, WHO sent out a revised version, omitting much of what was admitted to in the original copy.</p><p>In both versions of the statement, which was released on 20 April but was dated 16 April, the WHO leaders said "we have learned the importance of communication &ndash; of communicating risks early, of communicating more clearly what is needed and of involving communities and their leaders in the messaging."</p><p>The revisions to the statement were reminiscent of a report leaked this past October, in which WHO officials acknowledged "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."</p><p>But they quickly backed away from that report and said it was an unfinished, unedited version.</p><p>The report they ended up <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-defends-Ebola-actions-condemns-worlds-failures-356174" target="_new">releasing in January</a> took a much more defensive tone, in which WHO defended its actions and condemned the world for failing to heed recommendations issued more than four years ago by a panel convened by the health group to strengthen public health emergency preparedness.</p><p>In the 20 April statement, the WHO leaders made several pledges to improve the organization's processes for handling outbreaks, including better engaging with national authorities and asking them to keep prevention, preparedness and response management at the top of national and global agendas.</p><p>Dr Chan and her colleagues vowed to develop the capacity to respond rapidly and effectively to disease outbreaks and humanitarian emergencies, but acknowledged such a feat would require bringing together the world's resources.</p><p>The WHO leaders said they would establish a contingency fund to enable the organization to better respond to disease crises. </p><p>"We must ensure adequate resources &ndash; domestic and international - are available before the next outbreak," they said.</p><p>But they also issued a list of tasks they expected world leaders to address, including taking disease threats seriously, remaining vigilant and being transparent in reporting information. </p><p>"This Ebola outbreak is far from over, and we must sustain our support to the affected countries until the outbreak is over, in the face of increasing complacency and growing fatigue," the WHO leaders said.</p><p>They also urged global leaders to "engage to re-establish the services, systems and infrastructure which have been devastated in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone."</p><p>Lastly, the WHO chiefs called for more investment in research and development for drugs, vaccines and diagnostics to address neglected diseases with outbreak potential.</p><p>WHO leaders had earlier blasted the biopharmaceutical industry &ndash; declaring Ebola a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-A-market-failure-353355" target="_new">market failure</a>" and calling drug and vaccine makers a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/WHO-chief-blasts-biopharma-over-Ebola-failures-354828" target="_new">profit-driven industry</a>" that "does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay," such as West Africa.</p><p>Now, though, WHO is working with biopharmas to try to get Ebola drugs and vaccines tested in West Africa, but recently acknowledged the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-Ebola-remains-emergency-vaccine-trials-a-challenge-357842" target="_new">challenge</a> in doing so now that the virus is waning.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
