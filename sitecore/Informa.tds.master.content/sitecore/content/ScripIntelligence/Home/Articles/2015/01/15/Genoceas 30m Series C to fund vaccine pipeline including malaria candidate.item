<p>Next-generation vaccine developer Genocea Biosciences has raised $30 million in a Series C venture capital round that included an investment by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to advance the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's early-stage malaria programme.</p><p>Genocea's therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines are designed to induce a T-cell immune response to pathogens. The company's lead product candidate GEN-003 is a therapeutic vaccine to reduce recurrence and transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), but its government-backed and non-profit-funded malaria and pneumococcus programmes are in preclinical development.</p><p>Genocea's Antigen Lead Acquisition System (ATLAS) technology platform allows for rapid discovery of antigens that stimulate CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells to generate disease-specific cellular immune responses and long-term T-cell memory. The company believes that T-cell immune responses as well as B-cell responses induced by current vaccines are both necessary to protect against and treat viral infections.</p><p>The high-throughput ATLAS platform allows Genocea to overcome at least two of the challenges associated with T-cell vaccine development: 1) identification of the best T-cell antigens for eliciting immune responses to specific pathogens when T-cells have thousands of antigens to choose from; and 2) selecting a T-cell antigen that can provoke an immune response across diverse populations.</p><p>Genocea CEO Chip Clark said the lion's share of the company's Series C funding will support GEN-003, which includes the antigens ICP-4 and gD2 as well as the proprietary adjuvant Matrix-M, licensed from Isconova. The vaccine is in the middle of a 150-patient Phase I/II safety and immunogenicity study and topline data are expected later this year.</p><p>"Our aim is to show that we can affect the disease in people who already have it," Mr Clark said.</p><p>If it wins US FDA approval, Genocea claims that GEN-003 will be the first therapeutic vaccine to address an infectious disease. The company plans to begin the first human clinical trial in 2013 for GEN-004, its prophylactic pneumococcus vaccine, which has funding from the international non-profit organisation PATH (the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/PATH-strikes-more-pneumococcal-vaccine-alliances-1333" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 7 August 2008</a>).</p><p>Mr Clark said there are some good pneumococcus vaccines on the market, such as Pfizer's Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]), but "we think we need something to cover more people better."</p><p>GEN-004 is designed to cover all serotypes of pneumococcus rather than the select strains addressed by existing vaccines. The Genocea vaccine is based on a mechanism of T-cell immunity called Th27, which protects against infectious disease colonisation in mucosal tissue. It was discovered by a research team led by Dr Richard Malley of Children's Hospital Boston, who is a member of Genocea's scientific advisory board.</p><h2>malaria vaccine</h2><p>The company entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the Naval Medical Research Center in 2010 to identify antigens that will be used to develop a vaccine candidate against <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> for the prevention of malaria. The US Army Medical Research and Material Command provided a $2.7 million grant to fund rapid T-cell antigen discovery using human T-cell screens of a <i>P falciparum</i> proteomic library.</p><p>Mr Clark said the Gates Foundation's investment in the Series C round, which includes funding as well as access to recent malaria research, will "significantly expand the effort."</p><p>"The Gates Foundation is sponsoring multiple trials around the world that try to understand the immune response to malaria. We will get samples from those trials to use as a basis for finding a T-cell antigen," he said.</p><p>Since Genocea's pneumococcus programme is backed by PATH, which gets funding from the Gates Foundation, the company began seeking support from the foundation a few years ago. "This is the culmination of those efforts," Mr Clark said.</p><p>Gates Foundation president of global health Trevor Mundel said in a statement from Genocea: "T-cell innovation of this kind presents an intriguing opportunity to advance our global health mission through development of a new class of vaccines."</p><p>It's too early for Genocea to speculate about when it will begin clinical development for the malaria programme.</p><p>"But what we have shown with our HSV program, and what we hopefully will show with our pneumococcus program, is that we can go from the white board to an [investigational new drug (IND) application] in about four years. If that holds, in a couple of years we might be poised for an IND. That's a little bit aspirational though, because malaria is an especially tricky pathogen," Mr Clark said.</p><p>The Gates Foundation and CVF, an affiliate of Henry Crown and Company, were new investors for Genocea in its Series C round. All of the company's existing investors also participated in the venture funding round, including Polaris Venture Partners, Lux Capital, SR One, Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, Skyline Ventures, Cycad Group, Auriga Partners, MP Healthcare Ventures and Morningside. </p><p>Genocea has accessed $76 million of its equity financing raised since 2009, which included a $23 million Series A round in 2009 and a $35 million Series B round in 2011 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Genocea-raises-23-million-and-appoints-new-CEO-115941" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 20 February 2009</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Genocea-raises-35-million-for-T-cell-vaccine-pipeline-308008" target="_new">4 January 2011</a>).</p><p>
