<p>Europe needs better pricing systems for so-called value added medicines if the market for such products is to be sustainable or attractive, Warrick Smith, director general of the British Generic Manufacturers Association, the BGMA, told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Value added medicines are the fruit of what has traditionally been called incremental innovation. They are known molecules adapted to bring more benefits to patients to improve health outcomes. They may, for example, have better delivery systems, like transdermal patches, or they might combine two molecules, reducing the pill burden for patients. Many, like biosimilars or combination products, also carry a brand name. </p><p>Companies with value added products are finding it difficult to secure a fair price that reflects them. The problem is that pricing and reimbursement systems don't accommodate these products, which fit somewhere in between systems designed to cater for low-cost generics and expensive monopoly brands. In the UK, for example, they fall somewhere in between Scheme M, for managing the commodity generics market, and the PPRS, for managing new innovative drugs. In the absence of any suitable mechanism, manufacturers are negotiating their prices through the PPRS (which allows free pricing only for new chemical entities). </p><p>"If you bring a new medicine to the market, but not a new molecule, it doesn't get free pricing under the PPRS so you have to negotiate a price in an environment that wasn't designed for that sort of product," said Smith. This brings certain challenges. Manufacturers of combination products have found that the molecules in the new pill are priced separately, but there is no bench mark for pricing the new presentation that took millions of pounds to develop. And although there is a benefit for the patient, there is no means of quantifying that benefit, and "the discussion takes place in a vacuum", said Smith.</p><p>Industry is just beginning to "get its head round the problem", so the way forward could still be two or three years off, especially if sizeable changes to existing systems are needed, said Smith. One idea has been for a sort of health technology appraisal, but Smith thinks this would be too complex for such products.</p><p>The EGA, The European Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association, has recognized the issue and is on the case. In June it announced a new working party, the EVA, the European Value Added medicines group, which will work towards solutions that ensure the market for these products remains attractive. </p><p>"The EVA will be the leading voice of a broad-multi-stakeholder coalition supporting value-added medicines in Europe, engaging with patients and healthcare professionals in response to their needs and with payers to increase access to high quality and sustainable innovation for patients across Europe and worldwide," said Adrian van den Hoven, the EGA's director general, in a statement. </p><p>
