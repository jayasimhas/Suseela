<p>Miami-based Brickell Biotech is licensing its BBI-4000, a novel, topical soft-anticholinergic in development for patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, to Japan's Kaken Pharmaceuticals. Kaken will have the rights to develop and commercialize the drug in Japan &ndash; the world's second biggest dermatology market &ndash; and some other Asian countries. In return, the Japanese firm will pay Brickell an upfront sum and milestone payments based on certain objectives. Tiered royalties based on sales will also be paid to Brickell following launch. No further terms of the agreement have been released. BBI-4000 is an anticholinergic, which works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a molecule that transmits the signals within the nervous system responsible for a number of functions, including activating the sweat glands. Soft-anticholinergics like BBI-4000 exert their action topically and are metabolized rapidly into a less active metabolite when they reach the blood system. It is thought this could allow effective doses to be used without the limiting systemic side-effects associated with other drugs in this class. Brickell is a clinical-stage company that focuses on developing and commercializing innovative drugs for skin diseases. Kaken is a specialty pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in dermatology and orthopedics. Its main R&D focus is on inflammation, immunology, pain and antifungals.</p><p>
