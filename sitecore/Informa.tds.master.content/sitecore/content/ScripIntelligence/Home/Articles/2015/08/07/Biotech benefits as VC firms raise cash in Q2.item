<p>US venture capital firms raised $10.3bn during the second quarter of 2015 &ndash; the highest quarterly total since the fourth quarter of 2007, according to the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) &ndash; and roughly $2bn of the newly raised cash may be invested in biotechnology companies.</p><p>Three biotech-focused VC funds raised almost $1.2bn combined during the second quarter: Clarus Ventures closed a $500m fund in June; MPM Capital concluded a $400m fundraising; and Atlas Venture revealed a new $280m fund. Most of that will be invested in biopharmaceutical firms, although medical device, diagnostics and digital health companies could benefit as well.</p><p>NVCA used data from Thompson Reuters to determine that the largest VC fund to raise cash between April and June was a $2.8bn pool of money assembled by New Enterprise Associates (NEA), which told <i>Scrip</i> after the firm raised a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-2.6bn-NEA-venture-fund-could-invest-650m-in-biopharma-333216" target="_new">$2.6bn fund</a> in 2012 that a third of its capital is invested in health care. Most of that money is reserved for biopharma, meaning roughly $700m from the new fund could be invested in therapeutics companies.</p><p>The $10.3bn raised in the second quarter by venture funds that will invest across all sorts of industries represented a 39% increase from the first quarter when VC firms garnered $7.4bn. The second quarter total was 27% higher than the $8.1bn raised during the April-to-June period in 2014, which VCs will invest in biotech, information technology, energy, consumer-oriented and other startup companies.</p><p>"If this pace continues, we are certainly on track to surpass total fundraising for all of 2014 in what we hope is a more favorable environment across the venture industry, not just isolated at the top among a few firms," NVCA president and CEO Bobby Franklin said in the organization's quarterly report on fundraising.</p><p>Mr Franklin noted that institutional investors increasingly are putting capital into VC funds, contributing to the second quarter's strong performance.</p><p><b>Biotech bonanza</b></p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Clarus has more than $1.7bn under management after raising its $500m fund, which exceed the firm's $375m goal. The firm's managing director Robert Liptak said in a statement that the capital came from prior Clarus backers as well as "a select group of new investors." </p><p>The new fund will invest $15m to $50m per opportunity in therapeutics developers and "R&D risk-sharing partnerships" between pharma and biotech companies.</p><p>Flagship Ventures, which announced a new $537m fund at the end of the first quarter of this year, also boasted that it had outstanding interest from new and existing investors. Flagship closed its fund with "nearly twice the amount of capital we had initially sought, and in record time," the firm's senior managing partner and CEO Dr Noubar Afeyan said on 26 March. The last time Flagship raised money was when the firm put together a $269m fund in 2010.</p><p>Flagship and SV Life Sciences may act as bookends on the successful biotech VC fundraising in the second quarter. SV is in the process of raising a sixth fund totaling $400m fund, according to a 26 May filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which would bring its capital under management to $2.3bn. The new fund will be something to watch for in the third quarter or later this year. </p><p><b>Where has the money gone?</b></p><p>MPM Capital's investments are focused on drug, device and diagnostics companies, such as the now-public companies BioMarin, Conatus Pharmaceuticals, Epizyme, Verastem and Idenix Pharmaceuticals. <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-in-3.85bn-Idenix-buy-to-bolster-hep-C-outlook-352208" target="_new">Merck bought Idenix</a> for $3.85bn in 2014. Recent MPM investments include <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/iPierian-spin-out-brings-in-35m-Series-B-357695" target="_new">True North Therapeutics</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Diabetes-start-up-brings-in-cash-and-a-partner-357467" target="_new">Semma Therapeutics</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-PhaseBio-closes-40m-Series-C-round-led-by-AstraZeneca-plus-five-other-VC-financings-357270" target="_new">Vascular Pharmaceuticals</a>.</p><p>Atlas previously backed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Nimbus-transitions-to-clinical-development-raises-43m-357362" target="_new">Nimbus</a> Therapeutics, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/G1-Revolution-lead-116m-in-new-VC-funding-356563" target="_new">Lysosomal</a> Therapeutics and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Padlock-raises-23m-for-new-autoimmune-disease-approach-355771" target="_new">Padlock</a> Therapeutics, among many others. Atlas partner Bruce Booth told <i>Scrip</i> in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-raised-6bn-in-2014-venture-capital-most-since-2007-356200" target="_new">January</a> that Atlas likes to use its money to start companies run by biotech veterans charged with developing technology licensed out of academia.</p><p><p><p><p>
