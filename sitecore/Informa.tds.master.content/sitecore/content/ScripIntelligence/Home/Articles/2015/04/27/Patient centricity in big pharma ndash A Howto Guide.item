<p>Pharma needs to change in order to keep up with patients who are becoming increasingly empowered and connected, and are driving wider healthcare decisions, says Sanofi's chief patient officer Anne Beal. </p><p>Dr Beal was appointed head of Sanofi's patient needs in <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Rise-of-the-patient-affairs-officer-sanofi-makes-appointment-350960" target="_new">March last year</a>, when she became the first chief officer in this field for a top-ten pharma company. The role was created at Sanofi because "increasingly the pharmaceutical industry needs to recognize that patients are critical customers for us. We have to make sure we are responsive to the needs of the ultimate end user of our products &ndash; patients," she told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>While <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Scrip-100-UCBs-Lode-Dewulf-We-can-and-should-talk-to-patients-350788" target="_new">other pharmaceutical companies</a> are already following this path, Sanofi is the first of the "big pharmas" to fully embrace the idea and create this kind of position. Joining from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI), the largest research institute focused on patient-centered outcomes research in the US, Dr Beal believes this kind of senior position in patient engagement will be increasingly common. "The focus on patient centricity is going to become the new standard and the new norm within the industry."</p><p>"In many ways I call myself 'chief change officer'," Dr Beal said, as she explained to <i>Scrip</i> how exactly Sanofi is managing the shift to becoming a patient-centric organization. </p><p>At the moment, she says, pharma is in the midst of a relationship change: "From one where we have a product and we're trying to sell it, to a relationship where we are all working together to reach better patient outcomes."</p><p>And though Dr Beal feels the industry has made "some good inroads" into working with patients and becoming patient-centric, she thinks it must evolve still further. </p><p>Dr Beal highlighted that patient centricity is a stepping stone for improving pharma's often poor image in the public eye. "I think patient engagement will help in terms of the pharmaceutical industry's reputation but I do think it is something that we have to very genuine about in our approach. We have to be willing to talk about both the good and bad sides."</p><p>One year into the role at Sanofi, Dr Beal is most proud of the patient-centric framework the company has developed, a strategy that was created with the help of patients and advocacy groups through four days of meetings. "We asked for patients' input and guidance because in order for us to really be patient-centric we need to walk the walk while we talk the talk &ndash; which is to ask patients if the plans we are making are really relevant to them."</p><p>Sanofi uses a three pillar plan to implement the patient view into its projects: </p><ul><li>Understanding &ndash; to be focused on gaining insight to make sure a project really meets patient needs</li><li>Solutions &ndash; developing products that fit into patients' lives </li><li>Culture and community &ndash; building an organization where internally every employee feels they are working for the patient </li></ul><p>But implementing a patient-centric strategy at the big pharma hasn't been an easy feat. Dr Beal, who trained as a pediatrician and public health specialist, said the most challenging part of her job over the last 12 months has been Sanofi's diversity and size. </p><p>"We are a large company; I find it a challenge our organization is so large. When you speak about a plan for North America, it's going to be very different from thinking about working with patients in China. It's also very different working with patients with autoimmune conditions than it is working with patients with, say, diabetes. Trying to come up with a framework that is relevant in a variety of different settings, that was one of the biggest challenges we had," she said. </p><p>In order to combat the issue of serving multiple patient groups in many regions, Sanofi implemented a set of principles each unit of the French drug maker could "gel into their own specific areas".</p><p>"We didn't want to be too specific and we wanted these principles to act like an internal coach for Sanofi staff," Dr Beal explained. The four principles Sanofi uses are:</p><ul><li><b>Transparency</b> &ndash; "To be sure we are working to the needs of different patient populations and to be transparent as to what it is we are trying to achieve."</li><li><b>Partnership</b> &ndash; "Often we talk about what we are doing to do to patients or for them or on behalf of patients, and we want to change that to be about what we are doing with patients." </li><li><b>Learning and improvement</b> &ndash; "People should try different projects but they should be ruthless in terms of assessment and try things and determine whether they are working. We want to be really rigorous in what we are trying to achieve and be critical." </li><li><b>Outcomes and impact</b> &ndash; "We want to make sure the work we are doing isn't just feel good work, what we want is to have a clear line of sight of how these activities are improving patient outcomes."</li></ul><p>She added that the model is flexible enough for local adaptation but provided a structure, which allowed Sanofi to be coherent in the work it was doing across the organization.</p><p>"Patient centricity has to be the thing you do when no one else is looking, it has to be adopted and thought about by everyone in the company and it has to become the standard for how to do that work," Dr Beal said. </p><p>"For those thinking about whether to do it or not, I would encourage them to go for it," she said, adding that companies looking to go patient-centric should also to look at how others are doing it. "This is an area of expertise we are trying to grow within the industry."</p>
