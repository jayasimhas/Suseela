<p>UK life science startups, particularly therapeutic and medtech firms, have a new &pound;50m fund to vie for as investment firm Imperial Innovations has acquired a new loan facility. </p><p>London-based Imperial Innovations has secured a &pound;50m committed loan facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB), which it will use to invest in existing and new portfolio companies. It is the second loan the investment company has secured with EIB, after it agreed a &pound;30m loan in 2013. </p><p>The investment firm will only be seeking new companies based in the UK. Historically Imperial Innovations has focused on investment in startups coming from universities in the "Golden triangle" &ndash; Oxford, Cambridge and London. It likes to focus on this region because it believes "proximity" is key to a startup business' success. A spokesperson for Imperial Innovations told Scrip, "When investing in a new business we like to be influential and involved. We don't think that is as easily done if you have to keep jumping on a plane to visit the business."</p><p>However, more recently the investment group has joined forces with research groups, such as Cancer Research UK, and entrepreneurial startups, still in the UK. The spokesperson told <i>Scrip </i>it seeks out projects with "strong intellectual property" attached. He also noted that while Imperial Innovations "doesn't want to limit itself," the group has a specific interest in immune-oncology and immunology. "We seek portfolio therapeutic companies in areas of high unmet need but with sizable market opportunities." </p><p>As of 31 January 2015, Imperial Innovations' portfolio of companies was valued at &pound;262m, with drug makers and medtech businesses representing 72.9% of that value. Some of its existing portfolio companies include: clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Circassia; cell therapy company Cell Medica, which is focused on immune reconstitution and the prevention and treatment of infections acquired by immunosuppressed patients following bone marrow transplant; and cancer focused UK biotech PsiOxus Therapeutics. </p><p>Jonathan Taylor, vice-president of EIB said in a statement, "Investment in knowledge driven and highly skilled sectors is crucial to strengthen Europe's long-term global competitiveness. Imperial Innovations has set a benchmark for transforming cutting-edge research into some of the UK&rsquo;s most exciting early stage biotech and medtech companies."</p>
