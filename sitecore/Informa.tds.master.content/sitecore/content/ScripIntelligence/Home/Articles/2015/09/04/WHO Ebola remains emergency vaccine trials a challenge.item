<p>Even though there's been a steep decline in the number of Ebola cases in West Africa, the outbreak continues to constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a special emergency committee on Ebola for the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on 10 April.</p><p>Dr Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general at WHO, reported there were 25,532 Ebola cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, with 10,584 people now dead from the disease since the epidemic first started in December 2013.</p><p>But, he said, in the past week, there were only 30 confirmed cases of Ebola &ndash; the lowest weekly total since mid-May 2014. </p><p>Case incidence in Guinea decreased to 21, versus 57 a week earlier. Sierra Leone reported a fifth consecutive weekly decrease &ndash; dropping to nine, from 25 the previous week.</p><p>Liberia again reported no confirmed cases.</p><p>But while the rapid decline in Ebola cases is a significant advance in the fight against the disease, it's bad for the pursuit to find a safe and effective vaccine to combat the virus for future outbreaks, Dr Aylward acknowledged.</p><p>"The biggest concern would be the risk of not being able to get a definitive answer as to the clinical efficacy of these vaccines to prevent disease," he told reporters during 10 April media briefing.</p><p>Indeed, the National Institutes of Health has admitted that because there have been no new cases in Liberia in recent weeks, it would be a struggle to get the 27,000 planned volunteers in that country for the Phase III PREVAIL study of two experimental Ebola vaccines &ndash; cAd3-EBOZ, which is being developed by the agency's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and GlaxoSmithKline, and VSV-ZEBOV, a product initially developed by the Canadian government, which licensed the vaccine to NewLink Genetics, now partnered with Merck.</p><p>The Phase II portion of the PREVAIL study <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-vaccines-safe-but-quandary-for-Liberia-efficacy-enrollment-357521" target="_new">reported positive safety</a> results late last month.</p><p>But Dr Cliff Lane, deputy director for clinical research at the NIAID, told <i>Scrip</i> last month he suspected the Phase III portion <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">would need to be moved</a> to potentially Sierra Leone or Guinea &ndash; with the latter country the likely choice.</p><p>But there already are studies ongoing or planned in both of those countries, which could make enrollment in those trials and an expanded PREVAIL study tricky.</p><p>Indeed, the WHO late last month <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-ring-study-starts-in-Guinea-357504" target="_new">initiated</a> its 10,000-volunteer Phase III "ring" trial testing the NewLink-Merck rVSV Ebola vaccine in Coyah prefecture, Guinea, in which contacts of infected patients are identified and vaccinated &ndash; creating a "ring of immunity" around them to stop the virus from spreading.</p><p>Dr Aylward insisted the ring study was the "most likely to generate a meaningful answer" &ndash; a conclusion for which NIAID's Dr Lane has reportedly disagreed.</p><p>Dr Aylward said seven rings have been enrolled already in the WHO trial. But with a target of over 100 rings for the study, he acknowledged "there's still a challenge even to get a full answer from that trial."</p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also is testing rVSV in its 6,000-volunteer Phase II/III <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">STRIVE</a> trial in Sierra Leone.</p><p>But even if the Phase III studies are not able to meet their enrollment goals, Dr Aylward said he was optimistic the animal studies and safety and immunogenicity data that's been generated may suffice. </p><p>"It's not like we have no data on these vaccines," Dr Aylward declared. </p><p>Nonetheless, he said the issue of completing the Phase IIIs in humans "will be a challenge." </p><p><b>Recommendations</b></p><p>With the Ebola outbreak remaining a global public health concern, the WHO's special committee reemphasized the need to continue to reinforce active surveillance in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, particularly in the border areas.</p><p>The WHO panel also reaffirmed the need to avoid unnecessary interference with international travel and transport.</p><p>The committee said it was very concerned that additional health measures, such as quarantine of returning travelers, refusal of entry, cancellation of flights and border closures, were significantly interfering with international travel and transport and were negatively impacting the Ebola response and recovery efforts.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-declares-Ebola-international-public-health-emergency-353262" target="_new">WHO initially deemed</a> the situation in West Africa a public health emergency this past August &ndash; renewing that declaration three more times since.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
