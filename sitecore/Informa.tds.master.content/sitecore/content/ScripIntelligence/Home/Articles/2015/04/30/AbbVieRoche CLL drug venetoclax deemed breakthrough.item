<p>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) to AbbVie's venetoclax, an inhibitor of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein, which the company is developing in partnership with Roche and its US subsidiary Genentech as a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in relapsed/refractory patients with the 17p deletion genetic mutation.</p><p>AbbVie said it plans to submit applications to the FDA and EMA before the end of the year seeking approval of venetoclax in CLL.</p><p>Shares of the firm got a slight bump from the news on 6 May, gaining 1%, or 67 cents, before closing at $63.94, up 8 cents.</p><p>AbbVie said venetoclax currently is being evaluated in Phase II and III trials in CLL. It's also being tested in several other cancers.</p><p>Up to 10% of CLL patients have 17p deletion at diagnosis and it occurs in up to 50% of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.</p><p>The median life expectancy for CLL patients with 17p deletion is less than two to three years.</p><p>To <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-upgrades-guide-for-breakthrough-status-other-expedited-programs-352076" target="_new">gain BTD</a>, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i>, a drug must be intended to treat a serious condition and have preliminary clinical evidence that indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapies.</p><p>As of 1 May &ndash; the most recent date for which data are available &ndash; the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research had granted at least 76 of the 250 BTD requests it has received since July 2012, with regulators denying at least 127.</p><p>As of 30 April, the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research had granted at least 12 of the 50 BTD requests it has received, denying at least 34.</p><p>In all, the FDA said it has received about 300 BTD requests since 2012.
