<p><p>Perrigo CEO Joe Papa took the opportunity on Sept. 10 to chastise the Chairman of potential acquirer Mylan, calling Robert Coury's claims "disingenuous" and accusing the company of making "excuses."</p><p>Papa's letter is in response to a letter Coury wrote on Sept. 8 when Mylan announced that it will begin its tender offer to Perrigo shareholders on Sept. 14. The Netherlands-registered Mylan's bid values Perrigo at $27.4bn based on Mylan's closing share price on Sept. 8 and includes $75 per share in cash component, giving Perrigo shareholders a 40% stake in the combined company. </p><p>In Coury's letter, he reiterated that Mylan has made a "highly compelling" offer and that the deal would bring the same value to shareholder that Perrigo's 'plus plus plus' strategy promises, only sooner and more efficiently. </p><p>"The transaction will provide Perrigo shareholders with the immediate value they want and deserve, as well as the ability to continue to participate in the long-term upside, without taking unnecessary execution and integration risk," wrote Coury. </p><p>In response, Papa noted that Perrigo wasn't opposed to engaging with Mylan, but that current offers "have simply not been a basis for discussions."</p><p>"We also have been very clear that the $205 per share value that Mylan initially proposed, and your current lower offer, are grossly inadequate," said Papa. </p><p>Papa argues that "contrary to [Coury's] implications," Perrigo is confident it can deliver on its standalone strategy. </p><p>Papa says Perrigo and its shareholders are troubled by Mylan's corporate governance and some of the decisions it's made during the pursuit of Perrigo have been troubling &ndash; including its choice to lower the share tendering threshold to 50%. Ultimately, Papa contends that Perrigo shoareholders will not tender their shares and that the offer is still not compelling. </p><p>"It is not compelling because it substantially undervalues Perrigo and provides a meager change of control premium at best &ndash; in fact it is the lowest change of control premium of any biopharmaceutical deal valued over $5bn since the start of 2012," wrote Papa. </p><p>"And by your own admission, Mylan does not expect this offer to be accretive until 'year four' and then only if Mylan's synergy estimates are fully realized. If these optimistic synergy targets are missed, then the deal will become even more dilutive to Mylan's adjusted EPS and more financially unattractive for shareholders."</p><p><p>
