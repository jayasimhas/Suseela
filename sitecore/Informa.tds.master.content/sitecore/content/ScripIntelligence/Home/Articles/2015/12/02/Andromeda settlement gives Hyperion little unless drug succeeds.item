<p>Hyperion Therapeutics settled with former Andromeda Biotech parent company Clal Biotechnology Industries (CBI) in relation to Hyperion's desired disposition of Andromeda, a business it bought from CBI in 2014 without knowledge of data tampering related to lead product candidate DiaPep277.</p><p>However, most of the $30.85m or so that Hyperion has invested in Andromeda and DiaPep277 to date won't be recouped unless the ongoing Phase III type 1 diabetes development program is successful and Andromeda is reacquired by CBI. However, investors seemed to be happy with the settlement terms, since Hyperion's stock closed up 1.3% at $27.18 per share on 17 February, bringing the company's market cap to $563.3m.</p><p>Brisbane, California-based Hyperion agreed in April to pay $12.5m in cash and $7.85m in stock up front to buy Andromeda from CBI plus $570m in regulatory and commercial milestones for DiaPep277 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-HyperionAndromeda-lead-deal-makers-Theravance-tops-public-company-fundraising-351469" target="_new">28 April 2014</a>). But by September the company revealed that the DiaPep277 data it relied on to buy Andromeda had been tampered with by some of the CBI subsidiary's employees (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/DECEIVED-Hyperion-dumps-diabetes-drug-after-Andromeda-scheme-353764" target="_new">9 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Under the settlement agreement, Hyperion will receive an initial $2.5m option fee from CBI and it could earn a $3.5m option exercise payment if CBI decides to repurchase Andromeda by 30 September; both fees will be paid in Hyperion stock owned by the Israeli company. </p><p>Hyperion previously agreed to pay the $10.5m cost to complete an ongoing Phase III clinical trial for DiaPep277, but will use $2.25m of the initial option fee from CBI to pay any costs above the trial's budgeted expenses. CBI will cover any additional budget excesses beyond that $2.25m. </p><p>But most of Hyperion's investment in Andromeda and the Phase III DiaPep277 program will not come back to the company unless CBI exercises its option to buy its former subsidiary and DiaPep277 becomes an approved product. Hyperion may earn up to $36.5m in contingent payments if Andromeda and its shareholders earn revenue or other proceeds from an approved and marketed DiaPep277.</p><p>However, intellectual property rights for the drug will revert to Yeda Research and Development Co, the technology transfer institute of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, if CBI does not exercise its option to repurchase Andromeda.</p><p>Evotec, which stood to earn royalties from DiaPep277, also has a lawsuit pending against Andromeda based on hits to the German company's stock price caused by the data mishandling revealed in September (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Evotec-sues-Andromeda-after-DiaPep277-deception-354027" target="_new">19 September 2014</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
