<p>With the revelation on 2 March that yet another strong Capitol Hill supporter of the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plans to soon depart Congress, the number of lawmakers that have long advocated for more funding for the agencies is increasingly dwindling.</p><p>Senator Barbara Mikulski (Democrat-Maryland), whose claim to fame is being the longest serving woman in Congress &ndash; nearly 40 years, with the majority of that in the Senate &ndash; disclosed on 2 March she would not seek re-election in 2016 and would retire at the end of her current term in January 2017.</p><p>Ms Mikulski's home state of Maryland houses both the FDA and the NIH, so she's had skin in the game when she's pushed for increases in the agencies' budgets &ndash; something she's been able to have more control over in recent years as the Senate Appropriations Committee chair, when her party held the majority of the Senate, and now as the vice chair, after Republicans took the chamber in the last election.</p><p>Senator Mikulski has been behind efforts to try to kill the cuts to the NIH and the FDA under sequestration &ndash; the across-the-board spending reductions mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (scripintelligence, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Will-sequestration-be-a-better-outcome-for-biopharma-324099" target="_new">28 November 2011</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Super-failure-Whats-ahead-for-health-care-under-automatic-1.2-trillion-cuts-323917" target="_new">22 November 2011</a>).</p><p>During a speech last year at the NIH, Senator Mikulski said she was willing to "burn the midnight oil to do what it takes to make sure that we preserve innovation" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-budgeting-Is-it-madness-NIH-chief-senator-explain-350253" target="_new">26 February 2014</a>).</p><p>The Maryland senator's decision to leave Congress in less than two years follows the departures of other lawmakers who have been strong supporters of the FDA and the NIH, including Representatives John Dingell (Democrat-Michigan) &ndash; who holds the record of the longest serving member of Congress &ndash; and Henry Waxman (Democrat-California), who both held the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Senator Tom Harkin (Democrat-Iowa), the former chief of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FDA and NIH (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDANIH-advocate-House-Dean-John-Dingell-to-depart-Congress-350228" target="_new">25 February 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Key-healthcare-drug-laws-architect-Waxman-to-depart-Congress-349698" target="_new">31 January 2014</a>).</p><p>At a 2 March press conference in Baltimore, Senator Mikulski, who is 78 years old, said she was not leaving the Senate because of health reasons or because of the current dysfunctional environment.</p><p>Rather, she told reporters, the decision came down to not wanting to spend the next two years raising campaign funds when she rather be "raising hell" to meet the needs of her constituents. </p><p>Ms Mikulski was first elected to the House in 1976. When she entered the Senate in 1987, she was only one of two women senators. </p><p>Senator Mikulski became the longest-serving woman in the US Senate's history in January 2011, and in March 2012, she broke the record for the longest-serving woman in the Congress. </p><p>She also was the first woman to ever chair the Senate Appropriations Committee, where President Barack Obama said she &ldquo;wielded her gavel and used her booming voice&rdquo; to advocate for healthcare and other issues. </p><p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Democrat-California) praised Senator Mikulski as &ldquo;one of the most skilled appropriators the Senate has ever known.&rdquo;</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
