<p><p>Depomed is taking rapid steps to make sure Horizon Pharma can't get its hands on its growing company. In response to Horizon's unsolicited $3bn offer that was made public last week, Depomed has enacted a poison pill &ndash; and Horizon is not happy about it. </p><p>The California-based biotech filed a form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 12 July that says any company or person trying to acquire more than 10% of Depomed shares will trigger what is termed a poison pill in the world of takeovers, essentially flooding the market with further shares of the company and diluting the shareholder base. </p><p>Horizon responded with a statement calling the move "shareholder unfriendly." </p><p>"We are very disappointed that instead of listening to its shareholders and immediately entering into negotiations with Horizon, the Depomed Board has instead taken actions to limit its shareholders' opportunity to maximize the value of their investment by implementing a poison pill and adopting changes to their bylaws that would, among other things, enable their Board of Directors to delay and make more difficult the calling of a special meeting of its shareholders," said Horizon CEO Tim Walbert. </p><p>On <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Can-Depomed-get-more-value-out-of-Horizon-offer-359293" target="_new">07 July</a>, Horizon made public its intentions to acquire Depomed in an all-stock transaction worth about $3bn. The offer stands as a 42% premium to Depomed's closing price of $20.64 on the day prior to the offer being made public. </p><p>Hoizon says the combined company with have pro forma sales of $950m and EBITDA of $350m through the sale of 13 marketed products.</p><p>The offer was apparently not Horizon's first attempt at acquiring Depomed, but its third offer to the company. Horizon Chairman, President and CEO Tim Walbert said in a letter to Depomed shareholders that Horizon first approached the company on 27 May and then again on 02 June, but was rebuffed both times.</p><p>Depomed believes it has more value as a standalone company &ndash; largely because of the $1bn acquisition of the pain drug Nucynta it made from Johnson & Johnson earlier this year. Investors will have to have faith in management for now since the drug was just relaunched at the end of June. It will likely take several quarters before it will be clear if the launch of Nucynta is a success. </p><p>"In our view, a merger with Horizon Pharma may represent a viable strategic alternative for Depomed&rsquo;s core businesses, with operational synergies and tax benefits," wrote JMP Securities analyst Jason Butler in an 07 July note to investors. "However, we believe the current all-stock offer of $29.25 does not fully value the company and would view an increased bid of closer to $33-$35 per share with some cash component as more appropriate based on our expectations for peak product sales."</p><p><p>
