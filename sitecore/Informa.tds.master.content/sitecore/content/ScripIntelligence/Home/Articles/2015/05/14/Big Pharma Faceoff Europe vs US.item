<p>It's Big Pharma US versus Big Pharma Europe, the showdown! </p><p>Imagine 10 pharmaceutical companies from either side of the Atlantic Ocean as athletes, trained, toned and at the height of commercial perfection. The Big Pharma Face-off sends them into sporting battles as representatives of a continent, as a team and as individuals. </p><p>If it helps, think about the companies as their CEOs, dressed in singlets, shorts and spiked shoes &ndash; lithe, limber and buff &ndash; psyching themselves up for competition beforehand or punching the air afterward in victory. </p><p>This is not entirely a writer's conceit. Muscled CEOs with fab abs might be way off the mark, but the manner in which companies deliver revenues and profits, the value of their assets and the way in which they innovate are among the factors that get rolled into credit rating and market valuations. So too is the efficiency with which firms run as machines for making products &ndash; and earnings.</p><p>Let's meet the teams: they are the top 10 sellers of prescription drugs on either side of 'The Pond': in aggregate, the 20 companies sold $492bn worth of drugs in 2014. </p><p>Big Pharma US is Pfizer, Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Amgen, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Actavis and Baxter International.</p><p>Big Pharma Europe is Novartis, Sanofi, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Novo Nordisk, Boehringer Ingelheim and Merck KGaA, with Israel's Teva conscripted to the European cause on the grounds of geographical proximity (and precedence from the annual TV spectacular, the Eurovision Song Contest). </p><p>The companies come together in a three-part contest:</p><p>Firstly, covered in this article, is a team phase where winners are decided by aggregating the 'scores' of all 10 companies in each 'discipline';</p><p>The second has a head-to-head format comparing companies one on one, a bit like a Ryder Cup of pharma;</p><p>A third 'individual' phase will look at pharma outputs and achievements on a per employee basis.</p><p>For the Big Pharma face-off, <i>Scrip</i> focused on just five criteria of pharma performance (many others could have been used): </p><ul><li>drug sales</li><li>R&D expenditure</li><li>operating profit</li><li>net assets</li><li>enterprise value</li></ul><p>One key performance measure not examined is earnings (net profit or net income), omitted because it is influenced by both a company's intrinsic financial circumstances and the tax rates imposed upon or negotiated by it.</p><h2>Team results</h2><p>A contest between the aggregated might of the top 10 US pharma companies and their European counterparts is an even heavyweight contest (Table 1). Both teams have similar levels of drug sales, similar asset bases and similar market capitalization. Each team includes one big generic pharma player (Actavis and Teva), pure pharma firms and broader life science companies. But which comes out on top?</p><p>The first event involves drug sales, a parameter <i>Scrip</i> believes is still an important measure of achievement for most pharmaceutical companies. Big Pharma Europe has the edge over the US by $25bn. That lead is equivalent to around 10% of the $258.5bn European aggregate drug sales income for 2014 or, to think about it another way, a Gilead&ndash;worth of drug sales ($24.9bn), or an AstraZeneca-worth ($26.1bn). </p><p><b>1-0 to Europe</b>.</p><p>Europe also leads in R&D expenditure, a measure <i>Scrip</i> regards as a crude gauge of innovation and investment in the future. The top 10 companies in Europe spend $47bn between them versus $44bn for the US group. Oddly enough, the difference between the two sides is a Gilead-worth of R&D spending ($2.8bn).</p><p><b>2-0 to Europe</b>.</p><p>Operating profit can be seen as a basic financial assessment of the efficiency with which a company or group or companies converts product sales into money. Although investors often prefer to look at a company's earnings (net profit or net income), perhaps because these have a relationship to the dividend that many Big Pharma companies pay out, the measure has been omitted here because it is influenced by both a company's intrinsic financial circumstances and imposed tax rates.</p><p>At the top end of the pharma sector, US companies generated operating profits that in aggregate were 12% higher than those of their European counterparts in 2014:&ndash; $72.6bn versus $64.8bn. The US pulls it back to 2-1. The collective US operating margin (operating profit divided by sales; not shown in Table 1) was even further ahead of the European figure, since the US sales base is lower. The aggregate operating margin is 31% of sales for the ten US firms, 25% for the ten Europeans. </p><p><b>2-1 to Europe</b>.</p><p>The group of US companies also has slightly higher net assets, the difference between accumulated assets and accumulated liabilities, which can be used as a rough measure of the resource base. The US top 10 leads the European top 10 by some $20bn: $299bn versus $280bn &ndash; thanks largely to three major accumulators, Pfizer, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson. That makes it a tie, with one 'event' to go in the first phase of this faux pharma Olympiad.</p><p><b>2-2 all tied.</b></p><p>The final measure <i>Scrip</i> has looked at is enterprise value, an overall measure of value calculated by subtracting the balance of a company's current assets and current liabilities from its market capitalization. In essence, enterprise value represents the value of the business minus the liquid assets or liabilities. </p><p>Based on 2014 performance, the US companies win the enterprise value battle, too; the collected total for the enterprise value for the 10 US firms is $1.16tn versus $1.07tn for the European contingent. Again, the big three of Pfizer, Merck and Johnson & Johnson, ably abetted by Gilead, help put the US group ahead. </p><p>That clinches <b>team victory for the US, by 3-2</b>.</p><table><h2>Table 1.
