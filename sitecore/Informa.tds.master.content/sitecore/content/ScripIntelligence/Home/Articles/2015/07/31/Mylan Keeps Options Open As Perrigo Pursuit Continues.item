<p><p>Mylan continues to pursue Perrigo to no avail, but the larger generic drugmaker has made it clear that it's keeping its options open &ndash; raising the possibility that Mylan could set its sights on another target just like Teva Pharmaceuticals did. </p><p>Perrigo CEO Joe Papa continued to say on Aug. 5 that the Mylan offer undervalues the company and that an acquisition by Mylan "would dilute the strength of our durable consumer business" and "would result in a significant PE multiple contraction."</p><p>"I make no predictions on how Mylan shareholders will vote on August 28, but I also want to remind everyone, including the Mylan shareholders, that if they proceed with a tender offer for Perrigo, this will not be the easy path to completion as some are painting it to be," he added.</p><p>A day after Perrigo continued to publicly reject Mylan's offer during its second quarter earnings call, Mylan responded by amending the percentage of Perrigo shareholders it would need to take over the company. Mylan noted in a statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Aug. 6 that it only needs the support of more than 50% of Perrigo shareholders should it take its offer directly to the company's investors, down from its previously stated 80% threshold.</p><p>Mylan is waiting on a vote from its own shareholders on Aug. 28 regarding the transaction, but CEO Heather Bresch emphasized Mylan's interest in still acquiring Perrigo. "We believe our offer to acquire Perrigo represents the right next step for Mylan because it further diversifies our business &ndash; that creates a paradigm shift in how we'll do business, and establishes a unique platform with the size and scale that allows us to continue being a leading consolidator in our industry," she said during the Aug. 6 earnings call.</p><p>These were some of the first comments the CEO has made since Teva withdrew its own bid for Mylan, switching gears to acquire Allergan's generics business for $40bn instead. "You saw last week that Teva announced an agreement to acquire Allergan's generic drug unit and its withdrawal of its unsolicited expression of interest to acquire Mylan. We very much believe that this is the right outcome for both companies and their shareholders," Bresch added.</p><p>Bresch wasn't all positivity about the possibilities of acquiring Perrigo; during a question and answer session with analysts, Bresch noted that Mylan is keeping its options open.</p><p>"Obviously, we believe Perrigo is the right next transaction for Mylan based on the strategic initiatives that we laid out. But as we said before, we like Perrigo, but we don't have to have Perrigo," she said.</p><p>"There's lots of assets available out there that we believe very much would complement our platform that we would be able to leverage the infrastructure, both commercial and operational excellence that we have in place today," said the CEO. "So, we've been actively looking at many targets out there.</p><p>
