<p>Gilead Sciences Inc. has managed to persuade NICE, the HTA body for England and Wales, to reverse an earlier recommendation that <i>Zydelig</i> (idelalisib) not be offered free of charge under the UK's NHS (National Health Service) for certain patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The latest decision brings NICE in line with the Scottish Medicines Consortium, which approved Zydelig for use under NHS Scotland earlier this year.</p><p>In earlier draft guidance published in June, NICE said it would not be recommending Zydelig because its independent appraisal committee had concluded "there were still questions to be answered about the cost effectiveness of the treatment" and it requested "further analysis" from the company. </p><p>However, following publication of the earlier appraisal consultation document (ACD), "the company worked closely with NICE to provide the evidence requested to support a positive final recommendation," it told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>While details of the evidence Gilead provided have not been disclosed as yet, NICE's requests for further analyses included: a revised cost-effectiveness analysis for the comparison of idelalisib plus rituximab with rituximab alone, best supportive care and ofatumumab; and a variety of sensitivity analyses.</p><p>The final draft guidance now recommends Zydelig as a treatment option in combination with rituximab for adults with CLL who have relapsed early (<24 months),="" and="" this="" combination="" has="" also="" been="" recommended="" for="" untreated="" cll="" patients="" with="" markers="" for="" aggressive="" disease="" (genetic="" abnormalities="" called="" 17p="" deletion="" and/or="" tp53="" mutation).="" nice="" concluded="" that="" zydelig="" could="" not="" be="" recommended="" for="" people="" whose="" disease="" had="" relapsed="" more="" than="" 24="" months="" after="" previous="" treatment="" as="" no="" evidence="" was="" submitted="" for="" this=""></24></p><p>Professor Carole Longson, NICE health technology evaluation centre director, said: "We are delighted that Gilead Sciences responded to our consultation by providing further information for our independent appraisal committee and that they had agreed to provide idelalisib to the NHS at a reduced price in the initial submission. For people whose cancer has returned less than two years after their last treatment, their options are currently limited. With this new positive recommendation, the NHS will have another clinically effective option for treating adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia."</p><p>Zydelig is the first of a new class of drug that works by blocking the signals which help cancerous cells multiply and survive.</p><p>Zydelig provides a much needed option for those patients with CLL when the disease relapses and for previously untreated patients with a molecular switch that prevents chemotherapy being effective, said Professor Peter Hillmen, Consultant Haematologist, NHS Leeds Teaching Hospitals. "Previously these patients have been faced with very limited, ineffective treatment, and had a much shorter survival than other patients with CLL."</p><p>The mean cost of a one-year treatment course for Zydelig is &pound;37,922. The company has agreed to provide a discount to the list price of Zydelig, but the level of the discount is confidential, as usual.</p>
