<p><p>Regeneron noted during its first quarter call on 07 May that it is prepping for a third quarter launch of its closely-watched PCSK9 inhibitor with partner Sanofi, and the companies believe that it will serve a market of more than 11m in the US. Despite the market size, the partners expect uptake to be slow.</p><p>The LDL cholesterol lowering drug, dubbed Praluent (alirocumab), will face an FDA advisory committee on June 9 and has a user fee action date of July 24. While the class has faced backlash after the FDA expressed concerns about neurocognitive issues, the companies believe the drug will garner approval and are readying their sales forces. </p><p>The companies share responsibility for planning decisions globally and sales force promotion in the US.</p><p>"The majority of Regeneron's three field-based teams, our specialty representative, our hospital specialist, and our reimbursement specialists, have been hired, and the first two waves of home office training have been completed," said the biotech's head of commercial operations Bob Terifay during the first quarter call with analysts. "I'm very impressed with the caliber and experience of the Praluent team that we hired in less than three months. This required screening 20,000 resumes and conducting almost 2,000 interviews."</p><h2>A significant challenge</h2><p>Regeneron admits that it has a tough path ahead of it to commercial the product &ndash; it will have to educate the market and physicians on the proper patient population, as well as dosing, and deal with a complicated reimbursement environment. Regeneron has already launched unbranded physician and patient campaigns, as well as educational websites.</p><p>"Praluent has been developed to address the individualized LD-C lowering needs of patients. Praluent was studied using two different dosage strengths, a 75-milligram every two weeks dose, which provides on average about a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline, and a 150-milligram every two weeks dose which provides on average a 60% or more LDL-C reduction from baseline," said Terifay, who noted patients will likely start with the lowest dose and adjust accordingly. "The availability of two different dosing strengths offering different levels of LDL-C reductions is an important point of differentiation for Praluent," the exec added. </p><p>Regeneron and Sanofi aren't trying to replace the well-entrenched statins that currently dominate the cholesterol market, but instead reach a population that cannot take the commonly-used drugs. The company believes there is a large population &ndash; nearly 11m people in the US &ndash; that are not reaching the LDL cholesterol targets. "These high-risk patients include those with familiar hypercholesterolemia, those with statin intolerance, and those at high risk because of a previous cardiovascular event or other comorbidities," he said. </p><p>The FDA will scrutinize the drug at its advisory committee in early June, but payers, pharmacy benefit managers and physicians are already weary about the class, according to the company. "We expect the reimbursement environment to be complex and carefully managed. We are working with the players involved in the market access decision-making process to focus on patient good," said Terifay.</p><p>"That said, it will likely take several months for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions, and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, we expect an initial gradual uptake at launch," he added. </p><p><p><p>
