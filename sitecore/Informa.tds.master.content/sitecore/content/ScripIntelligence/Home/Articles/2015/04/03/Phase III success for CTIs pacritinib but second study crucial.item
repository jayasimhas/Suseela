<p>A statistically significant percentage of myelofibrosis patients treated with CTI BioPharma's pacritinib in the Phase III PERSIST-1 clinical trial had a 35% or greater reduction in spleen size versus best available therapy, including particularly large decreases for individuals who are unlikely to be treated effectively with the competing Incyte and Novartis Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor Jakafi (ruxolitinib).</p><p>PERSIST-1 enrolled 327 patients with myelofibrosis regardless of platelet count levels, but the JAK2 and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) inhibitor pacritinib performed best in patients with very low platelet counts, otherwise known as severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia. That makes the ongoing Phase III PERSIST-2 trial crucial to pacritinib's commercial success. In that study, the JAK2 inhibitor is being evaluated against Jakafi, which can cause low blood platelet counts, and other therapies.</p><p>Seattle, Washington-based CTI (formerly Cell Therapeutics) did not disclose percentages of study participants who achieved the primary endpoint of a 35% or greater reduced spleen size at 24 weeks, but the company said the result for all patients in the intent-to-treat group was clinically and statistically significant (p=0.0003). </p><p>"It worked across the spectrum in the sickest and in all other patients," president and CEO James Bianco said during a 9 March conference call with investors and analysts.</p><p>The greatest effect was seen in patients with less than 50,000 platelets per mcL, but CTI did not provide the p-value for those individuals. Among 50 patients who were red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependent when they entered the study, a "clinically meaningful" percentage who were treated with pacritinib became transfusion independent versus dependent patients who received best available therapy (BAT). At 24 weeks, 79% of the people in the BAT group crossed over to pacritinib therapy.</p><p>CTI will present detailed PERSIST-1 results at an upcoming scientific conference, the first of which could be the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting from 29 May to 2 June in Chicago. The company will submit the data for inclusion in a late-breaker session at the ASCO meeting. </p><p>PERSIST-2 is testing pacritinib versus best available therapy (BAT), including Jakafi, in patients with low platelet counts of 100,000 or less per mcL (normal levels in myelofibrosis patients are 150,000 to 400,000 per mcL). The Phase III study is on track to conclude in mid-2015. Initiation of a rolling new drug application (NDA) submission to the US FDA is planned for late 2015. </p><p>CTI paid S*Bio $30m in upfront cash and stock in 2012 to license pacritinib before the company entered into an agreement in 2013 worth $60m up front plus $112m in milestone fees to jointly develop the drug with Baxter in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CTI-to-pursue-Phase-III-ready-JAK2-inhibitor-329524" target="_new">19 April 2012</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Baxter-licenses-blood-cancer-drug-from-Cell-Therapeutics-348182" target="_new">18 November 2013</a>). Baxter is responsible for ex-US sales.</p><p>CTI closed up 6.4% at $2.82 per share on 9 March based on the PERSIST-1 results, bringing its market cap to $409.3m, while Baxter gained 0.7% to close at $67.70. Incyte's stock closed down 0.5% at $89.57. It's market cap, based on a single approved drug, is $15.4bn.</p><p><b>Pacritinib versus Jakafi, momelotinib</b></p><p>Sagient Research raised its likelihood of FDA approval (LOA) for pacritinib by 7% to 42% based on the top-line PERSIST-1 results. The drug's LOA is 7% above average for Phase III oncology candidates. </p><p>"While few quantitative details were released, the primary endpoint is similar to the COMFORT studies that led to approval of Jakafi," Sagient noted in a 9 March BioMedTracker report. "Given the lack of available therapies, the success of this trial should leave a clear path towards approval. Without a head-to-head trial against Jakafi, though, pacritinib may have an uphill struggle in the marketplace against the already-established Jakafi and other late-stage drugs," like momelotinib from Gilead Sciences.</p><p>Momelotinib, which like Jakafi inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, also is in Phase III and could be submitted for FDA approval during the first half of 2015, according to the BioMedTracker database. Ongoing Phase III studies include a clinical trial in JAK inhibitor-na&iuml;ve myelofibrosis patients versus Jakafi and a trial versus BAT in myelofibrosis patients previously treated with Jakafi.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia was one of the most common adverse events in a Phase I/II clinical trial for momelotinib in a trial conducted by YM Biosciences, which Gilead acquired in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-JAKs-up-oncology-presence-with-510m-YM-buy-338210" target="_new">13 December 2012</a>). With Jakafi, the drug's FDA-approved label requires prescribers to monitor blood counts every two to four weeks until patients are on a stable dose and then modify or end dosing based on thrombocytopenia.</p><p>But for pacritinib in PERSIST-1, the most common side effects were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting with three patients who discontinued treatment and nine who required dose reductions for diarrhea. CTI said "very few patients" discontinued treatment or required a pacritinib dose reduction due to anemia or thrombocytopenia.</p><p>"Despite the introduction of JAK2 inhibitors as effective therapies for patients with myelofibrosis, there remains a treatment gap for patients with disease-related or treatment-emergent thrombocytopenia. [Jakafi] may require dose titration to less effective doses in this patient population, thus limiting our ability to effectively treat them. Results from the PERSIST-1 randomized trial demonstrate that pacritinib could address this unmet medical need," said Claire Harrison, one of the study's principal investigators in CTI's announcement of the top-line Phase III results.</p><p>Dr Harrison, a consultant hematologist at Guy's Hospital in London, also noted that it was "encouraging to see that patients were able to receive therapeutic doses of pacritinib over a long period of time irrespective of their baseline platelet or red blood cell count while having therapeutic benefit in reduction in spleen volume and disease-related symptoms and improvement in transfusion dependency."</p><p><b>Efficacy details needed</b></p><p>While pacritinib may have a safety benefit, efficacy versus Jakafi and momelotinib is unclear without more detailed results. CTI said the JAK2/FLT-3 inhibitor's benefit was similar to its performance in Phase II in which 27% of patients treated with pacritinib had a 35% or greater spleen size reduction at week 24. </p><p>In the Phase I/II study conducted by YM, 38% of patients treated with momelotinib had a spleen response at six months. And in the Phase III COMFORT clinical trials for Jakafi, 41.9% of patients achieved a 35% reduction in spleen size at week 24 in COMFORT-1 while 31.9% of patients had a 35% or greater spleen size reduction at week 24 in COMFORT-2.</p><p>Roth Capital Partners analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay noted in a 9 March report that the percentage of patients treated with pacritinib who had spleen size reductions of greater than 35% increased to 37% at 44 weeks in Phase II. </p><p>"A 20% response rate in the overall population and mid-20% or higher in the sicker patients would make pacritinib very competitive, in our view," Dr Chattopadhyay wrote. "Since pacritinib does not inhibit JAK1, it has not been associated with myelosuppression."</p><p>He noted that up to 37% of the patients with myelofibrosis and other hematological conditions receive outdated therapies or sub-optimal doses of Jakafi, because of the treatments' effects on platelet counts.</p><p>However, Leerink Swann analyst Michael Schmidt remained upbeat about Jakafi's leading position as the first and only approved JAK inhibitor for myelofibrosis.</p><p>Dr Schmidt wrote in a 9 March report that "we expect pacritinib to expand the [myelofibrosis] market to patients with low baseline platelet counts and as an option as second-line therapy. Driven by solid efficacy data in [the] COMFORT trials, including [overall survival] data and a generally positive post-market experience and physician comfort with Jakafi, we expect the drug to maintain its market-leading position for first-line treatment of [myelofibrosis]."</p><p><p><p><p><p>
