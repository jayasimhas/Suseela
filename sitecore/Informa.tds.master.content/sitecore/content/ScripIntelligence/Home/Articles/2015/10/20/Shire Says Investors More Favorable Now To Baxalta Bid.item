<p>Shire PLC's large investors are more on board with the firm's pursuit of Baxalta Inc. than they were when the bid first was announced in August, and the specialty pharma says it will continue to seek a merger that would create a rare disease powerhouse with 30 new products and $20bn in annual revenue by 2020.</p><p>The Baxalta quest was a primary topic during Shire's third quarter earnings call Oct. 23, but other areas of focus included how to view the company's sales growth during a period when Intuniv (guanfacine) sales are cratering due to generic competition and what impact the launch of the binge-eating disorder (BED) indication is having for top-selling drug Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine).</p><p>The Dublin-headquartered firm did not change the narrative on lifitegrast, the dry-eye disease candidate that recently received a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Shrugs-Off-Lifitegrast-CRL-Launch-Expected-In-2016-361125" target="_new">complete response letter</a> from the US FDA. The goal remains refiling the new drug application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2016 backed by data from the just-completed OPUS-3 trial.</p><p>In a same-day interview, Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said that while some investors and analysts <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shires-Bid-For-Baxalta-A-Fools-Errand-359774" target="_new">did not see the value of a merger with Baxalta</a> when news of the pursuit first emerged, the deal would offer <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-Taking-The-Wrong-Approach-To-MandA-360423" target="_new">synergies in tax, revenues and cost of goods</a>.</p><p>A spinout from Baxter International Inc. that only went public July 1, Baxalta offers, among other things, a hemophilia franchise that would supplement Shire's portfolio, he said, while its plasma business would provide some overlap with Shire's hereditary angioedema franchise. Ornskov also pointed to Baxalta's immuno-oncology program and the additions it would bring Shire in terms of technology as potential benefits of a merger.</p><p>Shire went directly to Baxalta's board after the new company became a public entity, offering a stock-swap in which it would issue 0.1687 shares in Shire for every full share in Baxalta, valuing its target at roughly $30bn. Baxalta quickly turned down the offer, which would have given it a 37% interest in the combined company. Analysts expect that if a merger is to go through, Shire will have to increase the size of its offer and include cash in the deal.</p><p><b>Ornskov Reiterates Enthusiasm For Merger</b></p><p>Ornskov used the earnings call to reiterate his enthusiasm for acquiring Baxalta.</p><p>"Firstly, it would create the leading global rare disease biotech company," he said. "We continue to believe this highly complementary business combination would have the potential to deliver sales of $20bn by 2020. Secondly, we believe this combined company would have a compelling financial profile and create significant value for shareholders. And, thirdly, the combined company would have a strong outlook, with more than 30 new product launches planned by 2020."</p><p>"Any large deal takes time, and we've taken a focused and a disciplined approach to Baxalta from day one but are naturally not solely focused on this deal," the exec continued. "As part of our strategy, we continue in parallel to pursue smaller, but clearly value-adding deals in core areas of strategic interest to us."</p><p>Asked whether Shire's investors are warming to the idea, Ornskov said there had been significant outreach to large shareholders and he believed the tide of opinion was turning in favor of the deal.</p><p>"I think there can be different perspectives on what shareholders are telling us. The good news is I think I've spoken to most of our major shareholders regarding Baxalta. I think that initially Baxalta was not a known entity to many of our shareholders, neither [were] the therapeutic areas that Baxalta was operating in," he said. "I think as we've had an opportunity to explain Baxalta and the excellent strategic fit to our shareholders, I actually think that that gap has diminished."</p><p>The greater question at present, Ornskov added, is whether such a deal could occur under macroeconomic conditions in which biotechs are under-valued by roughly 20%. "I don't think that people are focused so much on the strategic fit," he explained. "They're more focused on whether a deal can be executed. So I think broad support has been generated for the strategic fit. But people are more questioning whether a deal can be done."</p><p>However, Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville said in an Oct. 23 note that he remains "skeptical of the overall value creation of the proposed deal for Shire." He likes Shire's increasing focus on rare disease markets, but thinks Shire might be unwise to take on the risk Baxalta is facing to its hemophilia franchise from "potential disruptive technologies" from competitors such as Roche and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p><b>Rare Disease Focus Puts Shire In Midst Of Pricing Debate</b></p><p>Approximately 40% of Shire's current business is in the rare disease area, Ornskov noted, which puts the firm right in the middle of the increasing debate over pharmaceutical pricing practices. Asked about how the company is going to look at pricing its products in the current climate, the CEO fell back on the tried-and-true response that "it's all about demonstrating the value of your products."</p><p>Rare disease therapies are "typically high-priced," he acknowledged, "so it's about focusing on creating the clinical data, and many times the follow-up data that are needed to continue to show the impact that your product has on &#8230; the quality of life of the patients. And we continue to work on that. We believe that innovation will pay off."</p><p>Shire has a history of single-digit price increases across its specialty pharma business, the CEO added. "We evaluate these opportunities in light of the competitive opportunity and consumer indexes, these kinds of things. I'm not going to give a prediction about what we're going to do on pricing. But we compare ourselves, of course, also to make sure that we act appropriately, and we're always fine in any comparison.&rdquo;</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Jeff Poulton acknowledged that over the past five years there has been a pricing component to the firm's growth, "but we've also had a substantial volume component in terms of what's driving the top-line results for our business."</p><p><b>Factoring Out Intuniv Provides Clearer View</b></p><p>As it did after the second quarter, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-preparing-for-all-outcomes-as-it-awaits-lifitegrast-approval-359598" target="_new">when overall product sales were flat</a>, Shire tried to keep the focus on its overall performance without the decline in Intuniv sales and the impact of foreign exchange. Product sales totaled $1.6bn on the quarter, up 2% year-over-year, or 6% under constant exchange rates. But if Intuniv is factored out, sales increased 7%, or 12% at constant currency rates.</p><p>With Intuniv "basically genericized" at this point, Ornskov said in an interview, looking at sales minus that drug is a better measure of performance. He pointed to strong growth in the two-drug hereditary angioedema (HAE) franchise: Cinryze (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]) was up 29% to $187.5m, while Firazyr (icatibant) rose 25% to $123.2m. Intuniv, meanwhile, is down 81% year-over-year to $18.1m.</p><p>"There are some people who say 'you're excluding certain things to make [the quarter] look better,'" Poulton added. "The reality is that's what I think investors are going to expect in terms of growth heading into 2016, and that's why we give that look-through, so that people have a good understanding of that."</p><p>Morningstar's Quenneville lauded the strong growth of the HAE products, and cited Vyvanse, up 20% to $427.3m, as another highlight of the quarterly report. Shire says that although IMS does not break out sales by indication, it believes the binge-eating claim added to Vyvanse's label can be credited for much of the drug's sales growth.</p><p>"You can do market research, you can look at patients who have never been on the product, but, in reality, none of those are good predictors," Ornskov said when asked how Shire is assessing the binge-eating launch.</p><p>"The only thing that has changed is that we got the indication of binge-eating disorder, and if you look at the weekly and monthly prescription data since we got that indication, they have been accelerating and outgrowing the market by 3% to 3.5%," he added. "There's nothing else [driving double-digit growth], in my opinion, because we have not significantly added new representatives, we've not significantly added to the strategy. &#8230; I would say most of this has to be directly or indirectly due to the launch of binge-eating disorder."</p><p>He added that unlike other years, Shire did not see the anticipated reduction in Vyvanse prescriptions during this past summer, which is thought to be due to pediatric ADHD patients not needing it while school is out. "This year is the first year ever when we did not see that there was this significant drop-off during the summer period," Ornskov said.</p><p>Poulton noted that Vyvanse has picked up about 0.5% in market share since the binge-eating launch, which he ascribes mainly to new prescriptions for the new indication. That would be worth about $65m, since every share point in ADHD is worth roughly $130m in the current marketplace, he explained.</p><p><p>This article has also been published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily" target="_new">"The Pink Sheet" Daily</a>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
