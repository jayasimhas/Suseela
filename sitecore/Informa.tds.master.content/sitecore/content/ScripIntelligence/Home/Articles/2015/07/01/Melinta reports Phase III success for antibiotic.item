<p>Connecticut-based Melinta Therapeutics says that a Phase III study of its lead product, the investigational fluoroquinalone antibiotic, delafloxacin IV has met its primary end point.</p><p>Top-line results are now available from the first of two Phase III PROCEED studies &ndash; RX-3341-302. This compared delafloxacin with vancomycin plus aztreonam for treating patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). The primary endpoint was a reduction in measurement of lesion erythema at the primary infection site at 48-to-72 hours.</p><p>Delafloxacin was well tolerated in trial subjects and the most common treatment-related results were mild gastrointestinal results.</p><p>According to Melinta, the drug was also comparable to vancomycin including in an investigator assessment of signs and symptoms of infection at the follow up visit. The European Medicines Agency required this metric.</p><p>Complete results of the study will be announced later in the year in a peer-reviewed journal and at an upcoming medical meeting.</p><p>Meanwhile, enrollment in the second confirmatory PROCEED trial (RX-3341-303) is underway. Top-line results for this study should available in the second half of this year.</p><p>The completion of this first Phase III study is a significant step towards bringing the drug to market, said MarySzela, president and CEO of Melinta.</p><p>Delafloxacin is enabled by Ligand's technology platform, Captisol, a chemically modified cyclodextrin designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs.More than 30 products in clinical development are enabled with Captisol, while six products that use the platform have FDA approval. These include Onyx Pharmaceuticals' Kyprolis, Baxter'sNexterone and Merck's NOXAFIL IV. </p><p>
