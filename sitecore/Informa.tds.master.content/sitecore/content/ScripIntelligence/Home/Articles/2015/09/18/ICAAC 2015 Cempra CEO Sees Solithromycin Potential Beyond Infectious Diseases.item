<p>Cempra Inc. president and CEO Prabha Fernandes sees the company's lead drug candidate solithromycin as a pipeline-in-a-pill with potential beyond infectious diseases and she's willing to follow all plausible leads given the macrolide antibiotic's immunomodulatory effects.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> spent some time with Fernandes on Sept. 18 during the American Society for Microbiology's and the International Society of Chemotherapy's Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) and International Congress of Chemotherapy and Infection (ICC) joint conference from Sept. 17 to 21 in San Diego. She talked about solithromycin's potential in everything from pneumonia to liver disease as well as the drug's differentiation from a competing Phase III antibiotic that suffered a recent Phase III setback.</p><p>A lot of the data for Cempra's solithromycin presented during the ICAAC/ICC meeting reviewed testing in infectious disease models, but the Chapel Hill, North Carolina-based company remains on track to report its second set of Phase III data for the macrolide antibiotic in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) before the end of 2015. Cempra revealed successful results versus moxifloxacin from its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Cempra-rises-on-first-Phase-III-solithromycin-results-355944" target="_new">first Phase III study</a> at the start of the year. </p><p>The earlier late-stage clinical trial evaluated the company's oral solithromycin formulation, but the second Phase III trial is evaluating intravenous solithromycin in CABP patients who switch to the oral drug after a few days. Cempra CEO Prabha Fernandes said she is confident in the success of the second pivotal study, because patients in that clinical trial are sicker than in the first pivotal trial, and in the first Phase III study oral solithromycin worked best in the sickest patients.</p><p>"We're gearing up to commercialize solithromycin in the US on our own. We are financed with the intent to take it all the way," Fernandes said.</p><p>Cempra has a partnership with Fujifilm Toyama <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cempra-licenses-solithromycin-to-Toyama-in-Japan-343184" target="_new">for solithromycin in Japan</a> and the company intends to seek a partner for Europe and other global markets outside of the US and Japan.</p><p>Fernandes also noted that Cempra will set solithromycin pricing at reasonable levels for the market versus high prices that have been the undoing of recent antibiotic launches. The comments were made three days before Turing Pharmaceuticals and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton</a> pushed drug pricing concerns into the spotlight again.</p><p>"We have a broad use drug. We will charge reasonably, but profitably," Fernandes said, noting that payers are on board with Cempra's proposed solithromycin pricing if the antibiotic proves to be safe and effective in both of the company's Phase III clinical trials.</p><p><b>Solithromycin Is Not Like Eravacycline</b></p><p>In the meantime, Fernandes has been answering a lot of questions from concerned investors who saw Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals tumble earlier in September after its antibiotic eravacycline &ndash; a tetracycline analog &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Stocks-Tumble-On-Tetraphase-Flexion-Failures-Surge-On-Akebia-Win-360305" target="_new">failed in Tetraphase's second Phase III study</a>. The Cempra CEO noted that solithromycin and eravacycline are from different classes of antibiotics and have different pharmacokinetic profiles and the companies' Phase III programs are focused on different indications.</p><p>Eravacycline succeeded in its first Phase III study in complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) before the Tetraphase drug's failure in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), which Fernandes described as one of several blunders in the eravacycline late-stage program. It's more difficult to succeed in Phase III in two different indications, she said, especially when you're testing for superiority rather than non-inferiority and with a drug that does not have good oral bioavailability. </p><p>At $10.85 per share as of Sept. 21, Tetraphase's stock is trading 75.7% below its price following the Phase III failure announced on Sept. 8. Investors shaved a little over $2 off of Cempra's share price the day after the bad Tetraphase news, but the stock rebounded somewhat, closing at $35.28 on Sept. 21, or less than $1 below its Sept. 8 value.</p><p><b>Infectious Diseases Are Just The Beginning</b></p><p>In addition to her confidence in solithromycin's future success in the second Phase III CABP study, Fernandes sees a lot of potential for the drug beyond infectious diseases, because of its immunomodulatory effects. </p><p>Cempra is testing solithromycin in indications in which antibiotic treatment normally is not associated, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). </p><p>Fernandes noted, however, that pulmonologists in Europe commonly prescribe macrolide antibiotics for chronic use in about 30% of COPD patients. Cempra is working with Imperial College in London to test solithromycin in a small study to see if the drug's immunomodulatory effects will allow COPD patients admitted to the hospital to feel better and go home sooner.</p><p>In NASH, solithromycin's immunomodulatory effects may be able to reduce inflammation that causes liver fibrosis, which eventually leads to liver transplantation or hepatocellular cancer. Inflamed livers and high glucose levels in mice with NASH returned to normal after one month of treatment with half the normal human solithromycin dose whereas other drugs tested on NASH mice took three months to show effects on the liver. </p><p>The preclinical data will be presented during The Liver Meeting, hosted by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) from Nov. 13 to 17 in San Francisco, but a 12- to 15-patient human NASH study is under way. Cempra will conduct liver biopsies at the beginning and end of the study to assess liver fibrosis. Glucose levels will be monitored throughout the study.</p><p><b>Infectious Disease Remains Priority</b></p><p>Still, COPD and NASH programs remain in the company's longer-term view, while near-term infectious disease opportunities are Cempra's bread and butter. A Phase III study for solithromycin in the treatment of gonorrhea is under way.</p><p>Also, the company has funding from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for development of oral, liquid and intravenous formulations of solithromycin for children. </p><p>A Phase Ib study in newborn through adolescent patients is under way with plans to start a pivotal Phase IIb study in 2016. Fernandes said the first pediatric study enrolled quickly, because pediatricians are looking for new antibiotics for broad pediatric use.</p><p>Another future market for oral solithromycin may be Strep B infections in pregnant women &ndash; an indication for which penicillin is the only approved antibiotic. Cempra is looking for BARDA or other public funding for a human study.</p><p><p><p><p>
