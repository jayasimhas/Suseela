<p>Drug developers are filing for initial public offerings at a brisk pace in October despite falling biotechnology stock values and the struggle to price first-time offerings attractively, which begs the question: Are biotech companies afraid that the IPO window is about to close?</p><p>The past few months have been brutal for publicly-traded biotech and pharmaceutical firms as politicians scrutinize drug price increases and investors react to disappointing sales and clinical trial results, bringing the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) down 23.5% as of Oct. 21 versus the NBI's July 20 peak. Even so, the number of drug developers that have filed paperwork so far in October to support potential IPOs already exceeds the monthly average for 2015, but the four companies that launched first-time offerings this month have done so only after cutting proposed stock prices.</p><p><b>Rushing Through The Window</b></p><p>Ten therapeutics companies have registered new IPOs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as of Oct. 21 versus this year's average of six IPO filings per month &ndash; and there's still a week and a half left of October. </p><p>The rush to file suggests that biotech companies fear an end to the IPO bonanza that drug makers have dominated during the past few years, because recent performance of just-launched public biotech companies doesn't seem to justify the push to price new offerings.</p><p>Drug developers raised <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-A-US-biotech-IPO-surge-Data-are-mixed-359219" target="_new">$2.8bn in 29 first-time offerings</a> during the first half of 2015 and their stocks closed their first day of trading 24.2% above the IPO share price, on average. The four biotech companies that have launched IPOs so far in October ended their first day just 0.8% above their offering price and by Oct. 21 their shares rose only 2.2% above their IPO values, on average.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>IPO Range</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>IPO Price</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Amount Raised</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>1st-Day Value</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Oct. 21 Price</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Despite-Headwinds-US-IPOs-Show-Few-Signs-Of-Slowing-In-Q3-360806" target="_new">Aclaris Therapeutics Inc.</a>; </p><p>Malvern, Pennsylvania</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$14-$16</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$11</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$55m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$11.05</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$14.92</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>CytomX Therapeutics Inc.; </p><p>South San Francisco</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$12-$14</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$12</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$80m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$12.40</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$9.58</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Cerecor Inc.;</p><p>Baltimore, Maryland</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6-$7</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6.50</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$26m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6.40</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$6.15</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Strongbridge Biopharma plc (formerly Cortendo);</p><p>Trevose, Pennsylvania</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10 for 4.25m shares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10 for 2.5m shares</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$25m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$10</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$8</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>IPO performance began to slump in the third quarter when <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Despite-Headwinds-US-IPOs-Show-Few-Signs-Of-Slowing-In-Q3-360806" target="_new">eight of the 15 drug makers who went public</a> between July and September traded below their IPO prices as of Oct. 1.
