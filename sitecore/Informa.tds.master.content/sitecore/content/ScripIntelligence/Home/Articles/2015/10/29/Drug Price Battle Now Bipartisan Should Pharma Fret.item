<p>Drug companies, particularly Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, got a double punch from Capitol Hill on Nov. 4 when lawmakers from the House and the Senate upped their pressure on drug pricing &ndash; with a group of Democrats forming a new task force focused on combating "skyrocketing" costs of medicines and two senators turning the battle into a bipartisan fight by opening a new investigation and revealing plans for a hearing in December on the matter.</p><p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), chair of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the ranking member, took particular aim at Valeant, Turing and two other companies &ndash; Retrophin Inc. and Rodelis Therapeutics Inc. &ndash; who all had significantly increased the prices of certain medicines in recent months.</p><p>The reaction from investors was swift for the two public companies &ndash; with Retrophin getting smacked the hardest, with its shares tumbling about 19% on Nov. 4, before closing at $18.90, down $2.92, or $13.4%.</p><p>Shares of Valeant, which have been pummeled over the past few months under the pressure of the drug pricing issue, plus the most recent hubbub involving the company's relationships with some <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">shady-looking specialty pharmacies</a>, dropped 6.7%, before ending the day at $91.98, a loss of $5.88, or 6%.</p><p>McCaskill already had been making noise about increases in the prices of two of Valeant's drugs, Isuprel (isoprenaline) and Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside), declaring during a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gaming-the-US-tax-system-Wolf-packs-other-strategies-359711" target="_new">July hearing</a> there needed to be an investigation of the company. She followed up with a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">letter to Valeant</a> in September demanding information on its pricing practices and shot off another letter on Oct. 26 telling the firm its first response was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Well-Rehearsed-Valeant-Call-Unlikely-To-Stop-Deeper-Probes-361237" target="_new">inadequate</a>.</p><p>Valeant already has been under investigation by US attorneys in Boston and New York, which have issued <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">subpoenas</a> to the company. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Elijah Cummings also started their own probe of the firm in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">August</a> as part of their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Drug-price-yellow-signs-market-canaries-or-lemons-355217" target="_new">ongoing investigation</a> into drug companies that have acquired medicines and then hiked their prices. The lawmakers also have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introduced legislation</a> aimed at reining in the pricing practices of Valeant and other firms.</p><p>Now, McCaskill has convinced her Republican colleague Collins to join her in investigating Valeant and other companies &ndash; making the Capitol Hill efforts on probing drug pricing practices a bipartisan endeavor.</p><p>In a Nov. 4 letter to Valeant CEO Michael Pearson, the senators demanded documents and other information by Dec. 2 &ndash; making similar demands of Turing, Retrophin and Rodelis. </p><p>The "massive" price increases by those firms, Collins said, are "worthy of a serious, bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts and potential solutions."</p><p><b>FDA's Role Under Scrutiny</b></p><p>Collins and McCaskill said their investigation will not only look at the substantial price increases of recently acquired older, off-patent medicines, but also the role the FDA's generic drug approval process has played. They said they also would examine the FDA's distribution protocols, and, if necessary, its off-label regulatory regime.</p><p>Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) already had suggested the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Clearing-FDAs-Generics-Backlog-Answer-To-Drug-Price-Controversy-361105" target="_new">backlog</a> of applications seeking approval for generic medicines had potentially played a role in the "drastic prescription drug price increases &ndash; creating a "major obstacle to a market-based competitive response to manufacturers who choose to run up prices."</p><p><b>Turing</b></p><p>Vitter specifically called out the nearly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">5,500% spike by Turing</a> in the price of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine), whose price went from $13.50 per pill to $750 after the company acquired the medicine in August for $55m from Impax Laboratories.</p><p>Turing currently is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Antitrust-Trouble-For-Turing-NY-Opens-Probe-361030" target="_new">under investigation</a> by the New York attorney general, who is looking into whether the firm violated antitrust rules.</p><p>After coming under fire by Sanders and another presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, Turing CEO Martin Shkreli, who has been called the "most hated man in America" on social media, had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">pledged to lower</a> Daraprim's price. But he has yet to do so.</p><p>Earlier this week, however, Shkreli told HIV/AIDS activist Josh Robbins in an online interview he plans to drop Daraprim's price by Thanksgiving, although he acknowledged it would be only a "modest decrease" &ndash; insisting it's a difficult move to make until the firm has made its money back on the drug, which he admitted will never be a blockbuster.</p><p><b>Dems Task Force</b></p><p>While Collins and McCaskill have tentatively scheduled a Dec. 9 Senate Aging Committee hearing on drug pricing practices, Republicans in the House have yet to budge on the issue.</p><p>Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said in January he'd hold a hearing examining the prices of generic drugs &ndash; although agreeing to convene only that one session this year with it focused on those types of medicines &ndash; he has yet to set a date, Cummings, the ranking member, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"It's now November and we still haven't had the hearing," he said. "It would be legislative and political malpractice not to act on this."</p><p>In a Nov. 4 letter to Chaffetz, Cummings and the other Democratic members on the committee called for the chairman to schedule a Nov. 17 vote on whether to issue the subpoenas they had called for in September to compel the Valeant and Turing CEOs to produce documents explaining their price increases.</p><p>"Your silence on this issue is troubling for several reasons," the Democrats told Chaffetz. </p><p>At a Nov. 4 Capitol Hill press conference, members of the newly formed Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force &ndash; a club of only Democrats so far &ndash; took turns taking shots at biopharmaceutical companies that have raised the prices of their drugs, which they said are making the medicines out of reach for American patients.</p><p>"This is an emergency situation," declared Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI), the ranking member on the House Ways & Means Committee, who said he plans to ask the head of his panel to convene a hearing.</p><p>He insisted high prescription drug prices have put the whole health care system "out of whack."</p><p>"Taxpayers who helped fund drug development find themselves unable to afford the costs of treatment," asserted Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL). "Despite rising drug prices, we still have no information on how drugs are priced and what the true cost of production and research and development really is. The cost of production of a particular drug is hidden from view and we are just left with estimates based on research, getting protected, proprietary information on the average costs of drugs. It's very hard to get that information and we want to know what it is."</p><p>But, Schakowsky argued, "this is no longer good enough."</p><p>"If drug companies are going to make the argument that they need to price these drugs at such exorbitant rates because of the cost of R&D, then they need to be proving it," she contended.</p><p>This past spring, Schakowsky had offered up an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">amendment</a> to the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> &ndash; although withdrawing it so that the bill could more easily pass &ndash; that called for biopharmaceutical manufacturers seeking FDA approval to be forced to disclose and make public their R&D costs and identify any US government funding used to offset their expenses. </p><p><b>Rigged Market</b></p><p>"These companies grow their businesses with the benefit of taxpayer-sponsored research and then they turn around gouge the same taxpayers without whom the drug may not even exist," asserted Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT).</p><p>"The market has been rigged for the pharmaceutical companies," said David Cicilline (D-RI), who said the "egregious" price increases is "an issue that affects almost every single family" in the US.</p><p>Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) argued the increases in the costs of prescription drugs is "not happening because the market requires it," but "because the pharmaceutical companies have marketing and pricing power to charge whatever they want."</p><p>"That's got to end," Welch demanded, declaring lawmakers were "sending notice the rip-off days are over."</p><p>While the Vermont congressman said he saluted biopharmaceutical firms that invest in innovation, he also said "don't ask us to turn a blind eye" to the price increases by other firms.</p><p>Jim McDermott (D-WA) insisted the "pharmaceutical companies have got the Congress in the palm of their hand and will not let us go."</p><p>But Cummings said lawmakers "don't have the right to remain silent."</p><p><b>Cost Vs. Value</b></p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) said any <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Payers-Choice-Death-Is-Cheap-Drugs-Add-Costs-361324" target="_new">conversations about cost</a> "need to look at spending across the health care system and not just at the share of spending that goes toward life-changing medicines."</p><p>But Kenneth Lisaius, senior vice president of communications at the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said his group was "disappointed" that the Democrats task force "seems likely to be narrowly focused on the cost of prescription drugs, rather than the enormous value they bring to patients, the healthcare system and society in general." </p><p>Cummings acknowledged there needs to be a broader conversation about costs versus value &ndash; a topic Health and Human Services plans to tackle at a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hashing-Out-Rising-Drug-Costs-An-Invitation-Only-Event-361363" target="_new">Nov. 20 invitation-only forum</a>.</p><p>But, Cummings told <i>Scrip</i>, neither PhRMA nor BIO has approached him about having those discussions with lawmakers.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
