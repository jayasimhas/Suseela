<p>The US Supreme Court has refused to hear arguments in appeals brought by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. in lawsuits against Apotex Inc., which is seeking to market a generic version of Benicar (olmesartan) in the US.</p><p>Mylan and Daiichi wanted the justices to overturn a decision this past spring by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which had ruled that Apotex had standing to seek a declaratory judgment that it would not infringe a patent held by Daiichi, even though the latter company in 2006 had disclaimed the patent, known as '703. </p><p>The dispute stemmed from the fact that the '703 patent, despite being disclaimed, remained listed in the FDA's <i>Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations</i> &ndash; a large volume commonly called the <i>Orange Book</i>, which contains patent numbers and expiration dates &ndash; for Benicar.</p><p>Daiichi had disclaimed the '703 patent when it was first challenged by an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed by Mylan.</p><p>Daiichi was able to successfully assert a second <i>Orange Book</i>-listed patent, known as '599, and therefore blocked Mylan's entry into the market. </p><p>But as the first party to file a so-called Paragraph IV certification, Mylan insisted it was entitled to a 180-day exclusivity period if it entered the market within 75 days of a final judgment that the relevant patents were invalid or not infringed, regardless of whether that judgment was obtained in litigation involving the company or a later ANDA filer.</p><p>Under the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, generic makers submit Paragraph IV certifications to the FDA stating the patents covering the branded product are invalid, unenforceable or uninfringed by the proposed copycat version &ndash; an action that generally results in the innovator firm bringing patent litigation.</p><p>A so-called Paragraph III certification indicates that an ANDA may be approved on the patent expiration date.</p><p>Apotex had filed an ANDA in June 2012 with a Paragraph III certification alleging that no infringement of the '599 patent would occur and also a Paragraph IV certification for the disclaimed '703 patent. </p><p>When Daiichi did not bring suit to enforce the disclaimed '703 patent, Apotex filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it would not infringe the '703 patent.</p><p>But the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that Apotex lacked standing and dismissed the case. </p><p>On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit reversed, holding that a "justiciable" case or controversy existed because a judgment of non-infringement could open the door for Apotex to enter the market earlier, as it would trigger the 75-day deadline for Mylan to enter or forfeit exclusivity, Jenkins said.</p><p>Mylan and Daiichi had asked the Supreme Court to review whether a party has standing to ask for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement of a disclaimed patent.</p><p>But Washington lawyer William Jay, a partner at Goodwin Procter and a co-chair of the firm's appellate litigation practice, noted that Mylan had asked the Supreme Court to hold off on taking up the case until it ruled in another lawsuit about standing, <i>Spokeo v. Robins</i>, for which the justices heard oral arguments on Nov. 2.</p><p>That case involves a Virginia man, Tom Robins, who sued Spokeo, which collects information for credit reports, declaring the search engine had violated the <i>Fair Credit Reporting Act</i> (FCRA) because it had published multiple inaccuracies about his personal information, such as his age, marital status, employment and education.</p><p>Robins sought to form a class action suit with other people whose information Spokeo had gotten wrong. </p><p>But a district court dismissed the case, declaring that Robins had to show he'd actually been harmed.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, overturned the district court's decision, insisting the violation of the FCRA was enough to have standing to sue in federal court.</p><p>But Mylan's tactic to get the court to hold off until it ruled on <i>Spokeo</i> failed, Jay pointed out. </p><p>"The court apparently concluded that no matter how it resolves the <i>Spokeo</i> case, its reasoning will not affect the Federal Circuit's holding that Apotex can sue over a disclaimed patent," he explained. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
