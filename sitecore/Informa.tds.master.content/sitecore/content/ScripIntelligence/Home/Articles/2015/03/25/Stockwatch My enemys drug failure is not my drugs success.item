<p>In life sciences, big share price movements occur in response to merger and acquisition (M&A) activity, clinical trial results and regulatory events. Actual, rather than rumoured M&A is the panacea for many investors but some companies have played up to this by appearing to spend more effort stoking rumours of their impending acquisition than developing their drugs. Such is the case with Achillion Pharmaceuticals, whose cry of acquisition wolf after each of its hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral competitors is acquired has been accompanied by a share price rise and an inevitable fundraising by the company. It is illogical for investors to believe that any and all companies developing HCV antivirals will be acquired. Those that have been repeatedly passed over as competitors with better and more advanced products are snapped up seem to be unlikely M&A candidates, but when they shout loud enough, investors behave as if this is a maximum sum game.</p><p><p>One of the other naiveties of the contemporary shift by financial academics away from the capital asset pricing model to behavioural finance in an attempt to try and explain asset pricing is to assume that investment is a zero sum game. Last week we were given two ironic examples of how investor behaviour actually reinforced this error.</p><p><p>The failure of one drug, or indeed the invalidation of a drug target, should not necessarily mean that anyone else developing drugs against the same target will be successful. Two of these zero sum games appeared to have been acted out in Europe last week. French metabolic company Genfit lost about half its value when it reported "positive" results from its Phase IIb GOLDEN-505 study of GFT505 in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/NASH-market-investors-clamor-for-answers-357549" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 March 2015</a>). The study failed the primary endpoint because of a high rate of NASH reversal in mild patients. As a result of Genfit's study failure, the share price of its competitor Intercept Pharmaceuticals jumped about 15%. Intercept's drug for NASH was not any more efficacious as a result of Genfit's failure, nor was it less likely to raise serum lipids to levels that had been partially responsible for its Phase II study being halted on safety grounds (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intercept-quiet-on-NASH-safety-data-disclosure-concerns-351960" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 May 2014</a>). Nevertheless, Genfit's loss is apparently Intercept's gain &ndash; despite the discovery of a high rate of spontaneous resolution in NASH patients which should logically be a negative for all companies developing treatments for NASH.</p><p><p>When I worked in a pharmaceutical company the purpose of Phase II was meant to show whether a drug has a dose-dependent efficacy in patients, and to determine the dose for phase III. Increasingly biotechnology companies use Phase II as an automatic stepping stone into Phase III. In the past, companies such as Elan and Antisoma have ignored negative data in Phase II and barrelled headlong into Phase III to their investors' great cost. More recently, Biogen, perhaps not wanting to know what a properly conducted Phase II study would tell them, threw caution to the wind and dispensed with it altogether (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Biogens-belligerent-repetition-355489" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 8 December 2014</a>). Likewise Genfit has decided to barrel on into a Phase III study of GFT505 in NASH without success in Phase II. The natural progression of conducting Phase III after a failed Phase II was demonstrated recently by Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, which, on announcing its Phase III failure (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sunesis-sinks-on-Phase-III-Qinprezo-survival-miss-354316" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 6 October 2014</a>), also outlined the intention to file for approval in Europe &ndash; the land where the reasons for unsafe and inefficacious drug approvals have until recently, only been suspected (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/French-agencies-to-probe-claims-of-malpractice-by-former-committee-members-357547" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 March 2015</a>).</p><p><p>A principal tenet of drug development is that if something can go wrong, it will do. A higher self-resolving population is an unlucky discovery and the last time a European company was this unlucky in Phase II was when Addex's clinical trial failed on safety grounds (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Addex-terminates-development-of-lead-drug-candidate-for-long-term-migraine-and-GORD-therapy-185307" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16 December 2009</a>). A similar zero sum calculation was being performed when German antibody company Morphosys announced that partner Celgene was terminating its collaboration on the anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody MOR202 for multiple myeloma (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-drops-Morphosyss-daratumumab-chasing-anti-CD38-MAb-357522" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 27 March 2015</a>). Oncology specialist Celgene should know a thing or two about multiple myeloma since it already has approved drugs for this indication. If Celgene doesn't know what a competitive target product profile looks like in multiple myeloma, probably nobody does. On the day of Morphosys's announcement, investors pushed the share price of GenMab up over 10%, because it has a similar anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody licensed to Johnson & Johnson. However, investors should at least be considering the possibility of a zero game, rather than a zero sum game, since the risks of developing an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody that could be competitive with Celgene's Revlimid (lenalidomide) just went up. In addition, GenMab has additional platform risk since its first fully human antibody against CD20 (Arzerra, ofatumumab) has long been stuck in the shadow of Roche's ageing chimeric antibody against CD20 (Rituxan, rituximab) which appears to have better activity and a paradoxically lower rate of hypersensitivity. </p><p><p>It is quite possible that effective disease-modifying therapies for indications such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, NASH and sickle cell disease may continue to elude modern pharmaceutical development. One drug's failure in an indication shouldn't automatically raise the chances of success, or diminish the toxic liabilities of the remaining drugs in development, since none of them yet has any market share. Last week's investor behaviour incorrectly suggests that competitive drug development is a zero sum game. For those who still naively believe this, researching the history of drug development in stroke and sepsis should prove quite a shock.</p><p><p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include Celgene, Morphosys, Biogen and Roche. </p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
