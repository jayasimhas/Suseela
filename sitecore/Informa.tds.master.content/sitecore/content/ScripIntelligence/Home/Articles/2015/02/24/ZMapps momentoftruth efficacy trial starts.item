<p>Researchers are finally able to test whether the experimental drug ZMapp earned the attention it's been getting since this past fall or whether it's all hype &ndash; the drug's moment of truth. </p><p>A trial examining the safety and efficacy of Mapp Biopharmaceuticals' three-drug monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail officially got underway on 27 February at Ebola treatment centers in Monrovia, Liberia. </p><p>The drug also will be tested at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland in the trial, which is being run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the government of Liberia, whose president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was coincidentally visiting the White House on 27 February.</p><p>Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia and the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska also are being considered as potential US sites. </p><p>LeafBio, the commercial arm of San Diego-based Mapp, said on 27 February the FDA had approved the firm's investigational new drug application for ZMapp &ndash; clearing the way for the clinical trials of the drug to start in Liberia. </p><p>"We have been working toward this moment for more than a decade, and are heartened by the support and responsiveness of the governments and organizations committed like we are to finding treatments for this devastating disease," said Mapp CEO Dr Kevin Whaley.</p><p>Larry Zeitlin, president of Mapp, said the firm is "optimistic about ZMapp's effectiveness.</p><p>ZMapp entered the public spotlight this past August when it was used in humans for the first time to treat two Ebola-infected American aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol, who were volunteering in Liberia when they came down with the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tiny-biotech-Mapps-Ebola-drug-thrust-into-spotlight-353192" target="_new">05 August 2014</a>).</p><p>The drug &ndash; the tiny amount that previously was available &ndash; also was used in other patients, although not always with successful outcomes (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-modern-techniques-too-late-to-save-doctor-355108" target="_new">17 November 2014</a>).</p><p>"Although ZMapp has been used to treat several Ebola-infected patients in recent months, we cannot determine if the drug actually benefitted those patients because it was not administered within the context of a clinical trial," said NIAID Director Dr Anthony Fauci. </p><p>ZMapp is manufactured in tobacco-based plants, known as <i>Nicotiana</i>. </p><p>Mapp describes its experimental drug is an optimized cocktail combining the "best components" of the firm's MB-033 and another product, ZMab, which is being developed by Toronto-based Defyrus and the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p><p>Late last summer, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded Mapp $24.9m to speed the development of ZMapp. The contract ultimately could be worth $42.3m for tiny San Diego-based Mapp (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-gambles-24.9m-to-speed-Ebola-drug-ZMapp-353682" target="_new">3 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Kentucky Bioprocessing currently is doing the work of growing ZMapp (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Earlier this week, BARDA Director Dr Robin Robinson, whose agency is also backing support of other tobacco-grown mAbs, said the start of the trial of ZMapp in West Africa was imminent (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BARDA-funds-ZMapp-like-Ebola-drugs-from-Medicago-Fraunhofer-356931" target="_new">25 February 2015</a>).</p><p>His boss, Dr Nicole Lurie, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed that information during a 26 February Capitol Hill hearing (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Medical-countermeasures-drive-pharma-innovation-US-officials-356971" target="_new">27 February 2015</a>).</p><p>It wasn't until last month there finally was enough ZMapp to start Phase I and II trials in patients with Ebola in Liberia and the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-Ebola-vaccines-set-for-testing-in-Liberia-356313" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>'Pairwise' study</b></p><p>The study is enrolling people of all ages &ndash; adults and children &ndash; who have been admitted to Ebola treatment units in Liberia. It also was designed to enroll US healthcare workers who were infected with Ebola in West Africa and returned home for treatment and Americans who may have acquired the virus through a secondary transmission. </p><p>While ZMapp is the first drug to be tested in the study, there are several others waiting in the wings to potentially be next: Tekmira's TKM-Ebola, BioCryst's BCX4430, Sarepta's AVI-7537 and Fujifilm's and Toyama's favipiravir &ndash; the latter drug of which already is being examined in another study in West Africa (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Africa-trials-underway-testing-Chimerix-Fujifilm-Ebola-drugs-355963" target="_new">6 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/West-Africa-Ebola-trials-to-test-brincidofovir-favipiravir-355056" target="_new">13 November 2014</a>).</p><p>The NIH-Liberian government study also may investigate the safety and efficacy of convalescent or post-immunization plasma collected from recent Ebola infection survivors. It may also be expanded to include plasma donors who have participated in Phase I Ebola vaccine trials and whose plasma shows high neutralizing activity against the virus.</p><p>The trial allows for a series of pairwise comparisons of experimental Ebola interventions against a background of optimized standard of care (oSOC) &ndash; intravenous fluids, electrolyte balancing, oxygen status and blood pressure maintenance and treatment for other infections, if they occur. </p><p>The goal of the study is to determine whether one or more of the interventions improve mortality over what is achievable through oSOC alone.</p><p>The study's primary endpoint is comparative mortality at day 28, with a number of secondary endpoints, which the NIH said hopefully will generate generalizable knowledge about the relative safety and antiviral activity of these adjunctive interventions.</p><p>All study participants will receive the oSOC for treating Ebola infection. Then they will be assigned randomly to receive oSOC only &ndash; the control group &ndash; or oSOC plus the study drug, with ZMapp being the first in the trial to be tested. </p><p>Three separate intravenous infusions of ZMapp will be administered three days apart, with the total dose of the drug depending on the weight of the participant. </p><p>The Ebola patients will be monitored up to 30 days after being discharged from the hospital and may return for outpatient visits for additional follow up.</p><p>Under the pairwise protocol, if one of the drug candidates proves to be statistically more effective, it will become the basis of the new standard of care against which additional investigational Ebola interventions could be tested and compared, the NIH said. </p><p>Each experimental therapy will be examined in up to 100 participants per arm. </p><p>If the study researchers are unable to establish a significant difference after enrolling the 100 patients per arm, that particular treatment will then be declared ineffective and the scientists will move on and start testing the next therapy.</p><p>"This clinical trial will help us determine if ZMapp and other treatments are safe and effective for use in the current devastating outbreak in West Africa as well as in future outbreaks," Dr Fauci said.</p><p>Although Ebola has infected nearly 24,000 people during the current outbreak, killing more than 9,600 &ndash; about half of whom lived in Liberia &ndash; the rates of new infections have declined in recent months. </p><p>So the NIH said it is anticipating the need to be flexible in conducting the study to address the changing nature of the outbreak. </p><p>The trial is expected to conclude in December 2016. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
