<p>Reassuring cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS study of Merck & Co's Januvia (sitagliptin) should reinforce the market leadership of the DPP-IV inhibitor after its rivals' CVOT studies saw an unexpected signal for heart failure hospitalization. </p><p>The good news for Januvia came as Sanofi's GLP1 agonist Lyxumia (lixisenatide, licensed from Zealand Pharma) also produced clean CV data from its ELIXA study that will allow it finally to be resubmitted in the US. Both trials were presented in full this week at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.</p><p>TECOS (trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin) was the largest study of its kind and met its primary composite endpoint on non-inferiority (defined as the time to the first confirmed event of any of the following: CV-related death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) for sitagliptin when added to usual care, compared with usual care alone. The top-line data from the study in 14,671 patients with type 2 diabetes and established CV disease in the coronary, cerebral or peripheral arteries study were released in April, and the full data have also been published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>These show that after a median follow-up of three years, a primary endpoint event occurred in 11.4% (n=839) of sitagliptin-treated patients compared with 11.6% (n=851) of placebo patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (HR=0.98; 95% CI [0.89-1.08]). For the per protocol analysis, the figures were 9.6% (n=695) in both the sitagliptin and placebo groups (HR=0.98; 95% CI [0.88-1.09]; p<0.001 for=""></0.001></p><p>Notably, there was no increase in hospitalization for heart failure (7.3% vs 7.2%) and rates of all-cause mortality (7.5% vs 7.3%) were similar in both treatment groups, two key secondary endpoints.</p><p>Acute pancreatitis, another safety concern for the class, was uncommon in the study, occurring in 0.3% of sitagliptin patients and 0.2% of placebo patients (ns, p=0.065). Likewise, pancreatic cancer occurred in 0.1% and 0.2% of patients respectively (ns, p=0.322).</p><p>Good results for TECOS were critical to the DPP-IV class after the "confusing" heart failure hospitalization (hHF) signal was observed in two previously announced DPP-IV inhibitors CVOT trials, SAVOR with AstraZeneca's Onglyza (saxagliptin) and to a lesser extent in EXAMINE with Takeda's Nesina (alogliptin), said analysts at Leerink. At a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Add-heart-failure-risk-to-AstraZeneca-Takeda-DPP-4s-357886" target="_new">FDA advisory panel meeting</a> in April, committee members wanted the data added to the products' labels. </p><p>Analysts at Sagient's BioMedTracker commented that, "The FDA will now need to decide what to put on the labels for these DPP-IVs, if anything. One KOL we spoke with simply did not know what the agency would do and another, while also uncertain, leaned toward mention of the issue for saxagliptin but not sitagliptin. We tend to think that too, because we do not think the FDA will be convinced the saxagliptin finding must just be due to chance." While they cannot completely rule out the chance that the FDA would add warnings for the other DPP-IV inhibitors based on a class effect, they added, "If saxagliptin alone has the information on its label, it could of course be a commercial disadvantage, though that could be mitigated by formulary negotiations."</p><p>The Leerink analysts said: "Overall, even though Januvia did not demonstrate superior CVOT over placebo, it demonstrated its utility as a glucose-lowering agent and 'there is no hint of safety a concern' according to one of the physician presenters." And they added that the TECOS data could provide a relatively compelling counter-detail opportunity for Merck against AstraZeneca's Onglyza franchise, which currently holds over 10% market share. The analysts forecast Januvia sales of $6.1bn this year, rising to $6.4bn in 2016, higher than consensus figures of $5.5bn and $5.76bn respectively. </p><h2>ELIXA of Lyxumia </h2><p>ELIXA was the first CVOT of a GLP1 receptor agonist to report. </p><p>The data from the trial will be included in the Lyxumia's US NDA resubmission which is now set for July &ndash; in the earlier part of the previously disclosed third-quarter timetable. An initial filing there was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-pulls-US-lixisenatide-filing-346519" target="_new">withdrawn in 2013</a> after discussions with the FDA to give time for the ELIXA study to complete, meaning that it has some catching up to do with rival GLP1 products. </p><p>In the the Phase IIIb ELIXA study in adults with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, lixisenatide met the pre-specified endpoint of non-inferiority versus placebo for a composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and hospitalization for unstable angina (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]: 1.017 [0.886 to 1.168]). It did not, however, show superiority, as the upper bound of confidence interval was greater than 1.0. </p><p>There was no signal for increased risk of heart failure (HR [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.75 to 1.23]), pancreatitis (0.2% with lixisenatide and 0.3% with placebo), pancreatic cancer (<0.1% vs="" 0.3%),="" or="" severe="" symptomatic="" hypoglycemia="" (0.3="" events="" per="" 100="" patient-years="" with="" lixisenatide;="" 0.6="" per="" 100="" patient-years="" with=""></0.1%></p><p>Leerink analysts noted that the ADA discussant "stated that all CVOT studies mandated by the FDA are likely to show what they are designed to show &ndash; neutrality for MACE (major adverse cardiac event). By design, they are unlikely to show CV benefits unless a drug has 'dramatic' off-target effects on atherosclerosis."</p><p>But a key issue is whether the encouraging safety data will help lixisenatide commercially, noted the BioMedTracker analysts. "One KOL did not think these studies would have much impact on the status quo for either drug, and noted lixisenatide's weakness is its more modest efficacy." They are raising lixisenatide's likelihood of US approval by 5% (which will bring it to 97% once it moves to NDA) on the back of the data. </p><p>The next GLP1 agonist due to present CVOT data is Novo Nordisk's Victoza (liraglutide) with the LEADER study due to report in about a year's time. </p><p><p><p><p>
