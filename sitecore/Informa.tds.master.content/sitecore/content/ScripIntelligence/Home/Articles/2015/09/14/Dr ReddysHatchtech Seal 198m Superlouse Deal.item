<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories will take to market Australian firm Hatchtech Pty Ltd's late-stage, next-generation head lice product in a deal potentially worth up to $200m.</p><p>While Dr Reddy's appears to be stringing together a clutch of in-licensing deals to fill up portfolio gaps or capitalize on complementary and niche opportunities in specific markets, Hatchtech chief executive Hugh Alsop was reported in the foreign media as saying that the deal is further proof that Australian research can get from the "university lab to market".</p><p>Hatchtech is backed by a clutch of investors including OneVentures Innovation Fund, the University of Melbourne Endowment Trust and Queensland Biotechnology Fund, among others.</p><p>Hatchtech's prescription head lice product, Xeglyze Lotion, is a topical formulation containing abametapir, an inhibitor of metalloproteases, and has shown both ovicidal and lousicidal activity. The active drug substance for the product was developed in collaboration with Dr Reddy&rsquo;s custom pharmaceutical services business unit.</p><p>Hatchtech is slated to file a NDA for the product with the US FDA on Sept. 14, statement from Dr Reddy's said. </p><p>Significantly, the filing comes amid new research recently presented at the American Chemical Society's national meeting suggesting that lice populations in at least 25 American states had developed resistance to widely used over-the-counter treatments</p><p>Xeglyze offers the potential for a more effective treatment using only a single application compared with existing repeat administration products.</p><p>Hatchtech had some years ago indicated that Xeglyze Lotion (then referred to as DeOvo) was being developed initially as a prescription product, but we will probably seek a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Hatchtech-locks-in-new-funding-for-lead-project-22258" target="_new">shift to over-the-counter status</a> later, though an update on that position could not immediately be got. </p><p>Dr Reddy's is to pay Hatchtech an upfront of $10m, up to $50m based on certain pre commercialization milestones and an undisclosed sum based on post commercialization milestones, linked to achievement of annual net sales targets. The Sydney Morning Herald reported Hatchtech's Alsop as telling Fairfax Media that the deal is worth up to A$279m ($198m).</p><p>Dr Reddy's will receive exclusive rights to the product for the US, Canada, India, Russia and the CIS, Australia, New Zealand and Venezuela.</p><p>On FDA approval Xeglyze will be marketed in the US by Promius Pharma, Dr Reddy's wholly-owned specialty arm that is currently focused on the dermatology and neurology segments.</p><p>In September last year, Hatchtech announced positive results from its two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating Xeglyze Lotion as a potential treatment for head lice infestation. The studies involved 704 people, across 14 clinical trial sites in the US and resulted in an 81.5% success rate, following the observation period of 14 days after a single 10 minute application. </p><p>This is the second such deal for Dr Reddy's over the recent past. Last week, the Indian firm and PanTheryx Inc, a medical nutrition company based in Boulder, Colorado, announced a pact that grants Dr Reddy&rsquo;s exclusive rights to market and distribute PanTheryx's breakthrough nutritional intervention for infectious diarrhoea in a clutch of nations.</p>
