<p> There is a big unmet need around the ethical management and supply of unlicensed medicines. Their unlicensed status could be due to the products still being experimental, or that the products have been approved in certain territories but not others. And as patients and their physicians become increasingly demanding about access to hard-to-get medicines, a trend which is expected to continue, pharma companies understand they have a responsibility to work with physicians to enable access. And companies such as Clinigen are there to help. Scrip spoke to Clinigen's deputy CEO Shaun Chilton. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: Why is there an unmet need in unlicensed medicines?</b> </p> <p> <b>Shaun Chilton:</b> There is quite a startling statistic: around 80% of the world's population doesn't have access to the medicines they require. Partly this is because of the changing commercial model of pharma. Pharma no longer does the big bang global launch to tens of countries and for broad indications. It is a very much more targeted launch process now: the major developed pharma markets and relatively narrow indications and then the life cycle is managed from there in terms of progressive launches expanding indications based on increasingly real world data, and only then if there is real commercial benefit coupled with unmet or underserved patient need. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: How do regulators feel about the supply of unlicensed medicines?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> What's becoming increasingly obvious is that the regulators on one side and physicians and patients on the other side are now almost meeting in the middle. The regulators understand that there is a need to manage the supply of medicines on an unlicensed basis. They also understand that it is not commercially viable for pharma companies to have a marketing authorization with a sales force and medical support or some sort of activity on the ground in every single country. And patients and patient advocacy groups, not just in the US but in other parts of the world, particularly in rare diseases and oncology, are much more informed and are much more vocal about their desire to access medicines, irrespective of what politicians say and irrespective of what regulators historically have tried to do to manage this area. </p> <p> A good example of that is in the US, where you can look at the 'Right to Try' legislation and the 21st Century Cures Act which were been passed recently. The FDA and the US government have realized that they can't stand against this anymore and need to engage in the debate and find workable solutions. And that's just one example. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: You recently signed a managed access program for an investigational ALS therapy with Neuraltus Pharmaceuticals. How does this fit into the situation that you describe? </b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> The Neuraltus partnership and other similar agreements are being driven by more informed patients who are going to their physician and saying, 'OK, I've got this disease. You've diagnosed me. I've done my own research online and accessed clinicaltrials.gov and talked to patient forums, and I'm much more aware of what's out there and what's in development, and what's available in different parts of the world that I can't get access to.' Patients are increasingly saying to their physician: 'You've tried everything else, and I want to be part of managing my own treatment, and I have a view &ndash; rightly or wrongly &ndash; on the types of treatments available.' </p> <p> We can help respond to that in two ways. With managed access, we work with pharmaceutical companies of all sizes to manage &ndash; in a controlled way &ndash; early access of those more innovative experimental drugs. </p> <p> Clinigen does not say 'Drug A is better than Drug B and more appropriate for your patients.' The decision that, 'Every opportunity to prescribe a licensed medicine has been exhausted and I now have to look at experimental medicines or medicines that aren't available in my country in the best interests of my patient,' is very much made by the physician. We then work with the pharmaceutical company to make that product available in a controlled and ethical way, often free of charge. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: So pharmaceutical companies are actually providing a valued service here?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> There are good reasons why it's an ethical and important service that a particular pharmaceutical company offers an unlicensed medicine. </p> <p> The other end of the spectrum is that in lots of markets, not just developing markets but even relatively mature markets, there are lots of products that have never been made commercially available for one reason or another and they can be quite mature products. How you manage access to these products has to be done in a very ethical and controlled way to try and mitigate the risk of counterfeit or unsuitable substandard drugs entering the supply chain. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: So who predominantly drives Clinigen's business activities? Patients or pharma companies?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> Fundamentally with the supply of unlicensed medicines, it is the unmet medical need highlighted by physicians in treating their patients who have exhausted all licensed treatment options that is important here. With the managed access side, it's predominantly from the pharmaceutical company because they are at a very important stage of development with their product. They do [managed access] for a couple of reasons. One, physicians are becoming more and more connected and so in these niche areas, key opinion leaders, the investigators of the big trials, and people running investigator initiated studies talk to each other at conferences and they know what's in development; it gets them thinking. So when they're treating their patients who have these rare diseases, mostly oncology or infectious disease conditions, the difficult to treat cases, and when they have exhausted licensed therapies, they are aware that there is another avenue, a legitimate ethical avenue, to access new innovative medicines. So they will often petition the pharma company. </p> <p> But it's also in these pharmaceutical companies' interests because, at that pre-launch stage, it is a great opportunity for the opinion leaders and the treating physicians to get as familiar as they can with these new innovative medicines. That works both ways: the treating physicians get more familiar, and ultimately are able to treat patients in a more effective way, and also they are able to feed back to the pharma company how they are using the drug and how they are finding the use of that drug. With the rise and importance of real world data, what's becoming more and more obvious is that the traditional clinical trial setting &ndash; certainly the big multicenter clinical trials &ndash; is starting to die as a useful model of what a drug is going to do in patients when it gets out into the real world. Hence you've got this rise in the desire to capture and manage real world data as a way of much more effectively commercializing products. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: Are there regulatory processes in place governing this supply of unlicensed medicines?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> Absolutely. That's one of the most important things to remember here and part of the service that we offer. We managed the supply of a wide range of products into about 95 countries last year and we have to understand what the regulatory mechanism in each of those countries is in order to ensure a controlled and ethical process. </p> <p> We manage, on behalf of the drug company, access to the drug directly to the hospital, directly to the physician. There are very tightly controlled regulatory processes and they are changing regularly in all countries, not just the US. We constantly have to monitor these changes and how they need to be interpreted and of course our considerations are not just regulatory, there is then a very practical consideration of how to get the product from us to whichever country in the world it might need to be. Depending on the product and the nature of the program, a request could come from any country in the world. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: How can it be worth the time and effort if it is being driven on an individual basis?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> If you're a big pharma company that's entirely true. But for us &ndash; as a specialist company with some of our own niche products to sell &ndash; we are entirely geared up to be delivering very small quantities of product to lots of different places. </p> <p> I would agree that if you are a big CRO or a big pharmaceutical company, it isn't commercially viable to manage this in-house and in fact you don't have the resources internally to keep on top of this. But that's why we are able to offer a very value-added, cost-effective outsourcing solution for them. </p> <p> <p> <b>Scrip: You recently acquired Link Healthcare which has a focus on Asia, Africa and Australasia. These are on the whole developing markets. How does this fit your strategy?</b> </p> <p> <b>SC:</b> In the developing areas of the world, or pharmerging markets, where healthcare systems are still developing, there are quite often a number of mature products that haven't previously been made available commercially because &ndash; particularly with the bigger pharma companies &ndash; they haven't been able to make a full commercial launch work commercially for themselves. Small numbers of drugs into small markets doesn't really sustain the big pharma model. But particularly in these niche, hospital-only sectors, there is still a viable commercial model for us because of our size. Not just for our own products but partnering with big pharma in particular and giving them that service so they don't have to attempt to set up lots of subsidiary companies in every single country. We're giving them a different commercialization model. Big pharma largely identified the emerging markets quite a long time ago as a potential growth opportunity but there are not that many success stories from the top 25 pharma in terms of those that have really been able to make that work. This is partly because they're big, and just not nimble enough to respond, so we can give them a viable alternative. </p>
