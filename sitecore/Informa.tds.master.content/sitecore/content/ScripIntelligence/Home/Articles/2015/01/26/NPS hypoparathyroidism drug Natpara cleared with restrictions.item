<p>The FDA on 23 January gave its nod to NPS Pharmaceuticals, which is being acquired by Shire, to market Natpara, an injectable recombinant human parathyroid hormone replacement therapy, as a treatment for patients with hypoparathyroidism. </p><p>The drug is the first parathyroid hormone approved by the FDA for hypoparathyroidism, a rare endocrine disorder, in which the body produces insufficient levels of the hormone, a principal regulatory of the body's mineral homeostasis.</p><p>The news of Natpara&rsquo;s approval came after the markets closed on 23 January. Investors pushed shares of NPS up 35 cents in after-hours trading, after the stock had closed at $45.64, where it had landed a day earlier.</p><p>Dr Flemming Ornskov, CEO of Shire, said the FDA's approval of Natpara "further validates" his company's decision to acquire NPS, which he said is "an excellent strategic fit allowing us to leverage our market expertise, core capabilities in rare disease patient management, and global footprint" (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-paying-5.2bn-for-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-356071" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The deal, in which Shire has bid $5.2bn for NPS, is expected to close in the first quarter. </p><p>Before the FDA's approval, Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, put the chances of Natpara gaining the agency's blessing in hypoparathyroidism at 88%, which is 1% below the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase. </p><p>The approval comes after the FDA's Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) voted 8-5 at a 12 September 2014 meeting in supporting Natpara's entrance onto the US market &ndash; a decision that was strongly influenced by the vivid descriptions patients relayed about the adverse effects they confront on a frequent, sometimes daily, basis in dealing with hypoparathyroidism (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vivid-stories-help-NPS-Natpara-win-panel-support-353921" target="_new">13 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Indeed, despite their reservations about the proposed dosing regimen and certain adverse events and potential risks, including osteosarcoma, many on the EMDAC cited the experiences of the dozen or so patients, advocates and family members of those with the rare endocrine disorder as their reasoning for voting to affirm the drug to treat the condition (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vivid-stories-help-NPS-Natpara-win-panel-support-353921" target="_new">10 September 2014</a>).</p><p>The FDA, however, addressed the osteosarcoma risk by imposing a black-box warning on Natpara's labeling, declaring the drug should only be used in patients whose hypocalcemia cannot be controlled on calcium supplementation and active forms of vitamin D, and for whom the potential benefits are considered to outweigh this potential risk.</p><p>Natpara is only available through a restricted program under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).</p><p>Nonetheless, Dr Ornskov said Natpara's labeling was in line with his firm's expectations.</p><p>The REMS was anticipated, given NPS this past October had revealed the FDA had requested such a plan, resulting in the agency extending by three months the drug's <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date. </p><p>Although several on the EMDAC had pleaded with the FDA not to approve Natpara as a once-daily medicine, the agency, nonetheless, granted the NPS drug approval with that regimen.</p><p>The FDA approved a started dose of Natpara, which is self-administered by subcutaneous injection, of 50mcg once daily. </p><p>Natpara's application was supported by 12 pharmacology studies and four company-sponsored efficacy and safety studies. </p><p>The firm's pivotal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III REPLACE study was the largest clinical trial conducted to date in patients with hypoparathyroidism, NPS pointed out.</p><p>The company reported that Natpara increased serum calcium levels, while reducing the need for oral calcium and active vitamin D. In some cases, the drug eliminated the need for active vitamin D altogether. </p><p>The FDA noted that results showed 42% of Natpara-treated participants achieved normal blood calcium levels on reduced doses of calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D, versus 3% of placebo-treated participants.</p><p>In the trials, the most common adverse reactions associated with Natpara and occurring in greater than 10% of individuals were paresthesia, hypocalcemia, headache, hypercalcemia, nausea, and hypoesthesia, diarrhea, vomiting, arthralgia, hypercalciuria and pain in extremity. </p><p>NPS noted that Natpara was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations or in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. </p><p>Natpara had received orphan drug designation as a hypoparathyroidism treatment from the FDA in 2007, winning the same status from the EMA in 2013.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
