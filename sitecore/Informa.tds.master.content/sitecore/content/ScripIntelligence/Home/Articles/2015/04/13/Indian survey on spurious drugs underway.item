<p>India continues to move ahead with efforts to tighten regulatory oversight in the pharmaceutical segment.</p><p>It is working on a new countrywide survey to determine the extent of spurious and "not of standard quality" drugs and expects to draw around 47,000 drug samples across the country as part of the initiative.</p><p>In a notice dated 13 April, India's Drugs Controller General, Dr GN Singh, said that 75 drug inspectors from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) had been deputed to the National Institute of Biologicals (NIB) to carry out the "humongous" task of "physical examination and veracity of information" concerning the drug samples from 11 April till the month end or then till the job is completed.</p><p>The survey is being conducted under the supervision of the director of the NIB, an autonomous institution under India's ministry of health and family welfare. The NIB is currently led by Dr Surinder Singh, a former drugs controller general of India. Among other responsibilities, the NIB is mandated with ensuring the safety, potency and standard supply of biological and biotherapeutic products, both made locally and imported, as per pharmacopoeial specifications, in the country. </p><p>Deputy Drugs Controller of India, Dr K Bangarurajan, had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that the regulator in consultation with the Indian Statistical Institute had been working on the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-set-for-new-study-on-spurious-drugs-354188%5d" target="_new">contours of the study</a> on spurious drugs and around 15 pharmacological categories had been shortlisted. </p><p>The new study is significant amid international concerns on the menace of spurious drugs and also a generally oft-quoted but exaggerated statistic that one in five drugs made and distributed in India is "spurious" &ndash; a finding often attributed to a non-existent WHO study. </p><p>India has previously referred to a WHO clarification on 31 August 2012 which maintained that there was no such study carried out by it.</p><p>A previous Indian government survey report in 2009 had stated that the extent of spurious drug in retail pharmacies was 0.046 % (11 samples out of 24,136 samples). The survey included samples of popular brands of oral solid dosage formulations from nine therapeutic categories including anti-infectives, anti-malarials, anti-TB drugs, steroids, cardiovascular drugs, anti-diabetics and multivitamins, which were collected between November and December 2008, as per details in the 2009 government report on the countrywide survey for spurious drugs.</p><p>A government statement in February this year had reiterated that based on the samples taken by the CDSCO during 2011-12 to 2014-15 (up to September 2014), 0.03% samples were found to be spurious or adulterated and that 3.33% samples were found to be not of standard quality.</p>
