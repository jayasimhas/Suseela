<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is nearly ready to launch its Phase II/III trial in Sierra Leone testing an experimental monovalent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) Ebola vaccine from NewLink and its partner Merck.</p><p>The CDC and its collaborators &ndash; the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences at the University of Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation and the US Biomedical Advanced Research & Development Authority &ndash; plan to enroll 6,000 patients in the study, known as Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine Against Ebola (STRIVE), which is an unblinded, randomized trial with phased vaccine introduction in the target population.</p><p>The trial is expected to launch before the end of this month, a CDC spokesman told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners &ndash; the Health Ministry of Guinea, Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, Epicentre and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health &ndash; launched a Phase III trial of the rVSV vaccine in Guinea on 7 March to test the product&rsquo;s effectiveness against Ebola.</p><p>Another study, known as PREVAIL, testing rVSV and an experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline, got underway in Liberia on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">2 February</a>.</p><p>The Phase II/III PREVAIL trial was designed to enroll 27,000 adults 18 years or older &ndash; some healthy subjects and others healthcare workers or those at high risk of contracting Ebola.</p><p>But the NIH is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">considering moving</a> the next stage of the PREVAIL trial to potentially Guinea or Sierra Leone because the number of Ebola cases in Liberia have subsided in recent weeks. </p><p>Ebola has infected more than 24,500 people in the current outbreak, killing about 10,100.</p><p>The CDC currently is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-Several-Americans-potentially-exposed-to-NIH-Ebola-patient-357292" target="_new">investigating</a> how one American healthcare worker became <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Ebola-deaths-top-10000-NIH-to-treat-infected-American-357273" target="_new">infected</a> with Ebola and potentially exposed 10 others to the disease at a treatment center in Sierra Leone.</p><p>A CDC spokesman told <i>Scrip</i> it was unclear whether that center was slated to participate in the STRIVE study.</p><p><b>STRIVE</b></p><p>Participation in the CDC&rsquo;s STRIVE study will be voluntary and open to adults 18 years or older at high risk of exposure to Ebola infection through their daily work and who work in a selected study area, including personnel working in healthcare facilities where care is provided for patients with the virus; those working in non-Ebola healthcare facilities who may have exposure to undiagnosed infected patients; and people working in surveillance or ambulance teams or laboratories where they are responsible for swabbing deceased persons. </p><p>Staff members involved in the study also are eligible to receive the vaccine under the STRIVE protocol. Those people will be followed for six months post-vaccination to monitor for safety of the rVSV vaccine.</p><p>Eligible participants within a healthcare facility or front-line team will be enrolled and individually randomized to either immediate or deferred vaccination with a single dose of rVSV, which will be administered intramuscularly. </p><p>Immediate vaccination is defined as vaccination within seven days of enrollment and deferred vaccination is defined as vaccination at the end of an 18-24 week follow-up period, according to information posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website. </p><p>Participants will not be blinded to the randomized assignment of immediate or deferred vaccination. All enrolled participants will have the opportunity to receive rVSV by the end of the study. </p><p>Enrollment and vaccination will be phased over time.</p><p>Ebola events that occur during the 18-24 week post-enrollment will be included in the vaccine efficacy analysis, with the immediate vaccination arm contributing vaccinated follow-up time and the deferred vaccination arm contributing unvaccinated follow-up time. </p><p>All participants, regardless of randomized assignment, will be followed for six months after vaccination to monitor for safety of rVSV.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
