<p> This C-suite interview was quite different. It was one filled with plenty of sis-bro banter and peals of laughter amid all the serious talk on where India's third largest pharmaceutical company by sales sees itself by around 2020 and how it does not intend to emulate Teva, whose business model some peers look up to. </p> <p> In a candid interaction with <i>Scrip</i> as part of our ongoing executive profile series, the Lupin siblings &ndash; CEO Vinita Gupta and her brother and managing director Nilesh Gupta &ndash; reflect on the firm's tough journey into the US and the influence of their father and Lupin's chairman, Dr Desh Bandhu Gupta (DBG to those close to him and industry bigwigs), on their lives and the firm's philosophy. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/1A1C9EE03DBF4055B89F7B828C56B00C.ashx"> </p> <p> <b>Vinita and Nilesh Gupta, CEO and MD of Lupin</b> </p> <p> <b>Scrip: </b><i>What was it like growing up in a premier Indian pharma business family? Was dinner table conversation all about pills?</i> </p> <p> <b>Vinita Gupta: </b>Dinner table conversations were always about the industry. It came to a point where my mother said that at least at the dining table we should sit down as family and talk about &quot;us&quot;. For a week there was pin-drop silence and then she gave up and allowed us to go ahead and talk about business. Right from the early days DBG would use us as a sounding board and we got to learn the business at the grassroots. We learnt how he makes decisions, weighs different aspects into his decision-making and more. That was a real privilege. </p> <p> <b>Nilesh Gupta:</b> As we have grown in the company, we have now moved into positions similar to those that DBG has held in the past. In thinking through how participative his approach has been with all stakeholders when he held these positions, it speaks volumes of him. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>Setting up base in the US from scratch&#8230; the jitters, the journey?</i> </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> It was all with a purpose. No jitters. We had to do it&#8230; Lupin had to find the right way into the market. It took us time. First we tried to do what everyone else had already done and get into a market that was already genericised. That was difficult. Then we got into a joint venture with a company in Puerto Rico and used that as a launch pad into the US. That turned out to be a challenge. Then we decided to invest in our own capabilities, build our own R&amp;D and manufacturing in India with cephalosporins and that turned out to be a great start. It gave us the avenue to file our first few products in the US &ndash; injectables as well as oral cephalosporins &ndash; and these took us into a very strong position. </p> <p> The jitters were when we had the Suprax (cefixime) opportunity&#8230; probably our third ANDA filed. We had expected to launch it as a generic and then the brand disappeared from the market. We were not sure what we were going to do. We said we need to promote it as a brand and had just two people in our office! So how do you promote a brand? We started talking to multiple players to partner the product&#8230; all of them would have given us very little in terms of a licensing fee or long-term royalties&#8230; then we decided to just jump into it and do it ourselves. We had a little bit of the jitters because we were not prepared for going into the brand business in the US. But we put together a plan&#8230; how we should get in, what structure do we need, etc. and then never really looked back. We broke even in the second year and turned profitable in the third. I learnt the brand business at the ground level. </p> <p> [Ed: Lupin's US arm was granted an exclusive trademark license by the innovator for marketing Suprax in the US. Today Lupin is the fifth largest generic firm by prescription in the US] </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>Who was your biggest influence, and why?</i> </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> My father. Very few people combine his vision, passion and inclusiveness&#8230; the ability to align people around a purpose, without trying too hard. It comes naturally to him. DBG very early on set out the philosophy that in Lupin, he would like professionals to feel like family and family to work like professionals. He gives people flexibility and allows them to grow. People have gone from executive assistant to president of a division in Lupin. </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> He has always been a very strong force in our personal and professional lives, more by the way he has conducted himself &ndash; as a child, a brother, a father and as well as in the company. He has always been a role model. But my father never treated us differently from others in the organization. We had to earn our stripes, deliver and perform to be recognized and respected. DBG is an extremely trusting person and he gives his people a lot of autonomy as well. Sometimes it can be too long a rope&#8230; in 1993-94 we had unrelated diversifications in finance and real estate (along with most other corporates at that time). The people who managed those diversifications were well intentioned but it was just not our area of expertise. When you give that kind of latitude, you need to have checks and balances as well. We have our roots founded firmly in his philosophy but we have our own views as well. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>What is the one corporate decision your regret you made or didn't make? </i> </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> I wish we had got into generics earlier than we did. There was skepticism within the organization at the time we started. I think we missed one wave. We have done well and there are no regrets with where we have reached at this point but we would have probably been even deeper in our evolution as a leading generics player globally, had we got in earlier. </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> While it would have been nice to get into the generic market earlier, it would also have been easier for us. We were trying to build capabilities at a time when we were also going through trouble with our balance sheet. We were investing into technology, cephalosporins capability while we had a huge amount of debt on our balance sheet. So from that perspective, we did what we could do best. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>How do you get step back and get perspective?</i> </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> Some weeks ago, I simply flew over to the US and just chatted with Vinita [Ms Gupta is based in the US]. No agenda. We are an insanely close knit family. </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> We complement each other extremely well and it's wonderful to get our collective thoughts in critical decisions. And also, my 10-year old keeps me on my toes and tells me that I'm not doing a good job on a daily basis. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>If you weren't a pharma executive, what would you be?</i> </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> In a different context when we are asked, would you want to sell the company, our thoughts are that we don't know what else we could do! There are lot of personal interests that we have but honestly speaking, I have never thought of an alternative profession. </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> The addiction to the business started very early and my father knew how to bring that out in us. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>What has your proudest moment been?</i> </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> The proudest is yet to come but personally I take lot of pride in having been able to turn Lupin's R&amp;D around. To be able to change the perception that the company had built of its R&amp;D and getting delivery that helped us create the US business gave me a lot of joy. </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> I agree that the proudest moment is yet to come. But I take a lot of pride in having been able to build the brand business in the US from nothing, when everyone questioned the decision. We have also built a very enviable generic business foundation in the US despite having come in late, through our strategy of focusing on the right products and building the right relationships. By a seamless integration between India and the US within the organization we were able to get a phenomenal start. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>Patents, Big Pharma or red tape&#8230;the bigger challenge for patient access?</i> </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> It's typically patents and the ability to evergreen patents and a combination of that and Big Pharma. Today if you look at pricing of medicines &ndash; the hepatitis C product pricing that has been in the limelight. Certainly there's a lot of investment that goes into bringing a molecule into the market but as the healthcare industry that is for the people, you have to balance the need to be able to get the right price and therefore a profitable business, with getting medicines to those who need it. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>Wearable devices /use of health apps &#8230;.will Google, Samsung change pharma's growth trajectory?</i> </p> <p> <b>NG:</b> I think these are issues bothering the Big Pharma world right now and the environment is changing rapidly. If you were to fast forward 5-10 years, it's going to be a very different world. Some of these innovations are going to be extremely disruptive&#8230;. how products come to the market, how patients get diagnosed, treated, tracked. </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> As industry, as we get into the more complex areas, whether inhalation products , complex injectables, biosimilars that use sophisticated devices, you are moving in that direction and have the potential of innovating with digital technology to bring better solutions to the market. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>Lupin in 2020&#8230;.bigger, better or other plans?</i> </p> <p> <b>VG:</b> Bigger and better&#8230; and more of an innovative organization. In 2020 plus, we'd like to still be a leading generic player&#8230; those are our roots; we have a very strong position there. But also become a more innovation-oriented organization with our specialty initiatives as well as making a move to commercialize our own NCEs. </p> <p> <b>Scrip:</b><i>So, is it Teva you probably hope to emulate?</i> </p> <p> <b>VG and NG:</b> We are not a Teva and don't want to be that. For a generic company you have to be nimble and agile and for a NCE play you have to have the maturity and bandwidth of a Big Pharma firm. We are talking of a blend of the two housed in one company. Don't compare us. </p>
