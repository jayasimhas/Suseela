<p><b>The EMA is a key partner for the generic and biosimilar medicines industries, but two areas &ndash; duplicate applications under the centralised procedure and a global development framework for generic medicines &ndash; need attention, says the EGA's Adrian van den Hoven.</b></p><p>Working with a network of over 4,500 European experts, coordinating the EU pharmacovigilance system for medicines as well as good clinical practice (GCP), good laboratory practice (GLP), good manufacturing practice (GMP) and pharmacovigilance inspections, the European Medicines Agency leads one of the safest and most advanced systems in the world for monitoring the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines.</p><p>The EMA�s 20 years of progress* mirror the development of the generic and biosimilar medicines industries, represented by the EGA. Today, generic and biosimilar manufacturers have become by far the biggest contributors to increased access to medicines for millions of patients in Europe. Like the EMA, our industries now play a fundamental role in the provision of healthcare for Europe.</p><p>The industries we represent and the EMA share a commitment to patient safety and to high-quality medicine standards. This was reflected in the constructive dialogue with the EMA during the revision of the EU pharmaceutical legislation, which opened up the centralised procedure for marketing authorisations for generic medicines and established a legal framework for the approval of biosimilar medicines in Europe in 2005.</p><p>The EMA has shown leadership in developing, together with national experts, a sound scientific framework for the development and evaluation of biosimilar medicines. This framework has made the EU an inspiration for the rest of the world and has enabled our member companies to lead in developing this new medicines space. More recently, the EMA played a central role, together with the European Commission, in supporting a global development framework for biosimilar medicines through cooperation with the US Food and Drug Administration in the biosimilar medicines cluster.</p><p>Duplicate applications and global development for generic medicines</p><p>Building on this excellent co-operation with the EMA, the EGA looks forward to advancing the dialogue on duplicate applications under the centralised procedure. These are currently not allowed by the European Commission for companies belonging to the same group of companies, but they are necessary taking into account the economic model of our industries.</p><p>Where duplicates are allowed by the commission because of the existence of use patents in some member states, it is paramount that the same brand name is allowed. This is essential in particular for biosimilars to ensure that patients get access to their prescribed medicine when they travel to different EU countries, as provided for under the EU cross-border healthcare directive. The same brand name would also ensure that companies can use the same name for their approved medicine before and after expiry of use patents.</p><p>The EU should also move to establish a global development framework for generic medicines by adapting the EMA guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, in particular for products with clinical programmes. Progress in this field would significantly speed up access to high-quality generic medicines.</p><p>The EMA is a key partner for the generic and biosimilar medicines industries in ensuring the implementation of high quality standards in terms of regulatory oversight and pharmacovigilance. Over the past five years, the EMA and our industries have made tremendous progress in stepping up transparency, for example of GMP inspections, and in improving the practical functioning of key European databases which contribute so much to ensuring patient safety.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our co-operation with the EMA staff and its huge network of experts and committees to build the best possible regulatory system for medicines and for protecting public health.</p><p><b><i>Adrian van den Hoven</i></b><i> is director general of the European Generic and Biosimilar medicines Association.</i></p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency.
