<p>Have you heard of FailCon? It's a conference franchise in which technology entrepreneurs come together for a day to study their failures and learn from those mistakes. It's been hosted in various cities worldwide since it was set up in San Francisco in 2009.</p><p>I would love to know if similar events have been hosted in the biopharma world, but I suspect that if they have, they wouldn't be on quite the same scale (with up to 500 attendees). It's not that biopharma isn't used to failure: according to Tufts University a Phase I compound only has a 12% chance of making it through to approval, so in quite a fundamental sense, failure is a fact of life in the industry. It's just that in general, from biotech entrepreneurs to big pharma executives, there's a tendency to steer clear of the subject of business mistakes.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think a biopharma FailCon would be a great idea. FailCon's format would transfer very well for biotech start-ups: topics such as "identify and survive bad legal advice" and "survive your fundraising trainwrecks" would surely help the youngest enterprises begin to build a business before being taken under the nurturing wing of a VC. </p><p>But how about a really radical idea: FailCon for big pharma? Companies might understandably be reluctant to share the valuable lessons they have learned from misguided portfolio management, inappropriate deal making or unsuccessful reimbursement negotiations. However, they could come together to talk candidly about how they messed up in China, or mis-sold products in the US, or overlooked their adverse event reporting duties in Europe, in a spirit of openness aimed at protecting the industry as a whole &ndash; and its reputation &ndash; from future avoidable mistakes. Surely it would do the industry more good to share and improve collectively than to hold its errors close to its chest for reasons of commercial advantage or belated shame. </p><p>When even global paragons of success like JK Rowling choose to focus on failure (her new book <i>Very Good Lives</i>, based on her 2008 commencement speech at Harvard University, is subtitled <i>The Fringe Benefits of Failure and the Importance of Imagination</i>), perhaps it is time that big pharma looked to make more of its assets in this department. </p><p>Samuel Beckett had it right: Fail again. Fail better.</p>
