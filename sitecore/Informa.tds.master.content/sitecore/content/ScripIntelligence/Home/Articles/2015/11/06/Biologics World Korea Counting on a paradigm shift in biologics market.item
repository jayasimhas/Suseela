<p>Biopharmaceutical experts from around the world gathered in Seoul at the recent Biologics World Korea 2015, at which a group of panelists discussed the strategic direction of the biologics industry in Asia and a paradigm shift in the global biologics market.</p><p>The panelists believed the biopharmaceutical market would shift away from the US and EU to Asia in the longer term, and expected more than 65% of the global biopharma market to be in Asian territories by 2030, raising the need to discuss and prepare for regulatory and harmonization issues.</p><p>Saying South Korea and Asia are the future in the area of biologics, one of the panelists, Alan Liss, principal consultant at GXP farma, said it was time for the industry to make a paradigm shift in its approach to biologics. He believed that the US market and US pharma-led research approaches were proving to be "dinosaurs" and not working.</p><p>He hoped Asian firms would help create the paradigm shift to put biologics in the role they were meant to play, which is to fill unmet medical needs for the future.</p><p>Speaking on the vision for the next 10 years for the biotech industry in South Korea and Southeast Asia, Senyon Choe, president of the Mogam Biotechnology Institute, an affiliate of Green Cross Holdings, said the biologics industry, which depends heavily on research (even more so than the traditional pharma industry), had been in a new trend in the past two decades, and would be a dominating force in the global pharma industry.</p><p>Although Southeast Asian countries are not world leaders in research, he stressed that there was a strong momentum growing, especially in South Korea, China and neighboring countries like Singapore, and this would stimulate research power which would then translate into new discoveries.</p><p>"When you ask about visions and how far we are looking at, in the next five years, I doubt it is going to happen. In the next 10-30 years, yes. It is going to happen," said Mr Choe. "The key thing from my angle is that Southeast Asia and its people need to do better to create a more common platform that works in discoveries."</p><p>Chengbin Wu, chief scientific officer of Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical, said innovation was a very important aspect of biotechnology and the industry needed to continue to bring more efficacious, safe and economic drugs to the marketplace.</p><h2>Success Factors</h2><p>The panelists said prerequisites for success in the biotech business in Asia included interactions with regulatory agencies as well as developing quality and differentiated drugs. They were generally positive on the regional success of the sector, saying their job as an industry was to help patients, provide drugs that are affordable and to educate regulators to enable them to put drugs on the market faster.</p><p>Liss, who was with the US FDA until a year ago, stressed the importance of interactions with regulatory agencies in particular taking place as early as possible.</p><p>"Sharing innovation and working together with regulatory agencies will really broaden their minds. The regulators will tend to be less fearful and will be more able to move on when new products come in," he suggested.</p><p>Wu said the key success factors for biosimilars and new biologics were quality and differentiation, while regulatory issues were also a very important consideration.</p><p>"I think the key success factor for biosimilars is quality. There are so many players. Each target has multiple players. The one who has the best quality and who can push the program fast will win in the end. For novel biologics...differentiation is the key word," he said.</p><p>Regulatory issues are a crucial factor for both biosimilars and innovative molecules and if regulatory pathways are unclear and some of the requirements are too stringent, this will delay the process.</p><p>Racho Jordanov, president and CEO of JHL Biotech in Taiwan, said the industry had to keep in mind that the main mission of the biotech industry in Southeast Asia was to serve patients. He believed the region's segment would succeed and advance given the great medical needs and rewards of saving millions of patients. </p><p>"The cost of drugs developed in the West to treat diseases like cancer or metabolic disorders is so great that it is impossible for this part of the world to sustain medical care at that cost," said Jordanov.</p><p>The industry also needs to understand how to help regulators understand the complexity of new biotech drugs.</p><p>The panel agreed that harmonizing regulatory agencies was a very difficult task, while harmonizing discovery processes may be something Southeast Asian countries could do.</p><p>Mr Liss hoped that Asia would build effective relationships between the research industry and institutes, and that Asia would learn from the mistakes made by North America and do the "right thing", which is to develop robust institutes and robust platforms, but still allow scientists to innovate.</p><p>Mr Choe has proposed that patent procedures and product review efforts be consolidated in Southeast Asian countries, like in the EU.</p><p>"Many small countries don't have to individually review [products]. Korea does it on its own, Japan does it on its own, China has its own agenda, but they have to give up a little bit and make a compromise to consolidate. They can definitely propose harmonizing the IP [intellectual property] side," he suggested.</p><h2>Looking Ahead</h2><p>The group also talked about the future direction of biosimilars as well as cell and gene therapies in the region.</p><p>Jordanov said the money raised from biosimilars could be applied to innovative research. Providing biosimilars for the world will bring countries like South Korea, which has Samsung BioLogics, Hanwha Group and Celltrion, enough resources to develop new therapies such as gene therapies. He believes in competition and funding research through revenues.</p><p>Mr Choe said the region had good prospects in the biosimilar and cell therapy sectors. "The numbers speak for themselves for biosimilars as Southeast Asian countries are producing more than 30-40% of the whole world's production. But these are contract manufacturers.</p><p>"If this is the biosimilar industry we are talking about, yes, we have a prospect. We are doing something. But it is contract manufacturing. To me that is not drug development," said Mr Choe.</p><p>He forecast that cell therapy would lead to future drugs in the next 10-20 years. "Therapeutic cells as a drug will be like antibodies we talked about 20-30 years ago. 20-30 years ago, an engineered antibody was a dream project, but now everyone thinks biologics are antibodies. But that is not true. That is only a small fraction of the whole thing. In 20 years, we will see another big revolutionary change in the field," he predicted.</p><p>Mr Liss agreed that the cell and gene therapy sector was the future, but noted it was a very difficult area for regulators to address. He hoped that if South Korea dedicated itself to that as the future, the country would include in its plans the education of regulators to create scientific tools to make sure such products are safe and effective.</p><p>"If you are a regulator, you always work too easy for some, too hard for others, too fast for some, too slow for others. But if you can provide some tools &#8230; to be able to judge and characterize cell therapies then maybe something can happen," he said.</p><p>Wu noted that many firms were already in the cell therapy business and it was less regulated, at least in China, but so far a lot of activities were led by hospitals and not the pharma industry.</p><p>"Industry definitely wants to get involved, but hasn't really figured out how from the business point of view. How to make money in a consistent way in the long term," he noted.</p><p>He agreed that the cell therapy business had a lot of commercial potential and that many new discoveries could be made, but he believed it still had a long road ahead, so the industry needed to help come up with regulatory guidance to make sure these therapies were safe and efficacious.</p><p><i>This article has also been published in</i><a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p><p><p>
