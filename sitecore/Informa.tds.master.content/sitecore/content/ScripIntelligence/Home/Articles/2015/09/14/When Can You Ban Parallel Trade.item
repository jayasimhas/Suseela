<p>Taking steps to prevent medicines being parallel exported from on EU country to another is always fraught with uncertainty, despite a succession of rulings on the matter by the Court of Justice of the EU. And a recent statement by Health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, appearing to conflict with action being taken by the commission's internal market directorate, has done little to clarify the situation.</p><p>Andriukaitis, a Lithuanian physician and politician who has held the health and food safety portfolio since late 2014, told a Romanian news agency that the prevention of parallel trade was "an absolutely legal instrument" and member states should be encouraged to use it. "EU member states have the right to regulate the parallel drugs trade," he said. "Slovakia took this kind of measure, Poland too." </p><p>However, the commission's directorate for the internal market and industry (DG GROW) appears to take a different view of the situation in Slovakia, and is pursuing the country's government over its parallel export notification policy. </p><p>In 2012 Slovakia introduced a mechanism whereby all medicines exports had to be notified to the drugs regulator, which could prevent an export if it would jeopardize its availability on the market. </p><p>According to law firm Allen & Overy, the measure was viewed with suspicion by the commission as a possible restriction on the free movement of goods in the internal market, and in early 2015 the commission said it had formally invited the Slovak government to explain the measure. There have been suggestions that the commission is now considering taking Slovakia to the European Court over the restriction.</p><p>Heinz Kobelt, director of European affairs at the European Association of Euro-Pharmaceutical Companies (EAEPC), which represents parallel traders, said he was aware that the commission was pursuing Slovakia, but that he had not seen any formal announcement of any legal action. "All we know is that the commission had stepped up the procedure from a light touch to a more stringent dialogue," Kobelt told <i>Scrip</i>. "We have asked the commission but they are saying nothing."</p><p>Views differ over whether the commission's various departments are singing from the same hymn sheet. The commission told the EU news service Politico that there was no contradiction between Andriukaitis's statement and the commission's pursuit of Slovakia, commenting that parallel trade restrictions were justifiable under EU law provided they were reasonable and proportionate and it could be shown that there was a risk of shortages leading to health problems.</p><p>However, Kobelt said Andriukaitis's comments were "very much in contrast to the commission's action on Slovakia. There is an obvious contradiction, but it also shows the unclear role of the health directorate in the whole of the European Commission." </p><p>The EAEPC acknowledged that EU member states can regulate parallel trade, but said that "any policy or decision made by the European Commission of member states as regards parallel trade in medicines must be based on objective criteria." Encouraging member states to restrict parallel trade "could result in misguided decisions and unintended policy outcomes," it said in a statement.</p><p>The association claimed there was nothing to suggest that parallel trade caused shortages or problems in patients' access to medicines. "To the contrary," it stated, "parallel trade often leads to better access to medicines at more affordable prices for consumers and member states, by providing liquidity and competition to a pharmaceutical market still fragmented by national borders."</p><p>Poland, the other country mentioned by Andriukaitis, introduced an amendment to the pharmaceutical law in May this year whereby all players in the distribution chain must inform the relevant authority about their stock levels on a regular basis, with exports of medicines being restricted up to a certain threshold. However, in this case, according to Aleksandra Baczykowska of law firm Bird & Bird, the commission has not raised any objections to this provision. </p><p>Bulgaria too has had a legal tussle over its notification regime, which was introduced in 2014 in an effort to avoid potential shortages of specific drugs. The country's Constitutional Court <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Bulgarian-court-ruling-expected-to-boost-parallel-exports-356751" target="_new">ruled earlier this year</a> that some aspects of the regime were unconstitutional, a move that was expected to result in an increase in parallel exports. </p><p>Kobelt acknowledged that there should be exceptions to the free movement rules for public health reasons, but said that if countries do take action on parallel exports, "the measure must be fit for purpose." Shortages "are not a good basis for restrictions on parallel trade," he said, because they are caused by a range of factors of which parallel trade "is probably the least relevant."</p><h2>Greek Export Ban Lifted</h2><p>Meanwhile, a temporary ban imposed in July on certain parallel exports from Greece in order to avoid drug shortages was recently lifted. In a notice published last week, Ekaterini Antoniou, president of the Greek medicines regulator, Ethnikos Organismos Farmakon (EOF), said the decision had been taken because the pharmaceutical market had "normalized", although EOF would continue to monitor MAHs' and wholesalers' compliance with their duty to ensure drug supplies met the needs of Greek patients. </p><p>According to sources within the distribution industry, all medicines exporters in Greece had earlier this year made voluntary commitments to limit exports because of the exceptional economic situation. They said the main cause of the disruption to supplies was the financial crisis and the lack of liquidity in the Greek supply chain, which caused delayed payments to pharmacies, wholesalers and manufacturers, with some companies stopping or reducing deliveries. </p><p>The July ban affected some 25 medicines identified by EOF as being potentially in short supply, but was not seen as a particular problem by the EAEPC. Kobelt said his association had been in constant dialogue with the Greek authorities over the ban, which was only ever meant to be temporary. </p><p>Rather than a response to shortages caused by parallel trade, the prohibition was "more of a political move in response to fears that big pharma companies might not supply the Greek market at all" if they saw large amounts of medicines heading to higher price countries, Kobelt claimed. "We knew it would be lifted as soon as the authorities saw fit."</p><p>The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), representing R&D-based firms, noted that export bans were temporary by nature but said it was "surprised by the speed with which this was lifted." </p><p>EFPIA acknowledged that it was possible for member states to ban exports of pharmaceuticals "to avoid shortages that would have negative effects on health." Moreover, "we assume that any measures taken by the Greek government are based on a sound analysis of available data regarding the supply of pharmaceutical products in Greece."</p><p>The federation told <i>Scrip</i> it was now liaising with affiliates in Greece "in order to receive a proper evaluation of the market situation right now and to assess whether the pre-elections context is not impacting the entire situation and authorities' short-term actions" (the Greek legislative elections are being held on Sep. 20). </p><p>Kobelt claimed the sale of parallel exported drugs by local wholesalers actually helped the situation in Greece because it brought the wholesalers revenues that they could inject into the supply chain to "help keep the distribution system going." </p><p>Wholesalers will now be free again to export the medicines concerned, although Kobelt said he had asked his member companies to do so "with care", taking the needs of patients into account.</p>
