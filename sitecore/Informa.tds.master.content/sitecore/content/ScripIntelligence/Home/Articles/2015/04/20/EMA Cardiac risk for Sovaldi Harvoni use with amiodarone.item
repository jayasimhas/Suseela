<p>The European Medicines Agency has confirmed a risk of heart problems in hepatitis C patients taking Sovalidi (sofosbuvir), and other new hep C regimens, in combination with antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone. </p><p>The hep C medicines in which a risk has been confirmed include: Gilead Science's Sovaldi, Harvoni (sofosbuvir with ledipasvir) or a combination of Sovaldi and Bristol-Myer's Squibb's Daklinza (daclatasvir). </p><p>As a result the EMA has recommended that amiodarone should only be used in patients taking these hep C medicines if other antiarrhythmics cannot be given. And if concomitant use with amiodarone cannot be avoided, patients should be closely monitored. </p><p>The recommendation follows a review of cases of severe bradycardia or heart block in patients taking amiodarone who started treatment with the hep C combinations. It was considered that there was a likely relationship of these events to the medicines, the EMA said. </p><p>However, "the possible mechanism behind these effects is unknown and further investigation of other cases with Sovaldi and other hep C medicines is ongoing," the agency said. The EMA reported that of eight cases reviewed up to April 2015, one case resulted in fatal cardiac arrest and two required pacemaker intervention.</p><p>Gilead <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Warning-added-to-Gileads-Sovaldi-Harvoni-after-cardiac-death-357426" target="_new">first warned prescribers</a> of the possible risks of co-administering the anti-arrhythmics with the company's hep C virus treatments in March this year, in a "Dear Healthcare Provider" letter. The US FDA approved the company's changes to its labeling under "Warning and Precautions," "Adverse Reactions" and "Drug Interactions" sections. </p><p>Sovaldi, a hep C nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor, which demonstrated a sustained virologic response of 12 weeks (SVR12) of up to 90%, was approved in Europe in January 2014. Harvoni, a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir, a hep C NS5A inhibitor, and Sovaldi, was approved in November last year. The drug demonstrated cure rates of 94%-99% in clinical testing.</p><p>Amiodarone is primarily a class III antiarrhythmic; it slows conduction and prolongs the refractoriness of tissue to a new electrical impulse. The product is a generic drug manufactured by a number of companies including: Teva Pharmaceuticals, Novartis (Sandoz), Mylan and Upsher-Smith Laboratories. It was originally developed by Sanofi and Wyeth. </p><h2>other warning labels</h2><p>The labeling for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Warning-added-to-Gileads-Sovaldi-Harvoni-after-cardiac-death-357426" target="_new">Johnson and Johnson's Olysio</a> (simeprevir), a NS3/4A protease inhibitor, which was approved in November 2013, already warns that concomitant use of the drug with certain anti-arrhythmics, including amiodarone, may result in increases in the concentrations of those heart agents due to intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition. Olysio's labeling advises to monitor patients when the drug is co-administered with anti-arrhythmics.</p><p>The labeling for another hep C competitor to Harvoni and Sovaldi, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Warning-added-to-Gileads-Sovaldi-Harvoni-after-cardiac-death-357426" target="_new">AbbVie's Viekira Pak</a> (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), which was approved this past December, also includes drug interaction warning alerting prescribers and patients to use caution when co-administering the drug with anti-arrhythmics, including amiodarone.</p>
