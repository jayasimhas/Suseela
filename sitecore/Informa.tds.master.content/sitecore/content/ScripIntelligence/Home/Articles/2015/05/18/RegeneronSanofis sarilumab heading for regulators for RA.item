<p>Sanofi and Regeneron have reported topline data from three Phase III trials of their novel anti-inflammatory MAb sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis that will support filings due in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Sarilumab inhibits the interleukin-6 receptor, like Roche's marketed arthritis treatment Actemra (tocilizumab). While Actemra is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, Sanofi/Regeneron's is a fully human monoclonal antibody, but it is also competing with another fully human anti-IL-6R antibody, Johnson & Johnson/ GlaxoSmithKline's sirukumab, also in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare say that sarilumab and sirukumab need to differentiate themselves from the currently available non-anti-TNF biologics, particularly Actemra, which remains the only IL-inhibitor approved for the treatment of RA. "Rheumatologists stress that they will struggle to distinguish between these therapies," they say. Datamonitor Healthcare believes that unless sarilumab demonstrates superior efficacy in certain patient subgroups, and/or has a lower cost, its uptake in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be low as Actemra will remain rheumatologists' IL-6 inhibitor of choice.</p><p>Indeed anti-TNF biosimilars are expected to have a larger impact on the RA therapy space than any of the late-phase pipeline candidates, Datamonitor Healthcare says. Their anticipated lower price compared with the branded agents will drive uptake, with payers heavily influencing prescribing decisions. </p><p>IL-6 is a potent pro-inflammatory agent that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis. As high levels of IL-6 are produced in the joints of patients with RA and can be detected in their serum, increased IL-6 secretion is deemed responsible for both local and systemic manifestations associated with RA.</p><p>In the largest of the three studies reported, SARIL-RA-TARGET, sarilumab (self-administered sc at two doses 200mg or 150mg every other week) added to non-biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy in 546 RA patients who were inadequate responders to or intolerant of TNF-alpha inhibitors (TNF-IR) met its co-primary endpoints of a greater improvement in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks and physical function (HAQ-DI) at week 12, compared with placebo (p>0.001).</p><p>Improvement in signs and symptoms of RA at 24 weeks, as measured by the American College of Rheumatology score of 20% improvement (ACR20), was 61% in the 200mg group; 56% in the 150 mg group; and 34% with placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events included infections and injection site reactions, but serious infections were uncommon.</p><p>The other two studies were SARIL-RA-EASY and SARIL-RA-ASCERTAIN. The 217-patient SARIL-RA-EASY trial was designed to evaluate the technical performance and usability of the sarilumab autoinjector device, and found no product technical failures with the autoinjector, the primary endpoint.</p><p>SARIL-RA-ASCERTAIN was a 202 patient safety calibrator study, designed to assess the safety of two subcutaneous doses of sarilumab and tocilizumab infusion in combination with DMARDs in patients with RA who were TNF-IR. It found no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups in serious adverse events and serious infections.</p><p>Detailed results from all three SARIL-RA trials will be presented at future medical meetings.</p><p>The first positive Phase III results for sarilumab were released in late 2013 from <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegenerons-sarilumab-hits-first-PhIII-arthritis-endpoints-348300" target="_new">the SARIL-RA-MOBILITY study</a> in patients with active, moderate to severe disease, who had responded inadequately to methotrexate therapy, both improving disease signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of joint damage.</p><p>
