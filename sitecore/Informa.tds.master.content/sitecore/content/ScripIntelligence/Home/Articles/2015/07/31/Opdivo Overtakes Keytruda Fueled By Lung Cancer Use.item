<p>Thanks in part to a new indication in lung cancer and despite a later start on the market, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s anti-PD1 Opdivo tripled its sequential sales in the second quarter, edging ahead of Merck & Co. Inc.'s competing Keytruda.</p><p>Of the family of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, Merck's anti-PD-1 Keytruda (pembrolizumab) scored the first approval in September 2014, for advanced relapsed melanoma. Bristol's Opdivo (nivolumab) wasn't approved for this use until December 2014, but the company followed swiftly with a clearance in early March for metastatic squamous-type non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p>In the first quarter of the year, Merck reported $83m in Keytruda sales, while Bristol lagged with $40m for Opdivo.</p><p>However, in the second quarter, Bristol reported sales of $122m, compared with $110m for Keytruda.</p><p>"We are seeing strong performance metrics with the approval in lung cancer with encouraging early trends in terms of access, reimbursement and abandonment of chemo in second-line squamous lung cancer in the US," Bristol Chief Financial Officer Charlie Bancroft said during a July 23 earnings call.The exec said that the company was adding resources globally to fully support the launch of Opdivo, including resources to increase awareness of the drug as well as the development of new drugs with complementary mechanisms of action.</p><p>Bristol is expected to file Opdivo and a companion diagnostic for the more common non-squamous NSCLC in "coming weeks," a filing supported by the Phase III CheckMate 057 study, in which the drug demonstrated an overall survival benefit.</p><p>Keytruda is now under FDA review for NSCLC in all histologies in patients with treatment-refractory NSCLC where EGFR or ALK-directed therapy is not indicated. The filing includes data showing better response rates in patients with higher PD-L1 expression in the Phase I KEYNOTE-001 study. Keytruda has "breakthrough therapy" designation for this indication and the application has priority review, with a user fee date of Oct. 2, though approval could come earlier. If approved, as expected, Keytruda would likely launch in lung cancer without overall survival data, which may not be available until the end of the year.</p><p>Opdivo was approved for second-line and higher metastatic squamous cell cancer in the EU on July 20. The drug had received EU approval in both first-line and second-line melanoma on June 22 and has launched in Germany, "where early trends are strong," according to Bancroft.</p><p>Keytruda was approved for first-line and advanced melanoma in the EU on July. 22. Both Opdivo and Keytruda are under review by FDA for first-line melanoma, as is the combination of Opdivo and Bristol's CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor <i>Yervoy</i> (ipilimumab).</p><p>Merck confirmed the frontline melanoma filing, based on KEYNOTE 006, for Keytruda during its earnings call on July 28.</p><p><b>Rapid Uptake Of Opdivo In Lung</b></p><p>Bristol's Murdo Gordon, senior VP of worldwide markets, noted a "very rapid penetration" in the squamous second-line market in the US, with two-thirds of new patients now getting Opdivo.</p><p>Furthermore, after the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, which influence insurance coverage, began to recommend Opdivo as an option for second-line non-squamous NSCLC based on the reported overall survival benefit compared to docetaxel chemotherapy in the CheckMate 057 study. Results were better for patients expressing the PD-L1 biomarker, but the guidelines advise against testing "because many patients with metastatic NSCLC benefit from nivolumab."</p><p>Since the NCCN updated its guidelines, the company has seen "a very nice uptick in lung overall," Gordon said.</p><p>"Clearly, that's another off-label indication, given that we are only promoting in squamous right now. So I would say very soon we'll see lung eclipsing our melanoma business and we'll see some nice growth out of Opdivo this year," Gordon said.</p><p>In response to analyst questions, Gordon noted that in the US, the company is seeing very balanced uptake, with very rapid adoption in second-line squamous type NSCLC in the community as well as in the academic setting.</p><p>The launch of Bristol's Yervoy raised questions about readiness in the community to embrace immunotherapy, due to lack of familiarity and concern about severe side effects.</p><p>Bristol responded that it did a lot of education around the launch of Yervoy, thereby promoting a "broad understanding" of how immune checkpoint inhibitors work. And Opdivo's better safety profile helped with rapid penetration in the community that will continue with broadening indications, Gordon said.</p><p>In July, with funding from Bristol, the Association of Community Cancer Centers launched the Institute for Clinical Immuno-Oncology to help community providers with a range of issues related to the adoption of immunotherapy, including side effects and reimbursement.</p><p><b>Yervoy Takes A Hit For Now</b></p><p>Bristol has two potentially registrational studies ongoing in first-line NSCLC. The first tests Opdivo as a monotherapy (CheckMate 026) in PD-L1 expressing patients, which the company said provides the quickest way to bring Opdivo to first-line patients, and the second (CheckMate 227) tests Opdivo in combination with Yervoy against Opdivo monotherapy or doublet chemotherapy in all comers with NSCLC.</p><p>"As you know, we've done a lot of early work in that space, in understanding the regimen &ndash; the combination regimen &ndash; that can be most effective in patients in lung cancer," CEO Giovanni Caforio said.</p><p>Additional combination data will be presented at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, to be held in Denver from Sep. 6-9.</p><p>Bristol said that since the ASCO meeting, it has seen some off-label usage of PD-1 inhibitors in front-line melanoma, which "puts some pressure" on Yervoy.</p><p>Compared to last year, Yervoy's second-quarter sales were down by almost 8% to $296m. Approval of the Yervoy/Opdivo combination in melanoma could help Yervoy make a rebound, though the reaction to combination data at the meeting was mixed (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com:443/publications/the-pink-sheet-daily/2015/6/1/opdivoyervoy-data-show-role-for-checkpoint-combos-asco-debates-biomarkers" target="_new">"Opdivo/Yervoy Data Show Role For Checkpoint Combos; ASCO Debates Biomarkers" &mdash; "The Pink Sheet" DAILY, Jun. 1, 2015</a>).</p><p>As part of a pipeline update in its second quarter earnings report, Bristol also announced that Yervoy failed to show an overall survival benefit in two Phase III studies of other advanced tumor types &ndash; castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer and small-cell lung cancer. No new safety issues were identified and development has been discontinued in these tumor types, Bristol said.</p><p><b>Keytruda Rules US Melanoma Market</b></p><p>During its earnings call, Merck stressed Keytruda's dominance in melanoma.</p><p>In the US, the company achieved more than a 60% patient share in ipilimumab-refractory melanoma, a testament to "strong launch execution," Adam Schechter, Merck's president of global human health, said. Looking at all melanoma patients, IMS Health data suggest an 80% share of the anti-PD-1 market and a 35% share including all treatments.</p><p>"Keytruda is now the number one therapy used to treat melanoma in the US," Schechter said.</p><p>The company is only promoting to the label and says that most use was for the approved refractory indication.</p><p>The "deep clinical experience" physicians are gaining through the Keytruda launch in melanoma is building a solid foundation, particularly in the community setting, for potential launches in lung cancer and also other cancers, Schecter said.</p><p>"With an Oct. 2 PDUFA date, our teams are ready for a potential launch in patients with advanced squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer," the exec said.</p><p>There has been much speculation about whether the lung cancer approval would be limited to patients with higher expression of PD-L1.</p><p>Data supporting the application showed substantially higher response rates in NSCLC patients with more expression of PD-L1, irrespective of the underlying histology, Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, told the call.</p><p>Perlmutter declined to comment on how FDA will handle labeling, but did say that he thinks the "data that exists for the PD-L1 negative population can't be ignored."</p><p>The exec also said that the filing includes data for about 100 PD-L1-negative patients.</p><p>"It's a considerable number there, and there are meaningful responses in that patient population, which one would guess will be reflected in one way or another," Perlmutter said.</p><p>The first look at overall survival data for NSCLC will come from the Phase II/III Keynote 010 study, which compares Keytruda to chemotherapy. That study is designed to end sometime around the end of the year, but an early termination is a possibility.</p><p>Perlmutter noted that in the NSCLC patients who had strong PD-L1 expression, the response rates were above 50%, which is "extraordinary" and "unprecedented," and should translate to a survival benefit.</p><p>Schechter acknowledged that "of course" the company would prefer to have overall survival data to promote at the time of launch. However, the drug has demonstrated an overall survival benefit in melanoma and the company has built an oncology business unit to maximize Keytruda over the long term.</p><p>"Just as we were ready to launch in melanoma, we will be ready to launch in lung. We are ready for that. We think it's a very significant opportunity," Schechter said.</p><p><b>Roche Under Pressure Again</b></p><p>During its July 23 earnings call, Roche was pressed to explain why it can't move as quickly as its competitors and file its anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab (MPDL3280A).</p><p>Roche presented positive interim readouts from the FIR and POPLAR lung cancer trials at the ASCO meeting. And recently it announced positive data in bladder cancer, an indication it is leading in, that could support regulatory submissions. But execs are not providing any greater assurances that they will file atezolizumab before early 2016.</p><p>The final readouts for FIR and POPLAR will come "really very soon," COO Daniel O'Day said. And the company is expecting a positive outcome in BIRCH, the lung cancer pivotal study, in more than 600 PD-L1 positive patients. BIRCH results are expected before the end of the year.</p><p>The company is "looking constantly at when the data is coming in" on atezolizumab and how to process that data and work with the FDA, O'Day said. Roche is still planning on filings for both indications in early 2016, while always looking for "acceleration possibilities."</p><p>"What I can assure you is that we will do everything possible to file these as soon as possible. They're both being looked at in parallel &ndash; bladder and lung &ndash; so it's not that one is getting in the way of the other, they both happen to have similar timelines," O'Day said.</p><p>AstraZeneca plc is planning to submit its anti-PD-L1 durvalumab (MEDI4736) in third-line NSCLC in PD-L1-positive patients by the end of the year, supported by the Phase II ATLANTIC study.</p><p>AstraZeneca continues to face questions about whether its plans to submit for accelerated approval could potentially be blocked by an approval of Merck's Keytruda in PD-L1+ patients. Senior VP and Head of Immuno-Oncology Robert Iannone responded during the firm's July 30 earnings call by saying: "I would just remind you that only full approvals based on randomized control trials would exclude additional approvals in the same indication for an accelerated approval."</p><p>Though Merck submitted stratified data, it is likely to receive a broad approval. Roche could also submit for this claim, based on OAK, but AstraZeneca has a clear window to be first.</p><p>This story has also been published in <i>"The Pink Sheet"</i>. <i>Scrip Intelligence</i> brings selected complementary coverage from our sister publications to our subscribers.</p><p>
