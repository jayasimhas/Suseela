<p>VBL Therapeutics' good news on 17 February the FDA had lifted its partial hold on the firm's experimental glioblastoma drug VB-111 &ndash; allowing it to proceed into a Phase III study under a previously agreed on special protocol assessment (SPA) &ndash; was overshadowed by the company's same-day revelation its investigational medicine VB-201 failed to meet its primary endpoints in two separate Phase II trials of the drug in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. </p><p>As a result, VBL said it does not plan to continue development of VB-201 in the psoriasis and UC indications &ndash; a disclosure that sent the firm's shares plummeting 65.5%, or a loss of $9.24, to close at $4.87.</p><p>The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study of VB-201 in psoriasis was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug dosed at 80mg or 160mg daily for 24 weeks. </p><p>The trial evaluated 194 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. </p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was PASI 50 &ndash; the proportion of patients who achieve at least 50% improvement from baseline PASI score &ndash; at weeks 16 and 24.</p><p>No effect of VB-201 versus placebo was observed on the primary or secondary endpoints at either dose level tested. </p><p>The PASI 50 for VB-201 patients was 26.4% at 16 weeks and 34% at 24 weeks, with no significant difference between the 80mg and 160mg dose cohorts. </p><p>The placebo PASI 50 at week 16 was 38%.</p><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study of VB-201 in UC was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the compound dosed at 160mg daily for 24 weeks. </p><p>The trial evaluated 112 patients with mild-to-moderate UC. The primary endpoint of the study was disease remission at weeks 12 and 24.</p><p>No statistically significant effect of VB-201 was observed versus placebo on the primary or secondary endpoints. </p><p>Remission rate for VB-201 was 10.5% at 12 weeks and 22.8% at 24 weeks, a meaningful improvement over week 12. </p><p>Remission rate for the placebo arm, however, was 15.1% at 12 weeks &ndash; meaning the 7.7% difference of VB-201 over placebo was not statistically significant.</p><p>VBL reported, though, that VB-201 was safe and well-tolerated in both trials, with no drug-related serious adverse events.</p><p>"We are disappointed by the outcome of these Phase II studies in psoriasis and ulcerative colitis, VBL CEO Dr Dror Harats lamented. "Immune-inflammatory conditions are difficult-to-treat diseases with a limited array of effective treatments."</p><p>He said the company would now turn its attention to advancing VB-111, its lead oncology product, into the Phase III trial in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.</p><p>"We believe that this drug candidate has significant potential as an anti-angiogenic agent for the treatment of cancer and we look forward to initiating the trial," he said.</p><p>VB-111 is an intravenously-administered anti-angiogenic agent, which uses VBL's "Vascular Targeting System" to target endothelial cells. </p><p>The compound contains a non-replicating adenovector, a proprietary modified murine pre-proendothelin promoter, or PPE-1-3x, and a Fas-Chimera transgene to angiogenic tumor blood vessels, leading to their apoptosis. </p><p>VBL said VB-111 is the first agent based on transcriptional targeting of tumor endothelium to be assessed in a clinical trial.</p><p>VB-111 has received orphan drug designation in the US and Europe and was granted fast-track designation by the FDA for prolongation of survival in patients with glioblastoma that has recurred following treatment with standard chemotherapy and radiation. </p><p>VBL said it expects to begin the pivotal Phase III trial of VB-111 in recurrent glioblastoma in mid-2015.</p><p>The FDA had placed the hold on the Phase III VB-111 trial pending the submission of additional properties about the drug's potency assay developed by the firm. </p><p>Last summer, the FDA had issued a concurrence with the design and planned analyses of the Phase III trial for a randomized, controlled, double-arm, open-label study of VB-111 with a primary endpoint of increased overall survival. Interim data is expected in the second half of 2016.</p><p>VBL recently reported positive data for VB-111 in glioblastoma and thyroid cancer. The company also is evaluating the drug in ovarian cancer. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
