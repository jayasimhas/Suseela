<p><p>Wound care specialist Derma Sciences knows when to throw in the towel and has decided to stick with what it knows. </p><p>The Princeton, NJ-based company announced Nov. 12 that it is terminating its entire development program for the drug aclerastide after a data monitoring committee determined that its Phase III clinical trial in patients with diabetic foot ulcers would be unable to hit its primary efficacy endpoints. </p><p>"Aclerastide was our one shot at drug development since it fit so perfectly into our goal of offering a portfolio of products for clinicians to choose from when treating difficult to heal wounds. We had also been clear that should the program not be successful we still have a growing and valuable asset in our dressing and device businesses to create shareholder value," said Chairman and CEO Ed Quilty on a Nov. 12 call with investors. </p><p>While aclerastide had no safety issues, Derma Sciences decided to cut the program completely &ndash; it will not pursue any other indications for the product. The trial had already enrolled about 600 patients and was expected to enroll a total of 1,055 patients. Enrollment will end and it will cost the company about $2m to wind down the program by the end of the year. Work will also stop in the scare reduction and radiation dermatitis programs. </p><p>"It's in the company's best interest and the best interest of our shareholders not to go forward with this program," added Quilty on the call. "It goes without saying that everyone at Derma Sciences is disappointed about this news. From the very beginning of this program we knew we faced challenges, but the program was designed to provide the cleanest label possible."</p><p>As of Sept. 30, Derma Sciences had $49m in cash and equivalents. Quilty admitted that management will be exploring its options going forward, including the potential acquisition of any wound care products and even the sale of the company. </p><p>The small company's stock dropped precipitously, losing 28%, or $1.59, to trade at $.01 in late-day trading. </p><p>From here on out, Derma Sciences on its already existing products, including MediHoney, a honey-based dressing for wound management. </p><p><p>
