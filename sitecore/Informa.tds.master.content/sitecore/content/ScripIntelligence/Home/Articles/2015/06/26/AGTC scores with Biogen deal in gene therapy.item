<p><p>Biogen has upped its presence in gene therapy through a $1bn deal with smaller biotech AGTC. The deal signals the second major biotech deal in a week and gives the smaller Florida-based company a chance to expand its wholly-owned programs. </p><p>Biogen announced 02 July that it has agreed to pay $124m upfront and $472.5M in milestones for two ophthalmic disease treatments, as well as another $592.5M in milestones for three potential discovery programs. AGTC is also eligible for royalties. </p><p>The upfront payment includes an equity stake in the smaller biotech. Biogen has agreed to buy 1.4m shares at $20.63 apiece for a total value of $30M, resulting in an 8.1% stake in the company. </p><p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015. AGTC will have the right to co-promote the second approved compound and has up to the time of a BLA filing to make that decision. </p><p>The two programs that got the big biotech interested in the deal were for rare eye diseases that are caused by a single deficient gene. AGTC's programs works by using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to carry the healthy copy of the gene into the affected cells. </p><p>The lead compound in the agreement is for the treatment of X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS), a rare disease that results in blindness. AGTC filed for an IND with the FDA in March and has begun a Phase I/II study. AGTC will lead development of the candidate through filing. </p><p>The second treatment is for a disease, X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP),that affects men in their teenage years and can result in serious complications to their eyes in adulthood. AGTC has begun preclinical studies for the candidate and will be responsible for the development through the first human trials. </p><p>Biogen will support the clinical development cost subject to certain conditions following the first-in-human study for XLRS and following the IND-enabling studies for XLRP. Under the manufacturing license Biogen will receive an exclusive license to use AGTC's proprietary technology platform to make AAV vectors for up to six additional gene therapy programs, three of which are at AGTC's sole discretion and subject to payment of option fees and royalties.</p><p><b>Growth for AGTC</b></p><p>The size of the deal gives the small Florida biotech more flexibility with advancing its own pipeline. AGTC President and CEO Sue Washer told analysts during a 02 July conference call that conversations with Biogen took several months to negotiate because AGTC wanted to keep some of its programs in-house. </p><p>"I think we had a wide range of programs available and it was very important to AGTC to retain internal control over a portion of them. And so it was obviously just a point of negotiation between Biogen and AGTC as to which programs were in the partnership and which programs we retained for ourselves," said Washer. "So obviously we did look at this deal as a way to broaden our pipeline and significantly expand the number of research programs that we could bring forward into the clinic in a more timely manner."</p><p>AGTC decided to hang on to the rights for a preclinical wet AMD program &ndash; an area that could have huge market potential if it works out, as well as an early stage program for achromatopsia, which will have data by the end of the year. </p><p>Analysts were excited about the deal: "In addition to providing validation to the AGTC gene therapy platform, including target, gene, and vector selection and manufacturing, we believe the deal increases the likelihood of ultimate approval and commercial success. We continue to expect positive proof-of-concept data in XLRS and Achromatopsia by YE15, based on solid biologic rationale, pre-clinical data and optimized clinical trial design," wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough in a sameday note. </p><p><p>
