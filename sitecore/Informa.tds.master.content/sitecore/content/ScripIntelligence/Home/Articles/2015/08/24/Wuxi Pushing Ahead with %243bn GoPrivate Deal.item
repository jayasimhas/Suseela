<p>Despite the market turmoil on China&rsquo;s stock exchanges since June, US-listed Chinese healthcare-related companies have not stepped back from privatization plans and the consideration of floating again on Chinese bourses, given the encouraging policies and promising development environment in the country.</p><p>The most recent privatization move was Wuxi PharmaTech&rsquo;s definitive merger agreement with New Wuxi Life Science Limited and its subsidiary Wuxi Merger Limited in August. </p><p>The idea was first pitched in April, when Wuxi announced that a consortium of investors was planning to take the company private for $5.75 per ordinary share and $46 per American depositary share in an all-cash deal. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/WuXi-To-Go-Private-In-33bn-CEO-Backed-Deal-35997" target="_new">buyout group</a> was led by Ge Li, founder, chairman and chief executive officer of the company, and Ally Bridge Group Capital Partners, Boyu Capital, the investment arm of Ping An Insurance (Group) of China and the Singaporean state investment company Temasek Holdings. </p><p>The go-private deal is now expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, although shareholder approval is still pending. According to Wuxi&rsquo;s announcement, the privatization remains subject to two conditions: getting the votes of at least two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares, and getting an affirmative vote from a majority of the shareholders that are not related parties.</p><h2>Promising Metrics</h2><p>The privatization is nevertheless moving forward, Jack Hu, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said in a recent research note. &ldquo;We maintain our price target of $48 as we believe the privatization is likely to go through,&rdquo; Hu said. &ldquo;We estimate the cash consideration for the deal is $3.3bn; the company indicated that it had secured a $1.1bn loan and the rest would be funded by equity.&rdquo;</p><p>Deutsche Bank examined four major M&A/privatizations in the contract research organization (CRO) space over the past 15 years and two similar proposals to Wuxi, including Covance Inc.&rsquo;s privatization by LabCorp, Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc.&rsquo;s delisting, and the previous privatization proposal of Wuxi by Charles River Laboratories International Inc., which was withdrawn three months after the proposal announcement. </p><p>According to its analysis, the current privatization proposal for Wuxi has the highest Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiple among the six transactions. Additionally, this proposal is the only one with an offer that is higher than the all-time high for the target&rsquo;s shares prior to the announcement of a deal.</p><p>Risks of the deal include additional investments, increasing competition, limited room for ASP (adjusted share price) adjustments, Renminbi appreciation, labor inflation, as well as uncertainties regarding privatization, Hu noted.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a strong possibility that the privatization would happen,&rdquo; said Ricky Zhong, chief investment officer of iMeigu Capital Management. &ldquo;The high valuation of Wuxi&rsquo;s newly listed subsidiary SynTheAll in China showed the confidence from the domestic market for the company.&rdquo;</p><p>In April 2015, Wuxi listed its wholly owned R&D and manufacturing unit SynTheAll Pharmaceutical on China's New Third Board, an over-the-counter exchange. In July, SynTheAll raised $80m through a private placement of 6% of its shares, giving it a total value at $1.3bn. This fundraising attracted several big institutional investors, such as Sequoia Capital and Fosun Capital.</p><p>The valuation of SynTheAll is not far from Wuxi&rsquo;s total valuation on the NYSE. This is encouraging for Wuxi to go private, Zhong said. Especially on the A-share market, pharmaceutical companies with high technology generally have higher valuations than the average, and in particular, Wuxi has businesses covering drug development and genomics testing, which are favored by A-share investors.</p><p>An example as a similar company is Hangzhou Tigermed Consulting, a Chinese A-share-listed CRO, with a price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of 81.57, which is much higher than the P/E ratio of 30.16 for Wuxi, according to Shanghai exchange and NYSE real-time data.</p><p>The buyers did not give details of the rationale for taking Wuxi private, although Li said in the company statement that it "provides a very attractive opportunity to the company's shareholders."</p><p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the proposal for privatization, we will pursue the listing out of the Small Molecule Manufacturing business unit, [and will] raise our relatively low cost capital in the Chinese capital market to fund this subsidiary, and substantial capital expenditure for capacity expansion,&rdquo; Li said in the second quarter results earnings call.</p><p>Wuxi&rsquo;s board of directors, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee comprised of independent directors, is exclusively evaluating and negotiating the go-private proposal, and the approval of the execution of a definitive agreement and plan of merger by Wuxi and various other parties, Li said.</p><p>The company did not have any further information to add at the time other than what has already been disclosed in the press release and Form 6-K, he added.</p><h2>New Global Headquarters</h2><p>In June in an official monthly magazine, Waigaoqiao Windows, released by the Shanghai Waigaoqiao Group that is running and managing the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, Li said Wuxi is planning to move its global headquarters to the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, and would also take this opportunity to set up a Wuxi PharmaTech Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center there.</p><p>Through establishing an open platform for small and medium companies, Wuxi will be able to provide one-stop services for these in terms of personnel, equipment, facilities and laboratory supplies, company registration and technology transfer, as well as financial support via venture capital funds.</p><p>The planned site is composed of an administrative office building for the headquarters, a biopharmaceutical laboratory building, drug analytical testing building and R&D building for cell therapy and new technology, with a total construction area of about 80,000 square meters.</p><p>The newly established subsidiary WuXi NextCODE Genomics will also be based at the new site, to provide genome analysis and genome sequencing services. </p><p>Other ongoing construction plans in China include the largest mammalian cell culture manufacturing facility using disposable bioreactors in the world, and the largest biomanufacturing facility of any kind in China under construction in Wuxi city, as well as a small-molecule manufacturing expansion in Changzhou.</p><p>&ldquo;By 2017, we expect to have a commercial scale manufacturing facility ready that will quintuple our capacity and be a key growth driver for the remainder of the decade. However, this means it requires a substantial investment in both capital and people,&rdquo; Li noted.</p><h2>Ties With Domestic Pharmas</h2><p>Li also disclosed Wuxi&rsquo;s client profile during the earnings call. &ldquo;I think right now, international versus domestic is about 80-20 [%]. The biotech versus large pharma, I would say right now about 50-50,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re also potentially entering into collaborations to bring innovative products into China to collaborate with partners to speed up the product development in China,&rdquo; Li noted.</p><p>This year, Wuxi has formed two strategic partnerships with China-listed pharmaceutical companies, including Harbin Gloria Pharmaceutical and Guangdong Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical. </p><p>In May this year, Gloria Pharmaceutical and Wuxi signed a risk-sharing joint development agreement to co-develop a selected biologic oncology drug and four Class 1.1 small molecule drugs for lung diseases, including lung cancer and respiratory indications.</p><p>Wuxi and Zhongsheng Pharmaceutical established their strategic partnership in July to co-develop class 1.1 innovative small molecule drugs with a focus on ophthalmology, oncology, cardiology and diabetes.</p><p>Wuxi set up a new venture capital fund focusing on healthcare companies in China and the US in July, with a $50m anchor investment, which was called WuXi Healthcare Ventures Fund II and runs in addition to the WuXi Venture Fund.</p><p>Gloria Pharmaceutical announced afterward it would join the Ventures Fund II as a limited partner for an investment of $10m. Shandong Luoxin Pharmaceutical also entered into an agreement with Wuxi in July to invest in the fund under a limited partnership with a $10m commitment.</p><h2>Going Private Trend</h2><p>Currently, 10 Chinese healthcare-related companies are listed on US stock markets besides Wuxi: China Pharma Holdings, China Cord Blood Corporation, China Biologic Products, Sinovac Biotech, China Nepstar Chain Drugstore, Mindray Medical International and Concord Medical Services. </p><p>But privatization has been an active trend this year. China Cord Blood announced in April that it had received a going private proposal from Golden Meditech, which will acquire all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the company. Mindray Medical said in June that three executives had proposed taking the company private for $3.5bn in cash.</p><p>Then Nepstar said in July that its board of directors had received a preliminary non-binding privatization proposal at a price of $1.30 per share, or $2.60 per ADS.</p><p>Looking back to several years ago, several other Chinese pharmaceutical companies had also already finished privatizations and delistings from US exchanges.</p><p>In 2013, China Nuokang Bio-Pharmaceutical announced the completion of a merger with Kingbird Mergerco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kingbird Investment and an affiliate of the company&rsquo;s chairman and CEO. In the same year, Simcere Pharmaceutical agreed to sell a $495.4m stake to a consortium led by the company's founder and chairman Jinsheng Ren.</p><p>Chinese biotechnology firm 3SBio also delisted from Nasdaq after shareholders voted in favor of a privatization bid from a group led by the company&rsquo;s CEO and CITIC Private Equity in 2013, but the company then launched an up to $712m Hong Kong initial public offering in May this year.</p><p>This article is also being published in <a href="https:/www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.
