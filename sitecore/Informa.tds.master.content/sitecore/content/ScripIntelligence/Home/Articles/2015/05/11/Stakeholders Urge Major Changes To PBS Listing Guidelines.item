<p> The future shape of Australia's system for listing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is becoming clearer after the government published stakeholder responses to a consultation on the long-awaited review of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) guidelines, which are used by the pharmaceutical industry to prepare requests for PBS listing. </p><p> It's clear from the responses that stakeholders believe a great deal of work needs to be done if the PBS listing procedures are to be brought into line with practices elsewhere in the world. High up on their wish-lists are the need for early PBAC engagement with industry, closer patient involvement in PBS procedures, clearer rules on comparator medicines, and the use of earlier trial data or surrogate endpoints to obtain a listing under managed entry schemes or risk-sharing arrangements. </p><p> Others said the committee's procedures had to take account of developments such as advances in health technology assessment and adaptive trial designs, and that special provisions were needed for particular kinds of products such as vaccines. </p><p> The consultation on the future shape of the PBAC guidelines was launched by health minister Sussan Ley in April this year in an effort to address the various technical issues that have been raised since they were last revised back in 2008. The government said at the time that the review would be carried out by an independent contractor which, and has just announced that this will be Adelaide Health Technology Assessment (AHTA) at the University of Adelaide. </p><p> Working with the Guidelines Review Steering Committee (GRSC), the AHTA will review the current content of the guidelines, taking into account the stakeholder comments as well as new developments in HTA, including documents produced by comparable HTA agencies, regulators and recognised evidence assessment bodies in other countries. The aim is to have the review completed by August 2016. </p><h2> Stakeholder Responses </h2><p> The consultation drew comments from a range of stakeholders, mainly industry, consumer bodies and medical societies, as well as from Pharmac, PBAC's counterpart in New Zealand. </p><p> Responding on behalf of the industry, Medicines Australia submitted a long and detailed response that incorporated many suggestions from its member companies. It said as new technologies were developed and R&amp;D became more intricate and more able to be targeted to specific genetic variations, it was &quot;vital to regularly review the guidelines that govern the system. &quot;Regularly updating, streamlining and incorporating the latest HTA methodological advances into the guidelines would ensure they remained fit for purpose,&quot; the association declared. </p><p> Medicines Australia has already produced a summary paper on industry's main concerns, based on surveys of its member companies, which was published in July this year. It said at the time that the PBAC guidelines were viewed by its member companies as &quot;an integral component of the HTA-based medicines reimbursement system we have in Australia. As such, MA supports the PBAC guidelines review project and believes this initiative is a great opportunity to update, streamline and incorporate the latest HTA methodological thinking within the PBAC guidelines.&quot; </p><p> The association says it is now making three additional recommendations that should help to achieve the &quot;world's best practice guidelines.&quot; These are as follows: </p><p> Consider key methodological guidance issues for updating or addition to the guidelines. Medicines Australia particularly singles out the choice of comparator, adaptive clinical trial design, indirect comparisons, surrogate to final outcomes, and patient crossover in clinical trials. It also calls for new methods of allowing the inclusion of broader societal costs and benefits &ndash; for example, consideration of non-health benefits like productivity gains and reduced welfare dependence - and how the PBAC might take these into account. Special attention, it says, should be paid to the evidence requirements for biosimilars, in particular data reviewed by the TGA and PBAC in determining biosimilarity, substitutability and appropriate prescribing advice, and to the question of how to deal with the relative paucity of data for treatments for rare diseases. </p><p> Consider process issues for updating during, or in parallel to, the review. Companies need to be clearer about getting early expert advice in specific therapy areas before the PBAC meeting, and on how patients can be involved earlier in the decision making process (learning from other countries like Canada, Netherlands and the UK). There should be less comprehensive evaluation for simpler submissions or those with a low budget impact, in order to give more time for complex cost-effectiveness or cost-minimization submissions. There should be an online portal for PBAC submissions and correspondence, and regular reporting on how PBAC guidelines are being used in practice. PBAC should, like the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England, take an approach that allows methodologies to be updated easily to reduce red tape and ensure guidelines remain up to date. </p><p> Follow a robust and transparent process with input from all relevant stakeholders and experts. Medicines Australia says the review must be conducted with input from all relevant stakeholders and experts, in line with the structure and procedural steps outlined in the recently revised Post Market Review Framework http://www.pbs.gov.au/info/reviews/subsidised-medicines-reviews. If any particular methodological issues are identified that need further scrutiny, these should be carved out of the review and dealt with separately to keep the review to timetable. </p><p> &quot;Considerable education&quot; will be necessary following the release of the new guidelines, according to the association. This could include a roadshow to workshop the new guidelines or any associated process changes, which would be of benefit to industry, evaluators, PBAC and subcommittee members as well as service providers within the industry. </p><p> It says it expects the updated guidelines &quot;will be welcomed by its membership and the broader industry if they live up to the promised expectations. That is, to incorporate a 'world&rsquo;s best practice' approach to methodological progress and improved collaboration on understanding the full value of medicines.&quot; It &quot;looks forward to the opportunity to raise other issues during the review as necessary, either through the GRSC or further public consultation.&quot; </p><h2> Vaccines A Special Case, Says GSK </h2><p> GlaxoSmithKline Australia's submission focuses mainly on the assessment of vaccines, which it points out have only been assessed under the PBAC system since 2005. It says that no provision has been made to &quot;stretch the system appropriately to address the unique costs, benefits and attributes of vaccines.&quot; </p><p> Vaccines are often undervalued because of factors such as discount rates, time horizon expectations for modelling outcomes, indirect costs and benefits, and quality of life estimates and methods for short-term diseases in young children, according to GSK. </p><p> While some new vaccines have been successfully managed within the existing PBAC system through resubmissions and efforts by sponsors to overcome the obstacles, &quot;case-by-case fixes do not serve the government or taxpayers well,&quot; GSK said. The PBAC system is intended to help the government allocate resources to those medicines and vaccines that represent value for money, but &quot;where the system provides suboptimal evaluation of vaccines, it is offering suboptimal information to government on where to direct resources. Ultimately, the patient impact can be long delays, limited access or no access to new vaccines.&quot; </p><p> It suggests learning from other countries' experience. International HTA experts have commented on the &quot;unique challenges&quot; for HTA in evaluating vaccines, and comparable agencies in some cases take a different approach from the PBAC, for example on the issue of discounting rates. &quot;By referencing international HTA experts and alternative systems, there may be solutions appropriate to the Australian system which can be adopted to ensure timely, appropriate and robust valuation of vaccines are conducted in the best interest of the Australian public,&quot; GSK declared. </p><h2> Amgen's concerns </h2><p> In its submission, Amgen Australia Pty Ltd raises a variety of issues: the need for guidance on use of non-RCT data sources like observational, real world, registry, historical controls, etc; how to handle pricing aspects when the price of the comparator is hidden; and the need for a better process for pre-submission meetings with the DoH that ensures they are held close enough to the submission to make feedback worthwhile but far enough out to allow for changes to content if necessary. </p><p> Amgen also wants to see early and extended evaluation for some complex products, and more modern modelling techniques to improve quality of submissions &ndash; discrete event simulation, network meta-analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis and so on. </p><p> Like Medicines Australia, Amgen wants special treatment for biosimilars. It calls for the guidelines to have a dedicated section on biosimilar comparisons &quot;as the medical community navigates the emergence of new biosimilar technologies (including those products that may offer benefits over the comparator).&quot; </p><h2> Pharmac Sees Benefits In Alignment </h2><p> The fact that PBAC's New Zealand counterpart, Pharmac (Pharmaceutical Management Agency), has made its own submission to the consultation makes sense, as many companies co-ordinate their listing submissions to Australia and New Zealand. Pharmac says there could be &quot;benefit from closer alignment of the assessment methods used in the two countries.&quot; </p><p> The agency has just updated its own guideline on funding applications as well as its &quot;Prescription For Pharmacoeconomic Analysis (PFPA), which is a guide for assessing the value for money of pharmaceuticals in New Zealand. It has also begun an internal review of the PFPA and suggests Australia might want to consider some of the issues identified in the review. </p><p> One of these is the definition of &quot;main comparator&quot;. Australia, Pharmac suggests, might want to consider whether to change this from &quot;the medicine that is prescribed on the PBS&quot; to &quot;medicines that are now prescribed or are likely to be prescribed on the PBS.&quot; The reason would be to take account of pending price changes, trends in volume, and expected use of other therapeutic options. </p><p> Pharmac also raises the question of choosing of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measures, consideration of health-related benefits to people other than those taking the drug (eg caregivers), and the use of lower-quality evidence in the economic evaluation when high-grade evidence is unlikely to be forthcoming in a timely fashion. </p><h2> Consumers And Medics </h2><p> From the consumer side of the fence, the HTAi Patient and Citizen Involvement in HTA Interest Group said the review should look at how data from patients and their carers are gathered and presented to PBAC, how research methods might capture &quot;patient value&quot;, and whether a disease and its management are a population or public health issue rather than one for individual consumers or consumer groups, as with type 2 diabetes. </p><p> PBAC should examine whether patient input is intended to &quot;legitimize decision-making, improve implementation of the decisions, or add value to the health technology (HTA) processes and inform decision making,&quot; says the group. Consumer participation activities that are transparent, have a well-defined purpose, and a clear plan for how information will be shared among PBAC members and staff and utilised are required, it adds. </p><p> The Medical Oncology Group of Australia Incorporated (MOGA) said it would like to see the use of earlier trial data or surrogate endpoints in order to obtain a PBS listing under a managed entry scheme or risk-sharing arrangement while more mature data were awaited. MOGA also backs priority and fast-track assessments and funding &quot;for true breakthrough medicines that address unmet medical needs&quot;, and would like PBAC to explore new methods of determining the value of cancer medicines in addition to cost-effectiveness studies, and of incorporating such methods into the guidelines. </p><h2> The Next Steps </h2><p> The AHTA will first look at the current content of the guidelines as well as significant new developments including guidelines published by comparable international health technology assessment agencies, regulators and internationally recognised authorities in the assessment of evidence. </p><p> Taking into account responses to the first consultation, it will prepare a technical paper for discussion on each key issue, recommend any deletions to the current guidelines, and make proposals as to how to address each technical issue. These will be consolidated into a revised set of guidelines and presented to the GRSC for review and comment. </p><p> Next, there will be a public consultation process for the proposed revised guidelines, after which the AHTA will produce a summary of the feedback and proposals for further improvements for consideration by the GRSC. The feedback will be incorporated into the draft revised guidelines, which will go to the Drug Utilisation Sub Committee (DUSC) and the Economics Subcommittee, and for endorsement by PBAC. </p>
