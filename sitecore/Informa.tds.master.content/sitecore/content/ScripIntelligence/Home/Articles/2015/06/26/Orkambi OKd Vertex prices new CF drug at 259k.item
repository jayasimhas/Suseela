<p>The FDA's 2 July approval of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' new cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi came as little surprise, with everyone on Wall Street anticipating the agency would make its move ahead of the 4 July US Independence Day holiday &ndash; in which federal offices are closed on 3 July &ndash; and the 5 July <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date.</p><p>What everyone was awaiting with great anticipation was the wholesale acquisition cost, which Vertex set at $259,000 per year &ndash; a price that was a bit higher than most analysts had anticipated, causing a slight, but brief, panic by investors.</p><p>Deutsche Bank analyst Dr Robyn Karnauskas said consensus for the price was about $220,000 annually.</p><p>Shares of Vertex, whose trading had been halted at about noon on 2 July after the FDA posted the Orkambi approval letter on its website, rose 4.6% in the afternoon to $132, a gain of $5.81, before closing the day at $131.26, up $5.07, or 4%.</p><p>Vertex officials insisted they were confident payers would provide broad access to Orkambi in line with the drug's labeling.</p><p>They said patients' access to Orkambi would depend on the time it takes them to secure reimbursement approval from their payer, however.</p><p>The firm, which said it expected to have Orkambi available to specialty pharmacies within days, anticipated that up to 40% of patients prescribed the drug would be covered by Medicaid &ndash; the US government's healthcare insurance program for the poor &ndash; with most of the remainder having commercial prescription coverage.</p><p>For the uninsured, Vertex said it was offering an assistance program for those who meet the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Orkambi &ndash; a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of Vertex's Kalydeco (ivacaftor), which initially was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">approved by the FDA in 2012</a>, and a new drug, lumacaftor &ndash; is indicated to treat CF patients 12 years or older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. </p><p>Overall, about 30,000 people in the US are affected by CF, a rare, life-threatening genetic disease caused by defective or missing proteins, which results in poor flow of salt and water into or out of the cell in a number of organs, including the lungs.</p><p>But Vertex has estimated there are about 8,500 patients in the US with two copies of the F508del mutation &ndash; the target population for Orkambi</p><p>"These patients are well known to their physicians," Stuart Arbuckle, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Vertex, told investors and analysts during a 2 July conference. "We believe all eligible patients should have access to Orkambi."</p><p>Analysts have predicted a favorable future for Orkambi, which will be used in a much broader population than Kalydeco &ndash; a drug that targets only about 2,000 CF patients in the US.</p><p>Kalydeco is approved in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-expanded-pediatric-use-of-CF-drug-Kalydeco-357372" target="_new">number of CF mutations</a>, but not F508del.</p><p>The drug has done well in the market, with Vertex anticipating net revenues of $560m to $580m for 2015.</p><p>The new twice-daily oral medicine, Orkambi, is the first drug granted approval in the US to treat the underlying cause of CF in the F508del mutation population, Vertex officials pointed out during the investor call.</p><p>Dr Jeffrey Leiden, president and CEO of Vertex, declared Orkambi's approval a "remarkable day for science, medicine and the CF community."</p><p>Dr Robert Beall, president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, noted his organization played a key role in Orkambi's development &ndash; actually initiating the first efforts that led to the discovery and development of ivacaftor and lumacaftor.</p><p>"It is our hope that everyone who is prescribed this drug will have immediate access to it so they can begin to live longer, healthier lives," said Dr Beall, whose organization is eligible to earn royalties from Orkambi's sales, which Vertex said would be in the low double digits.</p><p><b>Panel support</b></p><p>Orkambi's approval came after the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) on 12 May <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vertex-CF-patients-convince-FDA-panel-to-back-Orkambi-358384" target="_new">voted 12-1</a> the available efficacy and safety data supported the drug's marketing for the F508del mutation population. </p><p>In a unanimous vote, the PADAC also said Vertex's data supported Orkambi's safety in CF patients 12 years or older with the F508del mutation.</p><p>But the committee had mixed opinions about whether the available data demonstrated the newer agent in the FDC drug, lumacaftor, contributed positively to the clinical efficacy seen for the combination product in the F508del mutation population &ndash; with three declaring it did, four giving a thumbs down and six voting that they could not determine one way or the other.</p><p>The hot issue at that PADAC meeting was the fact the FDA had advised Vertex against including an ivacaftor alone arm in its Phase III studies because regulators determined a trial of the drug as a monotherapy, known as 770-104, showed the medicine was not effective in the F508del mutation population &ndash; information the agency even included in the labeling for Kalydeco, which was the first drug approved in the US to treat the underlying cause of CF.</p><p>So it was unclear to the PADAC how the combination product truly stacked up against Kalydeco in patients with the F508del mutation.</p><p>In Vertex's Phase III 809-103 and 809-104 studies, Orkambi had a small, but statistically significant effect in absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory capacity in one second (ppFEV1) at 24 weeks, with a difference from placebo of 2.7% to 3.0%. </p><p>The FDA had conducted its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fretting-over-Vertex-CF-drug-Orkambi-Nah-358274" target="_new">own statistical comparative analyses</a> between Kalydeco and Orkambi at the proposed dose, but the agency said it "could not exclude with any level of confidence" the combination drug was any different than the monotherapy agent in changes in ppFEV1 and pulmonary exacerbations.</p><p>Nonetheless, the panel voted to approve Orkambi and the FDA took its advice.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
