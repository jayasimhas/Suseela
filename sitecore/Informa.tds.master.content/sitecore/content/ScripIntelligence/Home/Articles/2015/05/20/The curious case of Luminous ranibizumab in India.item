<p>Novartis has moved court to block India's Intas Pharmaceuticals from manufacturing and selling its version of ranibizumab under the Lumina trademark, which the Swiss multinational appears to suggest rides on its well-documented "Luminous" study.</p><p>While Novartis markets ranibizumab as Lucentis and Accentrix &ndash; both associated with the Luminous study &ndash; it says that the use of Luminous also constitutes a trademark in relation to medical services and ranibizumab. </p><p>In a case at the Delhi High Court, Novartis argued that Luminous is also used in relation to medical studies and research pertaining to ranibizumab on the promotional materials of Lucentis and Accentrix.</p><p>"The trade mark Luminous acquired formidable goodwill and reputation which the plaintiff [Novartis] is entitled to protect in law against misappropriation and misuse. Reliance is also placed on trade mark registrations applied for and granted for Luminous in several countries," Novartis put forth, as per case details. Novartis applied for registration of the Luminous trade mark in India on 16 April 2015 under "multi class application".</p><p>Intas had proposed to use the trademark Lumina for its ranibizumab, but Novartis's arguments in the case documents appear to suggest that the Indian firm's original choice was the "Razumab" trademark and that the Swiss firm was caught unawares by Intas's change of plan. </p><p>"In February 2015, the plaintiffs [Novartis] were shocked to witness that in a conference organized by All India Ophthalmological Society the defendant [Intas] has now exhibited the proposed launch of the ranibizumab under the trade mark Lumina," details in an April order concerning the case said. At a previous conference by the Vitreo Retinal Society of India, Intas was said to have "exhibited" its proposed launch of ranibizumab under the trade mark Razumab. </p><p>On 24 April, the Delhi High Court had, in an interim order, restrained Intas from manufacturing, selling, advertising, etc pharmaceutical preparations of ranibizumab using the trade mark Lumina or any other mark "deceptively similar" to the trade mark Luminous. The court then observed that there appeared to be prima facie "structural and phonetic" similarity of the impugned trade mark Lumina with that of Luminous and also held that the balance of convenience was in Novartis's favor.</p><p>In late March Novartis issued a legal notice to Intas, but the latter declined to comply and instead went on to file a separate suit on the ground that the legal notice constitutes "groundless threats" under Section 142 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and should be injuncted.</p><h2>Intas's response</h2><p>Significantly, though, Intas's top brass told <i>Scrip</i> that the adoption of the Lumina trade name was based on the firm's "honest belief" that Novartis's Luminous is not a trademark. </p><p>"The products of Novartis are not prescribed and sold under the mark Luminous and the same is only for research purpose. However, in view of the finding of the court and other relevant considerations Intas has decided to use Razumab for the product ranibizumab," the Ahmedabad-based Intas told <i>Scrip</i> on 26 May. </p><p>Case details in the April order suggested that Intas plans a pan India launch of its product, including in Delhi, where it has requisite approvals.</p><p>It's not immediately clear whether Intas's decision to revert to the Razumab trademark will now mean an amicable settlement of the suit. The case was expected, as per court documents dated 19 May, to list on 10 July for further hearing.</p><p>Novartis did not immediately respond to an e-mail on the case.</p><p>While the case itself appears to be at a curious juncture, Intas had earlier argued that the user of the trade mark Luminous is only for research work, research studies and such kind of work and has "no commercial user."</p><p>It underscored that unless a commercial user is proved, no protection can be sought for or granted to the plaintiffs.</p><p>It also pointed out that that Luminous is a generic word and that there are various registrations on the record of the Registrar of Trade Mark of the mark "Luminous" and marks akin to this.</p><p>Earlier this year, Intas launched its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intas-biosimilar-Enbrel-debuts-at-hefty-discount-in-India-357542%5d" target="_new">cut-price etanercept</a>, a biosimilar version of Amgen's TNF-inhibitor Enbrel, on the Indian market. It now has around nine biosimilar products on the domestic market, including rituximab. </p>
