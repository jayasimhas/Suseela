<p>The Department of Health is talking to UK companies that supply human serum albumin in an effort to tackle supply shortages that are expected over the next few months. </p><p>The DH said it had been informed by one of the main suppliers to the UK market, Bio Products Laboratory (BPL), that the company expected to experience intermittent supply interruptions over the coming months. </p><p>The problem has arisen as a result of an increased demand for albumin combined with essential upgrades to the company's production facilities that cannot be undertaken without product interruptions, the DH said.</p><p>It told <i>Scrip</i> it was "in discussion with BPL and other suppliers of albumin to the UK market to assess the supply position", the aim being to work out how to cover any production shortfall. </p><p>A spokesperson for BPL said that albumin demand in the UK had increased over the past two years, and that in response the company had increased its output by 34% over that period. "However, BPL is part way through a &pound;60m investment programme to significantly increase production capacity and upgrade its facilities, which unfortunately means it will not be able to meet market demand for albumin in the coming months."</p><p>Neither the DH nor BPL gave any reasons for the increase in demand for albumin over the past couple of years. </p><p>Human serum albumin (HSA) is a protein secreted by the liver that helps to maintain plasma's normal oncotic pressure. As a therapeutic product extracted from the plasma of healthy donors, albumin has a number of uses, such as stabilizing blood pressure in patients with shock or sepsis and in diseases such as ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. </p><p>It is also used as an excipient in pharmaceutical and biological products, for example as a stabilizer of product potency, a carrier molecule in drug delivery, and a component in cell culture and stem cell expansion. </p><p>Aside from BPL, there are a number of other companies that produce and supply licensed human albumin in the UK, including BioTest, Octapharma and CSL Behring. It's not clear which firms, if any, will be able to plug the supply gap.</p><p>Marc Maltas, managing director of BioTest, confirmed his company had been contacted about the forthcoming shortages due to the situation at BPL, but said BioTest could only deliver to existing customers at present. Shortages of albumin are difficult to handle because there is a finite number of units to sell and the company has advance supply commitments, he said, suggesting that most other companies would be in the same boat. </p><p>A spokesperson for CSL Behring said the company could not comment on BPL's current supply situation, but noted that "CSL Behring has contracts in place with a number of NHS Trusts in the UK to supply Alburex and has not experienced any supply problems to date". Octapharma too said it had had no problems with albumin supplies.</p><h2>Shortages in India</h2><p>Albumin supplies have also been affected by shortages in India. In September last year the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) said albumin injection was among a number of essential drugs hit by shortages and that the manufacturers were failing to maintain normal supplies. </p><p>Some reports suggested that the shortages were the result of major manufacturers reducing or stopping production and supply of albumin in response to price caps imposed by the NPPA, although the authority has said that price is not the issue. </p><p>With the supply problems continuing into 2015, a report in <i>The Times of India</i> in March this year said that the government might invoke provisions of the Drug Prices Control Order, 2013, which allows the regulator to give instructions to manufacturers to distribute medicines in the event of an emergency or in the public interest. Under the DPCO, companies making essential medicines are required to inform the NPPA at least six months before they plan to discontinue production of a drug, and the government can also direct a company to continue production for up to a year, the <i>Times</i> noted.</p>
