<p>US FDA inspections in India under the agency's Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO) saw a peak of more than three dozen 483s being issued in fiscal 2010, though the actual numbers have declined in subsequent years &ndash; data that could potentially temper to some extent the debate on compliance concerns in the country.</p><p>A form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p>Data presented by Solomon Yimam, Assistant Country Director, US FDA India Office, at BioAsia 2015 in Hyderabad indicated that 16 of the 30 BIMO inspections in India in FY2012 were issued 483s, as against 19 such 483s in 2011 and a peak of 40 in 2010. The FDA issued 24 such 483s in 2008 and 18 in 2009.</p><p>''Issuance of 483s doesn't necessarily mean that the violations were serious or warrant a warning letter. Even if we find minor issues like improper protocol following or not documenting the consent process, it will warrant the issue of 483s,'' Mr Yimam told a packed house at the conference.</p><p>The total number of BIMO inspections conducted in India stood at 44 in FY2011, 67 in 2010, 38 in 2009 and 34 in 2008. FY2012 saw five CRO inspections as against a high of 16 in 2010 and a low of just one such inspection in 2008.</p><p>It is not immediately clear if latest FDA BIMO data mirrors similar trends. </p><p>Under the BIMO program, the FDA inspects clinical investigators, sponsors, monitors, CROs, institutional review boards, non-clinical laboratory facilities and bioequivalence facilities. Inspections of establishments that conduct studies of products intended for final use in humans but which are initially being tested in animals are also covered under this program.</p><p>Though the fewer number of 483s may be a result of a number of factors including simply fewer inspections in a particular year, such data could moderate skewed debate around compliance issues in India. This even as the Indian contract research organization GVK Biosciences is currently in the eye of a storm after the French medicines agency ANSM uncovered data manipulation <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Hundreds-of-generics-face-European-ban-following-GVK-breaches-356345%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 January 2015)</a>, though GVK has claimed the actions of European agencies were overblown.</p><p>Mr Yimam also referred to ''common violations'' in areas associated with protocol, records and reports, informed consent and adverse event reporting, among others. The FDA Assistant Country Director, however, all along qualified his comments suggesting that these represented his own views and not that of the agency.</p><p>The FDA has been conducting capacity building workshops in India - last year it conducted a series on workshops on quality systems that Mr Yimam said saw a ''sold-out crowd'' and also on data integrity issues. Last May, the FDA and India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization's collaborative workshop series saw the first of such efforts focused on effective quality systems, highlighting the FDA's efforts to engage in transparent discussions with industry and regulators to ensure and strengthen the quality, safety, efficacy and integrity of drugs exported to the US <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Green-shoots-in-US-India-co-operation-on-drugs-quality-351631%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 6 May 2014)</a>. </p><p>Asked by <i>Scrip</i> about his general experience concerning compliance levels and data integrity concerns in the backdrop of a spate of warning letters against Indian sites over the recent past, Mr Yimam indicated that the sheer number of facilities and volumes in India may be skewing the debate compared to other nations, which also had similar issues.</p><p>''The only reason that it is amplified is because of transparency &#8230; all warning letters that are issued are put on the FDA website. So people probably think India is getting more of a share of its warning letters than other countries,'' he said.</p><p>He also explained that firms being inspected for the first time may not be familiar with the regulatory requirements, inspection process and the first round of inspections may possibly see ''serious deficiencies'' being identified. </p><p>''The most important thing is to institute corrections after those violations have been identified and put those in place. Most of the facilities&#8230; when we go for follow up they are cleared. So I don't see any issues of Indian companies compared to companies located in other countries,'' he added. </p><p>An analysis of US FDA data for the 42-month period ended June 2013 by India's Vision Consulting Group, led by Dilip Shah and published in the CPhI pharma evolution annual industry report had earlier shown that a total of 66 firms, both innovator and generic, received warning letters, but that Indian companies accounted for just 12% of those <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-warning-letters-for-Indian-firms-relatively-low-at-12-347046%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 4 October 2013)</a>. </p><p>Mr Shah, who is also secretary-general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic companies, had then argued that the data suggest that Indian manufacturing, by and large, is only as good or bad as the rest of the industry. In 2012 Indian firms accounted for 37% of ANDAs and 40% of drug master files (DMFs) in the US, the analysis said.</p>
