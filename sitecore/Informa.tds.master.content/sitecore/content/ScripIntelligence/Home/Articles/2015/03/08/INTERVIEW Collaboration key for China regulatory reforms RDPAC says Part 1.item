<p> Four years into his tenure, R&amp;D-based Pharmaceutical Association Committee (RDPAC) managing director Joseph Cho is facing a different China. Compared to a booming economy and more welcoming environment in 2011, the pharma industry is now seeing its challenges mounting. </p> <p> <p> If pricing pressure and provincial tenders are just a few of the pressuring issues, multiregional clinical trial reviews and uncertain drug reimbursement policies are becoming even bigger pains to innovative drug makers. </p> <p> <p> In this changing environment, multinational pharma firms can&rsquo;t exclusively look after their own interests because it won&rsquo;t work, Cho told PharmAsia News in this first part of an exclusive interview conducted at his office in Beijing. They have to serve the interests of innovation in China and multiple stakeholders, he emphasized. </p> <p> <p> To that end, RDPAC, the organization Cho leads, has been working with domestic partners and collaborating with other associations. </p> <p> <p> The strategic shift seems to be working. An RDPAC representative was called upon to participate in a recent marketing authorization holder (MAH) forum, co-organized by the China FDA and European Union. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t simply give lectures. Instead, we need to reach out and not be limited to our own cycles,&rdquo; Cho noted. &ldquo;We need to involve domestic medical experts and representatives of other pharma industry associations, incorporate industry opinions to better serve the health goals of China.&rdquo; </p> <p> <p> Such goals include the Health China 2020 project, established by the Ministry of Health. </p> <p> <p> The association has previously worked with the China Pharmaceutical Industry Association (CIPA) and Pharmaceutical Industry Research and Development Association (PhRDA), but the shift towards cooperation has become more pronounced since late 2013, when a nationwide compliance probe stormed through the industry (<a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2014/9/26/gsk-aftermath-industry-grapples-with-compliance-issues" target="_new">&quot;GSK Aftermath: Industry Grapples With Compliance Issues&quot; &mdash; PharmAsia News, Sep. 26, 2014 5:30 AM GMT</a>). </p> <p> <p> Since then, RDPAC has reached out and forged partnerships with more associations, including the China Physicians Association. In one effort, it initiated an alliance with nine domestic associations and proposed a new code of conduct for pharmaceutical sales. </p> <p> <p> There have certainly been hard lessons along the way, Cho acknowledged. But one thing is clear, the goal should not be the short-term interest of the industry, he emphasized. </p> <p> <h2> &lsquo;Not Just About CFDA&rsquo; </h2> <p> <p> While others are placing a heavy focus on China&rsquo;s healthcare reforms or the China FDA, Cho sees many other stakeholders that are just as important and need to be attended to. &ldquo;There are multiple stakeholders. For a certain issue, there may be as few as six or as many as 10. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;The regulatory reform is not just about CFDA or CDE [the Center for Drug Evaluation],&rdquo; he stressed. </p> <p> <p> One example cited by Cho is the regulation of generics. The China FDA has been swamped by a large volume of generic applications for a few large-selling drugs. Novartis AG&lsquo;s leukemia drug Gleevec (imatinib), for one, has seen three generic approvals and 63 makers are waiting for a nod. </p> <p> <p> In the U.S. and Japan, such redundant filings don&rsquo;t exist. That&rsquo;s because the FDA gives 180-day exclusivity to the generics maker who files the first abbreviated new drug approval (ANDA), and Japanese authorities usually price the first generics at 70% of the originator&rsquo;s current reimbursement price while the second copycat gets 80% of the first generic&rsquo;s price. This means late followers have fewer incentives to flock to make copies of a few best-sellers. </p> <p> <p> In comparison, such policies don&rsquo;t exist in China, because they are considered to be outside the jurisdiction of the China FDA, Cho noted. Effective change therefore means working across a broad range of bodies that hold responsibility for various policies. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;Addressing this multi-stakeholder issue means having aligned industry opinions that reflect the need to identify these stakeholders and communicate with them based on balanced and evidence-based suggestions,&rdquo; the executive said. </p> <p> <p> To that end, the association has been working with director level officials at the China FDA and is now moving to the ministerial level, he noted. </p> <p> <h2> Think Tanks And Academics </h2> <p> <p> Additionally, the role of think tanks and key expert opinion leaders is extremely important for issue advocacy in China. Because top level government officials have little time to think through an issue, they largely rely on think tanks and key academics for consultation. </p> <p> <p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thus vital to involve the think tanks and communicate the views of the trade association and get the views reflected in their recommendations and proposals,&rdquo; Cho emphasized. </p> <p> <p> One example is the China National Health Development Research Center, a think tank under the National Health and Family Planning Commission, which has been working with multinational drug makers on key issues including tiered hospital visits, hospital management and drug policy. </p> <p> <p> Another is the China Pharmaceutical Association (CPA), led by Sang Guowei, a former vice-chairman of the China National People&rsquo;s Congress, and the CPA&rsquo;s Research and Scientific Center has worked with RDPAC for years. </p> <p> <p> Additionally, in a bid to raise awareness of the role of multiregional clinical trials in China, RDPAC has engaged key medical experts, oncologists and endocrinologists to give interviews on the issue. </p>
