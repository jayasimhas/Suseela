<p>Both the commercial launch of Enanta Pharmaceuticals's first approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug &ndash; the paritaprevir component of the twice-daily, four-drug Viekira Pak &ndash; and the company's ability to advance additional drugs in the clinic are powered by a more than eight-year-old partnership with AbbVie.</p><p>Watertown, Massachusetts-based Enanta's president and CEO Jay Luly told Scrip during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco that his company needed a "prime partner" like AbbVie to steer Enanta's therapy through the complicated and competitive payer and commercial landscapes. The results of that collaboration &ndash; milestone fees and royalties from Viekira &ndash; are beginning to flow toward Enanta as it prepares to take new wholly-owned programs into clinical trials.</p><p><b>'Exciting' Viekira</b></p><p>The first few weeks since Viekira's US launch in December have been "exciting," Dr Luly said, which may be an understatement. </p><p>AbbVie has been ensnared in a battle with the HCV market leader Gilead Sciences to win exclusive or at least priority reimbursement from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and major health plans for their novel hepatitis C therapies, both of which cure most of the patients they treat.</p><p>"These are good cure rates; patients are getting therapies that are extraordinary. Not too long ago, patients were treated for 24 to 48 weeks and the side effects were horrible," Dr Luly said. "We're excited to participate in this first wave of all-oral [drug regimens]."</p><p>AbbVie negotiated exclusive coverage for genotype 1 HCV patients covered by the PBM Express Scripts in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-on-deal-for-AbbVies-Viekira-more-to-come-beyond-hepatitis-C-355807" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>). But Gilead negotiated two deals during the first week of January: exclusive agreements with the PBM CVS/Caremark for Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) and with the health plan Anthem for Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), which generated more than $7.3bn in sales during the first nine months of 2014 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gileads-CVS-exclusive-may-best-AbbVies-Express-Scripts-hepatitis-C-deal-355940" target="_new">6 January</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-gives-Viekira-dependent-2015-guidance-as-Anthem-chooses-Harvoni-356035" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>).</p><p>"That's why, for Enanta, it was key to have a prime partner," Dr Luly said.</p><p>The competition for exclusive deals seems to have cooled off almost as quickly as it heated up. Prime Therapeutics said recently that it negotiated a parity agreement, which gives the PBM's customers access to both AbbVie's and Gilead's HCV drugs at a substantial discount. </p><p>Gilead said on 13 January during the JP Morgan conference that both companies have a preference for parity agreements going forward (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JP-MORGAN-2015-Gilead-addresses-hepatitis-C-drug-payer-deals-356133" target="_new">14 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Sagient Research analyst Edny Inui said AbbVie's public comments during the JP Morgan event suggest that the Viekira launch is going as expected, including negotiations with payers for reimbursement. Some payers prefer exclusive arrangements and others want parity agreements, but the company is prepared to operate in a market with both types of deals.</p><p>AbbVie projected that about 135,000 to 150,000 patients will be treated with Viekira annually, potentially rising to 200,000. Sales are expected to be in the range of $2.5bn to $4bn annually. With an agreement to earn double-digit royalties on Viekira, a 10% royalty would give Enanta at least $250m in annual royalty revenue on top of milestone fees under AbbVie's sales forecast.</p><p>"It's early days and the only [prescription data] so far are for a couple of partial weeks. Even then, the data are not perfect. It will take a few weeks and months to know more," Dr Luly said.</p><p>Prior to earning any royalties, Enanta had $132m in cash as of 30 September, but the company earned a $75m milestone fee &ndash; almost half of the $155m in total approval milestones under its paritaprevir agreement with AbbVie &ndash; after Viekira's US FDA approval in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">20 December 2014</a>). Enanta stands to earn another undisclosed milestone fee based on European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval early this year.</p><p><b>Other HCV, pipeline programs</b></p><p>Viekira is comprised of three directing-acting antiviral (DAA) medicines, including Enanta's paritaprevir boosted by ritonavir. AbbVie is developing a product with two DAAs, including paritaprevir, for Japan and Enanta will earn another milestone fee from that program when it is endorsed by Japanese regulators in 2016.</p><p>AbbVie also is developing a second product with two DAAs &ndash; a once-daily, fixed-dosed combination pill (FDC) that will include ABT-493, Enanta's next-generation protease inhibitor, and AbbVie's next generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. Phase III clinical trials will begin this year with regulatory approvals expected in 2017 or 2018. Approval milestone fees related to ABT-493 total up to $80m.</p><p>"We have good economics driving wave four [of our HCV drug development], since we earn milestones and then the approvals turn on the royalty tap," Dr Luly said.</p><p>The milestone fees and royalties are funding Enanta's first wholly-owned programs, including an NS5A inhibitor known as EDP-239. The company also has a cyclophilin inhibitor program and an NS5B nucleotide inhibitor in preclinical development.</p><p>Novartis returned its rights to EDP-239 to Enanta in October when the Swiss company ended all hepatitis C drug development, but Phase I human proof-of-concept studies for the Enanta asset in genotype 1 HCV is ongoing (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-quits-hepatitis-C-354253" target="_new">2 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Enanta also is working on candidate selection for its cyclophilin and nucleotide polymerase inhibitors for HCV and the company has a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist in preclinical development for the liver diseases nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary billiary cirrhosis (PBC).</p><p>"Since we have gone public [in 2013], that has been a great opportunity to build the company to the next stage," Dr Luly said. "We are exploring other indications. We like virology and liver disease &#8230; hepatitis C is a good way to cut your teeth on the competitive landscape."</p><p><p><p><p>
