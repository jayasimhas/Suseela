<p>The history of the biotechnology sector is punctuated by binary events. These are mostly clinical or regulatory developments that result in big share price moves. Until recently, an IPO acted like a binary event with big upward share price moves on the first day of trading. What most investors do not realize is that that IPOs can be the result of months or even years of careful orchestration in order to get the story presented to investors straight, even if it is highly spun.</p><p>In Otonomy's case, the failure of its Phase IIb study of OTO-104 to hit the primary endpoint of reduction in vertigo frequency in MÃ©ni&egrave;re's disease patients <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Otonomy-drug-flunks-Phase-IIb-full-speed-ahead-to-Phase-III-358567" target="_new">was not called a failure by the company</a>, or the analysts Piper Jaffray. Rather, the failure was presented as a reason to blindly move into Phase III. The orchestrated story presented to investors was that the study 'barely missed the primary endpoint' with a p-value of 0.067. This p value implies that that there is a one in 15 chance that the efficacy of OTO-104 could have arisen by chance; well below the less than one in 20 bar of occurring by chance that the FDA requires to approve a drug. Whilst the analysts from Cowen and JP Morgan both described the OTO-104 trial result as disappointing, only the analysts from JP Morgan downgraded Otonomy to neutral. The analysts from Cowan were clearly reading from the same script as the company as they ignored the abject failure, kept their probability of success in Phase III unchanged and advised investors to 'buy into any weakness'. And indeed, weakness there was as investors ignored the orchestration by the company and its analysts and sent the share price down by about 20%. </p><p>On first blush, the reasonable amount of time expected by a company receiving binary event news to carefully word its press release so as not to mislead investors was sacrificed by Sarepta last week. Sarepta apparently reported its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarepta-rolls-with-eteplirsen-NDA-new-FDA-relationship-358527" target="_new">plans to submit a rolling NDA submission</a> for its experimental drug eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy within a day of its end of Phase II meeting with the FDA. It is customary to await the formal written meeting minutes from the agency before announcing the results of such a meeting, just in case, for example, the Sarepta attendees missed the phrase 'never in a thousand years' in their notes. But Sarepta seems to have eschewed such cautionary PR practices in its rush to orchestrate its announcement of an earlier NDA submission, probably as it had been trying everything in its power not to have the confirmatory clinical study that the FDA requested, included in the eteplirsen NDA. In this case, the orchestration seems to have achieved the desired result with the Sarepta share price finishing the week up over 70%. It may be a close run thing as to which binary event comes next, a secondary offering of Sarepta stock, or a 'clarification' once the formal FDA minutes have been received by the company.</p><p>The orchestration of IPOs by investment banks are perhaps the best example of how positive news can be stressed and negative news forgotten as investors are prepared to part with their shareholders' money in the months leading up to an IPO. In the case of the DNA-sequencing company Oxford Nanopore, the analysts from Cowen seemed to accelerate that process last week before the bad news leaked out. I first came across Oxford Nanopore way back in 2010 when it held out its investment by Illumina, the world's biggest DNA sequencing company, as validation of its approach to sequencing single DNA molecules as they pass through nanopores. Three years on and following Oxford Nanopore's announcement of the early access program for its MinION DNA sequencer on a USB stick, the company was offered, but declined the chance to headline an investor conference with an on-stage demonstration of its product. </p><p>Following the refusal of Illumina not only to follow its money in Oxford Nanopore, but to have entirely divested their holding in the company, by early this year, things seemed to have gone from bad to worse with the analysts at JP Morgan highlighting Oxford Nanopore's virtual absence from March's AGBT sequencing conference. So it was with some surprise that I saw that the analysts from Cowan producing a research report on the private Oxford Nanopore in response to a number of questions from investors on the company that day. Cowan's analysis went into some detail &ndash; an unbelievable feat of speed since investors' questions that morning were addressed by a report that would have taken days to research &ndash; but nevertheless omitted the important details arising from two publications on Oxford Nanopore's technology this year. Both demonstrated a high (38.2%) error rate in the sequence. For any clinical judgments, DNA sequence information with these errors would not be useful, however just think of where a small, cheap, fast DNA sequencer that could plug into your home PC would find a market. Coming to the Christmas lists of teenage geeks soon would be Oxford Nanopore's 'My Little DNA Sequencer' toy. </p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
