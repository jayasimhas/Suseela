<p>Under attack from Médecins Sans Fronti&egrave;res (MSF) over an allegedly unfair "anti-diversion" policy being proposed for Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) licensees, Gilead claims bulk of MSF's concerns are centred around a government sanctioned program in Egypt which requires certain patient details.</p><p>Gilead told <i>Scrip</i> that Egypt's ministry of health was purchasing Sovaldi for their national treatment programs that require proof of citizenship to enrol. </p><p>"Most of the information released by MSF pertains to a program in Egypt. The ministry of health and Gilead have implemented a distribution program that uses unique label codes to confirm that each bottle is received and returned by the patient to whom it is prescribed," Gilead said in response to queries from <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The US firm said that the code was encrypted and can only be read at the government health centre where the drug is dispensed. </p><p>"This also aids in compliance, as monitoring tests are regularly carried out independent of this process," it claimed. </p><p>Egypt is the first developing nation where Sovaldi became available and more than 40,000 hepatitis C patients have initiated treatment with Gilead drugs. The African nation expects to treat 300,000 patients each year. </p><p>Earlier this week, MSF claimed that under the US firm's anti-diversion program, treatment access requires the patient's name, with proof of identification, citizenship and residence as pre-requisites. This, it said, could see the exclusion of vulnerable and marginalized communities such as refugees, migrants and the homeless.</p><p>It has urged Indian licensees of Sovaldi to reject any anti-diversion plan that blocks patient access to generic versions of the drug at their forthcoming meeting with Gilead. </p><p>Indian industry sources told <i>Scrip</i> that an anti-diversion plan with access to patient data appeared "unworkable" in the Indian context and Gilead had set other conditions such as colour, shape, size and different packs to offset this.</p><p>An MSF statement, though, also notes that in Pakistan, discussions with the local supplier and Gilead had resulted in an agreement in principle on conditions that do not require provision of patient names. "However, the full range of conditions of the program will apply to the millions of other patients affected by HCV in Pakistan. It will be applied to individual patients who may be extremely disempowered and will be forced to agree to problematic conditions before they can access treatment," it said. </p><h2>Indian firms</h2><p>Gilead, though, did not immediately clarify the contours of its anti-diversion plan with licensees for Sovaldi and whether it could include similar patient detail requirements. </p><p>It only said that it was in discussions with its 11 generic partners to identify strategies that are appropriate for the 91 developing countries they serve.</p><p>"We will continue to seek input on all areas of our access program as it evolves, and make any improvements as needed".</p><p>In a previous interaction on how it expects to prevent potential suitcase exports of cut-price Sovaldi generics to the developed world, Gilead, though, told <i>Scrip</i>: "The licensees are committed to working with Gilead and its partners to design measures to ensure that these high value curative medicines are not diverted from their intended recipients and outside those countries in the agreements".</p><p>Last year Gilead entered into licensing deals with the seven India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 16 September 2014)</a>. Biocon and more recently Natco subsequently joined the list of licensees, with the latter receiving regulatory approval for a launch of its generic version in India <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Natco-gets-approval-for-first-Sovaldi-generic-in-India-357243%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 12 March 2015)</a>. On 17 March, Zydus Cadila announced the launch of its generic sofosbuvir in India.</p><h2>MSF argument</h2><p>But Gilead may be treading on tricky terrain, when it comes to issues around patient data, given the sensitivity around confidentiality of such records.</p><p>MSF claimed that Gilead's anti-diversion program requires patients and treatment providers in developing nations to comply with a "web of onerous and potentially harmful procedures" that allow the US firm to preserve its ability to charge exorbitant prices in developed countries - up to $1,000 per pill, or $84,000 per treatment course. Licensee Natco's generic sofosbuvir, to be marketed as Hepcinat and through strategic partners, is to be priced at an MRP of INR 19,900 ($317) for a bottle of 28 tablets [or around $11.3 per tablet].</p><p>"Gilead's programme violates patient privacy and autonomy, undermines confidentiality of patient data, introduces coercion and policing upon medical providers and may result in treatment interruptions for patients, leading to treatment resistance and failure," MSF said.</p><p>MSF said that the programme could "open the door" for Gilead or its distributors to collect sensitive data on patients and their clinical outcomes without their consent. </p><p>"One of the key questions is likely to be how confidentiality of patient records will be protected given that under the programme, Gilead may have access to prescriptions and other medical documents, which could include mental health diagnosis, HIV status, history of drug use and other sensitive information," the medical humanitarian organisation explained.</p><p>Among a string of other arguments on the issue, MSF has underscored that requirements on dispensation of the medicine should not exceed what regulatory authorities mandate for drugs to be sold or provided under prescription.</p>
