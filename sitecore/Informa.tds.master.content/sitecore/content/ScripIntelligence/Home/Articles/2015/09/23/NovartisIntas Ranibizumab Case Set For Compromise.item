<p>The Novartis-Intas wrangle over ranibizumab in India appears headed for a thaw, with both sides understood to be agreeable to an out-of-court settlement.</p><p>Novartis previously moved the Delhi High Court to block India's Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd from manufacturing and selling its version of ranibizumab under the Lumina trademark, which, the Swiss multinational seemed to suggest, rode on its well-documented "Luminous" study. </p><p>Novartis markets ranibizumab as <i>Lucentis</i> and <i>Accentrix</i> - both associated with the Luminous study.</p><p>Intas subsequently decided to stick to the "<i>Razumab</i>" trademark for its ranibizumab, in view of a previous court finding and "other relevant considerations."</p><p>Court documents dated earlier this month now show that both sides have been able to negotiate an out of court settlement, with their respective counsels suggesting that if granted specified time, they would be in a position to file a "compromise application."</p><p>Intas underscored that its "only dispute" with Novartis was concerning the trademark registration. </p><p>When asked about the compromise application and whether Novartis would be required to be compensated for any alleged passing off/dilution of its Luminous trademark, Intas told <i>Scrip</i> that by changing its brand name, it had entered into a settlement with Novartis, "without any liability for payment." </p><p>"Therefore, this matter is now settled for all practical purposes," Intas said.</p><p>Novartis declined to comment since the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.</p><h2>Case History</h2><p>The Novartis-Intas case has seen a series of brand name flip-flops.</p><p>Intas, whose original choice for its version of ranibizumab was apparently the "Razumab" trademark, appeared to have caught Novartis unawares when it exhibited the proposed launch of its ranibizumab under the trade mark Lumina at a conference organized by All India Ophthalmological Society earlier this year.</p><p>Novartis issued a legal notice to Intas in late March this year, but the latter declined to comply and instead went on to file a separate suit on the ground that the legal notice constituted "groundless threats" under Section 142 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 and should be injuncted.</p><p>In April this year, the Delhi High Court issued an interim order <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-curious-case-of-Luminous-ranibizumab-in-India-358596" target="_new">restraining Intas</a> from manufacturing, selling, advertising , etc pharmaceutical preparations of ranibizumab using the trade mark Lumina or any other mark "deceptively similar" to the trade mark Luminous. The court then observed that there appeared to be prima facie "structural and phonetic" similarity of the impugned trade mark Lumina with that of Luminous and also held that the balance of convenience was in Novartis's favour. </p><p>Intas had earlier told <i>Scrip</i> that the adoption of the Lumina trade name was based on the firm's "honest belief" that Novartis's Luminous was not a trademark.</p><h2>Capacity Constraints</h2><p>Meanwhile, Intas refuted concerns linking Razumab with inflammation in eyes in India.</p><p>Intas said that it had "not withdrawn" Razumab from the market, that there was "no quality related issue" in the product and that all the vials strictly adhere to the "pre-defined quality parameters." </p><p>The Ahmedabad-based firm said that the purity and potency of the product had been "extensively tested" and proven to be equivalent to innovator's product. </p><p>"The clinical trial involved more than 100 patients spread across 21 centers across India to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. Of these 76 patients were in the Razumab arm. All the patients on Razumab showed comparable vision gain and safety vis-a-vis the innovator's product. Clinical data was found acceptable to prove biosimilarity and safety and on this basis, Razumab was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India," Intas told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p> Intas, though, did admit that it was only providing Razumab to selective centers as there were "capacity constraints" at its manufacturing plant. </p><p>"This issue is also being addressed to increase production so more patients can avail this affordable medication. Thereafter, we will offer this product to the right doctors for treatment."</p><p>Reports in local media previously cited unnamed eye care physicians as saying that Razumab had caused eye inflammation in patients. Intas was reported to have attributed the reactions to "inadequate maintenance" of cold chain in its new distribution vertical.</p>
