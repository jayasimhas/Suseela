<p>The negative publicity Turing Pharmaceuticals AG has been garnering over the past month for its nearly 5,500% increase of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine), which quickly became a presidential election issue, has now grabbed the attention of antitrust investigators in New York.</p><p>Eric Stock, chief of the Antitrust Bureau at the State of New York Office of the Attorney General, told Turing CEO Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager, that his company "may be restraining competition unlawfully" by restricting the distribution of Daraprim.</p><p>Stock said his office had received reports that Turing is only distributing Daraprim through a small number of specialty pharmacies as part of a scheme to prevent generic manufacturers from obtaining access to samples of the drug for use in bioequivalency studies, which in turn inhibits the copycat firms from obtaining FDA approval to sell cheaper versions of the medicine. </p><p>Such actions, Stock said, "have the potential to greatly impede access to a drug that is critical for the public health" &ndash; the only medicine approved in the US to treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection often seen in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>"Indeed, your own company's public disclosures indicate Turing's restrictive distribution scheme for Daraprim may have already led to hospitals and clinics 'having trouble accessing the products,'" Stock said, telling Shkreli to "immediately" contact the New York antitrust official's office to "address these concerns." </p><p>Stock also advised the Turing chief to "retain all documents that are potentially relevant to this inquiry."</p><p>A spokesman for Turing told <i>Scrip</i> the company had no comment about Stock's letter and was instead focused on the firm's R&D efforts.</p><p><b>Swift Rebuke</b></p><p>Last month, Turing received <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">swift condemnation</a> when it was revealed the company had raised the price of Daraprim from about $13.50 per pill to $750 after acquiring the medicine in August from Impax Laboratories.</p><p>The criticism quickly spread on Twitter &ndash; where patients, doctors and advocates blasted Turing and dubbed Shkreli the "most hated man in America."</p><p>But it was a tweet from presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that caused a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">panic on Wall Street</a> on Sept. 21 &ndash; with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index immediately dropping, falling as low as 5.4%, before closing down 4.5%.</p><p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who also is running for president, has also been highly critical of Turing, calling the company's price hike for Daraprim "blatant profiteering."</p><p>Under pressure from the candidates, others in industry and consumer groups, Shkreli said he'd lower the price of Daraprim, although he's not yet done so, nor has he disclosed any details of that price adjustment.</p><p>In an Oct. 9 statement, Sanders jumped on Shkreli for not following through on his pledge to lower Daraprim's price and instead hiring an "army of new Washington lobbyists and lawyers to stem the massive fallout from his actions and to stymie congressional oversight" &ndash; asserting the Turing CEO was "holding hostage the patients who rely on this lifesaving medication, as well as the hospitals that administer it, by charging unconscionable prices for a drug on which he has a monopoly &ndash; just because he can."</p><p>In an Oct. 13 tweet, Shkreli insisted "the majority of our drug is sold at 0.01/pill." </p><p>Clinton and Sanders, he said, "hold uninformed views, which fall apart under any scrutiny.</p><p>Oddly enough, however, Shkreli had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Prices-Trade-Deal-Hot-For-1st-Democratic-Debate-361005" target="_new">tweeted the day before</a> that he planned to attend one of Sanders' New York rallies and even said in one tweet he thought the Vermont lawmaker "has some good points."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
