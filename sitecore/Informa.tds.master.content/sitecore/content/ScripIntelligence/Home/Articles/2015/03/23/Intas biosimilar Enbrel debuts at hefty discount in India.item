<p>Intas Pharmaceuticals has launched its cut-price etanercept, a biosimilar version of Amgen's TNF-inhibitor Enbrel, on the Indian market.</p><p>Intas' etanercept (marketed as Intacept), available in two strengths 25mg in 0.5ml and 50mg in 1.0ml preservative-free solution, joins Cipla's Etacept on the Indian market, though the latter is manufactured by Cipla's Chinese partner, Shanghai CP Guojian Pharmaceutical.</p><p>Intas told <i>Scrip</i> that Intacept 25mg in 0.5ml is priced at about INR3,250 ($51.8) per pre filled syringe &ndash; about 50% cheaper than the innovator product. Cipla's Etacept, launched in 2013, was then estimated to be about 30% less expensive than Enbrel <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cipla-Guojian-launch-first-biosimilar-Enbrel-in-India-342218%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 April 2013</a>). </p><p>The Ahmedabad-based Intas, which recently snapped up the hospitals business of Spain's Combino Pharm <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Intas-bolsters-European-hospitals-supplies-base-via-Spanish-deal-357361%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 18 March 2015)</a> expects revenues of around INR150m from Intacept in the first full year of launch.</p><p>More competition appears in store in the segment, though. Last year, Lupin formed a joint venture with Yoshindo specifically targeted at the biosimilars segment, with the Indian firm's biosimilar Enbrel being the first product to be licensed to the new JV <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Japan-firmly-in-Lupins-sights-with-Yoshindo-biosimilars-JV-351422%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 23 April 2014)</a>. </p><h2>Europe filing</h2><p>Intas, which has filed filgrastim and peg-filgrastim for registration in the US, also indicated that etanercept was one of the products under consideration for a filing in the EU and certain emerging markets. </p><p>Samsung Bioepis had earlier this year confirmed that it had filed a version of Enbrel in the EU - the first biosimilar etanercept to enter the regulatory review process there <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Samsung-Bioepis-confirms-it-filed-biosimilar-Enbrel-in-EU-356285%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 21 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>Intas's first biosimilar for global markets, Accofil (filgrastim), was launched in Europe in January this year.</p><p>Intas now has nine biosimilar products on the Indian market, including rituximab. Biosimilars currently account for about 9% of its domestic sales. The Intas group expects to close the year ending March 2015 with a turnover of about INR52bn.</p>
