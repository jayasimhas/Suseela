<p> The European Medicines Agency is to begin sharing its assessment reports on generic medicines with selected non-EU regulatory agencies as part of a drive to improve the efficiency of review processes and make it possible to synchronize marketing authorizations across different jurisdictions. </p><p> The move represents the latest stage of the International Generic Drug Regulators Programme (IGDRP), which was established in April 2012 amid increasing pressure on generic drug review programs worldwide in the form of growing workloads, more sophisticated generic products and increasingly complex supply chains. </p><p> The IGDRP is an international information and work sharing effort to increase regulatory convergence and co-operation among participating agencies by adopting harmonized guidance documents and similar regulatory practices and procedures. Key to its success, the organizers say, is the support of industry and other stakeholders interested in facilitating the timely approval of safe, effective and high-quality generics. </p><p> A central part of the initiative is a pilot project launched in July 2014 to encourage participating regions and countries to share real-time information on generic drugs under evaluation and make it easier for companies to have their products approved at roughly the same time in the different jurisdictions, while preserving scarce assessment resources at global level (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Generic-drug-makers-invited-to-trial-international-approval-pathway-353321" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 11 August). </p><p> At present, the pilot project involves the EU and four regulators &ndash; the Australian TGA, Health Canada, the Taiwan FDA and Swissmedic &ndash; although other members of the IGDRP, such as Brazil, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea, may decide to join at a later date. </p><p> The pilot was originally modeled on the EU's decentralized procedure (DCP), where a regulator in one member state produces an assessment report on a drug that is then sent to the other concerned member states for their own decisions on approval. Under the pilot, outputs from DCP assessments are intended to inform evaluations conducted by participating non-EU agencies, each of which would continue to take its own approval decisions. </p><h2> Extension to centralized procedure </h2><p> The pilot is now being extended to generic applications submitted through the centralised procedure: it will initially involve 10 products but this number could be increased if all goes well. </p><p> The aim is to establish a parallel review process for centrally submitted generics, with non-EU agencies carrying out their own separate but synchronized procedures for validating, assessing and approving/rejecting marketing authorization applications. Once the EMA's scientific committee (CHMP) has adopted the assessment report on a product, it will be shared with the other participating agencies. </p><p> Generics firms wanting to take part in this latest initiative and get their product approved both through the EU centralized procedure and in any of the other four countries need to have their applications in by 31 March. One of the participating agencies, Australia's TGA, said it encouraged eligible generics firms to &quot;consider taking part in this exciting and ground-breaking pilot program&quot;. </p><p> To qualify, companies must meet certain criteria, including filing their marketing approval applications &quot;in a synchronized manner&quot;, the EMA says. This means submitting the application at times defined by the participating non-EU agencies in relation to the time of filing of the CP application &quot;in a manner that best aligns the review process and the flow of information&quot;. This could be either simultaneous or sequential reviews. </p><p> Complete applications meeting the respective regulatory requirements must be filed with the agencies involved. Minor differences among the products filed in the different jurisdictions may be allowed as long as they do not affect safety, quality or efficacy, and companies must consent to the sharing of the EMA's assessment report with non-EU agencies. The assessment report produced by the CHMP will be shared with the other regulators at day 120 of the review process if the procedure ends at that point; if not, it will be shared at either day 180 or day 210. </p><p> The sharing of assessment reports on generics is one of the work packages of the IGDRP. Other areas of cooperation include work-sharing in the area of the active substance master file, inspection of sites conducting bioequivalence and bio-analytical studies, and information sharing on pharmaceutical quality issues. </p>
