<p>Sanofi's new CEO Olivier Brandicourt was able to report a strong set of first quarter results just a few weeks after taking the helm, which hardly seems fair to ousted CEO Chris Viehbacher. Sanofi's first quarter sales increased by 2% at constant exchange rates to &euro;8.8bn (12% on a reported basis owing to the weak euro), which was above analysts' expectations. However, its diabetes business is still a major concern.</p><p>Sanofi's growth was driven by Genzyme, which had sales of &euro;821m (+31%) with the help of Aubagio (+89% to &euro;170m), and Sanofi's animal health business which grew by 13% to &euro;658m. </p><p>However, the US diabetes franchise &ndash; one of the root causes of Viehbacher's dismissal &ndash; continues to disappoint. Lantus sales dropped 5% "due to the expected rebates required to maintain favorable formulary positions with key payers for contracts that started 1 January 2015," said Sanofi. The firm secured approval of its Lantus follow-up Toujeo in the US in February and "full launch activities in the US market commenced at the end of March." However, the major disappointment was the inhaled insulin therapy Afrezza (developed by Mannkind), which was launched in the US in February but has since seen just &euro;1m in sales.</p><p>During the conference call, Sanofi's head of commercial operations Peter Guenter said that the company's market share of the basal insulin market had stabilized at around 69%, so it has "a stable base now for the Toujeo launch." He wouldn't provide details on pricing but said Sanofi "continue[s] to be absolutely convinced that the switch rate of Lantus to Toujeo will beat the consensus." Sanofi is maintaining its long-term diabetes guidance of "flat to slightly growing."</p><p>Dr Brandicourt, on his first conference call as CEO of Sanofi after joining from Bayer, said he was "privileged to be here representing a company with such a long-standing history of success in healthcare" and it had been "a great first few weeks, providing me with many insights."</p><p>His near term priorities are to lead the company through "a strategic review of its businesses, which is already underway" and he was also "intensely focused on the successful launch of multiple new medicines and vaccines." He also plans to "continue the strong momentum in R&D and focus on driving innovation." </p><p><b>Related stories</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-reveals-Brandicourts-pay-deal-356920" target="_new">Sanofi reveals Brandicourt's pay deal</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Viehbacher-received-3m-payoff-from-Sanofi-356344" target="_new">Viehbacher received &euro;3m payoff from Sanofi</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-wins-US-approval-for-Lantus-follow-up-Toujeo-356952" target="_new">Sanofi wins US approval for Lantus follow-up Toujeo</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-confirms-down-sizing-of-oncology-efforts-356729" target="_new">Sanofi confirms 'down-sizing' of oncology efforts</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Euro-helps-Sanofi-deliver-as-CEO-hunt-nears-end-356574" target="_new">Euro helps Sanofi deliver as CEO hunt nears end</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sanofi-launches-inhaled-insulin-Afrezza-in-US-356523" target="_new">Sanofi launches inhaled insulin Afrezza in US</a></p>
