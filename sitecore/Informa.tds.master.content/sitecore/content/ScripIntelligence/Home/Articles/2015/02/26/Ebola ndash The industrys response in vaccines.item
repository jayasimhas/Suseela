<p>The latest Ebola epidemic, which the WHO says has now claimed more than 9,600 lives, has focused attention on the long-term need for a prophylactic vaccine to prevent future outbreaks of this size. </p><p>Though no vaccine will be ready in time to have an impact on the current epidemic, having an effective vaccine product is essential to tackle the virus if it becomes endemic in these areas, especially given the high mortality rates associated with the infection. </p><p>There are no ready-made mock-ups for Ebola as there are for flu, and developing a novel vaccine is complicated enough even when using an established platform. Many of the potential candidates are using relatively new platforms and experts say this creates some additional steps before safety can be demonstrated for use in healthy populations. </p><p>Encouragingly large-scale clinical studies have now begun with the more advanced candidates. Here <i>Scrip</i> surveys the vaccines known to be in development against the filovirus (antiviral products were dealt with in a parallel piece, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola---the-industrys-response-in-antivirals-356934" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 25 February 2015</a>).</p><p>There appear to be around 23 prophylactic vaccine candidates being investigated, with some already being tested against each other in clinical trials and others being tested sequentially in a prime-boost approach to eliciting an immune response. The majority are still at the preclinical stage and, as can be seen, are using a range of potential vectors. </p><table><h2>Prophylactic vaccine products in development against Ebola</h2><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Vaccine</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Mechanism</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Stage and further information</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>NewLink Genetics and Merck & Co's vesicular stomatitis virus Ebola vaccine/rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine </p><p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Ebola vaccine, expressing the envelope glycoprotein of the Zaire Ebola strain.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Phase II/III </b>&ndash; The 27,000-patient Phase II/III PREVAIL (Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia) trial has begun to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two investigational vaccines intended to prevent Ebola virus infection: NewLink/Merck's VSV-ZEBOV investigational Ebola vaccine, and the NIAID/GSK's investigational Ebola vaccine (see below).

Immunovaccine is working with researchers at the NIH on the planning and ramp-up of additional studies of DPX-Ebola with data from these studies expected in 2015. These new data are expected to support advancing DPX-Ebola into human studies.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Greffex's Ebola vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Using its GREVAX universal platform of small synthetic nanoparticles of genes packaged in an adenoviral shells.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; In October, Greffex said it had designed a trivalent engineered Ebola-Marburg vaccine (GreEMTri) that carries glycoprotein genes of the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV), the Sudan Ebola virus (SEBOV) and the Marburg virus (MV). It targets three different viruses with a single vector. Standardized production schemes have been established so that millions of doses of GreEMTri can be delivered within six months.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>FIT Biotech and Icosagen Ebola vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>FIT Biotech is developing an Ebola vaccine for prevention and antibody therapy. It is based on Gene Transport Unit (GTU) technology allowing induction of passive as well as active immunotherapy.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; FIT Biotech and Icosagen said in October that the clinical stage is planned to start in 2016 at the latest. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>GeoVax's GOVX-301</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GOVX-E301 uses GeoVax's recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platform to expresses virus-like particles (VLPs) in the person being vaccinated. It is being developed as a monovalent vaccine for the Zaire strain of Ebola, the virus responsible for the current outbreak.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; GeoVax says it has successfully designed its MVA-based vaccine vector for the Zaire strain of Ebola using the most current genetic sequences from the ongoing epidemic. It has now demonstrated that its vaccine produces VLPs in vaccine-expressing human cells, an important milestone in the vaccine's development. GeoVax believes that MVA-expressed VLPs, which display the virus's surface protein (glycoprotein), will be highly effective at eliciting antibody capable of preventing and controlling Ebola virus infections. GeoVax's goals for 2015 include completion of initial immunogenicity studies in small animals, followed by proof-of-concept challenge studies. The company expects to begin challenge studies in non-human primates in late 2015. Simultaneously, GeoVax will be advancing its vaccine manufacturing and test methods, with the goal of initiating human clinical testing in 2016.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>GeoVax's GOVX-E302</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GOVX-E302 is a recombinant MVA vaccine designed to produce non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying the Ebola virus glycoprotein, under development by GeoVax for routine immunization and designed to protect against all three versions of Ebola known to be lethal in humans (Zaire, Sudan and Bundibugyo). GOVX-E302 is anticipated to be used in a two-dose regimen.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; see above. The company says it has now made its Ebola program a top priority for allocation of internal resources.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pentamer Pharmaceuticals' NoBola vaccine </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Using its NodaVax technology against Ebola virus infection. It consists of genetically engineering the chimeric viral-like particle protein to contain key Ebola epitopes that stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; The NoBola vaccine is currently in the preclinical development phase that includes efficacy studies in the lab and in animal models. Successful completion of this phase would allow for a large scale Ebola challenge trial in non-human primates in collaboration with the US government followed by a fast-track approach with the FDA to get the vaccine available to the public as quickly as possible given the urgent need. Upon successful initial testing, Pentamer hopes to receive funding from the Department of Defense's Defense Threat Reduction Agency for continued testing.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novartis's Ebola vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Using its RNA-based vaccine and small molecule TLR7 agonist technologies.</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Preclinical</b> &ndash; Novartis is undertaking work with scientists at the USAMRIID to assess a new technology for its potential to provide a vaccine candidate or treatment of Ebola. This work is still in early stages of preclinical research and, even if it is successful, it will likely take several years for any treatments to be ready for large scale clinical trials. According to the IFPMA, Novartis's RNA-based vaccine and small molecule TLR7 agonist technologies have demonstrated proof of concept in animal models at preventing and treating lethal Ebola virus infections, respectively. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Tianjin CanSino Biotechnology, the Bioengineering Institute of China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences and the Beijing institute of Biotechnology's Ad5-EBOV vaccine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>An Ebola adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad5-EBOV).
