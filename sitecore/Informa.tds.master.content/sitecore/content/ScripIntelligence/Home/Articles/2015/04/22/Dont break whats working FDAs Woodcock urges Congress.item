<p>As Congress considers actions to better enable the progress of US biomedical innovation, Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), pleaded "don't break what is working," but instead, "improve on the current system."</p><p>"We do need to continue to improve the efficiency of drug development if we are going to continue to get drugs to patients rapidly and affordably," Dr Woodcock told members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee during a 28 April hearing.</p><p>But, she said, "as we say in medicine, first do no harm."</p><p>"When CDER receives a large number of unfunded mandates, our attention can be diverted and review performances suffer," Dr Woodcock warned.</p><p>Indeed, she noted that while the <i>FDA Amendment Act of 2007</i> gave the agency many new authorities, such as the ability to force, rather than negotiate, safety labeling changes and require postmarketing studies, the law also resulted in a dip in the FDA's performance in meeting its <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> application review goals. </p><p>Dr Woodcock provided a chart to the HELP Committee that showed the FDA was meeting its 90% application review goals, and then some, in the two-and-a-half years before FDAAA was implemented. But shortly after the law was enacted, the performance percentages fell into the 80s &ndash; even dropping into the high 70s during the second fiscal quarter of 2009 &ndash; before recovering in 2010, although there was one slight dip again in the second quarter of that year. </p><p>The Senate HELP Committee is in the early stages of putting together legislation, known as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senators-jump-on-accelerating-cures-bandwagon-356448" target="_new">Healthier Americans</a>, aimed at overhauling the US biomedical enterprise, including the processes and activities of the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) &ndash; something the House Energy & Commerce Committee has been working on for the past year under the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Upton-hopes-for-Cures-deal-by-late-April-357997" target="_new">21st Century Cures</a> initiative.</p><p>"Our purpose here is to enable you, not to slow you down," Senator Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee), chairman of the HELP Committee, said in trying to assure Dr Woodcock. </p><p>He acknowledged that in the committee, there's "a feast of well-intentioned good ideas here and they come from all directions &ndash; from the right and the left."</p><p>But, Senator Alexander said, "We want to align federal policies and that means our laws and our regulations, with an opportunity for more, not less, safety innovations."</p><p>The lawmaker called on FDA and NIH to "form your own internal red team for red tape" to see if there are any laws and regulations or even requirements from the White House Office of Management and Budget the agencies think are nonproductive. And if so, "let us know, because this train is going to get to the station," Senator Alexander said.</p><p>"We are working with the House and with the president and this is an opportunity to clear the clutter out of the way and to take advantage of a rapidly changing landscape," he said.</p><p>Dr Woodcock explained that while there are a large number of innovative new medicines being approved and in the pipeline, "drug development costs too much and takes too long."</p><p>"This is mainly caused by the high failure rate," Dr Woodcock said, noting that even for the drugs that make it to human testing, eight out of 10 fail.</p><p>But, she said, that failure is not due to the FDA's requirements, "but because they don't work, or because they're too toxic or they're no better than existing drugs."</p><p>"The limitations are related primarily to the science," Dr Woodcock said. </p><p>While the FDA has been working "for quite some time" on improving the infrastructure that is used to move products to the marketplace, she said there are many areas that could be improved.</p><p>For instance, Dr Woodcock said, one thing that is sorely needed is better identification of new biomarkers &ndash; a challenge she said the FDA currently is pursuing with "many consortia." </p><p>The establishment of clinical trials networks also is critical, "so that each clinical trial isn't set up separately at great expense and time and then taken down," only to have nothing come from the majority of those studies, she said.</p><p>The electronic collection of data from studies and elsewhere also needs to be streamlined, Dr Woodcock said.</p><p>"There are quite a number of things that can be done that I wouldn't underestimate the difficulty of doing each one of them," she said. "They are scientific problems and they need collective solutions." </p><p>Senator Alexander urged Dr Woodcock and other FDA and NIH officials at the hearing to provide Congress with specific suggestions lawmakers could address to "enable you to do your jobs."</p><p>"We don't want to produce a bill that reduces your productivity. We'd like to increase it," he said. </p><p>But at the hearing, Senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat-Massachusetts) again, as she had earlier done, raised the issue of how the mandates will be <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Warren-picks-fight-with-Cures-author-over-NIH-funding-357475" target="_new">paid for</a> that the Senate and House include in their legislation &ndash; something she's insisted has yet to be addressed.</p><p>Already Congress has let funding for US basic research drop over the past decade.</p><p>"Medical research funding in this country is in crisis," Senator Warren argued. "It is irresponsible and shortsighted, not prudent, to let financing for basic research dwindle."</p><p>Many of the drugs on the US market today, Senator Warren said, &ldquo;were based on scientific insights gained through NIH or other publicly funded research.&rdquo;</p><p>"It's a fact," Dr Christopher Austin, director of the NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, declared in agreeing with the Massachusetts senator. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
