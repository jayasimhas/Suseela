<p>Celgene has been slapped with a poor benefit rating for psoriasis drug Otezla (apremilast) in Germany after failing to submit necessary data comparing the drug to other available therapies. </p><p>Germany's Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) said as a treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients, Otezla showed "no added benefit" over currently available products. </p><p>IQWiG said it examined two dossiers to determine whether Celgene's drug provided benefits over the respective comparator therapies, but neither dossier contain the relevant data for this assessment. The comparator drugs considered included AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab), Johnson & Johnson's Stelara (ustekinumab) and Simponi (golimumab), infliximab and etanercept. </p><p>The HTA said Celgene "only described data from placebo-controlled studies, but did not use them for indirect comparisons." IQWiG added that, "Consistently, the manufacturer itself did not claim an added benefit for the new drug in any of the two therapeutic indications."</p><p>Celgene got the nod to launch Otezla in Europe in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-and-Celgene-get-EU-approval-for-novel-psoriasis-therapies-356218" target="_new">January this year</a> specifically for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who have failed to respond to systemic therapy and for psoriatic arthritis in adults who fail on non-biological DMARDs. At the time, Datamonitor Healthcare lead analyst Jacoba Procter said "efficacy data has been underwhelming such that, despite the advantage of an oral formulation, Otezla will struggle to see uptake at later lines of treatment."</p><p>Otezla is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). It is only currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis but Celgene is testing the drug in a number of other indications, including: Phase III trials in ankylosing spondylitis and Beh&ccedil;et syndrome; and Phase II trials in ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies of the drug in asthma were suspended in 2005. </p><p>For a detailed breakdown of the anti-inflammatory area, see <i>Scrip's</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/multimedia/archive/00248/world-of-inflammat_248471a.html" target="_new">World of Inflammation dashboard</a>.</p>
