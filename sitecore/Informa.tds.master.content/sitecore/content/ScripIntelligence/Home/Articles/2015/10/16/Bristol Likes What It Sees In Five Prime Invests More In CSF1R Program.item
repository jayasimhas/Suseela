<p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is upping its commitment to Five Prime Therapeutics Inc. and the antibody developer&rsquo;s colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) antibody program with a new global licensing deal announced Oct. 15. </p><p>The deal replaces an existing clinical collaboration between the two companies signed in November 2014 to study Five Prime&rsquo;s lead CSF1R antibody FPA008 in combination with Bristol&rsquo;s PD-1 inhibitor <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) in six cancer indications, suggesting the two companies want to move even more aggressively to develop the therapy. </p><p>&ldquo;What triggered this was our mutual enthusiasm about the way the trial was going and our mutual enthusiasm about the prospects,&rdquo; Five Prime CEO Lewis &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Williams said in a same-day conference call. Plus, he noted, Bristol offered deal terms that made it hard for Five Prime to refuse. </p><p>&ldquo;We were pretty clear with Bristol and other parties that it would take an extraordinary situation for us to consider out-licensing this, and we did hit those terms with Bristol,&rdquo; Williams added. The company&rsquo;s stock shot up 65% following the announcement to close Oct. 15 at $27.93. </p><p><b>Five Prime Retains Certain Development Rights To FPA008</b></p><p>Under the new agreement, Bristol agreed to pay $350m upfront, as well as up to $1.05bn in development and regulatory milestones for each anti-CSF1R product that is developed in oncology indications, and $340m in development and regulatory milestones for each candidate in non-oncology indications. Bristol also agreed to pay double-digit royalties on sales of any products that reach the market. </p><p>But importantly, the deal allows Five Prime to continue developing FPA008 independently in combinations with its own internal immuno-oncology assets and in trials for pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), a pivotal component that swayed Five Prime&rsquo;s decision to move forward with a licensing deal. </p><p>Bristol will be responsible for development and manufacturing of FPA008 for all indications, except for Five Prime&rsquo;s option to conduct certain independent studies. Bristol will be responsible for global commercialization, but Five Prime will retain a US co-promotion option. </p><p>Under the November 2014 agreement, Bristol and Five Prime agreed to study Opdivo and FPA008 in combination in a Phase Ia/Ib study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer and malignant glioma. Bristol made a one-time $30m payment to Five Prime under that arrangement and agreed to pick up the study costs, and it gained a time-limited right of first refusal if Five Prime decided to seek a partner for FPA008. </p><p>Five Prime is leading the Phase Ia/Ib trial, which it initiated in September, and will continue to see that study through to completion. The company said it expects to complete the Phase Ia portion of the trial in early 2016 and move into Phase Ib. The company is also continuing a Phase I/II trial in PVNS but will not proceed with additional studies in rheumatoid arthritis, where it was originally studying the drug. PVNS is a rare disease characterized by proliferation of synovial tissue in the joint and tendon sheath that can be aggressive and disabling. </p><p>Roche is also developing the CSF1R antibody RG7155 and presented Phase I data from a proof of mechanism study in PVNS at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June. </p><p>Inhibiting CSF1R reduces the number of immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, facilitating an immune response against tumors. It works in a complementary manner to PD-1/L1 inhibitors, which work by lifting an important break on the immune system. </p><p>Immuno-oncology leaders like Bristol, Roche and Merck & Co. Inc. are working feverishly to determine the best potential combinations in the hopes of uncovering durable treatment responses. </p><p>South San Francisco-based Five Prime first partnered with Bristol in March 2014 to study checkpoint inhibitor targets, with Bristol agreeing to pay $20 million upfront and $21 million for a 4.9% equity stake in the company.</p><p>Deal-making in the field of immuno-oncology has been happening at a feverish clip over the last 12 months as drug makers look to advance their position in the competitive field. But deals have focused primarily on broad long-term collaborations rather than outright M&A, partly because of the level of investment and expertise required and high valuations for companies.</p><p>Bristol completed the most expensive acquisition in immuno-oncology this year with its acquisition of Flexus Biosciences Inc. for $800 million upfront plus $450 million in earn-outs, announced in February.</p><p><p><p>
