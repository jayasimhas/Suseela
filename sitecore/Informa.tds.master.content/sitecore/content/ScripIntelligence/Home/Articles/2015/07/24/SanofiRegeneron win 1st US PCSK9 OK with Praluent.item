<p>Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on 24 July pulled off the first US approval of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor &ndash; gaining the FDA's nod for Praluent (alirocumab).</p><p>The drug is approved by the FDA for use with diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy in adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) &ndash; a genetic condition that causes unusually high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; or patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as heart attacks or strokes, who require additional lowering of LDL-C.</p><p>Sanofi and Regeneron set the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) for Praluent at $40 per day, or $1,120 every 28 days &ndash; about $14,600 per year &ndash; for both the 75mg and 150mg doses, which the firms said made their drug the "lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal antibody therapy on an annualized basis." </p><p>Wall Street analysts, who had expected a lower price of closer to $10,000-$12,000, perceived the indication as a fairly broad label, although it was not as broad as Sanofi and Regeneron had hoped, and anticipated Praluent to be used even beyond what it is approved for in the US &ndash; something that's been a big concern for payers.</p><p>Indeed, before Praluent's price was even known, pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and CVS <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CVS-takes-aim-at-PCSK9s-costs-could-dwarf-HCV-meds-356803" target="_new">declared war</a> on the expected costs for PCSK9 inhibitors &ndash; arguing the volume of patients anticipated to use the drugs could sink the US healthcare system.</p><p>But Sanofi and Regeneron officials argued the actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be well lower than the WAC pricing after discounts and rebates.</p><p>"Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary depending on insurance status and eligibility for patient assistance," the firms said.</p><p>The companies also said they did not expect all of the 8-10 million patients eligible for Praluent under the FDA-approved labeling would be candidates for the drug for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Louisa Joseph, an analyst with <i>Scrip </i>affiliate <i>Datamonitor</i>, anticipated that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Praluent-Repatha-FDA-guinea-pigs-to-market-trailblazers-359580" target="_new">uptake</a> of PCSK9 inhibitors likely would be rapid within the high-risk familial hypercholesterolemia population.</p><p>The consistent positive safety and efficacy results from the drugs' Phase II and III trials likely will drive prescribing in those high-risk patients, in which statins generally are less effective, Ms Joseph said. </p><p><b>CHMP recommendation</b></p><p>Regeneron and Sanofi were blessed with other good news on 24 July &ndash; winning a positive opinion for marketing authorization of Praluent from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), which said the drug also should be used in certain adult patients with hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>Specifically, CHMP recommended Praluent at the 75mg and 150mg doses be approved to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia &ndash; HeFH and non-familial &ndash; or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet. In patients unable to reach their LDL-C goals with a maximally tolerated statin, Praluent would be used in combination with a statin, with or without other lipid-lowering therapies. In patients who are statin intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated, Sanofi's and Regeneron's drug would be used alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. </p><p>The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the Praluent marketing authorization application in the European Union in late September. </p><p><b>Competition</b></p><p>Earlier this week, the European Commission surprised everyone by granting Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Surprise-as-Amgen-pips-RegeneronSanofi-to-first-PCSK9-inhibitor-approval-359541" target="_new">approval</a> with a broad label.</p><p>But Amgen is waiting in the wings in the US, where its <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> action date is set at 27 August.</p><p>Praluent's nod came right on time on 24 July, the PDUFA the FDA had set for the drug.</p><p>Not far behind the two leaders is Pfizer's bococizumab.</p><p>With Praluent's and Repatha's safety and efficacy profiles comparable throughout the clinical trials, <i>Datamonitor's</i> Ms Joseph said being <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Praluent-Repatha-FDA-guinea-pigs-to-market-trailblazers-359580" target="_new">first to the US market</a> would help Sanofi's and Regeneron's PSCK9 gain a stronger foothold before Repatha is approved.</p><p>If the PCSK9s do well in the cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs), which will determine whether the drugs actually prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks, strokes and CV-related death, Praluent and potentially the other medicines in the class could garner much broader labels in the US.</p><p>Amgen has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">fully enrolled</a> its 27,500-patient CVOT, known as FOURIER, and anticipates results in 2017 &ndash; around the same time Sanofi and Regeneron are expecting data from their 18,000-patient CVOT, known as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES.</p><p>Last month, a panel of FDA advisers said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Praluent</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Repatha</a> should be limited to certain groups, like adults with HeFH and those at high CV risk where statins are not enough.</p><p>They also said they were comfortable with the term "maximally tolerated statin therapy."</p><p>In an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-panels-Nissens-take-358915" target="_new">interview last month</a>, Dr Steven Nissen, chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University, told <i>Scrip </i>the FDA's and its advisers' "emphasis on statins first" was the "appropriate" and "responsible" approach.</p><p>The FDA's advisers also unanimously backed the use of Amgen's Repatha in patients a more rare form of FH, known as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia &ndash; an indication Sanofi and Regeneron have not yet sought.</p><p>The FDA's decision and CHMP's opinion for Praluent were based on the results from Sanofi's and Regeneron's ODYSSEY program, which includes 14 global Phase III trials involving more than 23,500 patients.</p><p>Participants taking Praluent in the studies submitted to the FDA had an average reduction in LDL-C ranging from 36% to 59%, versus placebo, US regulators said.</p><p>"Despite statins and other lipid-lowering therapies, many patients are unable to reach their LDL cholesterol goals, and may benefit from new therapeutic options such as Praluent," said Dr Elias Zerhouni, president of global R&D at Sanofi and the former head of the National Institutes of Health.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
