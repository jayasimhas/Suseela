<p>Astellas's overactive bladder drug, mirabegron, appears to have failed to pass muster in India, after an expert panel held that its efficacy mirrored that of placebo.</p><p>Indications are that the office of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had sought a clarification regarding the efficacy of the drug over placebo for the applied indication and Astellas is said to have presented its justification in the case.</p><p>However, the concerned Subject Expert Committee (SEC) deliberated the matter in detail and opined that the efficacy of mirabegron was "similar to the placebo" in the Indian subset analysis.</p><p>"Hence the committee is of the opinion that marketing approval should not be given to the firm based on the above fact," the SEC (reproductive and urology) recommended at its meeting on 29 April. </p><p>Astellas did not immediately respond to emails from <i>Scrip</i> on the issue.</p><p>Details on India's clinical trial registry indicate an Astellas Phase III study of YM178 (the code name for mirabegron) in subjects with symptoms of overactive bladder. The randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo and active controlled, multi-center study involved 333 subjects in the country.</p><p>Applications of clinical trials and new drugs are initially evaluated by SECs (previously referred to as new drugs advisory committees) in India, under a three-tier review. The recommendations of the SECs are then reviewed by a technical committee and finally cleared by the apex committee in accordance with previous Supreme Court order. </p><p>India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in a previous update on steps initiated to make its services "responsive, efficient and transparent" had indicated that such SECs <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Brick-by-brick-India-is-restoring-clinical-trials-parity-357208%5d" target="_new">had evaluated</a> 201 of the 254 applications during the first two months of 2015. </p><h2>SEC's approach</h2><p>Industry experts tracking the mirabegron application, though, have questioned the SEC's approach and claim that the efficacy aspect should not be judged, in this case, by just the data pertaining to the Indian subset.</p><p>"There is a particular number that has to be recruited and analyzed before you can make a conclusive statement on whether it is better or worse than placebo&#8230;. and that number in this study was 1,300," the expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The expert added that if the Indian regulator was expecting that Indian data should show efficacy, then the numbers [trial subjects] recruited in India would have had to be much higher. </p><p>"If you were to do that in all countries then the concept of a global trial crashes. Then you need to recruit 1,300 patients in every country of the world. "</p><p>The expert explained that while an Indian subset analysis may not be an appropriate indicator as far as efficacy is concerned, adverse events are not based on the number of patients.</p><p>"Side-effects may happen more frequently in one particular sub-group. So you can conclude on safety matters but not really on efficacy matters with a smaller number than what the study was powered for," the expert explained.</p><p>The expert claimed that Astellas could potentially, informally, approach the regulator to explain the situation and seek a review, though it is not immediately clear if the Japanese firm does intend to seek a review or if it has already done so.</p><p>Mirabegron was approved in Japan in 2011 under the brand name Betanis, and <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/US-approval-sets-up-Astellas-overactive-bladder-drug-for-second-launch-332277%5d" target="_new">in the US</a> in 2012 as Myrbetric. The <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/EMA-approves-Betmiga-extends-Zytiga-label-339066%5d" target="_new">EU gave its approval</a> in 2013. Last year, however, the German health technology appraisal body, IQWiG, held that mirabegron showed <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/IQWiG-rejects-Astellass-Betmiga-for-overactive-bladder-353731%5d" target="_new">no additional benefit</a> over comparators. </p>
