<p>In a 344-77 vote on 10 July, the US House passed legislation intended to overhaul the US biomedical enterprise, with the aim of accelerating the discovery, development and approval processes for medical products &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i> (HR 6).</p><p>The House action won the immediate praise of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Biotechnology Industry Organization and a slew of patient advocacy groups.</p><p>While the bill's adoption was widely expected, the big question that faced the legislation when it reached the House floor after more than a yearlong effort was whether lawmakers would back a "poison pill" amendment added earlier in the week from Representative Dave Brat (Republican-Virginia), which sought to make the proposed $8.75bn for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and $550m for the FDA &ndash; the so-called NIH and Cures Innovation Fund &ndash; discretionary spending rather than mandatory, which would put the funding under annual congressional scrutiny and subject to budget caps.</p><p>The day before the vote, the Brat amendment appeared to be picking up steam &ndash; especially from fiscal conservatives.</p><p>But in the end, the Virginia lawmaker fell short, getting only 141 House members on his side &ndash; all Republicans &ndash; with 281 voting against the measure, including 100 from his own party.</p><p>Nonetheless, Representative Brat said he took the claim about his measure being a poison pill as a "compliment."</p><p>"A poison pill was reserved for the man who brought human reason to Greece. Greece. I similarly would like to bring a bit of reason to bear on the budget process of the United States," Mr Brat declared on the House floor on 10 July.</p><p>While "we all want cures," Mr Brat said, in economics "rationality requires that we rank our preferences in order and fund the best programs."</p><p>"There is no discipline up here in this city. We just fund everything and hand the bill to the next generation," he contended.</p><p>While Representative Tom Price (Republican-Georgia), a doctor, said the goals of the Cures bill were "laudable," he said the mandatory spending for the legislation was "troubling and unnecessary." "There's no reason that these programs could not be authorized and then made, appropriately, a priority through the discretionary spending process," Representative Price argued.</p><p>Representative Tom McClintock (Republican-California) insisted the greatest danger facing the US right now is its national debt, which "now exceeds our entire economy" &ndash; with the nation spending $230bn in interest alone. </p><p>"Behold the chaos in Greece and consider that our nation is not far behind," Representative McClintock said. </p><p>While HR 6 "makes many worthy changes in law," he asserted it "evades the discipline the budget requires to save our country from the fate of Greece."</p><p>Representative Brat's amendment, Mr McClintock said, would have placed the Cures bill "back within the boundaries" of the budget "Congress has labored mightily to enact," which he said aims to save the US from a "dismal future."</p><p>"Will we fund our priorities responsibly or follow Greece to ruin?" he asked.</p><p>"Nothing lasts longer in life than a temporary government program," said Representative Darryl Issa (Republican-California), who called the Cures bill's pay-fors &ndash; particularly the plan to sell crude oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) &ndash; "fraudulent" and a "gimmick."</p><p>The version of HR6 that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">unanimously passed</a> the House Energy & Commerce Committee in May called for the Department of Energy to sell 8 million barrels of crude oil from the reserve per year over eight years &ndash; or 64 million barrels.</p><p>But <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-pharma-losers-in-latest-Cures-maneuvering-359238" target="_new">last-minute changes</a> that showed up in the bill when it was reported to the House Rules Committee on 2 July pumped the barrels of oil up to 80 million, which Representative Fred Upton (Republican-Michigan), chairman of the House E&C Committee, insisted was necessary to meet the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-to-cost-106.4bn-exclusivity-ups-health-costs-359093" target="_new">cost estimates</a> provided by the Congressional Budget Office &ndash; the agency that provides nonpartisan budgetary advice to Congress.</p><p>Mr Upton said it also was necessary to trim the NIH funds from $10bn to $8.75bn &ndash; a move that caught Democrats off guard and a revelation about which they were none-too happy, but said they'd work with their Republican colleagues to preserve the originally agreed-on amount.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-Cures-bill-responsibilities-exceed-FDA-resources-359315" target="_new">White House</a> also has had reservations about the plan to use the SPR oil to pay for Cures, but has not threatened a veto of the legislation, whose companion bill from the Senate &ndash; which is only in the early stages of being developed &ndash; may end up changing how Congress ultimately cover the costs.</p><p>The White House also said the $550m in Cures would <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-Cures-bill-responsibilities-exceed-FDA-resources-359315" target="_new">not be enough</a> to fully fund the added responsibilities the legislation puts on the FDA.</p><p>Other pay-for changes made to the House bill after it left the E&C Committee included nixing a plan to change the timing of reinsurance payments to Medicare Part D drug plans &ndash; a change that demonstrated the Washington lobbying power, yet again, of the insurance industry, which stood to lose a bundle of money.</p><p>The lawmakers are looking instead to the biopharmaceutical industry to make up some of the pay-fors &ndash; including a last-minute measure that would exclude the sales of authorized generics from the calculation of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for determining Medicaid rebates.</p><p>The proposal would have the effect of increasing the AMP of brand drugs, therefore, boosting the rebates manufacturers would owe to the states and federal government.</p><p><b>Other amendments </b></p><p>While Representative Brat's measure failed, lawmakers adopted a handful of amendments to the Cures bill on 10 July by voice votes, including a provision by Representative Joaquin Castro (Democrat-Texas) aimed at ensuring underrepresented populations, like women and minorities, are included in a report Congress is requiring the NIH to submit on its efforts to attract, retain and develop emerging young scientists. </p><p>Lawmakers also overwhelmingly supported an amendment from Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee (Democrat-Texas) that would direct Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct outreach to minority academic institutions to ensure health professionals from underrepresented populations are aware of government-funded research opportunities.</p><p>House members also agreed to adopt Representative Louise Slaughter's (Democrat-New York) provision to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the effects of providing additional Medicare payments to hospitals for using advanced antibiotics to fight resistant pathogens &ndash; superbugs.</p><p>Also adopted was an amendment from Representative Mike Fitzpatrick (Republican-Pennsylvania) under which lawmakers would declare it is the "sense of the Congress" that recording unique device identifiers at the point-of-care in electronic health records could significantly enhance the availability of medical device data for postmarket surveillance purposes &ndash; a measure he said he was inspired to pursue in light of reports that laparoscopic power morcellators have spread cancerous tissue to women undergoing uterine fibroid removal.</p><p>Representative Jared Polis (Democrat-Colorado) offered up, but withdrew, an amendment that would have required HHS to submit a report to Congress assessing the feasibility, benefits and risks associated with establishing an expedited two-tiered approval process, which would have permitted certain medical devices to provisionally come to the US market if they had been demonstrated to be safe and effective.</p><p>But lawmakers in a 245-176 vote refused to back an amendment from Representative Barbara Jackson (Democrat-California) that sought to kill the so-called "policy riders" that were added to the Cures legislation after it had left the E&C Committee.</p><p>Most controversial was the language aimed at extending the "Hyde" amendment, which would prohibit federal funds to be used for abortions.</p><p>Representative Diana DeGette (Democrat-Colorado) &ndash; Mr Upton's primary partner on the Cures bill from the very beginning when they <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Time-to-go-big-on-cures-innovation-lawmakers-declare-351611" target="_new">launched their effort last year</a> &ndash; called the riders the "worst impulses of politicians to meddle and interfere with scientists and experts as they do their important work."</p><p>"The inclusion of the Hyde amendment among these riders is especially offensive," she declared. "Its unnecessary presence reminds that even the most bipartisan efforts are not immune from political attacks. Women are more than half of the patients in America, and their health needs should not be insulted and restricted by this Congress."</p><p>Representative DeGette pleaded with her colleagues to "Keep the <i>21st Century Cures</i> focused on the great potential to do more for patients."</p><p>But ultimately, she was unsuccessful in convincing her colleagues to remove the policy riders &ndash; the presence of which caused some Democrats, like Representatives Rosa DeLauro (Connecticut) and Jackie Speier (California), who said they otherwise would have backed the Cures legislation, to vote against the overall bill. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
