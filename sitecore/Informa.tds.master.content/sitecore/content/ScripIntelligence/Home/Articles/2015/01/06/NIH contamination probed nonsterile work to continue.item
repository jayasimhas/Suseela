<p>The Republican and Democratic heads of the US Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee on 5 June demanded answers about what led to the breakdown at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in which at least six patients were possibly exposed to contaminated products made by the agency's Pharmaceutical Development Section (PDS) &ndash; calling the incident "alarming."</p><p>In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, Senators Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee), HELP chairman, and Patty Murray (Democrat-Washington), the ranking member, said they wanted a "prompt and detailed explanation" of what went wrong and what was being done to address the situation and ensure the safety of patients receiving treatment at the NIH's Clinical Center.</p><p>The NIH on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fungal-contamination-shutters-NIH-drug-manufacturing-unit-358750" target="_new">4 June reported</a> it was shutting down its operations indefinitely at its PDS after the FDA discovered potentially deadly fungus in vials of products, unsanitary conditions and other violations at the facility.</p><p>Initially, the NIH said all PDS operations were being stopped. But late on 7 June &ndash; three days later &ndash; the agency issued a notice to reporters revising the NIH's earlier statement, declaring that production of only sterile materials at the PDS was suspended and that work on materials that do not require sterile manufacturing practices will continue.</p><p>NIH spokesman John Burklow told <i>Scrip</i> that after the agency made its 4 June public announcement, "it came to our attention that some functions within the PDS were still operational."</p><p>"We pursued the question, confirmed the fact that, indeed . . . the Clinical Center allowed the non-sterile functions to continue &ndash; since they weren't considered problematic &ndash; and so we made the correction on our website" on 7 June, Mr Burklow said, adding the NIH was "sorry" about the earlier "inadvertent error."</p><p>"We were focused on the significant problems with the sterile component of the PDS and have been working diligently to communicate with scientists and research participants," he said.</p><p>The shutdown of the NIH's sterile manufacturing could impact 46 studies and make 250 patients wait for medicines. The agency said it was working to secure alternative sources of products for those patients.</p><p>After receiving an anonymous tip about poor conditions at the PDS, the FDA conducted an inspection last month and found spore-forming organisms, such as <i>Cladosporium</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> midulans, in two vials of albumin human serum.</p><p>The FDA's inspectors also discovered a number of other deficiencies, including <i>Bacillus</i> species and Hyaline septate mold, insects in lighting bays in the clean room area, flaws in the PDS center's air handling system and operational failures, including inadequate quality control, insufficient employee training and a lack of compliance with standard operating procedures &ndash; a situation Senators Alexander and Murray called "unacceptable" and one that "jeopardized patient safety."</p><p>The lawmakers said they were particularly troubled the NIH failed to identify on its own the numerous problems in the PDS facility rather than waiting for someone to complain to the FDA.</p><p>The senators requested a response to a series of questions and called for a staff briefing from HHS "as soon as possible."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
