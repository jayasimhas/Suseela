<p>FDA watchers would be shocked if US regulators declined to approve the first two applications for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors &ndash;Sanofi's and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Praluent (alirocumab), which is up first, with an action date of 24 July, and Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab), whose verdict is anticipated by 27 August. </p><p>After all, the FDA's outside expert advisers gave their support to the experimental drugs at two separate advisory committee meetings in June &ndash; declaring the PCSK9 inhibitors had dramatically lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), with few adverse events.</p><p>Plus, the European Commission on 21 July <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Surprise-as-Amgen-pips-RegeneronSanofi-to-first-PCSK9-inhibitor-approval-359541" target="_new">gave its nod</a> to Repatha, with a broad label &ndash; although the FDA certainly doesn't always fall in line with its counterparts across the Atlantic.</p><p>The monoclonal antibodies work by blocking overactive PCSK9 proteins, which control the number of LDL receptors &ndash; proteins on the surface of cells that regulate blood cholesterol levels &ndash; which is a different mechanism than how statins act in bringing LDL-C under control. </p><p>But the companies have yet to complete their cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs), so it's unclear if Praluent and Repatha actually prevent events like heart attacks, strokes and CV-related death.</p><p>Amgen has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Repatha-review-not-quite-Praluent-mirror-dosing-stands-out-358853" target="_new">fully enrolled</a> its 27,500-patient CVOT, known as FOURIER, and anticipates results in 2017 &ndash; around the same time Sanofi and Regeneron are expecting data from their 18,000-patient CVOT, known as ODYSSEY OUTCOMES.</p><p>But without the CVOT data, the FDA's advisers said <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-advisers-endorse-PCSK9-Praluent-but-limited-population-358873" target="_new">Praluent</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Panel-Approve-but-limit-Amgen-PCSK9-final-verdict-payers-358895" target="_new">Repatha</a> should be limited to certain groups, like adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) &ndash; a genetic disease that causes unusually high levels of LDL-C, often resulting in heart attacks at a young age &ndash; and those at high CV risk where statins are not enough.</p><p>The FDA's advisers also unanimously backed the use of Amgen's Repatha in patients a more rare form of FH, known as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, an indication Sanofi and Regeneron are not seeking.</p><p>Dr Peter Chang, principal scientific analyst at Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, said given the "fairly restrictive" comments at the advisory committee meetings for Praluent and Repatha, he anticipated both compounds to gain initial approval in the smaller HeFH populations, with Amgen's drug also winning the HoFH indication.</p><p>But he said the FDA also could possibly grant approval for some other high-CV-risk patients on "maximally tolerated" statins &ndash; something a number of panelists favored. </p><p>"In general, given the PCSK9 inhibitors are injectables, we think the high-CV-risk group is a primary target group anyway, but it will be interesting to see how the FDA defines the initial approval and if it only includes secondary prevention or other restrictions," Dr Chang said.</p><p>But, he said, it would be "highly unlikely" for the FDA to allow initial use of Praluent and Repatha in the non-high-risk statin-intolerant patients, given the pending CVOTs.</p><p>Although several of the FDA's advisers insisted on having the CVOT data before a broader approval and expressed uncertainty around the LDL hypothesis &ndash; declaring LDL-C should not be used for all classes of CV drugs as a surrogate, particularly the PCSK9s &ndash; JP Morgan analyst Jessica Fye said she expected the FDA to continue to view LDL lowering as a surrogate for CV risk reduction. </p><p>Therefore, Ms Fye said she anticipated the FDA's approval of Praluent and Repatha to include patients beyond the HeFH/HoFH populations "to at least those with high-CV-risk, which is effectively the group we would expect physicians to use PCSK9 inhibitors in anyway," versus patients with only moderately elevated LDL levels.</p><p>A restricted label to only HeFH/HoFH patients before the CVOT data, she said, is "unlikely."</p><p>While Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum said he expected the European decision on Repatha to have "very little read across to the US," he also said he was "bullish" on a the drug and Praluent gaining a broad US label.</p><p>But Dr Chang noted the FDA had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Heart-of-FDAs-1st-PCSK9-review-population-ditching-statins-358772" target="_new">raised concerns</a> that if broad populations of patients gained access to PCSK9 inhibitors, they may prematurely abandon statins, rather than first trying a lower dose.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PCSK9-panels-Nissens-take-358915" target="_new">Dr Steven Nissen</a>, chairman of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University, said the FDA's and its advisers' "emphasis on statins first" was the "appropriate" and "responsible" approach.</p><p>After the two advisory committees last month, Dr Nissen told <i>Scrip</i> he anticipated the FDA to provide an approval, "but for a somewhat limited population initially."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
