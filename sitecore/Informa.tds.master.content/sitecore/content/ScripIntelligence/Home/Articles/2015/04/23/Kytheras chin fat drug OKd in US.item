<p>There may soon be fewer double chins in the US, now that the FDA has given the go-ahead to Kythera Biopharmaceuticals to market Kybella (deoxycholic acid), previously known as ATX-101, as a treatment for adults to improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe convexity or fullness associated with submental fat.</p><p>The drug is the first pharmaceutical option for the condition &ndash; offering a less invasive approach than surgery or liposuction. </p><p>Shares of Kythera jumped 8% on word of the approval, but quickly came back to earth, dropping 4.5%, or $2.13, before closing at $45.49, down $2.05, or 4.3%.</p><p>Kybella is an injectable formulation of a purified synthetic version of deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring molecule in the body that aids in the breakdown of dietary fat. It works by contouring the area under the chin by destroying fat cells, while leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected.</p><p>The dosing regimen is up to six treatment sessions at 28-day intervals, with each session involving up to 50 injections of 1% Kybella at 0.2mL each into submental fat.</p><p>Kythera said treatment can be tailored to the goals of the patient and the physician. Each in-office treatment session is typically 15-20 minutes.</p><p>The firm said many patients experienced visible results in two to four treatments. Once the aesthetic response is achieved, retreatment is not expected, the company said.</p><p>"Physicians can offer a clinically-proven treatment that is customized to the patient and their treatment goals for an improved chin profile," said Kythera CEO Keith Leonard, who insisted Kybella use in clinical testing resulted in a "high patient satisfaction."</p><p>Kythera plans to launch Kybella in the second half of this year. The company has not yet disclosed the drug's pricing. </p><p>But the firm said it plans to first execute a training program, in which prescribers can purchase the drug and treat patients only after going through the course about safe use of Kybella.</p><p>Kythera said physician faculty education will begin in June, with physician training programs initiating in late summer.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-dermatology-panel-backs-Kythera-chin-fat-drug-357142" target="_new">Last month</a>, the FDA's Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee unanimously backed approval of Kybella. </p><p>At that meeting, Dr Frederick Beddingfield, Kythera's chief medical officer, insisted submental fat is of particular concern for many adults, affecting their confidence about their attractiveness to others.</p><p>Chin fat can arise from several factors other than gaining weight, including aging, lifestyle or genetic predisposition, he explained.</p><p>But, Dr Beddingfield said, chin fat often is resistant to weight loss.</p><p>Before Kybella, treatment options for submental fat were limited to aesthetic surgical procedures and targeted liposuction.</p><p>Kybella's approval was supported by a global development program that included over 20 clinical studies with more than 2,600 patients worldwide, of which over 1,600 were treated with Kybella.</p><p>In the pivotal Phase III studies, 68.2% of patients responded to Kybella based on a composite of validated physician and patient measurements. </p><p>Patients treated with the drug reported an improvement in the amount of fat in the area under the chin. </p><p>In addition, patients reported improvement in the "emotional impact" of submental fat when asked how happy, bothered, self-conscious, embarrassed, old and overweight they felt following treatment in relation to the amount of their submental fat, Kythera said.</p><p>The most common adverse effects associated with Kybella were associated with the injection site and included swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, erythema and formation of small areas of firmness around the treatment area. </p><p>But as a cytolytic drug, Kybella, which is intended to destroy fat cells, can kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if it is inadvertently injected into the skin, US regulators noted.</p><p>"Using Kybella for the treatment of fat outside of the submental area is not approved and is not recommended," the FDA said.</p><p>And, regulators warned, Kybella can cause serious adverse effects, including nerve injury in the jaw, which can cause an uneven smile or facial muscle weakness and trouble swallowing. </p><p>"Treatment with Kybella should only be provided by a licensed health care professional, and patients should fully understand the risks associated with use of the drug before considering treatment," said Dr Amy Egan, deputy director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation III.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
