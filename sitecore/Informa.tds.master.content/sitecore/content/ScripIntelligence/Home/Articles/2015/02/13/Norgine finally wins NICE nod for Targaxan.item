<p>Dutch specialty company Norgine has finally convinced NICE to recommend its hepatic encephalopathy drug Targaxan (rifaximin) for use on the NHS in England and Wales.</p><p>Norgine originally submitted the drug to NICE in 2013, but NICE said it needed more cost-effectiveness data from the company (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-wants-more-info-on-Norgines-rifaximin-348399" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 28 November 2013). Norgine said that until now, those data have not been available. However, this time around the company was able to submit real-world data from four independent hospital audits, the company told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Despite the new data, NICE was still uncertain about the incremental cost effectiveness ratios for the drug, estimating that they would be near the top end of the institute's range for cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, the committee decided to recommend the drug, saying it was "aware of the important unmet medical need in this population and the innovative aspects of this treatment." </p><p>NICE has recommended Targaxan as a treatment to prevent recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, a brain condition caused by liver failure. Patients suffering from the illness suffer confusion and loss of consciousness, sometimes falling into comas as a result of a build-up of toxic substances in the body which would usually be removed by the liver. After an initial episode, recurrences can be fatal.</p><p>Standard treatment in the UK is lactulose, which is not generally well tolerated and is rarely used long-term because it is associated with significant toxicity. There is very little competition for Norgine, and not much in the pipeline beyond a handful of Phase II products. Chief operating officer Peter Martin commented: "There have been no new treatment options for HE patients in the UK for over 30 years. Indeed no other product has been studied in the way Targaxan has, and therefore no other product has a similar license indication."</p><p>Targaxan, which is also marketed as Xifaxan, Refero, and Tixteller, was approved in Europe via the decentralized procedure in December 2012 (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Xifaxan-launches-in-2013-after-decentralised-EU-approvals-337981" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, 2 December 2012). It already has reimbursement in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden.</p>
