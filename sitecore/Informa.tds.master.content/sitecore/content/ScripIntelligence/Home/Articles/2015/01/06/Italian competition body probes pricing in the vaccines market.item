<p>The Italian competition authority (AGCM) has launched a sector inquiry into the human vaccines market with a view to examining how public tenders are run and whether some companies are involved in "excessive" pricing or other anticompetitive practices. </p><p>Unusually, the authority has also issued a "call for input" inviting companies and other stakeholders to submit information on the commercial and competitive dynamics of the vaccines market as well as issues relating specifically to public tenders.</p><p>The AGCM says it started the inquiry because vaccines cost the national health service (SSN) more than around &euro;322m per year (or 1.6% of total SSN spending on pharmaceuticals), they are procured through public tenders, and the prices of some key vaccines "seem to be on the increase". </p><p>The inquiry will look at the following issues: </p><ul><li>The characteristics of the commercial dynamics relating to vaccines for human use;</li><li>Critical competitive factors in the vaccines market, particularly with regard to current Italian legislation and related acts, such as the national vaccine prevention plan; and </li><li>Efficiencies and critical issues in public tender procedures for vaccines purchasing.</li></ul><p>In order to support the inquiry, and "in line with international best practices", the AGCM has opened a public consultation (call for inputs) on these issues, and is inviting comments by 10 July. </p><p>Laywers from Covington & Burling say that companies and other stakeholders are free, at this stage at least, to decide whether, and to what extent, they wish to submit information, although the AGCM can decide to send out questionnaires to companies at any stage of the sector inquiry. "Since sector inquiries usually lead to investigations, companies should carefully assess the appropriateness of participating in the "call for input", they observe.</p><p>"Reading between the lines of its decision", they say, the AGCM "appears to be focusing on excessive pricing, although it is expected that the inquiry will also look for possible collusive practices". </p><p>Indeed, news that the AGCM is embarking on a fresh competition inquiry in this area should not be taken lightly: its last foray into the pharmaceutical sector resulted in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Roche-Novartis-slam-Italian-cartel-fine-350396" target="_new">hefty fine</a> last year for Roche and Novartis for allegedly colluding to exclude Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab) from the wet AMD market in favour of Novartis' more expensive Lucentis (ranibizumab). </p><p>And this is not the first time the Italians have looked into vaccine pricing issues: in 2014 Novartis had another run-in with the authorities when police <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Novartis-raided-over-flu-vaccine-price-as-EU-procurement-deal-signed-352490" target="_new">raided two of its sites</a> in search of evidence that the firm had artificially inflated its pandemic vaccine prices. </p><h2>Reasons for the inquiry </h2><p>Explaining its decision to launch an inquiry, the AGCM says that vaccines are procured via tenders based on a range of factors such as national vaccination targets and past consumption trends. While data show an increase in the use of centralized tenders, demand for vaccines remains fragmented and many local health authorities operate their own tenders, where different prices may be paid for the same product "with no relation to the quantities purchased".</p><p>Moreover, prices of newer vaccines are on an upward trend, the authority says. It notes that each vaccine for a specific disease is a non-substitutable product and so, in competition terms, a vaccine can constitute "a distinct market and therefore a commercial monopoly". Given the low level of generic competition in this market, "from a competition point of view the risks of a monopoly position are significant", it says, possibly via "sophisticated strategies of selective pricing". </p><p>The inquiry will seek to analyse the vaccine market, with special reference to obligatory or "highly recommended" vaccinations. In calling for stakeholder input, the AGCM says, it will among other things be particularly interested in information on "specific cases of tender procedures deemed to be significant in terms of the price paid and/or the behaviour of the company". The authority adds that if stakeholders believe their contributions include "sensitive data", they should provide a confidential version containing that information as well as a public version. </p><p>The consumer organization Federconsumatori welcomed the inquiry, saying it shared the concern over the "constant increase in prices and the consequent exclusion of more vulnerable people". Vaccines had to be made available at transparent and accessible prices, and companies had to "act responsibly" it said.</p>
