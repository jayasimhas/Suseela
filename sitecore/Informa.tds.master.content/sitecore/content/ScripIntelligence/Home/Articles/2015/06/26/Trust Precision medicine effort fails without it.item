<p>Trust, transparency and continuous communication.</p><p>That's what a group of more than 300 industry, patient advocacy, academic and government stakeholders insisted would be needed between researchers and potential study participants if the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has any chance of being successful in enrolling one million Americans in a cohort President Barack Obama has called for under his precision medicine initiative (PMI).</p><p>The goal of the PMI, said NIH Director Dr Francis Collins, is "to build a broad research program to encourage creative approaches to precision medicine, test them rigorously and then ultimately use them to build the evidence base needed to guide clinical practice."</p><p>The near-term objective is to "scale up in a big way" efforts in cancer genomics, which primarily involves partnering with biopharmaceutical firms to test combinations of targeted therapies based on a tumor's molecular signature &ndash; the so-called <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Precision-medicine-study-to-match-drugs-to-cancer-mutations-358699" target="_new">NCI-Match study</a> &ndash; which is anticipated to enroll 1,000 Americans across the US, Dr Collins noted on 1 July on the first of a two-day workshop hosted at the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><p>The study is "ready to go" and is just awaiting congressional approval of the $70m President Obama requested, he said &ndash; noting Congress seems favorably inclined to grant the funds, after House and Senate appropriators last week <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/White-House-NIH-spending-boost-comes-at-healthcares-expense-359111" target="_new">gave their blessing</a>.</p><p>But the NIH convened the workshop, which will continue into a second day on 2 July, to gather insight into the best ways for engaging potential participants in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">million-person cohort</a> and ensuring health equity in designing the study &ndash; the longer-term part of the PMI, the details of which President Obama unveiled in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">January</a>.</p><p>The president also <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">asked Congress</a> for about $130m to fund the one-million cohort efforts &ndash; funds lawmakers also appear to be OK with approving.</p><p>Now, though, it's up to the NIH to complete the design of the longitudinal cohort study and lead the effort in getting scientists, doctors and study participants on board &ndash; something Dr Collins acknowledged will be no easy task.</p><p>He emphasized the NIH is seeking to enroll a cross-section of Americans in the study &ndash; pointing out the agency doesn't want to "just study sick people," but also those resilient to disease, which he said may help researchers answer questions about how to address certain conditions, or even aging.</p><p><b>Public opinion</b></p><p>At the workshop &ndash; part of a series of gatherings the NIH has been hosting since <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Data-security-diversity-debated-at-precision-medicine-Super-Bowl-356706" target="_new">February</a> &ndash; officials revealed the results of a request for information (RFI) that went out in May to hear from the public about what potential strategies could be used to ensure the million-person cohort is diverse and that it's able to provide transformative research to address health disparities in the US. </p><p>Vence Bonham, a senior adviser on genomics and health disparities to the director of the NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute, said the agency received 69 "substantive" responses to the RFI, which came from Americans in 44 cities across 23 states, with two responses coming from outside the US &ndash; one from Europe and the other from South America. </p><p>"There was a diversity of the areas of the country, researchers, general public across the US," Mr Bonham told those gathered at the NIH workshop.</p><p>Of all of the responses, he said, an assurance of trust was the overwhelming plea.</p><p>"Trust is particularly critical given the unfortunate legacy within medical research where participant rights have not been equally protected," one respondent wrote. "Trust requires time and effort to develop, but is easily lost."</p><p>Other responses included requests to ensure materials for participants are available at low literacy, in multiple languages and in multiple mediums and for the NIH to develop additional strategies to educate and engage those who don't speak English, Mr Bonham explained.</p><p>He said the NIH also was asked to consider what health literacy approaches would be necessary to ensure patients and families understand precision medicine and whether those strategies would vary within subpopulations.</p><p>Mr Bonham said one person who responded to the RFI told the NIH it would be important to cover transportation and childcare costs for participants &ndash; something that could help improve enrollment.</p><p>Another person pointed out that the study must be "relevant" to the lives of participants, especially those in historically underserved communities.</p><p>"The only way for that to be true is participation to be authentically initiated, designed, conducted, analyzed and communicated within the community with members of the community as true leaders and facilitators," the responder said.</p><p>The NIH also was urged to study the multiple determinants of health and their interactions &ndash; personal, social, economic, environmental factors &ndash; on disease risk, disease mechanism and individual response to therapy, Mr Bonham said.</p><p>One of the RFI responders called for the cohort researchers to examine the genetic and environmental factors across a person's lifespan that influence the development of disparities in risk and incidence or progression of hypertension, chronic kidney disease and other chronic diseases.</p><p>In the comments the NIH received, the responders stressed the importance of examining sex, race and ethnic differences among study participants, such as whether one medicine works better in one group over another.</p><p>And lastly, Mr Bonham said, the responders argued the information gathered under the PMI cohort study should benefit the participants &ndash; with their data being returned to them.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
