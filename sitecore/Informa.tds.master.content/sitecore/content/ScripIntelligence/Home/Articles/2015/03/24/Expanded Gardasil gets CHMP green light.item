<p>The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has recommended approval of Sanofi Pasteur MSD's Gardasil 9 to immunize against nine types of human papillomavirus.</p><p>The original version of Gardasil was first approved in Europe in 2006 to prevent women developing cervical cancer by targeting four strains of the virus which cause the majority of cervical cancers. Gardasil 9 covers an additional 20% of cervical cancers which are not covered by the original version or GlaxoSmithKline's competing product, Cervarix.</p><p>The original version of the vaccine protected against the diseases caused by four types of HPV: 6, 11, 16 and 18. This one also includes types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58. In combination the nine types are known to cause about 90% of cervical cancers, more than 95% of adenocarcinoma in situ, 85-90% of HPV-related vulvar cancers, 80-85% of HPV-related vaginal cancers, 90-95% of HPV-related anal cancers and 90% of genital warts, among other conditions.</p><p>The vaccine is administered in three separate injections within a one-year period, with the initial dose followed by doses at two and six months. It is recommended for use in boys and girls from nine years of age to protect against cervical cancer and pre-malignant cervical lesions, vulvar and vaginal cancers and pre-malignant vulvar and vaginal lesions, pre-malignant anal lesions and anal cancers and external genital warts.</p><p>Recommendations from the CHMP are referred to the European Commission for a final decision, which is usually granted within three months.</p><p>Cervarix is a bivalent vaccine that protects against HPV 16 and 18, Sales have been in decline since peaking at $815m in 2011: they were $195m in 2014. In contrast, sales of Gardasil have risen from $1.2bn in 2011to $1.7bn in 2014.</p><p>Merck & Co <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-Mercks-new-Gardasil-provides-broader-protection-355558" target="_new">obtained approval for Gardasil 9 in the US</a> in December 2014.</p>
