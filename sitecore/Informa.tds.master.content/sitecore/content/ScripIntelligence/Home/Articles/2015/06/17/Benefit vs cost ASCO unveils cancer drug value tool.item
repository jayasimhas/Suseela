<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) asked the question "What is a cancer drug's true value?" and in four very specific treatment situations the organization's Value in Cancer Care Task Force supplied an answer: It depends.</p><p>"Value" is a fluid concept under ASCO's proposed framework for assessing the value of new cancer therapies versus the standard of care, which the task force revealed on 22 June in hopes of soliciting feedback during the next two months from physicians, patients, payers and pharmaceutical companies. ASCO hopes that doctors and patients will use the value assessment tool to make joint decisions on the best treatment for each patient's cancer and their specific circumstances.</p><p>ASCO's task force, which included representatives from the private payer United Healthcare and big pharma player AstraZeneca, determined that value depends on the clinical benefit and toxicity of cancer drugs as well as what patients are willing to pay to extend survival, maintain quality of life or pursue a cure. The first public glimpse of the value assessment tool shows how it will work in four treatment settings: metastatic lung cancer, advanced multiple myeloma, metastatic prostate cancer and as an adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.</p><p>Stakeholders are asked to share their concerns and recommendations with the ASCO task force by 21 August. Opinions may be submitted <a href="http://www.asco.org/value" target="_new">online</a>. </p><p>The industry group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) said in a statement: "Judgments about treatment value are highly individualized and vary over time as new research and new treatment options emerge. As the framework is finalized, it will be essential to ensure that it reflects the needs and preferences of individual patients, medical advances and increasing personalization in medicine, as well as the evolution of clinical value and cost over time."</p><p>ASCO's task force will revise its cancer drug value assessment tool based on feedback collected during the next two months then make the tool available to the public, but a timeline for the second draft and a public release of the final product has not been established.</p><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><p>It appears that the Value in Cancer Care Task Force took its time developing the drug value assessment tool, since task force co-chair Lowell Schnipper anticipated in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ASCO-looks-for-value-in-pricey-cancer-drugs-352139" target="_new">June 2014</a> that a first draft would be available for public review by the end of the summer last year.</p><p>"We set out to develop a way in which we could assess the value of various treatment options available for caring for a patient, so that the physician can help the patient understand how much benefit a new treatment has for them versus the standard of care. If the new treatment program offers improvement in survival and also offers less in the way of side effects, those factors would contribute to the new treatment getting a high score in terms of 'net health benefit'," Dr Schnipper told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Harvard Medical School professor is chief of hematology and oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and clinical director of the hospital's cancer center. He noted that doctors are not trained to talk to patients about treatment costs, but Dr Schnipper said oncologists feel compelled to address the issue more frequently as cancer patients decline to fill prescriptions and take fewer pills or injections than prescribed to avoid bankruptcy due to high and rising drug costs.</p><p>With those concerns in mind, ASCO's value assessment tool is designed to compare a newer therapy with the standard of care used as a control in a clinical trial for the drug. New therapies earn points based on the clinical benefit [improvement in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) or response rate (RR)] and the number of grade 3 through 5 toxicities versus an established treatment. </p><p>The clinical benefit score can be as high as 100 in the adjuvant setting and up to 130 for advanced cancer treatments, while scores based on toxicity range from -20 to +20. The net health benefit (NHB) can be as high as 120 points for potentially curable cancers and up to 150 for later-stage therapies. The detailed scoring system was published in ASCO's Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) on <a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2015/06/22/JCO.2015.61.6706" target="_new">22 June</a>.</p><p>When doctors share ASCO's value assessments with patients, they'll present the final NHB alongside each patient's out-of-pocket costs, including insurance deductibles and prescription drug co-payment requirements. </p><p>Together, oncologists and patients can determine whether the cost of a new drug is too high given the relatively small benefit or the high toxicity. They also may decide that a significant improvement in survival with a relatively low side effect burden are worth the cost of a new, expensive drug.</p><p>Another factor for doctor and patient consideration are bonus points that could increase the NHB for drugs that treat advanced cancers. ASCO's value assessment tool offers extra credit for therapies that improve cancer-related symptoms or stall disease progression well enough to give later-stage patients a treatment-free period during their remaining months or years of life.</p><p><b>How are the points applied?</b></p><p>ASCO's task force published score cards for treatments for four specific types of cancer. In metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the group evaluated the efficacy and safety of four treatment regimens versus the control used in clinical trials for the drugs. See the results below with out-of-pocket drug cost information provided by United Healthcare.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Drug combinations</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Clinical benefit (OS or PFS)</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Toxicity (grade 3-5 side effects)</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>NHB</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Monthly cost</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Avastin (bevacizumab) plus paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>OS: 12.3 months versus 10.3 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>22 mid- to high-grade adverse events versus 15</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>16/130 for Avastin combination</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$11,907 versus $182.09</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Alimta (pemetrexed) and cisplatin versus Gemzar (gemcitabine) plus cisplatin</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>OS: 10.3 months for both regimens</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>10 mid- to high-grade adverse events each</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>0/130 for Alimta</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$9,193.07 versus $811.72</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Gemzar and docetaxel versus docetaxel plus cisplatin</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>OS: 9.5 months versus 10 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>13 mid- to high-grade adverse events versus 15</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>0/130 for Gemzar</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2,184.18 versus $2,019.80</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Tarceva (erlotinib) versus cisplatin and docetaxel or cisplatin and gemcitabine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PFS: 9.7 months versus 5.2 months</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>8 mid- to high-grade adverse events versus 12</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>44/130 for Tarceva</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$4,607.63 versus $1,686.99</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>Dr Schnipper acknowledged that pharma stakeholders are concerned about comparisons of drugs across clinical trials, since each study is different. For instance, Roche probably doesn't want Avastin compared to Eli Lilly's Alimta, since the trials reviewed in ASCO's value assessments involved different patients and control arms, among other variables.</p><p>"We are in the process of studying ASCO's value framework &#8230; and will likely have more to say once we get a better understanding of the proposals," the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) said in a statement to <i>Scrip</i>. "Any decision-making tool should present patients and their providers with all available treatment options so they can make informed decisions about their best course of treatment."</p><p>ASCO's value task force and the pharma industry agree in terms of BIO's assertion that "any tool should preserve the complex clinical decision-making that goes on within the context of the provider-patient relationship, taking into account the provider's judgment and expertise and the patient's priorities."</p><p>That's why, for instance, advanced cancer therapies earn bonus points for treatment holidays and reduced cancer-related symptoms, like relief from pain caused by bone metastases. </p><p>"The urgency of providing optimal care for the cancer patient has never been greater, because the number of patients with the disease is rising and the number of wonderful treatments is growing. We are hopeful that manufacturers will try to generate new compounds and therapies that will improve treatment and be less toxic and that the cost can be modulated to some extent," Dr Schnipper said.</p><p><p><p>
