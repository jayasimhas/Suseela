<p>Allergan is unlikely to complete any additional large, transformational acquisitions before the $40.5bn sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries closes in the first quarter of 2016, but CEO Brent Saunders hinted during Allergan's second quarter earnings conference call that a mega-deal isn't completely out of the question before then.</p><p>Allergan is using much of its revenue &ndash; which more than doubled year-over-year to $5.8bn in the second quarter &ndash; to reduce the debt that funded its transformation from generics-focused Actavis to the brand-name behemoth Allergan and the company isn't particularly interested in taking out more loans to finance new deals. Yet while the company already is on a double-digit sales growth path even without another big acquisition, Saunders and his team aren't likely to take a long break from dealmaking just because the ink isn't dry on the Teva deal.</p><p>Allergan's business development activities have left the company with $1.5bn in cash as of 30 June, so the company would have to take on a lot more debt to execute another transformational deal &ndash; an option that may be off the table, because it could hurt Allergan's credit rating. That's why the company may wait for its $36bn in after-tax proceeds from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Teva-to-buy-Allergan-Generics-Mylan-off-the-hook-but-Perrigo-still-wriggling-359632" target="_new">Teva deal</a> to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-36bn-from-Teva-what-should-Allergan-buy-next-359644" target="_new">make a big purchase</a>, but that doesn't mean smaller deals are off the table in the interim.</p><p>During the months of June and July, Allergan announced four deals totaling at least $3bn with Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Oculeve, Merck & Co and Naurex that will give the company an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-buys-chin-fat-firm-Kythera-for-2.1bn-358996" target="_new">injection to reduce chin fat</a>, a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beyond-Restasis-Allergan-buys-Oculeve-dry-eye-device-359267" target="_new">medical device</a> for dry eye disease, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-migraine-portfolio-grows-with-Merck-CGRP-antagonists-359295" target="_new">two migraine drugs</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-paying-560m-for-Naurex-stays-quiet-on-rumored-generics-sale-to-Teva-359627" target="_new">two novel depression therapies</a>.</p><p>Mr Saunders noted during Allergan's earnings call on Aug. 6 that "we are executing on strategic business deals to support our growth in key therapy areas and charge up our pipelines for the future" and said the company is "always on the lookout for R&D assets that can extend our leadership in the areas we choose to compete," which include the central nervous system (CNS), eye care, gastrointestinal (GI), women's health, cardiovascular, infectious disease and urology drugs.</p><p>The CEO said transformational deals, like the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Analysts-play-MandA-chess-with-Actavis-Pfizer-352617" target="_new">$28bn purchase</a> of Forest Laboratories and the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111" target="_new">$66bn Allergan acquisition</a>, aren't likely until after the company closes its generics business sale to Teva. However, "anything is possible prior to that and we have always been bold in thinking about how to execute things if the timing is right," he said.</p><p><b>Exclusive Focus on Brands</b></p><p>It's easy to see why Allergan wants to focus on branded drugs rather than generic medicines going forward considering the sales growth achieved since the company acquired Forest and Allergan. </p><p>Revenue from branded pharma products jumped 35% between the first and second quarters of 2015, and skyrocketed 331% to $2.4bn for the April-to-June period versus $565m during the same period in 2014 on a non-GAAP basis. Meanwhile, generic product revenues were flat between the first and second quarters of 2015 and rose just 10% year-over-year to $1.6bn in the second quarter.</p><p>Allergan's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110" target="_new">top-selling product</a> is the wrinkle-reducer and migraine headache-preventer <i>Botox</i> (onabotulinumtoxinA), which is approved for several aesthetic and therapeutic indications. Botox generated $615m in second quarter sales versus <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2Q-EARNINGS-Allergan-boosts-sales-cuts-jobs-provokes-Valeant-352970" target="_new">$579.4m in the same period of 2014</a> and revenue from the injectable therapy, which had $2.2bn in full-year 2014 sales, should keep growing at a strong pace based on Allergan's ongoing research and development.</p><p>Botox was approved in Japan to treat strabismus during the second quarter and an application for approval to reduce crow's feet lines for adults aged 65 and above is pending in Japan.</p><p><i>Restasis</i> (cyclosporine) is Allergan's second biggest seller and another growth product. Sales for the dry eye treatment totaled $325m in the second quarter versus $269.3m for the same period last year &ndash; a gain that Allergan attributed to a new direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising campaign and initiation of marketing to primary care physicians. Restasis achieved blockbuster status for the first time in 2014 when sales spiked to $1.08bn versus $940m in 2013. </p><p>Allergan plans to increase sales further with a multi-dose, preservative-free formulation that will be submitted for US FDA consideration in September. The company also will boost its dry eye franchise with the Oculeve purchase.</p><p>"We have an [over-the-counter (OTC)] or artificial tear; Oculeve essentially is a natural tear option; and then Restasis is an anti-inflammatory," Allergan president of branded pharma William Meury said during the company's earnings call. "We offer a more complete product line for the eye care community than any company in the [dry eye] sector."</p><p><b>Other Key Brands</b></p><p>While dry eye disease represents a major market opportunity for Allergan, the company's <i>Namenda</i> (memantine) products for Alzheimer's disease have combined sales that exceed Restasis. Namenda immediate-release (IR) sales totaled $232.6m and Namenda extended-release (XR) sales totaled $204.7m in the second quarter versus $245.4m and $150.6m, respectively, in the first quarter. </p><p>Namenda XR sales are climbing as Namenda IR faces generic competition and as Alzheimer's patients switch to the extended-release formulation. The company is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-Actavis-Namenda-forced-switch-coercion-anticompetitive-358576" target="_new">under court order</a> to keep the immediate-release formulation on the market despite the presence of generic versions of the drug and the availability of Namenda XR, but the Namenda franchise is expected to keep growing as patients begin taking <i>Namzaric</i>. The FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merry-Christmas-Four-US-FDA-approvals-and-a-CRL-355850" target="_new">approved the once-daily pill</a> that combines Namenda XR and Aricept (donepezil) in December.</p><p>"We think [Namzaric] should be the standard of care for patients with moderate to severe disease," Meury said.</p><p>In Allergan's GI portfolio, sales for <i>Asacol</i>/<i>Dezicol</i> (mesalamine) were $149.3m in the second quarter &ndash; just 0.4% above the $148.9m reported for the IBS drugs during the same period in 2014. </p><p>The sales gain is far below the 10% or more annual growth rate that Allergan is targeting companywide for the next several years, and that goal will be harder for the mesalamine franchise to achieve in 2016, since two of the largest pharmacy benefit managers in the US &ndash; Express Scripts and CVS/Caremark &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Express-Scripts-CVS-Formulary-Updates-Whos-In-Whos-Out-359772" target="_new">excluded Asacol and Dezicol</a> from their formularies for next year.</p><p>However, US sales of <i>Linzess</i> (linaclotide) for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) rose 79% year-over-year to $112.1m in the second quarter based on a DTC advertising campaign and the conversion of patients on OTC products to Linzess. </p><p>Revenue from the drug could grow if Allergan is able to win FDA approval for a low-dose formulation of Linzess to treat chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). A Phase III clinical trial in CIC will be completed during the second half of 2015 and Allergan expects to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA in 2016 for the low-dose Linzess formulation.</p><p>Allergan sells Linzess in partnership with the IBS-C drug's original developer Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and recently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ironwood-Adds-Viberzi-To-Its-Bag-359796" target="_new">struck a deal with Ironwood</a> to co-market <i>Viberzi</i> (eluxadoline) for IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D).</p><p>Allergan acquired Viberzi, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Actavis-Viberzi-Valeants-Xifaxan-OKd-in-IBS-D-in-US-358630" target="_new">approved in the US</a> in May, when Forest <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-gaining-relevant-GI-position-with-Furiex-buy-351489" target="_new">agreed to buy</a> Furiex Pharmaceuticals for $1.1bn while the Forest sale to Actavis was pending. Allergan and Ironwood will begin selling Viberzi after the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) completes controlled substance scheduling for the drug, which has mixed opioid receptor activity.</p><p><p><p><p>
