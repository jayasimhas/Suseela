<p><p>The failure of Mylan to be able to pursue the Perrigo deal is not a failure at all, but a win for both companies. </p><p>Nov. 13 brought a seven month saga to an anticlimactic end when Mylan failed to hit the 51% threshold of Perrigo shares needed under Irish Takeover Law to move forward with the acquisition &ndash; instead, only 40%, or 58,040,150 Perrigo ordinary shares, were tendered in the offer. The Mylan &ndash; Perrigo deal that has made so much noise over the last several months fizzled out quietly. </p><p>The $26bn offer, which would&rsquo;ve given each Perrigo shareholder $75 in cash plus 2/3 of a Mylan share, will stop being a distraction to both companies &ndash; a win. </p><p>There are plenty of other reasons the deal was a win as well. For Perrigo, the generic drugmaker gets to keep its independence, something Perrigo Chairman and CEO Joe Papa has been incredibly vocal about over the last few months. Papa has responded with a litany of harsh words, criticisms of management and reasons why Perrigo is better as a standalone company. But Papa wasn't just all talk either. The pursuit by Mylan put his own management style under the microscope and prompted the company to make changes that would keep its shareholders happy, including the execution of its Base Plus Plus Plus plan &ndash; and initiative meant to add to the base business through acquisitions and licensing. </p><p>At the beginning of June, Perrigo <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Perrigo-acquires-GSK-products-as-Mylan-hovers-358705" target="_new">bought a portfolio</a> of over-the-counter (OTC) products form GlaxoSmithKline, allowing the company to have a greater presence in the European OTC market &ndash; a win. </p><p>In July it <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-needs-more-to-fend-off-Mylan-359575" target="_new">took the step</a> to acquire Naturwohl Pharma, the maker of the dietary supplement brand Yokebe, again adding to its European presence &ndash; a win. </p><p>In total, Perrigo has conducted 27 deals over the last nine years &ndash; four of those during the period when Mylan was trying to acquire it, but this execution of its Base Plus Plus Plus plan still wasn't enough. Shareholders needed the company to trim the fat as well. Perrigo is looking to sell its US vitamins and supplements division, which will result in laying off 800 employees and will save the company $35m in operating costs, should it happen.</p><p>The company <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Perrigo-Cuts-The-Fat-To-Take-A-Jab-At-Mylan-361192" target="_new">announced at the end of October</a> that it is going to consolidate its operations, including supply chain and procurement management activities in Ireland by moving its global R&D management there. Perrigo expects to realize $105m in operational and tax benefits from the move.</p><p>As part of that same announcement, Perrigo told shareholders that it would begin a $2bn share repurchase program, which is set to being now that the Mylan offer has passed. Perrigo will buyback $500m in shares before the end of this year and the rest in the next two years &ndash; a win. </p><p>"We have said all along that this offer from Mylan was a bad deal for our shareholders, as it significantly undervalued our durable business model and industry-leading future growth prospects," said Papa in a Nov. 13 statement. "Now that the Mylan tender offer is behind us, we look forward to continuing to create significant value for our shareholders."</p><p>Perrigo's stock reacted badly to the news, dropping 6.16%, or $9.65, to close at $146.90 on Nov. 13. This may not seem like a win, but analysts speculate that the stock is just normalizing after being pumped up by the offer from Mylan and suspect it will make back some of that value as Mylan becomes a distant memory.</p><p><b>Can You Win If You Lose?</b></p><p>As for Mylan, it may not look like a win, but it is. While many analysts believe there was some strategic sense to the deal, it would have been dilutive to shareholders and been a lag on the new company's earnings per share for the first three years. Mylan shares responded by jumping up 12.92%, or $5.58, to close at $48.78 &ndash; a win. </p><p>Now that the Perrigo saga is finally over, Mylan has been freed up to pursue other opportunities. It has been saying for several months that it has been looking at <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-Keeps-Options-Open-As-Perrigo-Pursuit-Continues-359814" target="_new">other opportunities</a> and in talks with other potential targets &ndash; a sentiment that Chairman Robert Coury reiterated on Nov. 13. </p><p>"As we have said all along, Mylan viewed Perrigo as a unique and exciting opportunity, but not one that was required for the future success of our company. With one of the strongest balance sheets in our industry, . . .we are well-positioned to quickly execute on the next strategic, value-enhancing opportunities for our business, some of which we have already identified," he said &ndash; a win. </p><p>Mylan has a few other things going on that the market has failed to pay much attention to during the last seven months as it pursued Perrigo and aimed to fend off Teva Pharmaceuticals. For one thing, its most crucial product, the epinephrine autoinjector EpiPen, has gotten a reprieve from competition. Sanofi was forced to recall its own epinephrine autoinjector Auvi-Q due to inaccurate dosing delivery &ndash; something that will be a big hit to the brand. These autoinjectors are life-saving devices that are often used by children with allergies; no parent is going to want risk their kid's life by using a product that has had a safety issue &ndash; a win for Mylan. </p><p>In other EpiPen news, generics of the drug have been delayed by another six months &ndash; a win. </p><p>The last win for Mylan is yet to be realized, but holds a lot of potential for the company and its shareholders. During the Perrigo drama, Papa accused the company of having corporate governance issues that highlighted some of the mistakes the company has been making. While Mylan hasn't made any changes yet, Coury promised several weeks ago that positive changes would happen. It's yet to be seen whether Mylan will follow through, but if it does, it can only be counted as another win. </p><p><p>
