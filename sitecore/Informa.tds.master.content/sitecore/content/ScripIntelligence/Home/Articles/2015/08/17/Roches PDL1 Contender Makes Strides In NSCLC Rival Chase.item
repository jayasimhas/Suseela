<p>Roche AG/Genentech is strengthening its hand in immuno-oncology with new data for its anti-PD-L1 product atezolizumab showing promise in a large Phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer. It needs the positive results in order to compete with the leading PD-1 players, Bristol-Myers Squibb's <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab), which is already approved in NSCLC, and Merck & Co's <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab), which is awaiting approval for this indication (both products are already on the market for melanoma). </p><p>The US FDA granted atezolizumab a Breakthrough Therapy Designation earlier this year for NSCLC patients expressing PD-L1 and who progressed during or after standard treatments (e.g. platinum-based chemotherapy and appropriate targeted therapy for EGFR mutation-positive or ALK-positive disease). Roche Chief Medical Officer and head of Global Product Development Sandra Horning said the company would discuss these data as well as results from its other lung cancer studies with health authorities.</p><p>Atezolizumab has already shown efficacy in shrinking (ie, inducing an objective response, or ORR) tumors in one type of bladder cancer in another <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Roches-big-immune-oncology-hope-atezolizumab-shrinks-certain-bladder-tumors-359397" target="_new">Phase II trial in July</a>. The product is currently in Phase III testing in bladder, non-small cell lung, renal and breast cancer. </p><p>It differs from its more advanced rivals in that the monoclonal antibody targets the PD-1 ligand (Programmed Death Ligand-1) found on the tumor cell surface rather than the PD-1 receptor found on the T-cell. Drugs aimed at these two targets act to disrupt this ligand receptor binding process which ordinarily inhibits T-cell proliferation, survival and effector functions and induces apoptosis of tumor-specific T-cells. </p><p>In the 667-patient, open-label, BIRCH study, atezolizumab (previously known as MPDL3280A) met its primary endpoint, shrinking tumours (ORR) in people with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease expressed PD-L1 when given as a 1,200 mg IV dose every three weeks. </p><p>The full results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, Roche said. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, overall survival, progression-free survival and safety. Adverse events were consistent with what has been previously observed for atezolizumab.</p><h2>PD-L1 As Biomarker?</h2><p>Significantly BIRCH showed the amount of PD-L1 expressed by the patient's cancer correlated with their response to atezolizumab. Roche's Diagnostics division is developing a companion IHC diagnostic for the product that measures PD-L1 expression, but its use as a biomarker has yet to be fully established. All clinical trials of atezolizumab include the use of this investigational IHC test in the hope that it could identify those patients most likely to respond to treatment. Roche wants to identify those people most likely to benefit when treated with atezolizumab alone, and to determine which people may benefit most from a combination of atezolizumab and another medicine.</p><p>Many studies to date in this area have shown a correlation between PD-L1 expression on the tumor surface and a beneficial response to PD-1 pathway blockade. However, the waters are muddied by the fact that patients with PD-L1 often do not respond, while those PD-L1 negative patients often do. The problem is that PD-L1 is inducible &ndash; its presence varies depending on how the tumor is interacting with the immune system and other factors. BRAF or HER2, by comparison, are far more accurate predictors of response. </p><p>Experts say that looking at combining PD-L1 expression with other factors such as mutational burden, and tumor immune cell infiltration, to create a multi-factor model to predict response could be the way forward, but this is complex and still some way off. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Colin White said: "Obviously Opdivo and Keytruda are ahead in development for NSCLC but atezolizumab's development is progressing well. There was more evidence from this phase II trial that PD-L1 expression is correlated with a better response to treatment. It is not an ideal biomarker for selecting all the patients that will respond to treatment but the patients with higher PD-L1 expression appear to respond better to treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors."</p><p>For an overview of the immune-oncology area, see <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Scrips-Rough-Guide-to-Immuno-Oncology-358690" target="_new">Scrip's Rough Guide to Immuno-Oncology</a>. </p><p>
