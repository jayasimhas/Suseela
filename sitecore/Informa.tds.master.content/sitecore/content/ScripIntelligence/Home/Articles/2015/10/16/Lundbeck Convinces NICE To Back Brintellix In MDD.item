<p>NICE has decided to recommend H. Lundbeck AS' Brintellix (vortioxetine) for funding on the National Health Service in England and Wales after requesting and receiving more information from the Danish company on the novel antidepressant.</p><p>In June, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in draft guidance issued for consultation said it was not yet minded to back vortioxetine for treating adults with major depressive episodes after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy.</p><p>But in final draft guidance issued Oct. 16, the health technology appraisal institute said it now was recommending vortioxetine for some adults with major depressive disorder.</p><p>"Following publication of the previous draft guidance on vortioxetine the company submitted further evidence on its use for adults who had not tolerated, or whose major depressive episode had not responded to two previous antidepressants. The appraisal committee concluded from this evidence that vortioxetine's effectiveness was comparable with that of other third-line antidepressants and that vortioxetine could be recommended as a cost effective option for treating major depressive episodes in adults whose condition has responded inadequately to two antidepressants within the current episode," Carole Longson, who heads the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation Centre at NICE, said in a statement.</p><p>Lundbeck welcomed the decision, telling <i>Scrip</i> it will "offer a new treatment option for adult patients with MDE for whom previous treatments are inadequately effective or where they are unable to tolerate the treatment side-effects."</p><p>As around one third of patients treated for an MDE will not have achieved remission after two treatments, "new treatments with different mechanisms of action are therefore welcomed to best equip healthcare professionals to effectively treat patients with this disorder," a company spokesman said. </p><p>"Vortioxetine has shown to improve both mood symptoms of depression, as well as certain aspects of cognitive dysfunction in depression and NICE acknowledged that it may be a valuable treatment option for people with an MDE experiencing cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, based on the available evidence, NICE concluded that vortioxetine may have a better overall safety profile than other antidepressants," he added.</p><h2>Difference With Germany</h2><p>The recommendation from NICE contrasts with the view taken by Germany's health technology assessment body the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare, which in August concluded that vortioxetine did not bring additional benefits to clinical practice, raising concerns yet again about how the German HTA evaluates new medicines.</p><p>Lundbeck, which is being restructured and refocused by its new CEO Kare Schultz, at the time voiced surprise over the IQWiG decision, saying: "IQWIG doesn't seem to have taken into account all the clinical evidence, and we will be bringing this up in discussions with the German HTA body."</p><p>The multi-modal antidepressant received EU approval in December 2013 to treat major depressive episodes in adults. Vortioxetine is thought to act as a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B partial agonist and 5-HT1A agonist. </p><p>NICE said the price of a pack (28 tablets) of 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg tablets is &pound;27.72 (excluding VAT), although costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies in an Oct. 1 note to investors predicted vortioxetine will eventually become a blockbuster for the Danish company, with estimated peak sales of $1.4bn. A key pipeline catalyst during 2016 will be the potential US approval of a cognition benefit for vortioxetine, which has a March 28, 2016 PDUFA decision date. </p><p>"Over 25% of depression patients are viewed to suffer from impaired cognitive symptoms and clinicians are not satisfied with current drugs for this comorbidity. Around 70% of clinicians would increase Brintellix use if US FDA approves a cognition label claim," the Jefferies analysts said.</p><p>
