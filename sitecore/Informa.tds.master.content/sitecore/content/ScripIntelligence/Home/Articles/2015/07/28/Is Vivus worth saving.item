<p><p>As one analyst put it, Vivus is amputating the limb to save the patient, but many might argue that the company doesn't have anything worth saving. </p><p>The biotech announced during its second quarter earnings call after the close on 30 July that it is once again going to cut costs to preserve cash as the obesity drug Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate) continues to flounder. </p><p>Vivus is reducing its sales force to 50 from 100 reps and is cutting an unspecified number of people from its headquarters staff. </p><p>The biotech's financial situation is tenuous at best. The company has $300m in debt on the books and only $274m in cash. Beyond the frail sales of Qsymia, Vivus has brought in a total of $118m in milestone payments form partners over the years. For the second quarter, Vivus brought in only $23m in revenues and spent $40m on various expenses. The company also took a hit of $29.8m on excess inventory of Qsymia. </p><p>"The US market for branded anti-obesity pharmacotherapeutics has developed at a substantially lower rate than expected, have been checked by factors including physician caution and reluctance to prescribe, historical hangover from past experiences with prescribing other agents, public and private payer resistance to reimburse and lack of widespread consumer awareness," noted Vivus CEO Seth Fischer. </p><p>Qsymia brought in only $14m during the second quarter, well below the billions investors had expected when this new era of obesity drugs hit late stage trials earlier in the decade. The obesity market as a whole &ndash; once thought to be a big ticket market &ndash; has failed to produce revenues of any meaningful size. </p><p>As Fischer said, the paltry sales can be attributed to a number of factors, including poor efficacy, plenty of safety risks, a virtually nonexistent reimbursement structure and consumer discomfort with the product. </p><p>While the company noted that the obesity market is actually growing at a rate of 12% a year, most of those new prescriptions are going to the already generic drug phentermine &ndash; one of the components that makes up Qsymia. </p><p>"For perspective, approximately $8.2m prescriptions were dispensed for generic phentermine during the most recent moving annual total comprising approximately 83% of the prescription anti-obesity market, compared to a combined $1.7m annualized prescriptions for branded anti-obesity agents," said Fischer during the call. </p><p>Without a major pharma partner, Vivus is unable to put the resources behind Qsymia that the drug requires &ndash; although both of its competitors have big Japanese pharma partners and neither is doing better than Qsymia. Yet, the chances of Vivus scoring a deep-pocketed partner is slim to none due to the sickly Qsymia sales so far. </p><p>Beyond that, the FDA is calling for a large-scale cardiovascular outcomes trial to be completed for the drug &ndash; another expense that is well beyond the company's reach. Vivus is currently trying to negotiate the post-marketing commitment with the regulatory agency, but due to the unfortunate history of obesity drugs it's not probable the FDA will allow the biotech to conduct a small-scale study. </p><p>At this point, the deck seems stacked against Vivus and soon there will be no more costs to cut. </p><p><p>
