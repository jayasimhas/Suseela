<p>Oil-rich emerging markets have for some time offered pharmaceutical companies room for growth where the stagnating cash-strapped traditional markets have failed. Now that oil prices have more than halved from $110 per barrel since June 2014, <i>Scrip</i> takes a look at what that means for companies and their investments in oil producing markets. While Russia and Venezuela are floundering, the Middle East is still attractive.</p><p>Oil prices in mid-January hit a six-year low of $47 a barrel, although they have now rebounded somewhat to $57 a barrel. Middle Eastern oil producers with well-managed economies are the best placed to weather the storm. Countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for example, are able to produce oil relatively cheaply, at around $22-25 a barrel, according to industry analysts, giving them some leeway when prices fall. And while their governments' budgets require oil prices higher than current levels to meet spending plans, they have had the discipline and foresight to build up huge financial reserves during the period of high oil prices, cushioning them further should low prices be sustained. For example, Saudi Arabia has reserves of well over $800bn, and UAE over $1.1 trillion. </p><p>Some Middle Eastern countries have used these oil-generated reserves to stem political unrest and prevent the Arab Spring from spreading. They have invested to improve living standards, often focusing on healthcare. For example, in 2013, Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah approved $4bn for healthcare projects, including new hospitals. Meanwhile, the UAE is encouraging greater use of health insurance schemes, and earlier this year Dubai formally introduced a new law requiring compulsory insurance for all residents.</p><p>For Astellas, which has just opened an office in Dubai, this is part of the attraction to the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa (MENA/SSA) region. The region, with a population of 305 million, spends around $144bn on healthcare.</p><p>In addition, within the region there is an increasing demand for effective new pharmaceuticals, including urology and oncology products, which fits well with Astellas' portfolio. The firm is set to launch its prostate cancer drug Xtandi, among other products, in up to six countries in the region over 2015 and 2016. According to the company, many prostate cancer patients in the region would previously have had to travel to Europe or the US to get treatment. And there are other opportunities too: for example, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are trying to attract more medical tourism, already a growth area, says Astellas. </p><p>The company expects double digit growth in the MENA/SSA region of around 11%."Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is a key territory for Astellas, contributing around one quarter of global profit and sales. In Fiscal Year 2013, sales in the EMEA increased for the third consecutive year to &euro;1,967m, a growth of 8.1% year-on-year," it said.</p><p>The fall in oil price does not worry the firm. "The drop is temporary; I don't think it's going to be a long-term thing. The reserves that these countries have are absolutely tremendous and they can weather a long-term low price. The most important thing is keeping their populations satisfied," said Ken Jones, president & CEO of Astellas Pharma EMEA in an interview. What is more likely to affect growth is the extent to which authorities fulfill their promises to implement first class healthcare systems, he said. But for Mr Jones, the biggest threat of all is conflict. "Let's be very clear, the amount of military conflict is quite high. That has more of an impact than the oil price," he said.</p><h2>Venezuela and Russia</h2><p>However, the situation is different elsewhere and the dive in oil prices has battered other economies and pharmaceutical markets. The price slump has hit Venezuela and Russia hard, not only because their oil is more expensive to extract, but also because of the very high prices needed to meet government budget requirements. </p><p>In the case of oil-dependent Venezuela (where more than 90% of its export revenues come from oil) previous economic mismanagement means they do not have the financial reserves available to cushion the impact of low prices. Now, according to local media reports, medicine shortages are worsening as the country lacks some $4bn to pay industry for raw materials and finished goods. </p><p>Meanwhile, Russia's pharmaceutical market, which nearly tripled between 2005 and 2012 to $18.7bn, is running into trouble too. Sanctions and falling crude prices prompted a decline in the value of local currency against the dollar, which spelled trouble for industry. Some Indian generics manufacturers have frozen exports until they can be sure of payment (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Russian-oil-spill-may-slide-Dr-Reddys-Glenmark-in-Q3-356272" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 21 January, 2015</a>). </p>
