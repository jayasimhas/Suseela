<p>Sarissa Capital Management has named a third nominee for the Ariad Pharmaceuticals board of directors, Biotest CEO Bernard Ehmer, but the activist investor did not say in its 24 February filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which current board member Sarissa is looking to replace.</p><p>The Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund said earlier in the month when it named its first two nominees for election to the Ariad board that Sarissa reserved the right to nominate a third potential board nominee (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sarissa-seeks-Ariad-CEOs-retirement-board-member-replacements-356877" target="_new">20 February 2015</a>). The investment firm initially indicated that it wants to replace CEO and chairman Harvey Berger as well as lead independent director Wayne Wilson.</p><p>Sarissa, Ariad's largest shareholder, already has a seat on the company's board, since the hedge fund's founder and chief investment officer Alex Denner was named a director in February 2014. Mr Denner's appointment followed a voluntary recall for Ariad's only commercial product, the leukemia drug Iclusig (ponatinib), which returned to the market a few months later with modified prescribing instructions to avoid cardiovascular safety risks (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Iclusig-back-on-US-market-Ariad-rises-349430" target="_new">20 January 2014</a>).</p><p>Sarissa said in its mid-February SEC filing that it wants to replace Dr Berger and Mr Wilson with Richard Mulligan and Anna Protopapas. Dr Mulligan is a founding partner of Sarissa, a Biogen Idec board member and an emeritus genetics professor at Harvard Medical School. Ms Protopapas is a former Millennium Pharmaceuticals executive.</p><p><p><p><p>
