<p>India stays a "priority watch list" partner nation that presents the most significant intellectual property rights (IPR)-related concerns for the US but was spared another immediate out-of-cycle review (OCR) in view of steps initiated by the Indian government indicating that it is "engaged and examining" key IPR issues.</p><p>The US Trade Representative's (USTR) 2015 "Special 301" report, which keeps 13 nations including India, China and Russia on the priority watch list &ndash; an increase over last year's figure of 10 &ndash; is laced with "full expectation" that the new channels for engagement created between the US and India in the past year will bring about "substantive and measurable" improvements in India&rsquo;s IPR regime.</p><p>Specific mention was also made to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement last month recommending that India align its patent laws with international standards though Indian firms have argued that too much was being read into the PM's words, which was also perhaps being taken out of context in the case of pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The report said that the US was not announcing another OCR "at this time", but would monitor progress over the coming months, and is prepared to take further action, if necessary. The US <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/USTR-keeps-India-IPR-review-threat-alive-354490%5d" target="_new">conducted an OCR</a> in India in autumn 2014.</p><p>References to the controversial Section 3d of India's Patent Act, compulsory licensing and the high-octane Merck vs Glenmark case [pertaining to Merck's diabetes therapies, Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin hydrochloride)] on the "challenges involved with the enforcement of patent rights in India" continue to feature in this year's Special 301 report too, but the overall tone is perhaps slightly less caustic.</p><p>Section 3(d) broadly deals with incremental inventions that are not patentable unless they show improved efficacy or unless a known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.</p><p>The 2015 "Special 301" report refers to India's continued engagement with the US on IPR issues of interest to both countries, including by establishing the High Level Working Group on Intellectual Property, which operates under the auspices of the US-India Trade Policy Forum. </p><p>"In our bilateral dialogue, the US is working with India to foster an environment that will enable India to achieve its important domestic policy goals of increasing investment and stimulating innovation through, not at the expense of, IPR protection and enforcement. Attention to our IPR priorities and action to resolve concerns through bilateral fora can benefit both the US and India." </p><p>Patient groups have, however, sought a review of the setting up of the US India Trade Policy Forum. The forum, these groups claim, will lead to "closed-door, continuous" bilateral negotiations with the USTR on IP issues, which in the long run may lead to TRIPS Plus measures or the undermining of public health safeguards in the patent law, in a way that suits foreign right holders rather than local conditions, and as such is an attempt to "limit the policy space" of India.</p><p>The USTR report also referred to India's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Speedy-dispute-resolution-on-Indian-IPR-policy-agenda-355866%5d" target="_new">proposed National IPR Policy</a>, a first draft of which was presented for public comment in December 2014 and to which the US has submitted comments in January 2015. In view of the "many informative inputs" following the publication of the first draft, the US has requested that India solicit another round of inputs, and conduct another round of stakeholder consultations on the next iteration of this draft policy. </p><p>Indian industry experts said that a "sustained and aggressive" campaign by the innovator pharmaceutical lobby in the US had created a false perception that India's IP regime does not protect their innovation. </p><p>They indicated to <i>Scrip</i> that India had granted about 63,000 patents across 20 segments including pharmaceuticals between 2005 and 2014, and around 82% of these were to foreign firms. In addition, data revealed that while India had had revoked 67 patents between 1995 and October 10 2014, the US had revoked 253 patents between 2007 and 2011.</p><h2>Compulsory licensing</h2><p>The USTR report, while underscoring its commitment to the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, adds that US continues to monitor India&rsquo;s application of its compulsory licensing law. </p><p>"The US requests clarity from the Government of India regarding the compulsory license decision-making process as it affects US stakeholders." </p><p>As in <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/USTR-threatens-India-review-as-it-remains-on-watch-list-351549%5d" target="_new">2014 Special 301 report</a>, the US reiterated its concern at the fact that though India has issued only one <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/USTR-threatens-India-review-as-it-remains-on-watch-list-351549%5d" target="_new">compulsory license</a> [for Bayer's Nexavar], it has made clear that it views this as an important tool of industrial policy for green technologies, with the potential to be applied more regularly across economic sectors. </p><p>Enforcement of patent rights is another area that continues to be flagged up, with specific mention of the Merck versus Glenmark <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Indian-court-blocks-Glenmarks-Januvia-generic-but-it-aint-over-yet-357431" target="_new">case</a>. The US referred to challenges that patent holders face in securing injunctions against firms that manufacture patented inventions without authorization from the patent holder. Additionally, it also referred to how while approving such manufacture, Indian state governmental authorities do not have a mechanism to confirm whether the item to be manufactured is under patent. </p><p>Activists, though, urge India to stay "vigilant" with regard to the very real risk of "over enforcement measures" being applied in India, which would be felt beyond its borders, as exports of medicines could be delayed or stopped due to IP enforcement disputes. </p><p>The US also said that it remained concerned about actions and policies in India that appear to favour local manufacturing or Indian IPR owners in a manner that distorts the competitive landscape needed to ensure the development of globally-successful and innovative industries. </p><p>In addition to past references to India&rsquo;s Drug Prices Control Order which provides certain exemptions for certain medicines that are manufactured in India and developed using indigenous R&D, the report also raises concerns over the apparent unpredictability of India's trial related regulations. </p><p>"Despite a Central Drug Standard Control Organization office order on waiver of local clinical trial requirements, industry still faces inconsistent application of requirements for local clinical trial data for approval of new drugs," the report said.</p>
