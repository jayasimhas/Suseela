<p>Amgen is to acquire Dezima Pharma B.V., which recently published highly positive Phase IIb data with its CETP inhibitor TA-8995 suggesting it might have potential as a more cost-effective option for lowering cholesterol than the PCSK9 inhibitor approach. Amgen just had its cholesterol-lowering injectable PCSK9 inhibitor antibody Repatha (evolocumab) approved.</p><p>Under the agreement, Amgen will pay $300m in cash and up to $1.25bn in additional payments if certain development and sales milestones are achieved. Low single-digit royalties will also be paid above a certain sales threshold. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, and Dezima will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. </p><p>Dezima published the data from the Phase IIb TULIP study <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dezimas-CETP-inhibitor-could-be-cheaper-oral-alternative-to-PCSK9s-358730" target="_new">in the Lancet in June</a> 2015. There was a corresponding editorial in the publication. "The magnitude of the reduction in LDL cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) achieved by TA-8995 means that this oral compound is comparable with the potent subcutaneous PCSK9 inhibitors. This makes TA-8995 a potentially viable, and likely cheaper, oral alternative to PCSK9 inhibitors," said researchers Kausik Ray and Antonio Vallejo-Vaz.</p><p>The data generated an "incredible amount of interest," study investigator and Dezima founder Professor John Kastelein told <i>Scrip</i> at the time. The publication and the interest were timely as the next step in the product's development is a large Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial. </p><p>"We had many options for financing the trial," confirmed Sander Slootweg, managing partner at Forbion Capital Partners and one of Dezima's venture capital backers. "There was lots of competition for the deal that was eventually reached with Amgen, but we were also independently preparing a large private financing round which would have been followed by an initial public offering. But then we decided that with the magnitude of the task at hand, it was better to go with a large committed partner such as Amgen."</p><p>Dezima Pharma was founded in 2012 by Prof Kastelein, who is professor of medicine at the department of vascular medicine at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam. Apart from Forbion, investors include BioGeneration Ventures and New Science Ventures. TA-8995 was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Additional-properties-signal-promise-of-Mitsubishi-Tanabes-out-licensed-CETP-inhibitor-339270" target="_new">in-licensed</a> from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma.</p><p>Mitsubishi will receive a portion of the upfront payment, future development and sales milestone payments, and royalties. It will also retain development and commercialization rights to TA-8995 in certain territories in Asia, including Japan.</p><p>Mitsubishi's decision to out-license TA-8995 in 2013 came after CETP inhibition had fallen out of favor with pharma companies after two high profile failures.</p><p>Roche <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CETP-arena-sees-another-major-casuality-as-Roche-drops-dalcetrapib-330242" target="_new">abandoned</a> Phase III studies of the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib in 2012 after an interim analysis of the dal-OUTCOMES study revealed a lack of clinically meaningful efficacy.</p><p>In addition, Pfizer's CETP inhibitor torcetrapib came to a very public end in late 2006, after being hit in Phase III by increased risk of death and cardiovascular events associated with raised blood pressure, altered serum electrolytes and increased aldosterone levels rather than a lack of efficacy.</p><p>These failures <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-is-a-lonely-hunter-in-CETP-field-342787" target="_new">dampened sentiment</a> for this class with just Merck & Co's anacetrapib and Lilly's evacetrapib still ongoing in Phase III.</p><p>"We are planning a Phase III trial the size of Lilly's 12,000-patient ACCELERATE evacetrapib study rather than Merck's 30,000-patient REVEAL anacetrapib study," revealed Prof Kastelein in June. </p><p>"With the recent launches of Repatha and Corlanor (ivabradine), and today's acquisition of Dezima, Amgen is proud to be on the leading edge of an exciting new wave of treatments for cardiovascular disease," said Robert Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer of Amgen.</p><p>"With a portfolio of TA-8995 and Repatha, we will be able to offer more treatment options with different mechanisms of action and modes of administration across varying LDL-C levels and risk profiles," added Dr Sean Harper, executive vice president of R&D at Amgen. </p><p>
