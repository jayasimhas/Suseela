<p>Having already launched programs this year on an Ebola vaccine and the adaptive pathways approach to drug development, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a European public-private collaboration, is now preparing to launch a number of projects looking at how "big data" can be used to improve health outcomes.</p><p>Among the topics being considered are support for outcomes-focused and sustainable health care systems, real world outcomes in Alzheimer's disease, and an outcomes-focussed platform to optimize care for patients with hematological malignancies.</p><p>These are part of a wider program called "Big Data for Better Outcomes". The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which is the co-sponsor of the IMI together with the European Commission, said development of the program was under way and that the first topics would be announced under the next round of IMI calls for proposals due to be launched in the autumn.</p><p>The IMI is now in its second iteration, IMI2, which is aiming to develop next-generation vaccines, medicines and treatments. Like the first phase of the initiative, it will bring together companies, regulators, universities, public laboratories, innovative small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and patient groups in collaborative projects to help tackle growing health challenges and ensure the future competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe.</p><p>Outlining the rationale for the big data initiative, EFPIA and the IMI note that Europe's health care systems are facing significant challenges such as managing aging populations, a growing incidence of chronic diseases, and intense budgetary pressures. Furthermore, there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating that health outcomes vary widely within and across healthcare systems, regions and countries. </p><p>In parallel, R&D pipelines are delivering new therapies that will contribute to significantly improving management of acute and chronic diseases. While these will inevitably have a short-term impact on disease management budgets, in the longer run they will deliver significant savings for healthcare budgets, the organizations say. </p><p>Greater availability of large health and population data sets, combined with growing analytic capabilities, could help health care systems to better understand patient outcomes, they suggest. However, they point out that many investments in large datasets and real world evidence are uncoordinated, duplicative and inefficient because of the lack of agreement on standardized outcomes that matter to patients and of appropriate data sources and methods to collect, analyse and use the data.</p><h2>Big Data Program</h2><p>The IMI's big data program is designed to maximize the potential of big data in the context of European healthcare and support moves towards outcomes-focussed and sustainable health care systems.</p><p>It is intended to look at which outcomes matter to patients with conditions with high economic and health burden, and at the relevance of those outcomes for different uses such as reimbursement and assessing effectiveness of a treatment. It will also focus on capturing high-quality comparable outcomes data and develop analytical tools to gain insights from those data to drive clinical improvements and decision making. </p><p>Public-private collaboration is the ideal model to get improved outcomes by using big data as it leverages expertise of private firms and public entities, the IMI and EFPIA say. </p><p>The two organizations held a consultation on the program in May-June this year, based on a concept paper that asked respondents which therapeutic areas or types of products would most benefit from such an approach, which aspects of measuring health outcomes would benefit from a multi-stakeholder collaboration, who should take part, and what they should contribute.</p><p>Respondents suggested many therapeutic areas for inclusion, such as cardiovascular diseases, oncology, rare diseases, multiple sclerosis, dementias and age-related cognitive disorders, human infertility, medication during pregnancy, respiratory diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, and infectious diseases. An approach addressing chronic disease in the elderly, including co-morbidities, was also proposed.</p><p>It was generally agreed that projects within the programme needed to address challenges in data privacy, data interoperability and comparability, including differences in data capture and data quality. </p><p>Moreover, patients and their representative bodies were seen as key stakeholders in the programme and are expected to be active partners in the shaping of all projects in order to reflect their needs. The relevance of their participation will be made explicit in the call text for all projects and particular attention will be paid to promoting the calls within this stakeholder group. </p><p>Beyond patients and patient organizations, the following are expected to be involved if the programme is to be successful: healthcare providers, physicians, regulatory bodies, HTAs, payers, academia, scientific groups, registries, organizations with access to long-term follow-up data in real-life situations, experts in managing governance and patient rights, data and bioinformatics ethicists, experts in data analysis (clinical, epidemiological, health economic), key opinion leaders, data collection software companies and so on. </p><h2>Key Topics</h2><p>The key topics under consideration for inclusion in the program are:</p><p><b>Coordination and Support Action (CSA) for the Big Data for Better Outcomes programme</b>. This will help to ensure consistency in definition of outcomes across therapeutic areas, provide methodology support, share learnings across projects and ensure consistency and high quality of resulting outcomes sets. Through this coordination, the programme will help healthcare systems to focus on the value and transparency of outcomes in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. </p><p><b>Real-world outcomes across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum (ROADS)</b>. Initiatives to ate have advanced the understanding of biomarkers in highly selected subjects, but these have not been paired to map the biology of the disease to concurrent and downstream clinical and cost outcomes in clinical practice, EFPIA and the IMI say. This project aims to increase understanding of outcomes across the AD spectrum by defining the relevance of various outcomes for different uses, look at how to integrate real world evidence, and develop analytical tools using retrospective data to compare results from existing assessments and predict late-stage outcomes. </p><p><b>Outcomes-focused platform for hematologic malignancies</b>. These include Hodgkins lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (nNHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and together they account for about one-third of cancer cases in children and about one-third of cancer deaths. Patients are treated aggressively with multiple courses of chemotherapies, despite which, 20-30% of children and 40% of adults relapse and are refractory to treatments, with poor prognosis. The aim of this project is to better define outcomes for specific types of malignancies, develop an outcomes-focussed data platform, and establish a pan-EU framework to assess health outcomes achieved with cell and gene therapies. The platform will also look at outcomes in diseases like CV, MS, psoriasis, solid tumours and rare diseases.</p><h2>Other Areas</h2><p>Beyond the big data and outcomes program, three other topics are being considered for inclusion in the autumn calls: </p><p><b>New quantitative system toxicology (QST) approaches to improve understanding of safety of new drugs</b>. Despite more than a decade of work&sbquo; -omics and other high-content approaches that have largely been used to identify signatures of toxicity have not dramatically altered pharmaceutical safety assessment practices. The continued need to move away from traditional safety assessment methods is increasing pressure from outside and within the industry to utilize new technologies more effectively. At the same time, the increasing availability of large comprehensive datasets, and the development of modeling and bioinformatics approaches, offer an opportunity to develop quantitative approaches for predicting drug toxicity. </p><p>While the pharmaceutical industry is expected to assume a leadership position on these strategies to ensure the applications address the most clinically relevant safety questions and use the most effective approaches, building QST approaches requires a specific set of expertise from experimental sciences (toxicology, -omics, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), fundamental biology, mathematics), as well as computer science (big data, computational biology, systems biology, modeling and simulation) that cannot be found in a single pharmaceutical company or academic institution.</p><p><b>Assessing and reducing the impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection</b>. Incentives for the development of robust sources of data are currently limited by the lack of funding for the prevention and treatment of RSV infection, classification of disease severity and prediction of long-term sequelae. This project will therefore look for new ways in which the public and private sectors can collaborate to ensure that valid and robust data relating to RSV are generated, analysed and communicated. The RSV project aims to align and understand the unmet needs in public health and to develop a shared platform of knowledge with which to map out the disease and its sequelae and to identify the direct and long-term burden on healthcare systems. </p><p>An IMI-based approach could ensure that different perspectives, and a wide range of different evidence sources, are gathered and synthesised. Different stakeholders need to be involved in this public private partnership in order to secure its successful development and implementation: Public health, industry (big pharma, SMEs, venture capital), academia, clinical societies, governments, payers, EU member states, patients.</p><p><b>Joint monitoring of the effectiveness of influenza vaccine</b>. No details are given on this project.</p><p>EFPIA and the IMI caution that all information regarding future IMI call topics is indicative and subject to change. Final information about future IMI calls will be communicated after approval by the IMI governing board.</p>
