<p>Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche, is teaming up with personal genetics firm 23andMe to research new therapeutic targets for treating Parkinson's disease. </p><p>The multi-year collaboration will generate whole genome sequencing data for approximately 3,000 people in 23andMe's Parkinson's disease community with the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets for treating the disease.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the collaboration, 23andMe will have the ability to conduct additional research on the data; as well as the ability to make the information, which will be de-identified, available to Parkinson's researchers globally. </p><p>"This collaboration is truly emblematic of both companies' broader vision of improving the human condition through genetic research," 23andMe president Andy Page said. "We are incredibly excited to work with Genentech again." Most recently the two companies collaborated on the InVite study, researching metastatic breast cancer and what role genes might play in how a person responds to Roche's Avastin (bevacizumab). </p><h2>More deals for 23andMe?</h2><p>Unnamed sources have speculated that this most recent deal could be worth a potential $60m to 23andMe, $10m upfront and up to $50m in milestone payments, but the company did not disclose financial information for the deal and decline to comment. 23andMe did say it is "well-funded through venture capital and has a total investment of $126m to date." </p><p>Reports also noted rumors that this is just the first of an anticipated seven or eight pharma deals 23andMe expects to complete in the near future. But the company could not confirm this and only said "23andMe frequently collaborates on research efforts with academic and industry partners." </p><p>Past partners include: Pfizer for IBD research announced in 2013; and TogetherRA, for a study of rheumatoid arthritis, in partnership with Janssen and MediGuard.</p><h2>Approval in US</h2><p>23andMe's main product is Personal Genome Service, which allows people to send their saliva in a testing kit to have their DNA screened. The test provides information on genes associated with certain inherited conditions such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia, and on ancestry research. However, it is not classed as a diagnostic tool. </p><p>The product was banned from providing health related results in the US in November 2013, when the US FDA said 23andMe failed to provide adequate information to back up claims it made about results of the spit test. The test now only sells in the US to provide ancestry information. But the company told Scrip it is "fully committed to completing the regulatory review process and is actively working to do so by partnering with the FDA. We currently have a 510(k) application for a health report under review by the FDA. Once cleared, this submission could provide a foundation for future submissions."</p><p>The product, for both uses, was approved in the UK in December last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/23andMes-genome-test-launches-in-UK-after-US-ban-355385" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 3 December 2014</a>). </p>
