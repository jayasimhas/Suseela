<p>Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Ranbaxy Laboratories appear to be on course to seal the divestment of seven products ahead of their proposed combination in India.</p><p>Investment banking sources told <i>Scrip</i> that Citibank had the mandate for the proposed divestment, which has probably been near sealed. </p><p>''The deal is likely to been struck at around two times sales,'' a source said, adding that a local player could potentially emerge as the successful suitor.</p><p>Sun made no definitive comment on a potential deal but told <i>Scrip </i>that the divestment process was currently ''in progress'' as per the order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Â ''However, it will be premature to discuss specific details,'' the company added.</p><p>The CCI approved the Sun-Ranbaxy combination proposal on 5 December 2014 subject to certain preconditions such as the divestment of seven products. Sun stated at the time that the products account for less than 1% of the combined entity's revenues in India.</p><p>The CCI had focused its investigation on 49 relevant product segments where the proposed combination was likely to have ''appreciable adverse effect'' on competition in in India, before zeroing down on the recommendation to divest the seven products. </p><p><p>The brands to be divested are: Sun's Tamlet (tamsulosin + tolterodine) and six from the Ranbaxy stable: Eligard (leuprorelin), Terlibax (terlipressin), Rosuvas EZ (rosuvastatin + ezetimibe), Olanex F (olanzapine + fluoxetine), Raciper L (levosulpiride + esomeprazole) and Triolvance (olmesartan + amlodipine + hydrochlorothiazide). The divestment is to include all strengths, indications, dosages and packaging (in all forms). </p><p><p>The CCI also added that should the divestiture of distribution rights of Eligard not be achieved within the first divestiture period, Sun would then need to divest its products containing leuprorelin, currently marketed as Lupride. </p><p><p>The divesture plans, though, need to be approved by the CCI. </p><p><p>Analysts said that Sun was moving swiftly as it was keen to get on with the combination, rather than eyeing incremental valuation gains for the brands. Last April, in a landmark $4bn transaction, Sun announced plans to acquire Ranbaxy, with the combine set to emerge as the fifth largest global specialty generic pharma firm with operations in 65 countries and 47 manufacturing sites across five continents <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indias-turnaround-specialist-Sun-snaps-Ranbaxy-in-4bn-deal-351127%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 7 April 2014)</a>. </p><p>Some analysts also claimed that certain brands on the block may have made an interesting fit for Natco Pharma, but the fact that Sun's founder and managing director, Dilip Shanghvi, owns a small personal stake in Natco would have potentially disqualified the Hyderabad based company. Sun has termed Mr Shanghvi's investment in Natco as '' passive and non-strategic'' <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Suns-founder-takes-3-in-Natco-passive-investment-324544%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 December 2011)</a>. Natco's shareholding pattern as of the quarter ended December 2014 indicates that Mr Shanghvi holds 3.46% in the company. </p><p>The CCI order stipulates that a potential purchaser should be ''independent of and with no connection whatsoever'' with Sun/Ranbaxy and also that the combining parties shall, for five years from the closing date, not acquire ''direct or indirect'' influence over the whole or part of the divestment product.</p><p>
