<p>Nina Pham, one of two Dallas nurses who became infected with Ebola after caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the disease, is suing her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian, her lawyer said.</p><p>Ms Pham, who was the first known US transmission of Ebola, is claiming the hospital and its parent company, Texas Health Resources, failed to provide the nurse and her colleagues with the proper training and equipment to care for someone with Ebola, putting the healthcare workers' well-being at risk.</p><p>She was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian on 10 October 2014 after reporting a fever (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-US-Ebola-transmission-dialysis-intubation-PPE-scrutinized-354408" target="_new">12 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Nurse-gets-Ebola-survivor-plasma-ZMapp-maker-ups-efforts-354424" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Ms Pham and her colleague, Amber Vinson, contracted Ebola after caring for Mr Duncan, who had been infected in his homeland of Liberia before flying to the US in September. </p><p>When Mr Duncan first arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian's emergency room, the hospital had botched his diagnosis &ndash; sending him home with some antibiotics (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gambling-on-Ebola-1st-US-case-sparks-stock-fervor-354228" target="_new">01 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Botched-Texas-Ebola-case-may-indicate-US-not-fully-prepared-354255" target="_new">02 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Texas-Ebola-mix-up-blamed-on-flawed-electronic-health-record-354276" target="_new">3 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Ebola-disclosures-get-messy-354299" target="_new">05 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Mr Duncan returned to the hospital, but died a little over a week later on 8 October (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Playing-God-in-the-time-of-Ebola-Who-gets-care-354361" target="_new">09 October 2014</a>).</p><p>Ms Pham was later transferred to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for care at its special clinical studies unit, which is designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists. Ms Vinson was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta &ndash; the same facility that had cared for the first two Americans to be treated in the US for Ebola, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. Both of the Texas Health nurses recovered from the disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/2nd-Texas-nurse-survives-Ebola-discharged-from-hospital-354730" target="_new">29 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola-drugs-vaccines-advance-US-frets-354531" target="_new">17 October 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Miracle-ZMapp-or-a-strapping-immune-system-353501" target="_new">22 August 2014</a>).</p><p>This past October, Texas Health acknowledged it had made mistakes in Mr Duncan's initial diagnosis (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Texas-hospital-admits-mistakes-in-Ebola-cases-354551" target="_new">20 October 2014</a>).</p><p>But Ms Pham, who was warmly greeted at the White House with a big hug by President Barack Obama after her discharge from the NIH Clinical Center on 24 October 2014, is asserting Texas Health used her to bolster its public image after failing so badly to care for Mr Duncan &ndash; even releasing a video of the nurse in her hospital bed without her permission.</p><p>A spokesman for Texas Health said the hospital is continuing to support Ms Pham and is hoping to resolve the matter amicably. </p><p>This article also may be read at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">US Capitol Capsule</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
