<p>When it comes to legal battles involving free speech under the First Amendment of the US Constitution, the outcome of a broad ruling is always a wildcard.</p><p>But a case filed last week by &ldquo;big tobacco&rdquo; against the FDA asserting violations of the industry's commercial free speech could ultimately have implications for biopharmaceutical makers, particularly involving the agency's regulations and guidelines governing communications about off-label uses of drugs &ndash; an issue Congress also currently is examining and may tackle as part of the 21st Century Cures bill.</p><p>At issue for the tobacco companies is the FDA's March guidance calling for prior approval for certain changes to product labels.</p><p>Lorillard Tobacco, Altria units Philip Morris and US Smokeless Tobacco and RJ Reynolds Tobacco and its subsidiaries American Snuff and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco are insisting they will be harmed by such a measure because it could take the FDA several months or even years to give its OK to new labels. The companies said the FDA's guidance also creates new burdens for the industry.</p><p>In their lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the firms are accusing the FDA of seeking to assert a "broad power of prior restraint" over the companies' marketing communications through the final guidance document &ndash; violating the First Amendment and the law that gave the agency the authority to regulate the industry, the <i>Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) of 2009</i>.</p><p>The tobacco companies also are arguing the FDA used guidance to avoid requirements of notice and comment under the <i>Administrative Procedure Act</i> &ndash; creating "specific legal obligations with clear and draconian consequences for violations."</p><p>Under the TCA, the tobacco manufacturers must obtain the FDA's authorization before making changes to cigarettes, smokeless tobacco or any other tobacco product on the market regulated by the agency.</p><p>But, the companies said, Congress specifically rejected giving the FDA the power in the TCA to pre-approve changes to tobacco product labels, except in two circumstances: where the label makes a modified risk claim and where the agency adopts a specific pre-approval regulation through notice-and-comment rulemaking.</p><p>The FDA's March 2015 guidance, <i>Demonstrating the Substantial Equivalence of a New Tobacco Product: Responses to Frequently Asked Questions</i>, the firms said, "disregarded Congress' carefully calibrated statutory framework" by directing the companies to obtain pre-authorization before making any label changes that would render a tobacco product "distinct" from the predecessor version, even though there is no change to the product itself. </p><p>The directives in the FDA's guidance, the tobacco companies charged, are "arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance of law and in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority and limitation."</p><p>For drugs, labeling changes always must be approved by the FDA &ndash; although there's currently an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Whos-responsible-for-safety-updates-Generics-rule-debated-357551" target="_new">ongoing debate</a> about the agency's proposed rule that would permit generic manufacturers to independently revise their product labeling to add new safety updates before regulators review or approve such changes, just like brand-name firms do already.</p><p>And US regulations governing prior approval of certain types of advertising for biopharmaceuticals, like those granted accelerated approval or for which the FDA has received information that has not been widely publicized in medical literature that the use of the drug may cause fatalities or serious damage, also are pretty well established, with no real legal pushback from industry, said Washington lawyer Peter Reichertz, a partner at Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton.</p><p>But the tobacco lawsuit may end up having implications for the drug industry when it comes to arguments about the FDA's rules over off-label promotion, Mr Reichertz told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The federal government has repeatedly prosecuted and obtained convictions against biopharmaceutical companies and their sales reps for misbranding based on off-label promotional activities deemed illegal, with most manufacturers agreeing to settle the charges &ndash; most notably the $3.1bn GlaxoSmithKline paid under a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Paying-3B-GSK-tops-US-criminal-civil-settlements-for-off-label-other-schemes-332383" target="_new">July 2012 settlement</a>, which was the largest combined federal and state healthcare fraud recovery in a single global resolution in US history.</p><p>But the FDA came out the loser in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Americans-unwilling-to-sacrifice-Medicare-but-back-better-Part-D-deal-339427" target="_new">December 2012 ruling</a> by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, in which the court overturned the October 2008 conviction of a New York sales representative, Alfred Caronia, for conspiracy to introduce a misbranded drug into interstate commerce related to discussions he had with doctors about unapproved uses for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' narcolepsy drug Xyrem (sodium oxybate).</p><p>In its decision in <i>United States v Caronia</i>, the Second Circuit said "communication of truthful and nonmisleading speech is fully protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and cannot be criminalized by the government."</p><p>The FDA decided <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Americans-unwilling-to-sacrifice-Medicare-but-back-better-Part-D-deal-339427" target="_new">not to appeal</a> the decision.</p><p>The Second Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's 6-3 opinion in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-House-adopts-patent-reform-but-fee-change-could-be-trouble-for-Senate-317676" target="_new">June 2011</a> in <i>Sorrell v IMS Health</i>, in which the high court determined that a Vermont law prohibiting pharmaceutical companies and similar entities from using prescriber-identifying information for marketing purposes violated the First Amendment. </p><p>Speech in aid of pharmaceutical marketing "is a form of expression protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment," Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion. </p><p>The decisions in the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court cases drew quick praise from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which has asserted First Amendment protections for an "open and robust exchange of ideas" limits the FDA's ability to regulate scientific speech.</p><p>PhRMA has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-FDAs-revised-reprint-guidance-chokes-communication-PhRMA-asserts-351775" target="_new">objected</a> to the <i>FDA's Revised Draft Guidance for Industry on Distributing Scientific and Medical Publications on Unapproved New Uses</i> &ndash; asserting the document, issued last year, imposed "unduly and impermissibly burden" on biopharmaceutical companies' "truthful and non-misleading" communications with healthcare professionals, and ultimately risked "chilling the provision of timely, educational and accurate information" to prescribers about certain unapproved uses, "many of which are medically accepted and indeed even the standard of care for certain diseases."</p><p>PhRMA took particular issue with the FDA's insistence that any scientific or medical journal article distributed by drug makers that included information about off-label uses of US approved medicines contain data from "adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations" considered scientifically sound by experts with scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of the product.</p><p>The lobbying group argued the "FDA does not have the legal authority, nor a public health-based justification," to impose such a limitation on companies' dissemination of published literature "simply because the information references unapproved uses."</p><p>Congress currently is working on a provision as part of the 21st Century Cures bill about "facilitating responsible communications of scientific and medical developments," although the language of that measure has yet to be revealed &ndash; with lawmakers only including a holding place in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/21st-Century-Cures-proposals-unveiled-trouble-already-356411" target="_new">draft legislative package unveiled in January</a>.</p><p>A January white paper out of the House Energy & Commerce Committee said the provision would clarify and rationalize the "broader rules of the road so scientific and medical developments can be proactively shared with physicians, insurers and researchers, with appropriate safeguards, in order to optimize patient care."</p><p>"Recognizing the need for important protections to ensure that such information is truthful and non-misleading, policies should not limit the ability of providers, payers and patients to access a robust body of evidence that will allow them to make the most appropriate clinical decisions," the California Healthcare Institute said in comments to the E&C Committee.</p><p>While the Cures bill may address the off-label issue, lawmakers in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee also are scrutinizing what they said was the FDA's use of guidances to make "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-admits-172-guidance-documents-linger-in-draft-form-357211" target="_new">substantive policy changes</a>" &ndash; something four Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander (Tennessee), now the panel's chief, said in a 6 May 2014 letter to the agency raised "significant" concerns.</p><p>Guidance documents "do not offer regulatory certainty," Senator Johnny Isakson (Republican-Georgia), one of the four lawmakers who signed the letter, declared during a 10 March HELP Committee hearing. </p><p>Mr Isakson scolded the FDA not only for taking more than 10 months to respond to the senators about their May 2014 inquiry, but also for having <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-admits-172-guidance-documents-linger-in-draft-form-357211" target="_new">172 guidance documents lingering</a> in draft form, which need to be finalized, revised or withdrawn &ndash; with one remaining in limbo since 1988.</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-to-ALS-biotech-Genervon-Show-us-the-data-357948" target="_new">FDA to ALS biotech Genervon: Show us the data</a></p><p>The FDA on 17 April issued a rare statement calling for Pasadena, California-based Genervon Biopharmaceuticals to release all the data from its recently completed Phase IIa trial for GM604, a 6-amino acid endogenous peptide, which is under investigation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often called Lou Gehrig's disease, a progressive, invariably fatal neurodegenerative condition.
