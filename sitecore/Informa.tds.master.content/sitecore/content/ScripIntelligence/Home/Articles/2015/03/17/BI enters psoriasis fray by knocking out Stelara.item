<p>Boehringer Ingelheim's novel entrant to the anti-inflammatory pipeline, BI-655066, has shown impressive Phase II results when pitted against the current standard of care, ustekinumab (Johnson & Johnson's Stelara) in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.</p><p>In the Phase II study, presented at a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in San Francisco on 20 March, nearly twice the proportion of patients receiving BI-655066 achieved the stringent PASI 90 goal, meaning clear or almost clear skin, after 12 weeks, compared with those on Stelara, the primary endpoint. The safety and tolerability profiles of the two drugs were similar.</p><p>The company is now recruiting investigators for a Phase III trial. "These Phase II study results in psoriasis mark a major milestone in our growing immunology research and clinical programme," said Dr Steven Padula, the company's therapeutic area head medicine immunology. </p><p>BI-655066 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes the p19 subunit of IL-23, making it similar to other more advanced anti-IL23 candidates: J&J's guselkumab and Merck & Co's/Sun Pharma's tildrakizumab, both in Phase III for psoriasis. </p><p>If reproduced on a larger scale the encouraging data will stand BI-655066 in good stead as it seeks to catch up in an increasingly crowded therapeutic area.</p><p>Stelara superseded the established anti-TNFs Enbrel, Remicade and Humira as the standard of treatment in moderate to severe psoriasis but it is now being challenged by Novartis's recently approved anti-IL17 product Cosentyx (secukinumab), with further competition from other anti-IL17s, Amgen/AstraZeneca's brodalumab and Eli Lilly's ixekizumab, not far behind in Phase III. The product is expected to need to rely on dermatologists' conservative prescribing practices to maintain its market presence. </p><p>Meanwhile, the FDA has accepted for review the sNDA for Pfizer's small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib citrate) for adults with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, but its competitiveness is expected to be dependent on long-term safety data. Added to the mix is the arrival of biosimilar versions of the anti-TNFs like Remicade.</p><h2>BI study</h2><p>In the study, 166 patients were randomized to three doses groups of BI 655066 (18, 90 or 180mg by sc injection) or ustekinumab (one of two sc doses according to its label). </p><p>Pooling the results from the two highest doses, 77.1% of BI-655066 patients achieved PASI 90 compared with 40% of Stelara patients. Secondary endpoint measures showed 90% of BI 655066 patients had clear or almost clear skin versus 67.5% for ustekinumab using sPGA (static Physician Global Assessment).</p><p>In addition, 46% of psoriasis patients on BI-655066 achieved completely clear skin (PASI 100) after 12 weeks compared with 17.5% of Stelara patients. The most commonly reported side-effects in the trial were nasopharyngitis and headache. </p><p>&ldquo;The results of this study are compelling," said lead investigator K Alexander Papp of Probity Medical Research, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. "[They] are particularly encouraging given the study focused on a new treatment goal of PASI 90... Furthermore, we saw that patients continued to achieve clear or almost clear skin beyond week 12."</p><p><p>
