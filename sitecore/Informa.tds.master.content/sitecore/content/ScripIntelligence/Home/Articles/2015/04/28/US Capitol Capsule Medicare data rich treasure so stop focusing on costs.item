<p>With the mega dump of prescriber-level data late last week by the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), attention quickly focused on the costs of the drugs being prescribed to America's elderly and disabled.</p><p>But the data on more than one million US healthcare providers, who collectively prescribed $103bn in prescription drugs in 2013, provides a treasure chest just waiting to be explored by industry, academicians and others, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the Washington-based analysis and consulting firm Avalere Health, who said his company is spending the next few weeks diving into the deep of the CMS dataset.</p><p>For instance, he told <i>Scrip</i>, if used appropriately, the data can stimulate conversations between doctors and patients about which drugs are the best choice for them, based on several factors.</p><p>Even though limited to Part D, the data may provide information on geographic variation in prescribing patterns and why doctors tend to prescribe one drug over another &ndash; something Mr Mendelson said bears more exploration, understanding and scrutiny.</p><p>The data also may play a role in helping industry better identify and adjust their resources in marketing and sales efforts.</p><p>About 68% of Medicare beneficiaries, or about 36 million Americans, are enrolled in the Part D prescription drug program, according to CMS. </p><p>And now, drug makers will get a firsthand look at who &ndash; by name and location &ndash; is prescribing the companies' medicines to Medicare patients, although CMS emphasized the volume of prescriptions presented in its public use file (PUF) dataset is unlikely to be fully inclusive of all scripts written by the providers listed, since the data are based only on beneficiaries enrolled in Part D.</p><p>"Clinicians typically treat many other patients who do not have that form of coverage," CMS said. </p><p>CMS stressed its PUF dataset does not indicate the quality of care provided by individual clinicians.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mr Mendelson said, the "top 10" ranking tables of medicines by claims and costs released by CMS late on 30 April quickly overshadowed the richness of the other information the data may ultimately reveal once researchers have a chance to dig into it.</p><p>He noted CMS provided no analysis about the real value those prescribed medicines have provided to beneficiaries' overall health and the possible savings of those benefits to taxpayers &ndash; something he said must first be examined thoroughly before anyone can make any sound judgments about spending on Part D-covered therapies.</p><p>And, Mr Mendelson said, the cost figures included in CMS' tables do not reflect any manufacturer rebates paid to Part D plan sponsors &ndash; something the agency did in fact emphasize in its "fact sheet" and "frequently asked questions" pages on its website, although not in its press release.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) each reacted to the immediate focus on costs &ndash; declaring in separate statements the data in the way they were released without the negotiated rebates are misleading.</p><p>"Rebates have been a significant factor in keeping Part D program costs hundreds of billions of dollars below original estimates, while still offering beneficiaries steady premiums and a robust choice of plans, PhRMA said. "As with all data, it is important to look at these numbers in context. As released, these data and analyses may be confusing to beneficiaries, making it difficult for them to better understand how care is delivered under the Part D program."</p><p>Moreover, said BIO, CMS' data "are missing critical context as to how Part D medicines may result in better outcomes and lower costs to the Medicare program, including through fewer hospitalizations, surgical interventions and physician office visits."</p><p>CMS' data contain information on specific drugs prescribed under Part D, statistics on their use and the costs of those medicines.</p><p>To ensure the privacy of the beneficiaries is protected, CMS did not include information in cases where 10 or fewer prescriptions were dispensed, for fear it would be too easy to identify specific patients.</p><p>CMS created the PUF dataset using information from the so-called Prescription Drug Event Standard Analytic File, which has final-action claims submitted by Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans and standalone Prescription Drug Plans. </p><p>For each prescriber and drug, the PUF dataset includes the total number of prescriptions that were dispensed, including original prescriptions and any refills and the total drug cost, which includes the actual cost of the medicine, dispensing fees, sales tax and any applicable administration fees. </p><p>The drug cost data are based on the amounts paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, other government subsidies, and any other third-party payers, such as employers and liability insurers, CMS said.</p><p>CMS pointed out that since its data are aggregated to the drug name level, the data do not account for varying strengths or dosage levels of the medications.</p><p>Mr Mendelson said it would have been helpful had CMS included Part D plan tier information in the agency's PUF dataset, which could have helped researchers have a better understanding of certain economic aspects about the information on the drugs being prescribed. </p><p>He said he fully expected that as more analyses of the data are completed and publicized, the information will fill many practical purposes.</p><p>On this flip side, however, "it's really important to treat the data with respect," Mr Mendelson warned. "In other words, you can't immediately assume something about provider behavior on the basis of the data. You have to understand why the data are the way they are."</p><p>For instance, he said, if a physician in the PUF dataset is prescribing a lot of opioids, that doctor might be practicing rehabilitative medicine with several patients with certain conditions requiring those medicines.</p><p>"So you can't assume they are doing it for some nefarious purpose," Mr Mendelson said.</p><p>While there's already been a lot of criticism about the way in which CMS released the data &ndash; almost ensuring costs of certain medicines would grab the spotlight &ndash; Mr Mendelson insisted any release of those types of data "is good" because it increases transparency.</p><p>But, he said, "it's still important for all of us to look at it and understand what the limitations are."</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Patent-reform-its-all-about-the-trolls-no-Bass-358182" target="_new">Patent reform: it's all about the trolls, no 'Bass'</a></p><p>While lawmakers on Capitol Hill have concentrated the latest attempts at patent reform on so-called patent trolls &ndash; entities that acquire patents for the sole purpose of forcing companies to pay licensing fees or settling infringement suits through threats of aggressive litigation &ndash; the biopharmaceutical industry has been pleading for a fix to a problem that sprung up as an unintended consequence from the last time Congress tried to repair the US patent system.</p><p>As part of the <i>America Invents Act of 2011</i>, lawmakers created the <i>inter partes</i> review (IPR) process, which was intended to be a faster and more affordable way to challenge patents than going through the US court system &ndash; a process that can take from one to three years. But PhRMA and BIO have insisted the IPRs are being used in abusive ways for which they were never intended.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">NIH: Thanks for the funds; FDA: Where's ours?</a></p><p>Lawmakers acknowledged at a 30 April Capitol Hill hearing that much more work needs to be done on a revised bill aimed at overhauling the US biomedical research enterprise and the process for assessing and approving new therapies &ndash; the <i>21st Century Cures Ac</i>t &ndash; which was unveiled a day earlier.
