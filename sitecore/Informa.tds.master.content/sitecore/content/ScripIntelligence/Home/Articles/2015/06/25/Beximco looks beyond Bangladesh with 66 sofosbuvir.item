<p>Bangladesh's Beximco Pharmaceuticals may not be the first onto the local market with its cut-price version of Gilead's hepatitis C blockbuster Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), but the company appears to be pulling out all the stops to establish a stronghold in the market.</p><p>Beximco's newly launched sofosbuvir has been priced at Taka600 ($7.68) per tablet but the firm indicates that prices can drop to Taka517($6.6) per tablet when the product is procured from any of its 28 distribution centres since it would exclude retail margins. Competitor Incepta earlier this year <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bangladeshs-Incepta-leads-LDC-charge-with-10-Sovaldi-generic-356891%5d" target="_new">launched its sofosbuvir</a> version at a maximum retail price (MRP) of Taka800 (then $10.4) per tablet but the product is now reported to be available at Taka600. </p><p>In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, Beximco's chief operating officer, Rabbur Reza, outlined a set of initiatives aimed at improving diagnosis and patient support/care in the hepatitis C segment, in addition to offering savings of up to $1,000 in total treatment costs for purchases made through the firm's distribution outlets in Bangladesh. </p><p>The firm's effort, which the COO termed as a "community approach" rather than a pure commercial one, will involve communicating regularly with a targeted "pool of doctors", who would encourage patients to undergo screening for the disease [diagnosis currently occurs at very late stages, he explains] and also act as "custodians" to monitor patients and counsel them to complete the treatment course. Around 50 physicians are expected to be part of the initiative initially though Beximco hopes to take this figure up to around 200. Centers that can provide low cost testing will also be identified.</p><p>"We are working very closely with doctors and patients," Mr Reza told <i>Scrip</i> in a telephone interaction.</p><p>He also said that the Bangladesh government some days ago agreed to exempt hepatitis C products from value added tax (VAT).</p><p>"The Taka517 per tablet price is excluding VAT and patients would pay this price."</p><p>Beximco also hopes to make supplies to a clutch of least developed countries &ndash; filings for at least 15 countries are expected to commence in the next six to nine months. Mr Reza also indicated Beximco's interest in seeking WHO prequalification for sofosbuvir. The company has initiated discussions with its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) vendors on the issue, he added. It's unclear who these vendors are and whether they include any Indian suppliers.</p><p>Beximco has also filed its version of Gilead's Harvoni (the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) for approval in Bangladesh and expects to hear from the regulator soon. "Within the next few months, we expect to be able to launch," Mr Reza said.</p><h2>price pressure</h2><p>Asked whether Beximco anticipates further pricing pressure and competition, especially if Indian firms make supplies, Mr Reza clarified that as per the law if there are multiple suppliers within Bangladesh, except for the innovator firm, others may not be permitted on to the market.</p><p>As in the case of other molecules, it would need to be established that there are sufficient local suppliers, he explained. Few more local players are expected to enter the market.</p><p>The Beximco COO is also confident that local firms can meet Bangladesh's requirement for sofosbuvir: "For certain diseases we are fulfilling requirements for 160m patients. Here the patient pool is estimated at 2m, so it should not be a problem."</p><p>Last year Gilead entered into <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966%5d" target="_new">licensing deals</a> with seven India-based firms including Cipla, Hetero, Strides, Ranbaxy and Zydus Cadila to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries, which is believed to include Bangladesh. Biocon subsequently joined the list of licensees, followed by Natco, which had <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Patent-challenger-Natco-is-now-Gilead-licensee-for-Sovaldi-357020%5d" target="_new">previously challenged</a> the Sovaldi patent. </p><p>While several sofosbuvir versions are available on the Indian market Natco and Hetero are believed to be the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Indian-Sovaldi-generics-saga-2-suppliers-and-falling-prices-357593%5d" target="_new">only key suppliers</a> of sofosbuvir to the entire flock of firms in the country. Natco has launched the first generic sofosbuvir version <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Let-the-price-war-begin-After-Bangladesh-Sovaldi-generic-now-in-Nepal-357125%5d" target="_new">in Nepal</a>. </p><h2>FDA audit</h2><p>Meanwhile, Beximco has also achieved another milestone, successfully going through a US FDA inspection at its oral solids site in Tongi. </p><p>Beximco claims to be the first Bangladeshi firm to get an FDA approval for its site, though Square Pharmaceuticals, another leading local firm, has previously indicated that its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Square-Beximco-lead-Bangladeshi-charge-for-slice-of-global-pie-348291%5d" target="_new">dossiers had been accepted in the US</a> and the firm was awaiting an FDA inspection. Last month Square said that the FDA had released an Establishment Inspection Report on a recent pre-approval inspection to the firm. "The report states that Square had a satisfactory cGMP inspection covering manufacturing of solid dosage form," it said.</p><p>Beximco, which previously entered the US market via the acquisition of an ANDA for the antihypertensive drug carvedilol, has been readying for a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Brick-by-brick-Bangladeshs-Beximco-builds-for-play-in-the-US-351856%5d" target="_new">larger play in the US</a>. The company has made five ANDA filings with the US FDA and Mr Reza anticipates around eight additional filings in the next 18 months or so. </p><p>He also noted how the FDA approval for the site had evoked "lot of interest" in some North African markets.</p>
