<p> Five practical steps to address the global problem of antibiotic drug resistance have been outlined in a new paper published as part of the O'Neill Review, which was commissioned by UK Prime Minister David Cameron to come up with solutions. </p> <p> The review, headed by economist and former head of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Jim O'Neill, has identified where action can be taken without delay in one of a series of planned papers. </p> <p> At a conservative estimate, resistance to drugs to treat infections will cost the world an additional 10 million lives a year by 2050, more than the number of people currently dying from cancer annually. </p> <p> Cutting through the large volume of noise this issue has generated in public health circles to provide a universal step by step guide, the O'Neill Review says these five steps do not require a change to the current drugs market but they will buy time and lay the groundwork for future discoveries. They include better the creation of an early research fund and thorough research into the better use and combination of existing treatments. </p> <p> In more detail, the steps outlined are: </p> <p> <b>1. Increase early science funding to tackle AMR:</b> Mr O'Neill wants funders, philanthropic or government, to set up an AMR Innovation Fund to act as an early research grant maker for blue sky science, and as a non-profit incubator for ideas that are more mature. </p> <p> &quot;Antibiotics research is the poor relation to studying chronic diseases of the developed world but, without antibiotics, treating those diseases can be compromised too,&quot; Mr O'Neill said. </p> <p> More specific details on this AMR innovation fund and how money would be allocated have not been pinpointed yet but the O'Neill Review said it will &quot;work through these ahead of our next paper.&quot; </p> <p> The preliminary report did highlight that, &quot;There are some encouraging signs among non-profit and government funders of money starting to flow again to support research related to AMR. Major charitable foundations such as the Wellcome Trust in the UK and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in the US have begun to increase their focus on drug resistance within the areas they prioritize.&quot; </p> <p> In addition, key initiatives such as the European Innovative Medicines Initiative's (IMI) New Drugs for Bad Bugs project, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency (BARDA) Broad Spectrum Antibiotics Program in the US have between them invested nearly $650m over the past five years directly into new antimicrobial discovery efforts in partnership with industry, the report noted. Most recently, the White House has requested a sharp increase in funding from Congress, up to a total of $1.2bn, to bolster US federal funding in 2016 to tackle AMR. </p> <p> However, the report notes that more can be done by governments. For example, it reviewed publicly available information for the US National Institute of Health (NIH) which has an annual budget of around $30bn. Out of that total budget, the NIH allocated around $341m annually on average, over the past five years, to AMR. That's approximately 1.2% of the NIH's grant funding. In comparison the unit spent $5.2bn annually on cancer research in the same period, representing 18.6% of its total. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/B6503018999B4EF782C861185657F297.ashx"></p> <p> Data for Europe were not so readily available, because there is currently no single source of data on spending on AMR-related research by public bodies in member states across Europe. </p> <p> Longer-term, the issue at hand won't be government funding, it will be making the antibiotic space an economic investment for drug developers &ndash; something for which Mr O'Neill has been drafted in to research and provide worldwide recommendations. He anticipates more on this issue in upcoming reports from the AMR review. </p> <p> <b>2. Make existing drugs go further:</b> The O'Neill Review is calling for existing antibiotics to be re-examined to test whether changing the dosing or combining them with other agents or other antimicrobials could slow down the spread of drug resistance and treat resistant infections more effectively. </p> <p> The review compared antibiotics to fossil fuels: &quot;We seek to use our existing finite resources (oil and gas fields) more efficiently, and at the same time we look for new sources of power (solar, wind etc).&quot; </p> <p> Three questions arose from key opinion leaders (KOLs) on the subject of existing antimicrobials in the February report: </p> <ul> <li>Is the dosing and length of treatment for most existing antibiotics consistent with the goal of minimizing resistance? </li> <li>Have we tested available antibiotics sufficiently in combination with other antibiotics or different agents to see if combinations could treat &quot;resistant infections&quot; more effectively and/ or prevent increased resistance? </li> <li>Do we know which old libraries and patent literature have been systematically mined, and how recently, and whether there are &quot;forgotten&quot; compounds that could be put to use? </li> </ul> <p> All of the above support the O'Neill Review's advice that a systematic program to relook at existing antibiotic products is needed. </p> <p> <b>3. Support the development and use of relevant diagnostic technologies:</b> With the right diagnostics more patients would receive the right antibiotic to treat their infection and fewer antibiotics would be prescribed unnecessarily. </p> <p> The UK's Longitude Prize, which in 2014 elected AMR as its topic for investigation, is one example of a grant offering cash to develop a winning design for a cheap diagnostic tool for prescribing antibiotics. </p> <p> AMR won out over the other six shortlisted challenges: tackling paralysis; supporting people with dementia; ensuring access to clean water; developing technology for carbon-free flight; and feeding the world's growing population. </p> <p> &quot;A test is one of the best ways to make sure that the patients get the right antibiotic at the right time, and the right dose for the right disease, which will foster appropriate antibiotic use,&quot; said Steven Gilman, chief scientific officer of Cubist, said when AMR was announced as Longitude's target. But he added that &quot;the selection of the right agent is really important in that first 24 hours.&quot; A faster turnaround time could reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, &quot;and therefore lead to less resistance emergence.&quot; </p> <p> <b>4. Invest in the people who will solve the problem: </b>While many companies have retreated from antibiotic discovery in recent decades, drug developers are slowly trickling back into the field. The review noted &quot;It is crucial to train the next generation of doctors, scientists, microbiologists, pharmacologists, medicinal chemists and biochemists, as well as economists, social scientists and vets, among others.&quot; </p> <p> Mr O'Neill said, &quot;In researching our latest report, we found no shortage of ideas and promising new technologies but progress is too slow due to lack of investment and much of the workforce is edging towards retirement.&quot; </p> <p> However, antibiotic R&amp;D is being brought to the fore, especially as big pharmas appear to have a reignited interest in the field. In December 2014 Merck &amp; Co agreed to acquire antibiotics specialist Cubist Pharmaceuticals in a cash deal worth about $9.5bn (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mercks-9.5bn-Cubist-buy-overshadowed-by-court-decision-355511">scripintelligence.com, 9 December 2014</a>). As a result, other companies engaged in antibiotic development&nbsp;saw their stocks get an upward push, as Merck's takeover bid validated the interest of big players in the antibiotics space. </p> <p> Also, in October last year Actavis got in on the game; it agreed to acquire Durata Therapeutics&nbsp;for $675m in cash up front, and up to around $145m in additional future payments contingent on regulatory and commercial milestones being met for Durata's lead product Dalvance (<a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-builds-antibiotic-presence-with-675m-Durata-deal-354319">scripintelligence.com, 7 October 2014</a>). </p> <p> <b>5. Modernize the way surveillance of drug resistance is done and used globally:</b> The final step is to create a more joined up and digital global approach, using the latest advances in molecular testing and informatics, to improve access to real time global-scale surveillance information. </p> <p> Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, commented that, &quot;As well as developing new drugs and alternative approaches to antimicrobials, making the most of existing ones, and improving surveillance of resistant infections, [there is a] need to investigate the social context and behaviors that contribute to the problem and how we might learn to modify these factors.&quot; </p> <h2> First step of too many? </h2> <p> Upon the release of this first report from the highly anticipated O'Neill Review, there seems to be a flicker of hope that real, measurable and impacting moves can be made towards the issue of global resistance to antibiotic medicines. Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, described it as &quot;the dawn of an exciting new age of discovery and use in antimicrobial treatments.&quot; </p> <p> However, the small steps Mr O'Neill has outlined highlight again that there's much more work to be done. Though the review gives five clear answers it breeds far more questions. Many will be waiting for part two and its ideas about incentivizing drug development, and hoping that the next recommendations from the O'Neill review will delve deeper into the gritty problems facing the existing structure for drug development, manufacturing and use. </p> <p> Read more about antibiotic resistance&nbsp;on <i>Scrip</i>'s dedicated <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/amr/">microsite</a>. </p>
