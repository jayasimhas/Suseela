<p>On its way to becoming Biogen Idec's top-selling product, the oral multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) helped push the company's total revenue 40% higher on a year-over-year basis to $9.7bn for 2014.</p><p>"We believe Tecfidera is on track to become the most prescribed therapy for MS in the world," Biogen executive vice president of commercial operations Tony Kingsley said during the company's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings conference call. But even though Tecfidera generated $2.9bn in sales last year, putting the drug just $100m away from Biogen's current best-seller Avonex (interferon beta-1a) for MS, analysts on the conference call were most interested in the company's research and development pipeline.</p><p>Mr Kingsley previously told <i>Scrip</i> that Tecfidera is grabbing a significant share of newly diagnosed patients and the drug's EU launch is ramping up faster than in the US (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-Amgen-Biogen-BMS-Celgene-Novartis-Pfizer-and-Roche-356329" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>). And Biogen chief financial officer Paul Clancy noted during the company's conference call that "in every [European] country that we get reimbursement in we do better than the last." The company expects to have reimbursement for its drug in all major EU markets by the end of 2015.</p><p>Thanks to Tecfidera's contribution, Biogen's 2014 revenue was in line with analyst consensus and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) jumped 54% from 2013 to $13.83 for the year, exceeding consensus estimates by $0.30. </p><p>"The growth of Tecfidera in world markets, the improved performance of Tysabri and our entry into the treatment of hemophilia demonstrated our strength as a commercial organization while benefiting patients in many countries around the world," Biogen CEO George Scangos said in the company's fourth quarter and 2014 earnings statement.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2014 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>2013 Sales</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Avonex</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>MS</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.013bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$3.006bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Tecfidera</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>MS</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$2.9bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$876.1m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Tysabri (natalizumab)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>MS</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.96bn</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$1.53bn</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Fampyra (dalfampridine)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Improvement in walking for MS patients</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$80.2m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$74m</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>MS</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$44.5m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Alprolix [coagulation factor IX (recombinant) Fc fusion protein]</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hemophilia B</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$76m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Eloctate [antihemophilic factor (recombinant) Fc fusion protein]</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Hemophilia A</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>$58.4m</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NA</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p>Biogen also recognized $1.2bn in 2014 from joint business agreements, such as its long-standing relationship with Roche's Genentech for the anti-CD20 blood cancer therapies Rituxan (rituximab) and Gazyva (obinutuzumab), versus $1.1bn in 2013.</p><p>The company forecast 14% to 16% revenue growth in 2015 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $16.60 to $17, which was roughly in line with consensus estimates despite some slowing in Tecfidera sales growth.</p><p>Mr Kingsley acknowledged a slowdown in the drug's sales growth rate due to slower conversion of patient switching from other therapies to Tecfidera, the launch of Biogen's twice-monthly interferon Plegridy, and a label revision in the US to note a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) patient death associated with the drug (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Biogens-Tecfidera-US-labeling-revised-to-reflect-PML-death-355263" target="_new">25 November 2014</a>).</p><p>William Blair analyst John Sonnier said the $916m fourth quarter Tecfidera sales total still was better than investors expected given the PML concern from November.</p><p>"We believe that Biogen Idec has considerable operating momentum commercially, strategically, and clinically, and we expect the trend to continue in 2015," Mr Sonnier noted in a 29 January report.</p><p><b>Pipeline programs garner attention</b></p><p>However, analysts on Biogen's earnings call focused their attention on pipeline assets that the company is years away from launching, like BIIB037 for Alzheimer's disease for which positive Phase Ib results were reported in December (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Early-Alzheimers-data-sound-good-but-Biogen-has-much-to-prove-355380" target="_new">3 December 2014</a>). Biogen will provide more data from the study during the 12th International Conference on Alzheimer's & Parkinson's Diseases (AD/PD) from 18 to 22 March in Nice, France, but a Phase III clinical trial program already is in the works.</p><p>The company also will present additional data in April from a Phase II clinical trial for anti-LINGO-1 in the treatment of acute optic neuritis (AON) following initial results from the proof-of-concept study, which were reported in early January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Biogens-highly-anticipated-anti-LINGO-data-fall-flat-356028" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>). Results from a separate Phase II trial in the treatment of MS patients are expected in 2016.</p><p>Beyond programs already in the company's pipeline, Biogen is growing through acquisitions and partnerships, including the purchase of pain drug developer Convergence Pharmaceuticals for up to $675m and some early-stage, research-based collaborations (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogen-Idec-buys-analgesic-developer-Convergence-for-200m-356088" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Biogen invested $30m in a strategic alliance with Columbia University Medical Center to conduct genetic research on the underlying causes of diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pinpoint new treatment approaches (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Incyte-Agenus-sign-410m-immuno-oncology-pact-plus-six-more-deals-356064" target="_new">10 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Biogen also is working with Google Life Sciences to look at the drivers of MS progression. The companies will use experimental technologies, such as novel sensor platforms, advanced laboratory science and bioanalytical tools.</p><p>Prior to the company's earnings report on 29 January, Biogen announced another early-stage collaboration with Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy to jointly develop gene therapies for the treatment of hemophilia A and B. San Raffaele Hospital's Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET), which has done preclinical testing with its gene therapies delivered via lentiviral vectors, will earn $5m up front and is eligible to receive research funding and milestone payments. </p><p>Biogen said it will continue to bolster its R&D capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships in 2015.</p><p>Investors responded positively to the company's strategy and its sales growth after the stock market closed on 29 January. Biogen gained 7.4% after hours to reach $379.25.</p><p><p><p><p>
