<p>The FDA, in many ways, is one of the most poorly understood public agencies and too often is maligned, said Larry Shapiro, executive vice chancellor for medical affairs at Washington University in St. Louis.</p><p>But as Congress moves to overhaul the agency through the <i>21st Century Cures Act</i>, adopted by the House in July, and the Senate's companion bill &ndash; a draft of which is anticipated sometime this fall &ndash; lawmakers mustn't neglect acknowledging the role the FDA has played in keeping Americans safe and in bringing new medical innovations to patients at what's been an increasingly faster pace, Shapiro said during a Sept. 10 Washington forum hosted by the advocacy group Research!America.</p><p>Today's FDA is a considerably different organization than it was 15 or 20 years ago, said the agency's acting commissioner, Stephen Ostroff, who insisted regulators are using new tools and pathways and have worked hard to keep pace with the science behind industry's most innovative breakthroughs in medical product research and development.</p><p>Ostroff pointed to the fact the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-2014-a-year-for-orphan-drugs-anti-PD-1s-2nd-chancers-355915" target="_new">approved 41 new molecular entities</a> and novel biologics in 2014 &ndash; a record that was only surpassed by the 53 the agency OK'd in 1996.</p><p>And, he said, it wasn't just the numbers of approvals that was remarkable, but the speed at which some of them were evaluated by the FDA.</p><p>But Ostroff also acknowledged the FDA has recently come under fire for its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/50-Shades-Of-Regulatory-Gray-More-Flexible-FDA-360111" target="_new">high approval rates</a>. </p><p>"There are a lot of reasons the numbers are as high as they are," Ostroff said, noting the agency has more expedited pathways available, including the breakthrough therapy designation created under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> (FDASIA) of 2012, which provides opportunities for more dialogue between regulators and companies about study designs and what may be required in marketing applications.</p><p>Drug makers also are using more adaptive trial designs, he added.</p><p>Those efforts account for some of the increased speed and the FDA's efficiency in approving applications and "play a very critical role in getting to 'yes,'" Ostroff declared.</p><p>He said the FDA also has been listening more to patients, noting the agency has been holding patient-focused drug development meetings &ndash; something that was required of the agency under the fifth round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA), which was enacted as part of FDASIA.</p><p>Figuring out how to incorporate that patient input into the regulatory process will be a "critical" part of the PDUFA VI discussions, Ostroff assured.</p><p>"We want to be able to continuously change and adapt to environments where we can receive information from all of the various stakeholders to be able to come to the appropriate decisions," he said.</p><p><b>Forced To Change?</b></p><p>One of the ways the FDA is being forced to change, said Amy Comstock Rick, president and CEO of the Food and Drug Law Institute, is through recent court decisions in which judges have declared companies can share information, as long as it is "truthful and non-misleading," about off-label uses of their drugs &ndash; the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Possible-FDAAmarin-Off-Label-Deal-Rule-Tweaks-Ahead-360183" target="_new">most recent decision</a> involving Amarin's fish-oil pill Vascepa (icosapent ethyl).</p><p>If that trend continues, "does that diminish the value of FDA approval, because you can get a drug approved on a very narrow indication but then communicate more on areas of potential off-label use?" Rick asked. "Does that make FDA approval the moment or are we looking at a place where the FDA needs to shift to an agency . . . where safety and efficacy for real-world use is very much a part of the regulatory science conversation?"</p><p>With patients and clinicians looking more and more for real-world data on how drugs are actually being used, not just what they are approved for, "should the role of the FDA be shifting to a much more of a continuum in a public health conversation?" Rick said.</p><p><b>Cures Comfort Level</b></p><p>While it's too early to know what will be included in the Senate biomedical bill, a draft of which Ostroff said he's been told will be available as early as next month &ndash; although an aide for Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the chamber's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, would only confirm for <i>Scrip</i> sometime this fall &ndash; the FDA chief noted the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cures-adopted-mandatory-NIH-FDA-funds-survive-challenge-359386" target="_new">House Cures bill</a> calls for several changes to the agency.</p><p>"The original versions of the bill had a number of parts that made us somewhat uncomfortable," Ostroff said.</p><p>But he said the agency was able to provide input and get the legislation to a place where "we were very comfortable with the content of that bill."</p><p>Now, Ostroff said, "it does not do things that would significantly cause concerns for us for our ability to do our job effectively, which is to be able to evaluate products for their effectiveness and for their safety."</p><p>But having said that, he said the FDA is concerned about the costs associated with "doing the things that we are being asked to do in that bill."</p><p>While Ostroff said he was "certainly happy with the fact that there were funds dedicated for FDA" in the Cures bill, by the agency's estimation, as well as an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the $550m in the House legislation falls well short of the nearly <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">$1bn that would be needed</a> &ndash; worries he'd expressed <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/User-fees-Cures-elections-FDA-bracing-for-the-crash-359689" target="_new">earlier this summer</a> to his science board.</p><p>"There are a number of things we can point to that we are doing extremely well, and we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the successes that we have," Ostroff lamented.</p><p>He noted the Cures bill includes a mandate for the creation of a structured framework at the FDA for the submission, review and qualification of biomarkers &ndash; a provision that was criticized earlier this year by former agency commissioner David Kessler as <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lawmakers-Cures-bill-wont-sacrifice-US-drug-safety-358983" target="_new">lowering the FDA's standards</a> for efficacy and safety.</p><p>While Ostroff said he wouldn't want the FDA to veer away from looking through the lens of efficacy and safety &ndash; "because it has served us incredibly well for a very long period of time" &ndash; he said if biomarkers could assist in rendering the appropriate decisions about products, "they will be valuable."</p><p>He noted that half of the 94 drugs approved between 2010 and 2012 used surrogate endpoints, with many of those relying on biomarkers. </p><p>"So this isn't something new and different for us," Ostroff said.</p><p>The challenge, he said, is that the "evidence of the clinical validity of the biomarker needs to be relatively solid and needs to be demonstrated."</p><p>For many diseases, Ostroff said, "we just know the information isn't there yet to be able to say this is an adequate biomarker for that particular disease" &ndash; repeating what Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, had expressed last month during a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/No-More-Biomarker-Fumbling-Time-to-Get-Serious-360094" target="_new">forum in Baltimore</a>.</p><p>One thing Ostroff said he'd particularly like to see the Senate include in its biomedical overhaul bill is the provisions that would make it easier for the FDA to hire new scientists.</p><p>He said the agency has had a particularly hard time keeping statisticians and experts in informatics.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ostroff said, "many scientists don't look at FDA as a scientific organization."</p><p>But, he said, "there are career opportunities that can be very interesting" at the agency.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
