<p>Merck & Co researchers have found a small-molecule modulator of non-coding elements in bacterial mRNA that points the way to the development of new antibacterials with a totally new mode of action, and possibly novel medicines for human disease too.</p><p>The compound works not by inhibiting enzymes, binding to receptors or altering the structure of proteins, the most common modes of action for drugs, but by interacting with a previously unexploited target, non-coding bacterial mRNA that controls gene expression.</p><p>Bacterial "riboswitches" have been known to exist in mRNA for some time; the binding of specific metabolites to a region of the mRNA changes the expression of genes involved in the corresponding biosynthetic pathway. But, showing they could be useful drug targets has previously been difficult. </p><p>The compound found by Merck researchers to modulate the activity of the bacterial mRNA riboswitch &ndash; ribocil &ndash; has a structure completely different from the known metabolite ligand for the switch, explained Dr Terry Roemer, who led the research team at Merck Research Laboratories in Kenilworth, NJ and in West Point and North Wales, Pennsylvania. </p><p>"It is intriguing to think there is chemical matter out there that is specifically interacting with targets we have not even considered yet; it's a complete black box," Roemer said. </p><h2>Fragile X, Myotonic Dystrophy</h2><p>"If we can find these small molecules that interact with structural RNA elements in bacteria, it may be possible to do the same with human RNA structural elements," Roemer noted. There are human diseases associated with abnormal RNA like fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy and Huntington disease that might benefit from drugs that interact with RNA. </p><p>Another research team led by Matthew Disney at Scripps Research Institute, Florida, is one looking at this relationship, Roemer added.</p><p>In a paper in the journal <i>Nature</i> published online Sept. 30, Roemer and colleagues describe the use of phenotypic screen of 57,000-bioactive compound library and deduced that one of the compounds, ribocil, was targeting mRNA rather than an enzyme. </p><p>Further, a compound derived from ribocil has been found to be a potent antibacterial in an animal model of <i>Escherichia coli</i> septicaemia, although bacterial resistance did occur, Roemer reported. It may be that antibacterials with a narrow spectrum of activity could be developed that target a particular bacterial genus through their specificity to particular non-coding elements, Roemer noted. </p><p>However, the research may be of greater value for researchers looking to develop new classes of agent for certain RNA-associated human disease, where resistance is not likely to be an issue, he added.</p><p><p><p><p>
