<p>The mysteriously named &lsquo;deep learning&rsquo; is a form of machine learning that uses computational models with multiple processing layers to analyse complex patterns in experimental or other data. Machine learning is a specialized type of artificial intelligence (AI), and dramatic improvements in the state of the art have been achieved in areas such as speech recognition, visual object recognition and object detection through the use of AI techniques like deep learning.</p><p>In recent years, deep learning with neural networks has begun to be applied to drug discovery, in particular in areas such as genomics and virtual drug screening. Recently, a joint research team from Stanford University and Google suggested that analysing more data covering more biological processes, coupled with the development and adoption of new algorithms, could accelerate the drug discovery process significantly. One way in which larger datasets could be constructed, they propose, would be for pharma companies to share more experimental data among themselves.</p><p>With considerable understatement, the researchers say that &ldquo;drug discovery is an extended process that takes years to move from start to finish, with high rates of failure along the way&rdquo;. Computational methods were a major step forward, but despite extensive automation they remain expensive to perform. Virtual screening may offer a solution to this challenge, although there currently remain several obstacles to be overcome for it to be really effective. For example, low hit rates in experimental screens can result in imbalanced datasets that require careful management to be of practical use. </p><p>So to increase the predictive power of such screens, learning algorithms need to be able to combine disparate data sources across multiple targets. To investigate this issue further, the researchers, led by mathematician Bharath Ramsundar, a Google Research Intern and Stanford PhD candidate, analysed a large collection of datasets containing 37.8 million experimental measurements across 259 targets. </p><p>Ramsundar and his collaborators found that multitask networks trained on this data collection achieved significant improvements over baseline machine learning methods. (<a href='#'>http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/large-scale-machine-learning-for-drug.html</a>). Moreover, adding more tasks and more data improved predictive performance even further.</p><p>Already the pharmaceutical industry is exploring how AI could be used in drug discovery. One company that has embraced this approach is Boston-based Berg, which has developed a technology platform known as the Berg Interrogative Biology Discovery Platform. The company plans to use the technology &ldquo;to identify and develop therapeutic targets that are safe, effective, and based on the bio-intelligence from the human system&rdquo;. Instead of screening chemical libraries or using synthetic compounds, Berg&rsquo;s approach is based on using endogenous compounds to normalize the disease microenvironment, exploiting the body&rsquo;s own mechanisms to reverse the pathological process.</p><p>Berg&rsquo;s most advanced product is API-31510, a topical cream formulation of ubidecarenone, under development for the local treatment of cancer. It has successfully completed a Phase II trial in 160 patients with superficial basal cell carcinoma lesions, and a Phase I/II trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma has also been completed. Trials are also planned with a different formulation in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>Another company to espouse the cause of AI is UK-based Molplex Pharmaceuticals, which has a research collaboration with AstraZeneca to explore new approaches to the mechanisms of cancer progression, and to translate them into treatments for cancer.</p><p>In contrast to using AI to increase the number of data points that can be analysed, some experts have argued that the best way to accelerate drug discovery is to carry out that analysis more intelligently. Given the size of combinatorial libraries, mass screening is like trying to shoot a fly with a blunderbuss, whereas in reality the analysis should be much more focussed. This has given rise to the concept of the Robot Scientist, which can form hypotheses to explain the data it generates, devise experiments to verify those hypotheses, physically run the experiments and interpret the result in terms of the original hypothesis.</p><p>One such robot was &lsquo;Adam&rsquo;, developed to plan and carry out yeast microbiological experiments. Adam has the distinction of being the first machine to have autonomously discovered new scientific knowledge, namely the function of yeast orphan enzymes (enzymes for which the gene(s) encoding them are unknown).</p><p>Adam&rsquo;s inventors, led by Kevin Williams of the University of Aberystwyth in Wales, have now developed a new robot which they have named &lsquo;Eve&rsquo;. It has three sequential operating modes: </p><ul><li>In library screening mode it systematically tests each member of a large set of compounds against an assay, rather like conventional mass screening. The aim is to identify a subset of &lsquo;hit&rsquo; compounds.</li><li>In hit-confirmation mode, it re-assays the hit compounds using multiple repeats and titrations to reduce the probability of false positives. The screening and hit confirmation cycle is analogous to advanced screening systems that perform high-throughput screening followed by a high-content screen for selected compounds.</li><li>In the final phase the system executes cycles of statistics/machine learning that hypothesize quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), and tests these QSARs on new compounds. Ultimately it is planned that Eve will have the ability to synthesize the new compounds automatically (at present they have to be synthesized manually).</li></ul><p>Interestingly, Eve can also be used for drug repositioning, that is, the application of known drugs to new diseases. In particular, Eve&rsquo;s inventors have used the system to look for established drugs that may be useful in the treatment of tropical diseases, which do not currently attract a lot of research in terms of new medicines. Using the Johns Hopkins University Clinical Compound Library of approximately 1,600 drugs approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, several compounds have been identified that discriminate between host and parasite, and have passed initial cytotoxicity tests.</p><p>Another compound of interest is AGM-1470 (TNP-470), an angiogenesis inhibitor previously investigated by Takeda as an anticancer agent. Results from Eve&rsquo;s yeast synthetic biology assay show that AGM-1470 has high activity against <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR): further enzyme inhibition assays showed that P vivax DHFR was 1,000-fold more sensitive to AGM-1470 than its human counterpart. These findings suggest the researchers had indeed identified a DHFR inhibitor with improved selectivity. </p><p>The use of artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discovery is still in its infancy but, as the above examples show, some real progress is being made in a number of directions. While clinical trials remain the most expensive phase of bringing a new medicine to market, improvements in the way drugs are discovered still have the potential to save considerable time and expense. And in areas of medicine such as infectious diseases where the need for new products grows ever greater, the wider adoption of techniques such as AI could be a life-saver in more ways than one.</p>
