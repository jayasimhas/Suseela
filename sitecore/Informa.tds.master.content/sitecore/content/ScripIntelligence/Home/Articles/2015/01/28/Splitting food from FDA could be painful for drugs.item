<p>President Barack Obama has proposed taking the food safety related components of the FDA and merging them with the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the Department of Agriculture to form a single new agency.</p><p>The proposal comes as part of the president's fiscal year 2016 budget request, which he sent up to Capitol Hill on 2 February.</p><p>The plan is supported by Senator Dick Durbin (Democrat-Illinois) and Representative Rosa DeLauro (Democrat-Connecticut), who introduced legislation last week to split the food oversight from the FDA.</p><p>A group of Democratic lawmakers also have signed on to the bill, known as the <i>Safe Food Act of 2015</i>.</p><p>The White House noted that more than a dozen agencies are involved in overseeing the safety of the nation's food supply &ndash; implementing at least 30 statutes governing some part of food safety. </p><p>While the FDA is responsible for most foods, FSIS is charged with overseeing the safety of meat and poultry. </p><p>FSIS also oversees processed egg products, but the FDA oversees the shells of eggs. </p><p>The FDA is responsible for seafood, but FSIS is responsible for catfish. </p><p>The White House used pizza as a prime example of how complicated the safety oversight is for food in the US.</p><p>The FDA would have sole regulatory authority over a cheese pizza, but add pepperoni, and then that pizza falls into the jurisdictions of the FDA and FSIS, because both have some oversight of that meet product. </p><p>Sandwiches are another area where regulation gets complicated &ndash; with the FDA responsible for inspecting manufacturers of closed-face meat or poultry sandwiches, while FSIS would have jurisdiction over the meat and poultry products before they are marketed.</p><p>"Fractured oversight and disparate regulatory approaches are confusing," the White House said.</p><p>The division of responsibilities between the FDA, FSIS and other agencies over food was not deliberately designed, but evolved as Congress passed laws to address specific safety concerns, the Obama administration said. </p><p>Now, the president wants to create a single federal food safety agency, independent from the FDA &ndash; but within the Department of Health and Human Services &ndash; which the White House said would provide focused, centralized leadership, a primary voice on food safety standards and compliance with those standards, and clear lines of responsibility and accountability that would enhance both prevention of and responses to outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. </p><p>"It would rationalize the food safety regulatory regime and allow the federal government to better allocate resources and responsibilities," the White House said.</p><p>The new agency would have the primary responsibility for food safety inspections, enforcement, applied research and outbreak response and mitigation. It would be charged with pursuing a modern, science-based food safety regulatory regime, drawing on best practices of the FDA and FSIS &ndash; with strong enforcement and recall mechanisms, expertise in risk assessment and enforcement and research efforts across all food types based on scientifically supportable assessments of threats to public health. </p><p>The agency also would serve as the central point for coordinating with state and local entities and food safety stakeholders, the White House said.</p><p>But Craig Burton, director at Washington-based analysis and consultancy firm Avalere Health, said splitting up the FDA will create disruption and chaos for all of the agency's centers during any sort of reorganization effort &ndash; at least in the short term.</p><p>That disentanglement process, he said, likely will result in some harm to the agency's ability to function properly &ndash; potentially interfering with the FDA's regulatory activities. </p><p>Mr Burton, however, pointed out that the proposal to carve off the food safety activities at the FDA from the drug and device regulatory processes had been bandied about for some time.</p><p>"So it's a question that's not going away," he said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr Burton gave the president's proposal little chance of actually getting enough bipartisan support to make it through Congress this year. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
