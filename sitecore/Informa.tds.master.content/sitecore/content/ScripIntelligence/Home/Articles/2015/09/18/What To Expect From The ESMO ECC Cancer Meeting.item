<p>Clinical data for Roche AG's entrant to the PD-1/L1 immuno-oncology fray, atezolizumab, look set to dominate at the ESMO ECC2015 meeting in Vienna later this week.</p><p>The product, a PD-L1 inhibitor, is the third in this space, coming behind the forerunning PD-1 inhibitors Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc.'s <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) and Merck & Co Inc.'s <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab), but Roche is nonetheless hoping that it will play a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roche-Immunology-Arsenal-PD-L1-Franchise-And-Beyond-360445" target="_new">major part in its oncology future</a>. </p><p>The late-breaking Phase II results are from two pivotal Phase II studies of atezolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) called POPLAR and BIRCH, and a third pivotal Phase II study in urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) called IMvigor 210. </p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs say they expect Roche to file atezolizumab (also known as MPDL3280A) for these indications by the end of the year, despite the company's guidance for early 2016. Bristol-Myers Squibb's <i>Opdivo</i> is already approved in NSCLC, and Merck & Co's Keytruda is awaiting approval for this indication (both products are already on the market for melanoma).</p><p>Top-line data from <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Roches-PD-L1-Contender-Makes-Strides-In-NSCLC-Rival-Chase-359984" target="_new">BIRCH were released</a> last month, while the company revealed headline data from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Roches-big-immune-oncology-hope-atezolizumab-shrinks-certain-bladder-tumors-359397" target="_new">bladder cancer trial</a> in July. Data from all three trials will be presented on the morning of Sep 27. </p><p>During the same session, research with AstraZeneca PLC.'s anti-PD-L1 offering durvalumab (MEDI 4736) will be reported, looking at whether treatment response in NSCLC is associated with high tumoral interferon-gamma mRNA, PD-L1 protein and combined IFN-gamma mRNA/PD-L1 protein expression. Durvalumab is currently in Phase III trials for NSCLC and head and neck cancer, and about to enter a further Phase III trial in bladder cancer. </p><p>Later on Sunday, there are two late-breaking presentations scheduled for BMS's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda in skin cancers. For Opdivo there will be the CheckMate 064 study looking at its use sequentially with BMS's CTLA-4 inhibitor, Yervoy (ipilimumab), in advanced melanoma. These two drugs have already been filed in the US for use in combination for previously untreated advanced melanoma, based on the Checkmate 067 study, for which a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-OpdivoYervoy-combo-gains-priority-review-358701" target="_new">priority review</a> has been granted. </p><p>The Keytruda study is looking at its use in the rare skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma.</p><p>Data for both anti-PD1s in their second indication, NSCLC, will be presented on Monday. Results from the CheckMate 057 trial of nivolumab versus Genentech's standard of care Taxotere (docetaxel) in advanced non-squamous NSCLC will include subgroup analyses and patient&ndash;reported outcomes. This study was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Another-quick-lung-cancer-approval-in-Opdivos-future-357947" target="_new">stopped early</a> in April. Opdivo had <a href="http://gained approval in March" target="_new">gained approval in March</a> from the FDA in metastatic squamous NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, and BMS has now filed an sBLA for its use in this wider lung cancer indication (PDUFA date set for Jan. 2, 2016). Should it gain approval this could guarantee the drug's status as a major blockbuster. </p><p>For Keytruda, delegates will hear data from the KEYNOTE-001 study in patients with previously treated NSCLC. This product is slated for a possible US approval shortly for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-negative and ALK rearrangement-negative NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. The PDUFA date is set for Oct. 2, 2015.</p><p>The Goldman Sachs analysts note that hopes for a broad label have waned following comments from the company hinting of a narrow label. </p><p>Meanwhile, Merck will also present on Sunday first-time data looking at PD-L2 expression in multiple tumors to assess the potential value of this biomarker in patient responsiveness to anti PD-1 therapies. </p><p>"We are also committed to identifying factors that may help us determine which patients are most likely to respond best to an individual medicine or approach," said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development at Merck Research Laboratories. "The initial data we are seeing with regard to PD-L2 expression now point to the potential relevance of dual PD-L1 and PD-L2 blockade in anti-PD-1 therapy for cancer treatment." </p><p>Other interesting late-breaking studies being reported include Immatics' Phase III study of its multipeptide cancer vaccine IMA901 in patients receiving Pfizer's <i>Sutent</i> (sunitinib) as a first-line therapy for advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma. </p><p>In nuclear medicine, French company Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA), will presenting on Sunday the pivotal Phase III NETTER-1 clinical study of Lutathera (177-Lu-Dotatate) in patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor positive midgut Neuro Endocrine Tumors (midgut NETs). Top-line data show it has met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant and clinically meaningful increase in progression-free survival for Lutathera versus a double dose of Sandostatin LAR. Lutathera belongs to an emerging form of treatments known as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), which involves targeting carcinoid tumors with radiolabeled somatostatin analogue peptides. </p><p>And for those interested in how things go wrong, the full data from the failed Phase III study of Active Biotech and Ipsen's tasquinimod in prostate cancer will be reported on Monday. This product was dropped from development in this indication after the top-line results were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tasquinimod-failure-sends-Ipsen-and-Active-Biotech-shares-tumbling-357912" target="_new">reported in April</a> showing a lack of benefit on overall survival. </p><p><p>
