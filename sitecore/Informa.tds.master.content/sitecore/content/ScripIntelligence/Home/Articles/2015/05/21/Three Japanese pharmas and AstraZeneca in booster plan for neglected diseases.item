<p>The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and four pharmaceutical firms &ndash; Eisai, Shionogi, Takeda and AstraZeneca &ndash; are collaborating on a new project to find therapies for two of the world's most neglected diseases: leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. </p><p>The 'Neglected Tropical Diseases Drug Discovery Booster' consortium allows for the DNDi to search millions of compounds simultaneously for new treatment leads for the two diseases. The innovation of the Booster consortium not only lies in the multilateral approach, explains the DNDi, but also in the iterative nature of the search. The companies will continually examine their libraries for better matches as the search is refined. "The Drug Discovery Booster has the potential to cut up to two years from the early drug discovery process, which takes approximately five years or more, and improve cost-efficiency across research activities," said the DNDi in a statement.</p><p>The process will start with DNDi providing all four companies with a common chemical starting point, a promising 'seed' compound, which has shown activity against the parasites that cause leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, but is not suitable for development as a drug. The four companies will then search their own chemical libraries for similar and potentially better molecules, and will send the most promising to DNDi, which will then screen them for effectiveness against the two diseases. DNDi will then select the best 'hits' for further testing. </p><p>This process will be repeated up to three times, with each new iteration &ndash; or round &ndash; starting from an improved seed compound identified from within one of the four partners' collections and shared with all. The initial goal is to find at least four promising seed compounds for each disease. It is expected that at least two of the resulting novel series of compounds will move to the next stage of development.</p><p>Any progress or successful new treatment for leishmaniasis or Chagas disease resulting from the Drug Discovery Booster will be attributed to all the partners, which have also agreed that no intellectual property barriers will be imposed to any successful new treatment.</p><p>The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT Fund) is an international non-profit organization headquartered in Japan that invests in the discovery and development of new health technologies. GHIT has provided a grant of &euro;640,000 to support the three Japanese companies in this project. The remainder, including the involvement of AstraZeneca, is being supported by DNDi funds.</p>
