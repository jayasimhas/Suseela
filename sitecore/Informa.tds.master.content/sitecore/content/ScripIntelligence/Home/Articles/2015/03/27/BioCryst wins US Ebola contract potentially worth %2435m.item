<p>The US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) has awarded BioCryst Pharmaceuticals $12m to advance the development of its experimental Ebola drug BCX4430 &ndash; a contract that could ultimately be worth $35m.</p><p>Shares of BioCryst jumped 8.5% on 31 March, before closing at $9.03, up 46 cents, or 5.4%.</p><p>In non-human primate studies, BCX4430, which is a RNA dependent-RNA polymerase inhibitor, was effective against Ebola and Marburg &ndash; viruses that both belong to the filovirus family &ndash; indicating the investigational small molecule may be useful as a broad spectrum antiviral. </p><p>BioCryst currently is conducting Phase I safety studies of BCX4430 in healthy volunteers &ndash; trials that are being funded by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-pumps-more-cash-into-BioCryst-Ebola-antiviral-353375" target="_new">awarded the company a contract</a> potentially worth $29.1m &ndash; $25.8m of which has been received by the firm.</p><p>The NIAID funding is being used for non-human primate proof-of-concept studies and an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled Phase I trial, which was initiated in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/BioCryst-Ebola-drug-BCX4430-enters-safety-testing-355673" target="_new">December 2014</a>, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intramuscular administration of BCX4430 in healthy volunteers. </p><p>Results from the Phase I trial are expected in the third quarter. </p><p>If those studies show that the drug is safe, BCX4430 could become one of the possible treatments tested for efficacy in clinical studies.</p><p>While the studies are underway, BARDA said it will support BioCryst's ongoing efforts to improve manufacturing processes and scale up production in facilities in the US &ndash; work that includes boosting product yield, reducing process steps and increasing the scalability of manufacturing &ndash; so that thousands of doses can be made with consistent product quality.</p><p>If the BARDA contract is extended, the company would conduct additional manufacturing work and other studies required to apply for FDA approval under the agency's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Wheres-FDAs-past-due-animal-rule-final-guidance-356972" target="_new">animal rule</a>, which was created in 2002 to permit a drug's effectiveness to be demonstrated in animals when it is unethical or not feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans.</p><p><p><p><p><p>
