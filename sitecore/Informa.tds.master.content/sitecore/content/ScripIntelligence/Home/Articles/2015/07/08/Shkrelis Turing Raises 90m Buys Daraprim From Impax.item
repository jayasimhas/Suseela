<p>Former hedge fund investor and outspoken biotechnology CEO Martin Shkreli is making his second attempt at a startup drug development and acquisition firm by leading a $90m Series A funding round for Turing Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Turing, which has offices in New York and in Zug, Switzerland, also paid Hayward, California-based Impax Laboratories $55m to buy exclusive US rights to market <i>Daraprim</i> (pyrimethamine) for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. Turing has multiple unidentified programs in research and development and Daraprim is in line with its interest in infectious diseases, but a spokesman said the new company is considering R&D and acquisitions in a variety of therapeutic areas.</p><p>"The business model here is such that we're not focused on any one or two disease states. We're interested in novel medications that treat serious, and often rare, diseases &ndash; rare, undertreated and under-diagnosed," Turing chief communications officer Craig Rothenberg told <i>Scrip</i>. "That was part of the reason for bringing in Daraprim for toxoplasmosis. We believe and are confident that by driving awareness, early diagnosis and treatment, we will expand the market for Daraprim today."</p><p>The strategy at Turing to develop an internal drug pipeline as well as to add R&D and commercial programs through acquisitions seems to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Tables-turn-as-hedge-fund-investor-and-activist-Shkreli-leads-rare-disease-focus-at-Retrophin-340265" target="_new">mirror the business plan</a> for Retrophin, where the board of directors <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Two-key-fires-at-Retrophin-NewLink-three-deals-and-three-financings-354298" target="_new">ousted Shkreli</a>. </p><p>He took rights to multiple in-licensed drugs with him, including <i>Vecamyl</i> (mecamylamine) for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-to-spend-63m-on-Manchester-350044" target="_new">hypertension</a> from Manchester Pharmaceuticals and <i>Syntocinon</i> (oxytocin nasal solution) for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Retrophin-revives-inhaled-oxytocin-for-schizophrenia-autism-348755" target="_new">autism and schizophrenia</a> from Novartis. Turing also has an intranasal ketamine in development for various mood disorders.</p><p>The company's new capital will be used to build a commercial team around Daraprim for toxoplasmosis, which could be a large market. Daraprim is approved in combination with sulfonamide to treat toxoplasmosis &ndash; the second most common cause of foodborne illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that up to 60m people in the US carry the toxoplasmosa parasite and 1m people are infected with the potentially deadly parasite annually.</p><p>Turing's Series A funding round led by Shkreli with participation from "multiple preeminent institutional equity investors" also will fund R&D programs and other acquisitions. Turing issued senior secured debt, but did not disclose the amount or the debt investors, simultaneously with the Series A round.</p><p>Whether or not Turing pursues an initial public offering to support future development and deal costs will depend on "what's in the best interest of the company and the shareholders. We have an eye toward going public, but we will wait to make a decision in the best interest of shareholders," Rothenberg said.</p><p>Turing has about 65 employees, but it is growing. Recent hires include Rothenberg in July after Eliseo Salinas was appointed president of research and development in June.</p><p><p><p><p>
