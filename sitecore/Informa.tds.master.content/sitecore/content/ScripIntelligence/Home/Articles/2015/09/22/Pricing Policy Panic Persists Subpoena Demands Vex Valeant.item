<p> Even as Wall Street analysts were trying to calm biotech investors on Sept. 28 after last week's panic over concerns Washington would try to control prices &ndash; triggered by the news that Turing Pharmaceuticals had increased by more than 5,000% the cost of its toxoplasmosis medicine Daraprim (pyrimethamine) &ndash; Democrats were turning up the heat, taking aim at Valeant Pharmaceuticals. </p> <p> The lawmakers demanded Valeant be compelled under subpoena to turn over certain documents detailing what was behind the significant boosts in the costs of its drugs. </p> <p> Valeant investors were none too happy the spotlight on high prices had now shifted from Turing and its CEO Martin Shkreli &ndash; dubbed last week on social media as the &quot;most hated man in America&quot; &ndash; to the Canadian drug maker. </p> <p> Indeed, shares of Valeant dropped 20% on Sept. 28, before closing at $166.50, down $32.97, or 16.53%. </p> <p> But it was biotech in general that suffered, with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index tumbling 8% on Sept. 28, before closing down 6.33%. </p> <p> All 18 members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led by ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-MD), called on the panel's chairman, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), to &quot;invite&quot; Valeant to testify at a hearing next week with Turing's Shkreli &ndash; insisting the two companies are using the same business model of buying up life-saving older &quot;neglected&quot; drugs, dubbing them &quot;specialty&quot; medicines and then significantly hiking their prices to maximize profits. </p> <p> Cummings already had partnered up with presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in pursuing <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">investigations into Valeant's</a> and other drug makers' pricing practices and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Buckle-Up-Drug-Makers-Bumpy-Pricing-Roads-Ahead-360425" target="_new">introducing legislation</a> intended to rein in the costs of medicines. </p> <p> But it was a tweet from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is seeking to be the Democratic nominee for the 2016 White House run, that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">caused a panic</a> on Wall Street on Sept. 21 &ndash; with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index immediately dropping, falling as low as 5.4%, before closing down 4.5%. </p> <p> The pricing controversy over Daraprim also provided an opening for Clinton to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">introduce her health care plan</a>, in which she takes aim at prescription medicine costs. </p> <p> Shkreli <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Turings-Shkreli-Caves-To-Pressure-Lowering-Daraprim-Price-360631" target="_new">caved under pressure</a> and said he would not charge the $750 per pill for Daraprim, whose price before Turing bought the drug in August was about $13.50 per tablet, although he would not disclose how much he was dropping the drug's price. </p> <p> Valeant grabbed the Democratic lawmakers' attentions by raising the prices of Nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) from $257.80 to $805.61, or 212.5%, and Isuprel (isoprenaline) from $215.46 to $1,346.62, or about 525%, after acquiring the cardiovascular medications from Marathon Pharmaceuticals this past February. </p> <p> Like Daraprim, Nitropress and Isuprel are older drugs and Valeant is the only company that markets the latter two medicines &ndash; as is the case for Turing with its product. </p> <p> So without alternatives, patients and payers are stuck &ndash; either they must pay the high costs or let patients go without. </p> <p> &quot;Valeant's price hikes on these two critical drugs area already having a huge negative effect on hospitals and other providers,&quot; the Democrats told Chaffetz, noting Cleveland Clinic has had to spend an additional $8.6m on the medicines so far this year. </p> <p> &quot;Since Valeant Pharmaceuticals has refused to provide any documents to Congress to explain its massive price increases for these two heart drugs, we request that the committee issue a subpoena compelling Valeant to turn over this information,&quot; the Democrats said. </p> <p> Cummings had sent a letter to Valeant on Aug. 12, but the Democrats noted in their letter to Chaffetz the company had rejected the request, declaring the information was proprietary and confidential. </p> <p> &quot;The American people &ndash; including Democrats, Republicans and Independents &ndash; are fed up with drug companies putting profits before people, and this issue affects the constituents of every single member of Congress,&quot; the Democrats said. </p> <p> Evercore ISI political analyst Terry Haines said his &quot;gut reaction&quot; to the Democrats' letter was that Chaffetz would ask Turing and Valeant to testify, but he doubted the Republican chairman would issue any subpoenas to either firm. </p> <p> Haines surmised the Democrats were seeking the subpoena to open Republicans to a charge they're &quot;soft on drug pricing, a political point.&quot; </p> <p> He said he also did not think the congressional scrutiny of drug pricing would lead to legislation in a Republican majority Congress &ndash; pointing out the party has never voted in favor of price regulation and &quot;are not about to start now.&quot; </p> <p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
