<p>Regulators and academics are meeting in Rome today and tomorrow to discuss ways of improving the diagnosis and treatment of dementia, with the focus on aspects such as clinical trial design, endpoints and benefit-risk balance, and the possibility of expedited drug approval procedures. </p><p>Hosted by the Italian regulatory agency AIFA, the two-day meeting will bring together representatives from the UK, Japan, Canada, the US, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, as well as the European Medicines Agency. They will hold "an open discussion on one of the diseases that will have the biggest impact in coming years," AIFA said.</p><p>The meeting is a follow-up to a workshop held in Geneva in November 2014 &ndash; the first time that the regulators had come together to discuss issues surrounding dementia. Both events are part of a wider global project &ndash; the Dementia Integrated Development initiative &ndash; being led by the UK government. </p><p>Following a declaration of intent issued at the G8 Dementia Summit in December 2013, the project kicked off with the first of a series of "legacy" global events in June 2014, covering topics like barriers to research and possible financial mechanisms to increase investment in innovation. </p><p>One of the overriding themes of the project is the need for a collaborative approach to filling in knowledge gaps and harnessing new technologies and tools to accelerate the development of potential new drugs.</p><p>At the November 2014 workshop, chaired by Raj Long, director of Dementia Integrated Development and a member of the World Dementia Council, participants agreed there were important gaps in the understanding of dementias, which hampered the discovery of effective treatments, and that there was a need for a collaborative approach to the challenges facing dementia R&D. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/International-regulators-make-dementia-plans-357321" target="_new">conclusions of the workshop</a> were published in March this year, at the same time as the World Health Organization held its first ministerial conference on global action against dementia. </p><p>Among the key issues identified were the high failure rate of new drugs in development (particularly at an early stage), ways of improving the efficiency of clinical trials, the development of standardized and validated endpoints for cognitive impairment, promoting regulatory consistency, and how to manage the likely high level of uncertainty at the time of regulatory submissions, especially if expedited or early approval procedures are used. Discussions also covered the industry, patient and clinical perspectives, as well as questions of regulatory science.</p><h2>Rome meeting</h2><p>Noting that the number of Alzheimer's disease patients was expected to rise from 44 million to some 135 million by 2050, AIFA said the second Dementia Integrated Development meeting in Rome on 9-10 June would be discussing "critical issues" related to the testing of new treatments for dementia. Reducing uncertainty with respect to diagnosis and disease progression, and being able to evaluate the outcome of treatments with reasonable statistical confidence, "can have a direct impact on the costs of research and may act as an incentive to continue to invest in this field," according to the agency.</p><p>Advances in neuroscience open up the possibility of earlier diagnosis of the disease, which could in turn allow earlier therapeutic interventions, although this will require a "collective effort" to gather and share epidemiological, clinical and neurobiological data in order to validate biomarkers, new diagnostic criteria and outcome measures", AIFA said. "Identifying areas of research and innovative methodologies that can effectively provide hope for the development of a cure for dementia and not just help relieve its symptoms is a challenge that we as scientists and regulators want to responsibly take charge of.&rdquo;</p><p>The agency also noted the relative lack of success of R&D in this area, and the need to balance rapid access to new treatments with proper assessment of safety and efficacy. Valentina Mantua, a psychiatrist and senior medical officer at AIFA's European Assessment Office, said that although the pharmaceutical industry had been investing in innovative therapies directly targeted to the molecular mechanisms of the disease, "no treatment is yet available on the market". </p><p>Regulatory agencies, she said, had "a twofold mandate: on one hand they must ensure that therapies that will prove effective and safe will be available to patients as rapidly as possible, on the other hand they need to ensure sufficient evidence to enable the correct assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of new treatments and understand the real added value of new technologies in terms of health".</p><h2>Other initiatives</h2><p>The question of diagnosis and new drug R&D is also being pursued in other fora. The EU's public-private Innovative Medicines Initiative earlier this year launched <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Overcoming-the-Alzheimers-challenge-I-SPY-style-356550" target="_new">EPAD</a> (European Prevention of Alzheimer's dementia), a research project aiming to get past some of the key hurdles restraining drug development in this area. Focusing on early intervention, EPAD will look at setting up a global infrastructure to enable studies in large enough numbers of people to confirm a therapeutic effect and to test several treatment options rapidly within one single trial.</p><p>In February, the US National Institutes of Health held an "Alzheimer's disease research summit" to develop research recommendations looking at ways of identifying the research priorities and strategies needed to accelerate the development of successful new therapies. Involving more than 60 experts from academia, industry, non-profit organizations and advocacy groups, the summit called for changes in the way that the biopharmaceutical, government and academic sectors generate, share and use knowledge, and looked at the infrastructures and partnerships needed to implement these changes.</p><p>The WHO's first ministerial conference on dementia on 16-17 March involved ministers from around the world, as well as experts from the research, clinical and NGO communities. The event, staged to raise awareness of the socio-economic burden of dementia, considered issues ranging from research and drug regulation to care and human rights. </p>
