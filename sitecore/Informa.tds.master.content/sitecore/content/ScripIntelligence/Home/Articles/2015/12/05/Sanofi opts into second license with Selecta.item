<p><p>Building on a relationship already in place, Selecta Biosciences is expanding its partnership with French pharma Sanofi to use its in-house technology platform to develop treatments for celiac disease. </p><p>The Watertown, Mass-based biotech has developed an immunotherapy platform, dubbed the Synthetic Vaccine Particle platform, or SVP, that is able to engineer nanoparticles to produce immune tolerance "by attenuating the overactive response to specific antigens," said the company in a 13 May statement. </p><p>Selecta CEO Dr Werner Cautreels explained during an interview that the SVP platform "teaches the immune system not to react to certain signals it receives" and the "immune system learns to ignore certain things that are immunogenics," he added. </p><p>Sanofi has exercised its option to use the SVP platform to develop an immunotherapy for the treatment of celiac disease, an intolerance to gluten that causes severe abdominal pain and can even lead to intestinal cancer. </p><p>Teams from both Selecta and Sanofi will work together through the discovery and preclinical phases, capitalizing on Sanofi's expertise in preclinical development. The smaller biotech is eligible to receive milestone payments on preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial activities for a total of $300m. Selecta is also entitled to double-digit tiered royalties as well. </p><p>The deal is the second the pair has inked; Selecta and Sanofi signed a licensing agreement with similar terms in 2012 for the development of an immunotherapy for the treatment of severe food allergies. </p><p>The pair also work in collaboration with the JDRF doing research for type 1 diabetes. </p><p>Cautreels noted that the SVP platform has broad applicability in three areas, including biologics, allergies and autoimmune diseases. The company has yet to do much work in biologics, but the platform has the ability to make these up-and-coming drugs more safe and tolerable for patients. </p><p>As for allergies, Cautreels said that Selecta prefers to partner in this area while it works on its own fully-owned compounds. "The field of allergies, we feel it's more efficient to outlicense our technology, as is the case with Sanofi," said the exec. </p><p>Meanwhile, the autoimmune space remains an untapped opportunity for Selecta. "We work together already with JDRF in a basic research capacity, but there is a full spectrum of autoimmune diseases where there needs to be more basic research to understand the antigens that are the underlying cause. I believe technology will encourage more research in this space," noted Cautreels, who hopes the future holds plenty of opportunities for Selecta's technology. </p><p><p><p>
