<p>Two years and three names later, Actavis will reinforce its branded pharmaceuticals-led growth strategy by changing its name to Allergan when the company's $66bn acquisition of the Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) maker closes within the next month or two.</p><p>Watson Pharmaceuticals changed its name to Actavis after it acquired the generic medicines company to move its headquarters to tax-friendly Ireland, boost its low-cost drug portfolio and increase its international presence (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Watson-buys-womens-health-focused-Uteron-for-up-to-305m-as-it-adopts-Actavis-name-339343" target="_new">24 January 2013</a>). Actavis's acquisitions since then, including its $25bn purchase of Forest Laboratories last year, were designed to speed the company's growth through development and commercialization of brand-name pharma products, hence the forthcoming name change to Allergan (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-in-25bn-Forest-buy-rumor-350092" target="_new">18 February</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110" target="_new">18 November 2014</a>).</p><p><b>2014 Results</b></p><p>North American branded pharma products recently became Actavis's largest and fastest-growing business segment with $1.81bn in sales during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 188% increase from $616m for the same period in 2013. Full-year North American brand sales jumped 336% to $4.57bn in 2014 from $995m in the prior year. </p><p>Meanwhile, North American generics and international pharma sales increased to $1.76bn in the fourth quarter from $1.72bn a year earlier. Full-year generics sales totaled $6.6bn versus $6.3bn in 2013.</p><p>Actavis reported a 48% year-over-year increase in revenue to $12.8bn in 2014 from $8.7bn in 2013 across all three of its major business groups, which includes the Anda Distribution segment. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) jumped 47% to $13.98 from $9.50, exceeding analyst consensus of $13.77 for full-year 2014 EPS.</p><p>Actavis forecast $15bn in 2015 revenue, not counting assets to be acquired from Allergan, which reported $7.1bn in 2014 product sales versus $6.2bn a year earlier. The company's non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2015 is $16.30 to $17.30.</p><p><b>Growth strategy</b></p><p>In addition to the acquisitions of Allergan and Forest, as well as the $1.1bn purchase of Furiex Pharmaceuticals and the buyout of Durata Therapeutics for at least $675m, Actavis will invest $1.7bn in research and development to grow its branded pharma portfolio (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-gaining-relevant-GI-position-with-Furiex-buy-351489" target="_new">29 April</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-builds-antibiotic-presence-with-675m-Durata-deal-354319" target="_new">7 October 2014</a>). </p><p>Actavis has nine gastrointestinal, central nervous system, women's health and anti-infective drug candidates in mid- and late-stage development that could generate $3.1bn to $6.25bn in sales annually by 2019, according to the company's projections. Allergan's assets will add ophthalmology, neurology, urology, dermatology and aesthetic products and pipeline programs to the company's portfolio. </p><p>The investments "will power Actavis's ascent into the fastest-growing and most dynamic growth pharmaceutical company in global health care," president and CEO Brent Saunders said in a statement unveiling Actavis's pharma pipeline.</p><p>Of course, the company will maintain its bread-and-butter generics business. Actavis has about 230 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) pending with the US FDA, including more than 40 ANDA filings in 2014 and 25 first-to-file applications, as well as almost 1,000 applications pending in international markets. </p><p>As the company integrates Allergan later this year, Actavis will adopt the Allergan name for almost all of its operations, but maintain its identity as Actavis for certain geographic regions and product lines.</p><p>"Together, our combined company will be equally focused on developing new medicines that meet unmet medical needs in critical therapeutic categories, as well as increasing global access to high quality, affordable medicines," Mr Saunders said in an 18 February announcement.</p><p>The company's stock closed down 1% at $284 per share after rising as high as $289.68 earlier in the day, which was a one-year high for Actavis's stock. The company's market cap is $75.3bn.</p><p><p><p><p>
