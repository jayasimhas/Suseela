<p>With some of the most complicated questions not likely to be resolved by the courts for potentially three to five years over the interpretation of various provisions in the extremely complex US biosimilars law &ndash; and the likelihood many more disputes will arise for years to come beyond the expected patent litigation &ndash; will some firms hold back or even avoid the area altogether, leading to the American market not being as robust as it could be?</p><p>"Perhaps," said New York lawyer Robert Cerwinski, a partner in the intellectual property litigation group at Goodwin Procter, although he pointed out it would depend on "so many commercial variables."</p><p>"There are a lot of potential players who are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the uncertainty to resolve itself because the investment in a biosimilar product is substantial," he said, noting it's conceivable some might get frustrated and abandon any plans to jump in.</p><p>Indeed, while small molecule generic drugs can be developed for about $1m to $2m, R&D costs for the much more complex large molecule biosimilars can go as high as $50m or beyond, Cerwinski told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>But he said it's highly unlikely the early adopters who already have been investing in biosimilars will be deterred, especially those companies that already have filed applications with the FDA or are on the verge of doing so.</p><p>"They are taking the long view of the market opportunity and are willing to make the investments," despite the potential they may have to wait an additional six months after approval before their products can enter the US market, Cerwinski said.</p><p>The 2010 law that gave the FDA the authority to approve biosimilars, known as the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act</i> (BPCIA), underwent its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Federal-Circuit-dances-with-biosimilar-laws-complexity-in-Zarxio-fight-358731" target="_new">first appeals court test in June</a> in a case involving a dispute between Amgen and Novartis unit Sandoz over the latter firm's product Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), which made history in March as the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">first biosimilar licensed</a> for the US market.</p><p>Both sides got a win and a loss when a three-judge panel at the Federal Circuit on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">July 21</a> handed down a mixed opinion, Cerwinski and his colleague at Goodwin Procter, Elaine Herrmann Blais, also a partner in the IP litigation group at the firm's Boston office, explained during an <a href="http://www.goodwinprocter.com/Events/Webcast-Library/2015/Amgen-v-Sandoz-On-Appeal.aspx" target="_new">Aug. 12 webinar</a>.</p><p>At issue was whether Sandoz failed to comply with BPCIA's disclosure and negotiation procedures about what patents will be litigated &ndash; often called the "patent dance &ndash; when it withheld its 351(k) biosimilars application and manufacturing information from Amgen, said Cerwinski and Blais, who co-author a <a href="http://www.bigmoleculewatch.com/" target="_new">blog on their firm's website</a>, <i>Big Molecule Watch</i>.</p><p>The court also looked at whether Sandoz failed to provide Amgen, whose human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim) was the reference on which Zarxio was based, with proper notice that the biosimilar maker planned to launch its product as soon as it won FDA approval.</p><p>Sandoz insisted it gave the proper notice when it sent a letter to Amgen on July 25, 2014, acknowledging the FDA had accepted the Swiss firm's 351(k) application.</p><p>But the Federal Circuit panel ruled 2-1 that when a 351(k) applicant opts out of the dance, notice of commercial marketing of biosimilars is mandatory and can only be given after FDA approval &ndash; telling Sandoz it had to wait 180 days, or six months, from when Zarxio was cleared before it could enter the market, or not until Sept. 2.</p><p>"That part of the decision was a surprise to the biosimilar industry," Blais told <i>Scrip</i>. "In this arena, six months is a lot of money. You could be talking about $1bn in six months."</p><p>But the panel also ruled 2-1 that Sandoz and other biosimilar makers could choose not to disclose their applications and manufacturing details &ndash; meaning, they could opt out of the patent dance.</p><p>Having the dance become optional, Cerwinski said in an interview, has shaken some of the assumptions of the biologics innovators.</p><p>"It's a bit of a disruptor to what a lot of folks expected a conservative timeline from application to actual biosimilar competition would be," he said.</p><p>Nonetheless, Blais said, getting the extra six months of exclusivity and the mandatory notice after licensure is more favorable than if the case had gone the other way for the innovators.</p><p>But the Federal Circuit panel's decision also left open several questions, Blais said.</p><p>For instance, she said, is the notice of commercial marketing mandatory after FDA licensure for all biosimilar applicants or only those that opted out of the patent dance? </p><p>And even if the parties engage in the patent dance, could the 180-day injunction after FDA licensure still apply?</p><p>Blais said those questions may get their day in court next July when another case filed by Amgen against Apotex involving its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-biosimilar-of-Amgens-Neulasta-under-FDA-review-355732" target="_new">pegfilgrastim biosimilar</a>, which is referenced on the former company's Neulasta, a long-acting form of Neupogen, goes before a judge in Florida.</p><p>Apotex actually engaged in the patent dance with Amgen, beginning in December 2014, and the firms agreed through those exchanges to include two patents covering Neulasta in their litigation process.</p><p>Apotex, however, sent Amgen a letter on April 17 of notice of commercial marketing.</p><p>So Amgen filed a complaint with the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida, accusing Apotex, like it did Sandoz, of violating BPCIA's notice requirements &ndash; sending it before the FDA had licensed the pegfilgrastim biosimilar.</p><p>So therefore, Amgen said, the notice was ineffective.</p><p>Amgen feared Apotex planned to try to launch its pegfilgrastim biosimilar on FDA approval without waiting to give notice on actual licensure.</p><p>"The complaint is very interesting for us armchair quarterbacks because it actually lays out in detail the exact dance the parties did &ndash; what they exchanged and when," Cerwinski said. "It squarely raises the issue of when does notice become effective when both parties actually dance. It also presents some interesting procedural issues. For example, there&rsquo;s a ripeness issue that makes us wonder when the court is actually going to deal with Amgen&rsquo;s count regarding the effectiveness of Apotex's notice. Is it going to wait until the FDA actually approves the application and then act to require Apotex to give the notice?" </p><p>Cerwinski said there's also the issue of what type of right of action there is under the BPCIA to enforce the act's procedural requirements. </p><p>"Does Amgen have a private right of action to enforce the notice provision? Does the court have the power to grant Amgen the relief it wants? There's a whole host of questions," Cerwinski said.</p><p>"The answers to these questions will have an impact on every biosimilar applicant who engages in the dance, so we&rsquo;re watching the case closely," he added.</p><p>Blais also noted <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Janssen-seeks-to-block-Celltrions-infliximab-biosimilar-357239" target="_new">another case</a>, expected to be heard at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts filed this past March by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen, which is trying to force Celltrion to engage in the patent dance over its infliximab biosimilar, which is referenced on Remicade, could answer additional questions.</p><p>With the complexity of the BPCIA, Blais said she anticipated the interpretation of the statute to be the subject of many more legal disputes for years to come &ndash; noting that even more than 30 years after the generics law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, was enacted, "new questions pop up all the time." </p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Drug-Makers-Betting-The-Farm-On-Others-Cybersecurity-359920" target="_new">Drug Makers Betting The Farm On Others' Cybersecurity</a></p><p>What can biopharmaceutical manufacturers and other firms do when they must put their trade secrets, data, financial details and other facts into the hands of others, like a government agency, such as the FDA &ndash; where it's mandated to be shared &ndash; or a publicity firm, where in both cases the owners of the information have no control to prevent a cyber attack?</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Economist-Pharmas-Are-Protected-Fragile-Little-Birds-359948" target="_new">Economist: Pharmas Are Protected 'Fragile Little Birds'</a></p><p>While makers of high-priced specialty drugs in the US like to think they are free-enterprisers operating in the competitive markets, what those firms really are, argued Princeton economics professor Uwe Reinhardt, are "fragile little birds" protected by the government, which he said "carefully shields" the companies from the "harsh vagaries of truly free, competitive markets."</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-Guidance-Aims-To-Advance-Facilitate-Rare-Disease-RandD-359972" target="_new">FDA Guidance Aims To Advance, Facilitate Rare Disease R&D</a></p><p>The FDA on Aug. 14 issued a new draft guidance document, <i>Rare Diseases: Common Issues in Drug Development</i>, aimed at advancing and facilitating the development of medicines to prevent and treat rare diseases and conducting more efficient and successful programs through a discussion of selected issues commonly encountered by drug makers.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">Valeant Latest Congressional Target Over High Drug Prices</a></p><p>Valeant Pharmaceuticals became the latest drug maker targeted by lawmakers over high drug prices.
