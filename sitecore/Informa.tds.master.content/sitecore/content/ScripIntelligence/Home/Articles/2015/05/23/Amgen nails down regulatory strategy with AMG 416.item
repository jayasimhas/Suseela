<p><p>With strong Phase III results for its chronic kidney disease drug, Amgen is prepping to file a new drug application with the FDA.</p><p>At the ERA-EDTA Congress in London on 29 May, the big biotech announced the results from two late-stage studies of AMG 416 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease. Both of the studies were successful in meeting their primary endpoint and reduced parathyroid hormone by greater than 30% compared with placebo. </p><p>The drug is being positioned as a follow on offering to Amgen's blockbuster Sensipar (cinacalcet). While previously announced trials have been successful, the company had not announced any timelines for filing an NDA with FDA. Now the company expects to file this year. Previously, Amgen said it hopes to gain five drug approvals this year. So far it's gotten an approval for the heart drug Corlaner (ivabradine) and is on track to gain approval for the cholesterol lowering drug Repatha (evolocumab). Yet, the company recently pulled out of a partnership with AstraZeneca on the inflammatory drug brodalumab after concerns regarding suicide risk surfaced. </p><p>SHPT affects about two million people who are currently on dialysis and is caused by an increase in parathyroid hormone as kidney function declines. AMG 416 is a calcimimetic agent that binds to the calcium channels and decreases the production of the hormone. </p><p>The two 26-week studies, which included over 1,000 patients total, showed that a statically significant number of patients &ndash; about 52% -- achieved parathyroid hormone level of 300 pg/mL, compared with only 5.9% on placebo. Patients in the trial were given either AMG 416 or placebo three times per week intravenously. Those patients on the drug saw improvements in secondary endpoints as well. </p><p>Amgen is hoping that AMG 416 will replace Sensipar when it goes off patent in 2018; the drug currently brings in more than $1bn annually. The dosing schedule will be more convenient with AMG 416, which is dosed three time per week, while Sensipar is dosed daily. </p><p><p>
