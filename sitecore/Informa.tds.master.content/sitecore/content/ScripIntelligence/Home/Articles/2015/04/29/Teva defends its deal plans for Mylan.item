<p>Teva Pharmaceuticals has issued a statement to investors refuting the allegations from Mylan of mismanagement and has renewed its commitment to making a deal with the generic drug maker. </p><p>The Israeli company posted an investor presentation on its website on 05 May and filed the slides with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but failed to increase its offer to Mylan of $82 per share, or $43bn. </p><p>The original proposal was made on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Rejections-All-Around-Mylan-to-Teva-Perrigo-to-Mylan-357994" target="_new">21 April</a> after much speculation that Teva was interested in Mylan and after the intended target had announced its own intentions to acquire fellow generic drug maker Perrigo. </p><p>The main claim of the 45-slide presentation was that Teva is "fully committed and willing to devote the time necessary to unlocking value" for shareholders of both companies. The presentation goes on to reinforce that the offer could be completed within the year and has a strong cultural fit &ndash; something Mylan executive chairman Robert Coury has hotly contended in his own rejection letter to Teva. </p><p>The Israeli company insists that it has a "well-respected and established leadership team," despite the upheaval the company has been going through over the last few years. </p><p>Teva has been in and out of the news because of the problems its executive team has had with its board of directors, as well as the highly public, and messy exit of Jeremy Levin &ndash; a CEO who earned the company praise. Levin's hasty exit a couple of years ago after just 18 months on the job was a signal to the market that there are deeper problems at the company &ndash; something Coury was also quick to point out in his <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mylan-to-Teva-we-dont-want-your-problems-358077" target="_new">27 April letter</a>. </p><p>Despite Coury's clear objections, Teva is convinced that the combination of the two companies will create an "industry-leading" company with "significantly expanded and more efficient global footprint," as well as "enhanced global infrastructure to pursue current and future commercialization."</p><p>The Israeli pharma argues that the businesses are highly complementary because Teva has 42% of its business in specialty pharma and 49% in generics, while Mylan's revenue mix is 13% specialty and 49% generic. </p><p>Both companies have approximately the same geographic mix with about 50% in the US/North America, about 30% in Europe and approximately 20% in the rest of the world. Mylan countered previously that the businesses were in fact too overlapping and would therefore deplete value of both companies. </p><p>One of Teva's most compelling arguments is its successful history in integrating large acquisitions, including its 2008 acquisition of Barr Pharmaceuticals, its 2010 acquisition of Ratiopharm and its 2011 acquisition of Cephalon. </p><p>Yet, these acquisitions have done little to fix the problems at the company as recent quarterly earnings showed &ndash; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Teva-still-in-pursuit-of-Mylan-raises-guidance-358179" target="_new">revenues</a> from its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) was down 14% year-over-year to $954m. </p><p>The company continues to battle generic competition, but the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SandozMomenta-nab-1st-US-generic-Copaxone-launch-unclear-357920" target="_new">first biosimilar</a> of the drug has recently been approved by the FDA. </p><p>"Teva is well on its way to create a new future for the company by targeting a unique space in the industry, building on its strong capabilities in generics and specialty and the intersection between the two. [The] Mylan proposal aligns with this strategy by aggressively pursuing growth opportunities positioning Teva to succeed in the evolving global pharmaceutical industry," concluded the presentation</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
