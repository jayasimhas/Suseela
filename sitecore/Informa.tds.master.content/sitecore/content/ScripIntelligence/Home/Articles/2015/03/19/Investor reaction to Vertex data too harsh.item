<p>New cystic fibrosis data from Vertex Pharmaceuticals has investors discouraged, pushing the stock down almost 4% to linger near $126 at the end of trading on 23 March, despite the study showing positive results that have confirmed the company's move into Phase III. </p><p>Investors in the big biotech were disappointed with data from a Phase IIb trial of VX-661 in conjunction with Vertex's already-marketed cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor). </p><p>Patients in the 12-week study were given either a placebo or one of two doses of VX-661 (100mg daily or 50mg twice daily) with Kalydeco (150mg twice daily). The 39 patients included in the study had two copies of the F508del mutation &ndash; a hard-to-treat patient population. </p><p>"We see this as disappointing and it suggests to us that the risk of failure in the heterozygous population is high," wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a 23 March note. </p><p>The trial was conducted to prove the safety data for the drug was strong enough to move into Phase III trials, while secondary endpoints measured the effectiveness by looking at percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) and sweat chloride levels. </p><p>Vertex is hoping to use the combination to expand the patient population that currently uses Kalydeco. The already-marketed treatment works by helping proteins move through the cell membrane; VX-661 is meant to facilitate Kalydeco in getting those proteins to the proper place. </p><p>Kalydeco currently is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-expanded-pediatric-use-of-CF-drug-Kalydeco-357372" target="_new">approved</a> by the FDA for cystic fibrosis patients with certain mutations &ndash; about 3,400 people, but the addition of VX-661 could mean an expansion to that population by another 17,000 patients.</p><p>Yet, analysts and investors are skeptical about whether the combination will work in the hard-to-treat patient population. </p><p>The trial showed that VX-661 in combination with Kalydeco was generally well-tolerated. No patients dropped out of the trial. The most common adverse events were pulmonary exacerbation and cough &ndash; both conditions were seen in a slightly higher percentage of placebo patients. </p><p>The positive safety data confirms Vertex's decision to begin Phase III trials. The late-stage program consists of four Phase III studies, including a trial in patients with two copies of the F508del mutation that began enrolling earlier this year. The other three trials will include patients with various different mutations. </p><p>The data that investors were displeased about was the efficacy data, despite there being a statically significant improvement in patients on the drug combination. Patients taking VX-661 and Kalydeco showed an improvement of 4.4 percentage points (p=0.009) in ppFEV1 from baseline at four weeks, while placebo patients did not show an improvement. </p><p>The data continued to be statistically significant at 12 weeks, with patients in the drug combination group showing an improvement of 3.0 percentage points (p=0.026) in ppFEV1 compared with an improvement of 1.0 percentage points in the placebo group. </p><p>Analysts speculate that the apparent decline in efficacy data from week four to week 12 could have confused investors, causing the stock slip. </p><p>"We spoke with management about these data and they note that these data are consistent with other studies. They highlighted the safety as an important takeaway. They also highlighted that there was not a decline through week 12 where the ppFEV appears to decrease to 3%, but rather this indicates stable function within a range," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Dr Robyn Karnauskas in a 23 March note. </p><p>Vertex has other combinations in development that include Kalydeco and could treat the F508del population. A combination of Kalydeco and VX-809 has a 5 July user fee action date with the FDA &ndash; an approval Dr Karnauskas estimated would add $500m to 2015 revenues.</p><p>Kalydeco initially was approved in the US in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-drug-to-treat-underlying-cause-of-cystic-fibrosis-approved-in-the-US-326472" target="_new">January 2012</a> for CF patients 6 years or older with at least one copy of the G551D mutation. It has since been approved for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Vertex-wins-expanded-pediatric-use-of-CF-drug-Kalydeco-357372" target="_new">several other mutations</a>. </p><p><p><p>
