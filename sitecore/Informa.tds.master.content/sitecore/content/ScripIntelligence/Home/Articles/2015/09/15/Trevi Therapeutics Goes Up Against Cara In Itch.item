<p>Trevi Therapeutics has announced positive Phase II/III results for its lead product nalbuphine ER tablets in treating uremic pruritus. </p><p>Uremic pruritus is a persistent and debilitating itch that occurs in kidney disease patients on dialysis. Currently there are no treatments specifically approved for this condition although Trevi and another US company, Cara Therapeutics, are both vying to be the first to provide one.</p><p>Trevi's study compared two doses of nalbuphine (60 mg and 120 mg) twice daily with placebo for six weeks after a two-week titration period in 370 haemodialysis patients in the US and Europe. Patients scored their itch intensity on the NRS scale and those given the 120 mg dose reported a highly statistically significant 3.5 point reduction (p=0.017) in itch intensity from a mean baseline score of 6.9 (7.0 is deemed severe) to 3.4 (mild). </p><p>Trevi said the difference was seen as early as one week following titration to the fixed dose, and the significant separation from placebo remained throughout the remaining blinded period.</p><p>The reduction in itch seen with the 60mg dose was not statistically significant. </p><p>At the end of a subsequent wash-out period, patients were eligible to roll over into a six-month open-label extension study, which Trevi expects to be completed by year-end.</p><h2>Rivals</h2><p>Nalbuphine acts by antagonising both the mu and kappa opioid receptors, which have each separately been shown to reduce itching. By contrast, Cara's difelikefalin (CR845) only acts through kappa receptor antagonism. This product has also shown statistically significant reductions in itch intensity in a 65-patient Phase II study <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Cara-is-itching-for-approval-359595" target="_new">reported in July</a>.</p><p>The two companies are set to proceed into full Phase III trials, with Cara scheduled to meet FDA before the end of 2015 to discuss its plans and expects to start the trial begin in 2016. Trevi says it will meet the FDA and EMA and work in parallel with both agencies in planning its pivotal trial. </p><p>In the meantime, Trevi claims that its product will have the edge over Cara's, which so far can only administered intravenously. "Although it may be useful for patients on hemodialysis [to have an I.V. product], it will not be practical to use it more broadly in itch," the company told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Trevi also pointed out that it has a much more robust data set: it has eight-week data in 370 US and EU patients, while Cara only has two-week data from 65 patients. "They still need to establish the durability of effect for their drug, as it has only been developed for acute indications."</p><p>The two products' side-effect profiles could ultimately prove important. In their Phase II studies, adverse events associated with difelikefalin were dizziness and transient numbness, whereas Trevi's patients experienced dizziness with vomiting, nausea and somnolence.</p><p>Trevi is also developing nalbuphine ER for use in prurigo nodularis, an intensely itchy dermatological condition with the presence of papules and nodules, which also has no approved treatments. Data from its Phase II/III trial in this indication are due to report in the first half of 2016. </p><p>
