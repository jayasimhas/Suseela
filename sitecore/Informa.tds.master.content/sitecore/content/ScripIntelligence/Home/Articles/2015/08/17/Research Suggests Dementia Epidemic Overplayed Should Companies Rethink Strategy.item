<p>Contrary to expectations of a "dementia epidemic", a new study has found that the number of cases in some western European countries seems to be stabilizing, if not decreasing, thanks to better living standards and management of vascular and chronic diseases. Companies investing in expensive and elusive dementia breakthroughs may be disheartened to hear the review's lead author caution against "the current overemphasis on diagnostics and drug interventions".</p><p>Nevertheless, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Casey Godbout says that the study should be interpreted with caution and questioned its findings. More research to assess global trends in dementia prevalence are required, she said. </p><p>"Conservatively, these studies may suggest that dementia prevalence proportions have stabilized over time; however, this is no reason to celebrate. While the review asserts that the prevalence proportions of dementia may be stabilizing we disagree with the statement that the number of people with dementia are also plateauing. Increasing elderly populations will contribute to a growing number of prevalent dementia cases even if prevalence proportions are stable," said Godbout.</p><p>The review from the University of Cambridge, published in <i>The Lancet</i> on 21 August, looked at the occurrence of dementia in five studies &ndash; one from England, Spain and the Netherlands and two from Sweden &ndash; between 2007 and 2103 using consistent research methods and diagnostic criteria. </p><p>Four of the studies showed non-significant changes in overall dementia occurrence over the past 20 to 30 years. The England study revealed a significant drop of about 22% in overall prevalence in people aged 65 years in 2011 compared with predicted estimates from 1990. And results from the Spanish study showed a significant reduction of about 43% in dementia prevalence in men aged 65 and older between 1987 and 1996. One Swedish study and the Dutch studies showed the age-specific incidence of dementia is falling in these regions.</p><p>The review's authors say they cannot find evidence to support predictions of an epidemic, like that made by Alzheimer's Disease International. In 2013 it said that there would be around 135 million people with dementia by 2050 and such figures have been taken very seriously. In 2013, the G8 pledged action, while in 2014 UK Prime Minister David Cameron promised a treatment would be available by 2025.</p><p>The authors claim these estimates are based on outdated epidemiological research from the 1980s. "These old studies support the idea of a continuing 'dementia epidemic', but are now out of date because of changes in life expectancy, living conditions, and improvements in health care and lifestyle," according to says Carol Brayne, lead author and Professor of Public Health Medicine at the Cambridge Institute of Public Health, part of the University of Cambridge.</p><p>According to Brayne, the up-to-date evidence indicates a more positive outlook for future trends. She called for research and societal focus to center on primary prevention and move away from "what could be seen as the current overemphasis on diagnostics and drug interventions for dementia".</p><p>The review warns that "inconsistent [research] methods, enormous political interest, and stakeholder and public awareness could influence interpretation of scientific evidence for dementia." It adds that catastrophic predictions about dementia in an aging society "serve present political and charity campaigns, and encourage investment into pharmaceutical and health-care industries, maintained by sustained attention of social and general media."</p><p>The review says that dementia research is still largely focused on biomarkers, biochemical mechanisms, treatments and cure. A research impact report from the UK's Alzheimer's Society reveals that between 1990 and 2012, 65% of research funding was spent on research into causes, cure and treatment development. Some 5% of funds went towards studies on risk factors and preventive strategies, 11% went to research on diagnosis and 20% was invested in care and support research. </p><p>However, Datamonitor Healthcare's Godbout remains uncertain of the findings. "More research is needed to assess global trends in dementia prevalence Two data points are not sufficient to conclude true variation in prevalence over time and many of the data points are quite old. Only the UK, found a significant decrease in dementia prevalence over time, however, low-response rates may have contributed to this, although the true effect is unknown," she said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
