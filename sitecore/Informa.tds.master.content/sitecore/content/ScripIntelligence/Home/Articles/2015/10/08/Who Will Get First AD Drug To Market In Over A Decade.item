<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug developer Axovant Sciences, which earlier this year raised a record-breaking sum of cash, has launched a large Phase III study for its 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, RVT-101&ndash; a move it hopes will set the company up to seek the first approval for any new AD product in over a decade. </p><p>The 5-HT6 class has been an active space for Alzheimer's research &ndash; a notoriously tricky area of with a high margin for failure &ndash; with a number of pharmas getting products into larger clinical trials. </p><p>H. Lundbeck A/S has been leading the way with its offering, idalopirdine (Lu AE58054), which is in Phase III; while Pfizer Inc. and Suven Life Sciences also have 5-HT6 receptors in Phase II for the treatment of AD. AbbVie is a bit further behind with a Phase I candidate. </p><p><b>5-HT6 Receptors In Development</b></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Originator Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Partner/ Licensee</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Stage of Development</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>GlaxoSmithKline (discontinued)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Axovant</p><p>(ongoing)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>RVT-101</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Lundbeck</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Otsuka</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>idalopirdine</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase III</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Suven Life Sciences</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>None</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SUVN-502</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pfizer</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>None</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>PF-5212377</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Roche Holdings AG (discontinued)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>BioTie Therapeutics</p><p>(ongoing)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SYN120</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Abbott</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AbbVie</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ABT-354</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AllaChem</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>None</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AVN-101</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase I</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>AllaChem</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Avineuro</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AVN-211</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Suven Life Sciences</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>None</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SUVN-507</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Suven Life Sciences</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>None</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>SUVN-512</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Preclinical</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><h2>First New AD Drug?</h2><p>If successful in Phase III, Axovant intends to submit a new drug application to FDA by the end of 2017. But it will be fighting for first-to-market status for this class of AD drugs against Lundbeck's product. </p><p>It will also be competing to be the title of "first AD therapy in over a decade" against Forum's encenicline, which is also entering Phase III. Encenicline, a partial agonist of the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, saw positive Phase II data in which the 2 mg dose of the drug improved ADAS-cog scores by 2.2 points over 23 weeks in "add-on" patients stable on ACheI therapies and "de novo" patients who had never taken or had previously taken but were not currently being treated with AChEI therapies, donezepil or rivastigmine.</p><p>Analysts' current impressions are that encenicline has the better data. </p><h2>GSK Cast-Off</h2><p>Axovant, a wholly owned subsidiary of Roivant Sciences, picked up RVT-101 from GlaxoSmithKline for just $5m, via a licensing agreement, in December 2014. At the time, some saw this as GSK losing faith in the product, which in July 2011 reported poor results in two failed six-month trials. Both of these trials missed their primary endpoints of significant improvement in cognition. GSK determined the product didn't warrant the R&D spend required to take it to market. </p><p>However, others believed the drug just fell afoul of cost-cutting. It has since shown statistically significant results in Phase II and has shown stronger efficacy data overall than its biggest competitor, Lundbeck's idalopirdine.</p><p>In Phase II, an analysis of all patients with complete data at each study visit showed that patients receiving 35 mg RVT-101 in combination with approved, generic therapy donepezil demonstrated significant improvements in cognition and function at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks, compared with patients receiving donepezil alone. But analysts at Sagient Research's BioMedTracker noted the Phase II data showed that the effects of RVT-101 were only modest on cognition. </p><p>However, they said "even mild improvement on top of stable donepezil treatment would fill a large unmet need." The analysts added, "We believe that replication of this Phase II trial using the ADCS-ADL and ADAC-Cog endpoints could very well lead to approval." </p><p>Based on the Phase II results, BioMedTracker increased its likelihood of approval rating for RVT-101 by 5%, to 20%, which is 3% above average for a similar product at the same stage of development. </p><p>Axovant managed to gain a strong amount of investor support for its only pipeline candidate in June when it raised a massive $315m through an initial public offering; this year's biggest biotech IPO so far in terms of money raised. </p><p>Daniel Chancellor, lead analyst at Datamonitor Healthcare, said investors were buying into this drug because "the general sentiment around Alzheimer's disease R&D is much more positive compared to a couple of years ago."</p><p>He added, "Axovant will sink or swim based on this drug, but then the company was only created because of the opportunity to in-license the product for a low price."</p><h2>Phase III Details</h2><p>On Oct. 6, the FDA agreed to a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) supporting Axovant's Phase III program for RVT-101, providing further backing for the drug's promise in AD. </p><p>The 24-week Phase III MINDSET trial will compare 35 mg, once-daily oral doses of RVT-101 to placebo in approximately 1,150 patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease on a stable background of donepezil therapy. The primary efficacy evaluations are the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL), each of which have been used as endpoints to obtain regulatory approval of currently-marketed AD treatments in the US and Europe, Axovant noted. The study is being led by Axovant chief development officer Dr. Lawrence Friedhoff, who previously headed the development program for donepezil (Eisai Co., Ltd /Pfizer Inc.'s Aricept, approved in 1996), the most widely used Alzheimer's treatment.</p>
