<p>India has underscored the significance of proactive reporting of adverse reaction-related "administrative action" of foreign regulators by "importers" of medicines as part of efforts to improve regulatory compliance in the country.</p><p>An importer is required to report, from "time to time", such administrative action namely market withdrawal, regulatory restriction or cancellation of authorization and "not of standard quality report" of a drug pertaining to the registration certificate declared by any regulatory authority of any country where the drug is marketed, sold or distributed, a notice by Dr GN Singh, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), said.</p><p>It is not immediately clear what triggered the DCGI's notice, but its contents are largely encapsulated in Schedule D(1) of India's Drugs & Cosmetics Rules 1945.</p><p>"The despatch and marketing of the drug in such cases shall be stopped immediately and the licensing authority be informed immediately. Further action in respect of stoppage of marketing of the drug shall be taken as per the directions of the licensing authority," the DCGI's notice dated 4 June affirmed.</p><p>While India expects to take action "equivalent" to that taken with reference to the drug in the country of origin/marketing, the licensing authority can also direct "any further modification" to this course of action, including its withdrawal from the Indian market within 48 hours. </p><h2>Dependence</h2><p>Some industry experts, however, flawed the Indian regulator's compliance approach, given the seeming extent of reliance on the importer to trigger action.</p><p>"It looks as if the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) wants to depend on the information from the importer to take regulatory action in India. Unless, the CDSCO has its own sources for remaining up-to-date by effective networking with the US FDA / EMA / MHRA and other regulators, this circular may not achieve the desired objective," an industry expert told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The expert said that global agencies may take their time to evaluate the overall safety profile before making a decision and in such a scenario, Indian patients may continue to take a "potentially unsafe" drug till the global regulatory decisions are announced. </p><p>"The CDSCO should have its own Indian based pharmacovigilance system which dynamically reviews reports of adverse drug reactions and assesses risk-benefit ratios in real time. It should also issue a public advisory for doctors/patients along the lines of the US FDA."</p><p>Another official with a large multinational firm told <i>Scrip</i> that it is surprising that the onus of reporting has been put on manufacturers and that the regulator seems "comfortable enough" to depend on their "alacrity" to report developments in an area that should ideally be the regulator's domain. </p><p>"Has the DCGI put in place a parallel system to collect data and adverse event reports on its own? After facing flak in the past for its flip-flop on first banning, then reversing the ban for a number of products, one would expect more alacrity from the regulator. If not, this would appear as a good way to fix blame on the industry for failing to update the regulator rather that it accepting blame for its lackadaisical approach," the official said.</p><p>On the 48 hour withdrawal window specified, the official said that most often manufacturers withdraw their products voluntarily to pre-empt such action and mitigate further risk to human lives.</p><h2>Response time</h2><p>Industry watchers say that the Indian regulator has, in general, lagged response time in such cases in the past, save a few exceptions. A case in point is probably India's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-bans-gatifloxacin-and-tegaserod-312855%5d" target="_new">2011 decision</a> to ban the manufacture, sale and distribution of the antibacterial, gatifloxacin, and the constipation and irritable bowel syndrome therapy, tegaserod, in view of certain risks associated with these products. </p><p>Kyorin Pharmaceutical and Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma had in 2008 voluntarily discontinued all sales of Gatiflo (gatifloxacin) in Japan, among the last major markets for such withdrawal, while Novartis' Zelnorm (tegaserod) was withdrawn from the US market at the FDA's request in March 2007.</p><p>However, in the case of anti-obesity drugs sibutramine and R-sibutramine, India appears to have acted promptly and <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/India-joins-list-of-countries-banning-sibutramine-306378%5d" target="_new">suspended the importation and manufacture</a> of the products in line with international regulatory action against Abbott's Meridia (sibutramine) due to cardiovascular risks. </p><p>The DCGI's notice also comes at a time when the <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-Lilly-JandJ-dinged-by-FDA-SGLT2-alert-358454%5d" target="_new">US FDA recently observed</a> that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may cause ketoacidosis, a serious condition in which the body produces ketones, or high levels of blood acids, which may lead to hospitalization. </p><p>Asked whether Johnson&Johnson would require to share such safety communication with the Indian regulator under the 4 June diktat in view of Invokana's (canagliflozin) recent domestic launch, Janssen India told <i>Scrip</i> that it works closely with the DCGI and abides by all its related policies and procedures. </p><p>"These do not require us to notify the DGCI of the recent FDA advisory on SGLT2 inhibitors.However, as patient safety is our number one concern and as a responsible healthcare company, we have proactively notified the DGCI of the advisory. We continue to monitor related developments and will keep the DGCI updated," Janssen said.</p>
