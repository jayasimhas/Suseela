<p>AbbVie disclosed on 12 January the FDA had approved Duopa, an enteral suspension formulation of carbidopa and levodopa, as a treatment for motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.</p><p>The drug is intended to be administered using a small, portable infusion pump, which delivers carbidopa and levodopa directly into the small intestine for 16 continuous hours via a procedurally-placed tube.</p><p>In the advanced stages of Parkinson's, patients may begin to experience "off" time &ndash; periods of poor mobility, slowness and stiffness. </p><p>Duopa was shown to significantly reduce the amount of off time advanced Parkinson's patients experienced in clinical trials, noted Dr Warren Olanow, a professor neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the lead investigator for AbbVie's pivotal trial of the drug.</p><p>In Parkinson's, the spontaneous emptying of the stomach can be unpredictable, which can affect the timing of when orally administered medicines are absorbed in the small intestine. </p><p>But Duopa can provide patients with the same active ingredients as orally-administered carbidopa and levodopa immediate-release (IR) in a suspension that goes directly into the small intestine via a tube placed by a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy procedure with jejunal extension &ndash; bypassing the stomach, according to AbbVie. </p><p>The FDA approved Duopa based on a multicenter 12-week, double-blind, double-placebo, active-control, parallel group Phase III trial, which compared the efficacy of the drug to oral carbidopa-levodopa IR tablets in advanced Parkinson's patients. </p><p>The study showed that Duopa significantly reduced daily mean "off" time at 12 weeks by four hours, which resulted in an average of 1.9 fewer hours of "off time," versus carbidopa-levodopa IR tablets. </p><p>Treatment with Duopa also was associated with an improved mean "on" time &ndash; periods when the medication is working and symptoms are controlled &ndash; without uncontrolled movements, or dyskinesia by four hours at 12 weeks, which resulted in an average of 1.9 hours more "on" time, compared with carbidopa-levodopa IR tablets. </p><p>The most common adverse events were complication of device insertion, nausea, constipation, incision site erythema, dyskinesia, depression, post procedural discharge, peripheral edema, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, atelectasis, confusional state, anxiety, dizziness and hiatal hernia.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
