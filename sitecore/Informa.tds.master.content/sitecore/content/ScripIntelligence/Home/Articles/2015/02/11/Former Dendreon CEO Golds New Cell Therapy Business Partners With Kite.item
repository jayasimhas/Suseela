<p>With insights into what's needed to make a cell therapy for cancer succeed, former Dendreon Corp. CEO Mitchell Gold is shepherding new technology for closely-watched immunotherapies into the clinic through his latest company Alpine Immune Sciences Inc., which has entered into a $535m-plus partnership with Kite Pharma Inc.</p><p>Cell therapy developers learned a lot from Dendreon's experience with the hotly-anticipated immunotherapy <i>Provenge</i> (sipuleucel-T), which didn't live up to its blockbuster expectations once the autologous cell therapy entered the commercial market. Gold left Dendreon to pursue other projects in 2012 &ndash; before Provenge's fire sale this year to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International &ndash; and sold his first venture Alpine Biosciences to Oncothyreon Inc. in a $27m all-stock transaction in August 2014.</p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Oncothyreon-builds-targeted-portfolio-with-Alpine-buy-353338" target="_new">Alpine Biosciences was built to develop protocells</a> &ndash; nanoparticle therapies used for targeted delivery of nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, small molecules and other types of therapeutic agents for cancer and rare diseases. Seattle, Washington-based Alpine Immune Sciences (AIS) is developing protein-based therapies that harness the immune system to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p><p>AIS has two platform technologies: the variant immunoglobulin domain (vIgD) platform to enhance or diminish an immune response, and the transmembrane immunomodulatory protein (TIP) technology, based on vIgD, to improve the efficacy and duration of engineered T cell therapies, such as Kite's chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) and T cell receptor (TCR) therapies. </p><p><b>Lucrative Deal Terms</b></p><p>Kite paid $5m up front and committed undisclosed research funding to AIS plus up to $530m for reaching research, clinical and regulatory milestones under an agreement to develop protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse. AIS also may earn low single-digit royalties.</p><p>The deal gives Kite an exclusive license to two targets from Alpine's TIP platform. Kite will use the technology to develop next-generation T cell therapies that are designed to overcome inhibitory mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. </p><p>"We believe the ability of AIS's TIP technology to modulate the immune synapse can be incorporated into engineered T cell therapies to advance CAR and TCR product candidates into multiple tumor types," Kite president and CEO Arie Belldegrun said in a joint statement from the companies.</p><p>AIS was founded based on the ideas of two former Amgen Inc. scientists, Michael Kornacker and Ryan Swanson, after Amgen shut down its Seattle research campus in 2014. Gold and Jay Venkatesan, partners in the venture capital firm Alpine BioVentures, agreed to fund AIS after meeting Kornacker and Swanson in early 2015. </p><p>Gold is the startup's executive chairman, Venkatesan is the CEO, Kornacker is senior vice president of protein engineering, and Swanson is senior vice president of immunology.</p><p><b>Setting The Stage For Combinations</b></p><p>AIS will build on the growing legacy of cancer immunotherapies, which got their start when the tuberculosis vaccine known as <i>bacillus</i> Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) began to be used in bladder cancer. BCG was followed by Provenge, which was followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors <i>Keytruda</i> (pembrolizumab) from Merck & Co. Inc. and <i>Opdivo</i> (nivolumab) from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</p><p>"Now, the next wave is engineered cell therapy drugs, as well as doublet or combination products. We will see combinations between PD-1s and cell therapies," Gold predicted.</p><p>AIS's TIP technology could be delivered to the surface of T cells to enhance the efficacy or durability of CAR-T and other cell therapies. The company's vIgD platform will be used to design therapies that target multiple aspects of the immune system at the same time.</p><p>"I've been around the immunotherapy field for a long time and I'm super excited by the data we've seen clinically, but it's still early in the development of immuno-oncology. We're still learning very much about interactions within immune cells," Gold said. "But the science I've seen at Alpine is some of the best in the immuno-oncology space."</p><p>AIS is researching what happens when molecules interact in the immune synapse &ndash; the communication center for cell surface molecules that activate and regulate the immune system. The company is developing treatments that exploit interactions within the immune synapse, which could be especially important now that immuno-oncology players are starting to combine treatments to boost the immune system's response to immunotherapies.</p><p>Outside of cancer immunotherapy, Venkatesan noted that the AIS platform "has the potential to overcome the overactive immune system in autoimmune diseases." He said there are "a lot of opportunities to improve how we modulate the immune system and get the best outcomes for patients."</p><p><b>Provenge's Contribution</b></p><p>Still, cancer is a big focus for immunomodulatory agents in development, following on the heels of Provenge, Keytruda and Opdivo. </p><p>"Provenge was a very important landmark in terms of bringing an immunotherapy into cancer treatment. What we learned is that the cost of goods is important," Gold said.</p><p>Provenge has been hurt by the time and cost involved in producing the autologous cell therapy and shipping it back to oncologists that will administer the treatment. Sales also were hurt by targeted prostate cancer treatments with similar or better efficacy, including the androgen receptor inhibitor <i>Xtandi</i> (enzalutamide) from Medivation Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc., and the CYP17 inhibitor <i>Zytiga</i> (abiraterone) from Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary Janssen Biotech Inc.</p><p>With too much debt and too few Provenge sales, Dendreon auctioned off the rights to Provenge and related assets earlier this year under the supervision of US Bankruptcy Court, agreeing to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-ups-bid-for-Dendreons-Provenge-to-400m-356577" target="_new">sell the cell therapy to Valeant for $400m</a>.</p><p>Despite the failure of Provenge to reach blockbuster status &ndash; 2014 sales totaled $303.8m &ndash; Gold said the cell therapies in development now are "standing on the shoulders of Provenge."</p><p>"The physicians prescribing it didn't have a lot of experience with autologous therapies. Now, because of Provenge, they are comfortable giving autologous products to patients," he said.</p><p><p><p><p>
