<p>Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov called 2014 a "historic, transformational" year which saw "record progress", and sales climb by 23% to $5.8bn. And 2015 got off to a flying start: within the first few weeks Shire announced its largest acquisition to date and the first approval for a drug to treat binge-eating disorder, Vyvanse.</p><p>In addition, the firm said it expects to deliver further growth in 2015 and has forecast $10bn in product sales by 2020. Shire's share price closed up 5% at &pound;49.97 on the London Stock Exchange following presentation of the annual and fourth quarter results (12 February).</p><p>"Management continues to deliver strong results, highlighting the underlying core fundamentals of the business," noted analysts from Cowen.</p><p>Dr Ornskov said that much of Shire's growth last year was driven by its rare disease business, which grew by 46%. Product sales in 2014 included $538m for products acquired with ViroPharma, primarily $503m from orphan drug Cinryze. The inclusion of ViroPharma contributed 12 percentage points of product sales growth in the year. Product sales in the fourth quarter were up by 17% to $1.5bn.</p><p>Cowen analysts believe 2015 "could prove transformative from a pipeline disclosure perspective." Shire plans to launch Natpara (a treatment for hypoparathyroidism), which it is bringing in through the acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals, announced last month. Natpara sales have been forecast to top $500m. The $5.2bn deal is Shire's largest purchase to date, with Dr Ornskov gambling correctly on Natpara's US approval, which followed two weeks after the deal was announced (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shire-paying-5.2bn-for-rare-disease-specialist-NPS-356071" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 January 2015</a>). The acquisition also brings Gattex, an approved treatment for short bowel syndrome. Gattex sales were around $100m in 2014.</p><p>Shire will also file the NDA for Lifitegrast for dry eye shortly, and is reporting Phase II data for Premiplex for retinopathy of prematurity. The latter two products are both potentially $1bn-plus opportunities, say Cowen.</p><p>"If we are correct, with traction in Natpara &ndash; benefiting from 2015 investment spending &ndash; and anticipated launch of Lifitegrast in 2016 &ndash; combined with likely additional capital deployment &ndash; should lead to one of the best growth profiles in the larger pharmaceutical-biotechnology space. Few to any entities look like this."</p><p>All this however highlights Shire's worth to potential suitors. It narrowly avoided being bought up by AbbVie last year (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-drops-Shire-bid-354511" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16 October 2015</a>). Its independence was saved only following the US Treasury's tightening of tax rules.</p><p>Dr Ornskov defended Shire's tax position, which has come under criticism from some quarters. "We are totally law-abiding and we have an obligation to our investors to look at tax in an efficient manner," he said on a conference call accompanying the results. However, re-locating Shire was not an option. "We are looking to do many things in 2015 &ndash; changing domicile is not one of them."</p>
