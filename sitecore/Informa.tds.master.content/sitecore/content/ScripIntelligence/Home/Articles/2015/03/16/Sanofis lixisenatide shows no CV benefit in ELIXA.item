<p>Sanofi's GLP-1 agonist lixisenatide has failed to show any benefit over placebo for cardiovascular safety in a high-risk population of adults with type 2 diabetes in the Phase IIIb ELIXA study. </p><p>The integrity of this study was the reason cited by Sanofi back in September 2013 for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-pulls-US-lixisenatide-filing-346519" target="_new">its decision to withdraw the US filing for lixisenatide</a>, which by that time had already been approved in Europe, Japan and elsewhere under the Lyxumia trade name. It said that the filing's inclusion of early interim results from the trial, making them publicly available, could compromise the study, and that it intended to complete the trial before resubmitting sometime in 2015.</p><p>This refiling is now slated for the third quarter and will include the ELIXA data which do at least confirm its non-inferiority to placebo on CV safety to placebo. If approved, Sanofi stressed, this would make the lixisenatide the only GLP-1 agonist with long-term CV safety data on its label. </p><p>If launched in 2016, lixisenatide will need help in catching up with the other GLP-1 agonists in the US following the delay, especially in competing with newer more convenient GLP-1 agonist products that are dosed weekly rather than daily. Based on efficacy results and brand loyalty, analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare expect lixisenatide will take only a very small share from the market leader Victoza (liraglutide). </p><p>Added to this is the fact that many patients will be switching to basal insulin/GLP-1 agonist combinations, including Sanofi's investigational lixisenatide/insulin glargine combination, currently in Phase III and where most of the potential for lixisenatide is believed to lie. Other pressure will come from the new SGLT2 inhibitors, like AstraZeneca/Bristol-Myers Squibb's Forxiga (dapagliflozin) and Johnson & Johnson's Invokana (canagliflozin), which will delay the use of GLP-1 agonists. </p><p>Lixisenatide was licensed from Danish firm Zealand Pharma in 2013 in the hope that it would help offset the loss of sales from the loss of patent protection for its blockbuster insulin product, Lantus. Sanofi's US sales difficulties in its diabetes franchise contributed to the removal of former CEO Chris Viehbacher late last year. </p><p>The 6,000-patient ELIXA trial was designed to show that showed that lixisenatide can reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina] compared with placebo in type 2 diabetic patients who recently experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. </p><p>Sanofi has released no further details but the data will be presented in full at the American Diabetes Association meeting on 8 June. </p><p>
