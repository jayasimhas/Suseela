<p><p><p>Failure is fairly common in the world of biotech development as companies struggle to bring candidates forward, but the impact those results have on other candidates in development is what is really important to investors. For Xenon, the company is hoping a failure in osteoarthritis pain doesn't affect an ongoing study in neuropathic pain. </p><p>Investors believe it just might, pushing the stock down as much as 35% in early morning trading on 01 July. The stock was able to rebound slightly, trading down only 21% midday to linger near $9.10. </p><p>Xenon Pharmaceuticals announced that its Phase IIb topical inhibitor of the sodium channel Nav1.7 failed to produce statistically significant efficacy when compared with a placebo in 380 patients. The 15-month trial of TV-45070, which was conducted by partner Teva Pharmaceuticals, was tested at two different dose levels in patients with pain in the knee from osteoarthritis. </p><p>The partners didn't release any further data, but noted that the drug was safe and well-tolerated, as well as produced fewer signs of rash than other analgesics. </p><p>Teva is currently conducting another Phase IIb study of TV-45070 in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) that is expected to read out in the second half of 2016. </p><p>Xenon President and CEO Dr Simon Pimstone called the results "disappointing" during a sameday conference call with investors, but confirmed the commitment to the program from both Xenon and Teva. The company had strong preclinical and animal models that showed the drug should work in osteoarthritic pain, but had yet to test TV-45070 in humans in this indication. Further development in osteoarthritic pain will not continue. </p><p>Dr Pimstone made no excuses about the failure, noting during the call with investors that the trial was well-powered and that the placebo response was in-line with what the company expected. </p><p>A major failure for a biotech can often be indicative that its platform technology is not reliable and could mean other failures are down the line. </p><p>The failed mid-stage trial was the first conducted since Teva licensed the drug from Xenon in 2012 for an upfront of $41m and the promise of $335m in milestones. Teva is on the hook to conduct a total of three trials, including the failed OA trial, as well as the ongoing PHN trial. The pair is partnered on other programs in the pipeline and Xenon has several other large pharma partners including Roche's Genentech and Merck & Co &ndash; all of which are based on Xenon's Extreme Genetics platform. </p><p>Dr Pimstone insisted that the failure does not translate to a problem for the PHN program or any of Xenon's other candidates in development. "Both Teva and Xenon believe that today's data do not impact the rationale or the opportunity in neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain represents a distinct disease condition and as we've seen with other pain drugs, results in nociceptive pain are not indicative of results in neuropathic pain, and vice versa," said the exec on the call. </p><p><p>
