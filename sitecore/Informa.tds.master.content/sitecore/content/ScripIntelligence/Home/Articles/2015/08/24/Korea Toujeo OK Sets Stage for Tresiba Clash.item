<p>Sanofi's next-generation basal insulin Toujeo has been approved in South Korea and looks set to compete with Novo Nordisk's Tresiba (degludec), which is also expected to be launched there soon.</p><p>Sanofi-aventis Korea, a local affiliate of Sanofi, said it has received marketing authorization from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for its Lantus follow-on product Toujeo Solostar (insulin glargine, 300U/mL), a new long-acting basal insulin for the treatment of diabetes in adults.</p><p>Sanofi's Lantus (insulin glargine) is the most widely used diabetes therapy in the basal insulin segment in South Korea. Toujeo is set to vie with Novo Nordisk AS's similar product Tresiba, which received marketing approval from the MFDS a few months earlier this year. </p><p>Both products will be covered by the National Health Insurance scheme when they hit the South Korean market, but the exact timing of their respective launches hasn't been determined yet.</p><p>Toujeo, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Sanofis-Toujeo-can-now-face-off-with-Novos-Tresiba-in-Japan-359244" target="_new">approved by the Japanese authorities</a> in July for the first time in the Asian region, is expected to face tough competition from Tresiba, which is already marketed in Japan. </p><p>However, it may come into a less fierce environment in South Korea, as both products are expected to be launched at a similar time. Toujeo is also likely to benefit from Lantus&rsquo;s dominant status in the country.</p><p>Toujeo is now also available in the US, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands and has been registered in Australia. Sanofi noted the product would become available in other additional countries in the coming months.</p><h2>Approval Basis</h2><p>The MFDS&rsquo;s decision to grant marketing authorization for Toujeo was based on results from the EDITION study, a worldwide Phase III program evaluating the efficacy and safety of the product in more than 3,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes that were uncontrolled on their current therapy.</p><p>In the EDITION study, Toujeo was comparable to Lantus in terms of blood sugar control while reducing the risk of hypoglycemia compared to Lantus both at any time of the day and at night in people with type 2 diabetes. Toujeo also demonstrated more stable and more predictable glycemic control which lasted beyond 24 hours and the within-individual blood sugar variability was lower than Lantus.</p><p>In spite of its efficacy in blood glucose control, about half of diabetics worldwide still fail to achieve the target level on insulin therapy. In South Korea for example, patients achieving the target HbA1C level (< 6.5%)="" account="" for="" only="" 22%="" of="" all="" diabetes="" patients.="" patients="" who="" have="" experienced="" hypoglycemia="" also="" cannot="" be="" injected="" with="" the="" optimal="" dose="" of="" insulin="" due="" to="" hypoglycemia="" concerns,="" which="" contributes="" to="" failure="" in="" target="" blood="" glucose="" level=""></p><p>Toujeo helps diabetes patients reach glycemic goals by allowing more aggressive blood glucose control with a lower risk of hypoglycemia.</p><p>A more stable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics profile can also lead to more sustainable and prolonged blood sugar control for more than 24 hours through a once daily injection. Patients and diabetes experts can in turn be more aggressive in treating the disease, and insulin glargine has also demonstrated long-term cardiovascular safety through its clinical program.</p><p>The number of diabetics in South Korea has been rising steadily, and in 2013 about 3.2 million people in the country had the disease, accounting for 12% of adults aged 30 years or over. But people with pre-diabetes status were estimated to number around 6.6 million and as a result, about 5.9 million people are expected to suffer from diabetes in 2050, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control.</p><p>This article is also being published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.
