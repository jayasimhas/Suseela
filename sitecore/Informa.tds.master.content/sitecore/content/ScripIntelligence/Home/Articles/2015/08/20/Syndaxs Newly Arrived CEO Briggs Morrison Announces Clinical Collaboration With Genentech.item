<p>Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc. - which recently lured respected scientist Briggs Morrison away from AstraZeneca to be its CEO - has entered a clinical collaboration with Genentech Inc. to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of its lead asset, entinostat, an oral small molecule targeting immune regulatory cells (myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs)), in combination with the Roche Holding AG biologics division's PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. </p><p>Under terms of the deal, announced on Aug. 27, Syndax will conduct the Phase Ib/II trial in triple-negative breast cancer. It includes a provision where the duo may extend the collaboration to include a Phase III clinical trial and additional trials in new indications of mutual interest. </p><p>Entinostat is currently being evaluated in a Phase Ib/II clinical trial for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma and in a Phase III clinical trial for advanced breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is estimated to account for 10-20% of all diagnosed breast cancers and is characterized by a lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER-), progesterone receptor (PR-) and HER2 (HER2-) on the breast cancer cells.</p><p>"Clinical development collaborations with industry leaders are an essential element of our strategy to realize the full potential of entinostat and position Syndax at the forefront of next-generation immuno-oncology therapy. This collaboration expands our emerging immuno-oncology program into an important new indication," Morrison said in a statement. The American had up until June been at AstraZeneca, steering its late-stage development for both small and large molecules. He was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Is-Sean-Bohen-360101" target="_new">replaced there by Sean Bohen</a>, who left Genentech where he was senior vice president in charge of early clinical development. </p><p>Explaining why he decided to move to Syndax, Morrison said: "With a breakthrough designation in advanced breast cancer and emerging preclinical and clinical data as an epigenetic immunomodulator, I believe entinostat could become a cornerstone combination therapy for a broad range of cancers." </p><p>Its pact with Syndax further extends Genentech's combination study program for atezolizumab: On Aug 12 it unveiled a research deal with Immune Design Corp. a day after announcing that the company had entered into a partnership with Clovis Oncology Inc. </p>
