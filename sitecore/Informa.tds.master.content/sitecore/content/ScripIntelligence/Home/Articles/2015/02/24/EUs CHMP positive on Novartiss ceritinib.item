<p>The EU's CHMP has granted a positive opinion for Novartis's Zykadia (ceritinib) to treat adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib (Pfizer's Xalkori), making it set to be the first specifically approved treatment option for this population. </p><p>Crizotinib is the only currently approved medicine for the treatment of previously treated locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. However, even with treatment, disease progression typically occurs. Furthermore, not all patients respond to crizotinib treatment, the committee noted. </p><p>It added that Zykadia provides a treatment option for a high unmet medical need in patients previously treated with crizotinib, as treatment options are currently very limited. </p><p>However, the approval will only be conditional as the data available so far are based on two uncontrolled studies. Nevertheless, they show that Zykadia&rsquo;s benefits for treating patients with this condition were clinically relevant and outweighed the risks of adverse effects. The CHMP has requested further results from ongoing studies and a comparative Phase III study within the next three years. </p><p>Zykadia was first approved for this indication in the US last year (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Breakthrough-status-drives-Novartis-Zykadia-to-early-FDA-win-351512" target="_new">30 April 2014</a>), and has since received the go-ahead for marketing in Mexico, Chile, South Korea, Guatemala. The FDA decision came four months earlier than expected due to Zykadia's breakthrough therapy designation, which recognizes drugs that show promising results in early clinical testing in diseases with unmet needs.</p><p>However, Zykadia and other second-generation ALK inhibitors (eg Roche's alectinib) are launching into a fairly small market, since ALK-positive patients represent about 3% to 5% of NSCLC patients.</p><p>Ultimately, and depending the results of Phase III trials, Zykadia is likely to progress to become a first-line option for patients exhibiting the ALK rearrangement, allowing it to take substantial market share from Xalkori, analysts at Datamonitor Healthcare believe.</p><p>
