<p>Merck & Co. Inc. has been fairly tight-lipped about its cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor anacetrapib for hypercholesterolemia while the 30,000-patient Phase III REVEAL clinical trial is ongoing, but the company said on Nov. 13 that the drug passed a recent futility test.</p><p>The REVEAL data monitoring committee (DMC) conducted a planned review of unblinded safety and efficacy data and said the trial should continue with no changes. But whether CETP inhibition safely increases good HDL cholesterol and lowers bad LDL cholesterol, producing important cardiovascular benefits, is a question that will remain unanswered for at least another year and a half, since no other safety or efficacy analyses are planned for REVEAL before the study's conclusion in early 2017.</p><p>Merck is forging ahead through a field littered with failures, including Eli Lilly & Co.'s recently concluded Phase III program for evacetrapib. The Merck and Lilly drugs were the last two Phase III candidates in development to broadly treat high LDL cholesterol when Lilly's ACCELERATE clinical trial was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Who-Suffers-From-Lillys-Evacetrapib-Failure-361000" target="_new">stopped for futility in October</a>.</p><p><b>Glimmers Of Hope</b></p><p>With the view of CETP inhibition growing increasingly negative, Merck beat analyst expectations by announcing that its DMC recommended continuation of REVEAL after an interim review.</p><p>"Given the questions surrounding the CETP inhibitor class following the recent termination of [Lilly's] evacetrapib program, we see very low probability of stopping at interim for superiority and increased chances of stopping for futility," Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a report weeks before the DMC recommendation was disclosed.</p><p>But Merck's not the only company keeping hope alive in the CETP field. DalCor Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. licensed Roche's failed CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib in June with plans to screen 30,000 patients and test the drug in 5,000 people who have acute coronary syndrome and an unspecified genetic marker. DalCor's $250m clinical trial will be conducted in partnership with the Montreal Heart Institute. </p><p>Besides the Lilly and Roche drugs, the other high-profile CETP inhibitor failure was Pfizer Inc.'s torcetrapib in 2006, but UBS Securities LLC analyst Marc Goodman said in a Nov. 5 report that while anacetrapib is one of the biggest wild cards in Merck's portfolio, it may be different enough from its unsuccessful competitors to show a worthwhile benefit in Phase III. </p><p>Goodman said torcetrapib failed due to increased risk of death from cardiovascular issues, but the adverse events (AEs) in Pfizer's studies may have been off-target effects "that are unrelated to CETP inhibition, as other CETP inhibitors do not exhibit torcetrapib-like AEs."</p><p>The UBS analyst also noted that dalcetrapib is a prodrug that's different from other CETP inhibitors and failed in 2012 due to a lack of efficacy, while evacetrapib might have failed due to a molecular structure that could be similar to torcetrapib.</p><p>Merck also may benefit from a Phase III clinical trial that has more than two times the 12,000 patients enrolled in Lilly's evacetrapib trial, a four-year treatment period rather than 2.5 years in the Lilly study, and patients who are in better cardiovascular health than in the Lilly program, Goodman wrote.</p><p><b>IMPROVE-IT Sets Precedent?</b></p><p>Merck is confident that <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-and-Cos-IMPROVE-IT-hits-its-target-355102" target="_new">the results of its IMPROVE-IT study</a> testing the CV benefits of its cholesterol absorption inhibitor <i>Zetia</i> (ezetimibe) versus <i>Vytorin</i>, which combines Zetia and <i>Zocor</i> (simvastatin), will help the company make the case that lowering bad LDL cholesterol has a significant impact on CV health regardless of the mechanism of action. </p><p>"Our IMPROVE-IT data, which became available a year ago, demonstrated that reductions in serum LDL cholesterol levels, whether achieved using statins or using the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, had predictable and similar effects on the risk of major cardiovascular events," Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president at Merck and president of Merck Research Laboratories, said during the company's third quarter earnings conference call on Oct. 27.</p><p>"Since CETP inhibitors also dramatically reduce serum LDL cholesterol levels, it is now especially important to know whether this biochemical effect is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Our REVEAL study is explicitly powered to see this effect," Perlmutter said.</p><p><p><p><p>
