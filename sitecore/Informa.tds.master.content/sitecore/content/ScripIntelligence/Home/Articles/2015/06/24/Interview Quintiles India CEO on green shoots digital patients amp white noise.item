<p> Naz Haji, Quintiles' new country CEO for India, claims there are green shoots in India's beleaguered clinical research segment. Sponsors, he says, are beginning to reassess decisions to move studies away from the country, although he admits the confidence gap may take a while to bridge. </p> <p> In an interview with <i>Scrip</i>, Mr Haji, who doubles up as Quintiles' Senior VP and CIO (Asia) and has experience of life and work in many continents, also explained why Quintiles is uniquely placed in the emerging world of trials impacted by mobile and wearable technologies. </p> <p> The Quintiles executive also stressed that it is vital for the biopharmaceutical industry to invest in patient-driven services and online communities that help shape a networked model of communication among patients. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/4D474A0C6CD7469BBCBF01DC1240AEF3.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>Naz Haji, CEO, India and senior vice-president and CIO (Asia) for Quintiles</i> </p> <p> <b>Scrip: You've taken charge at Quintiles India at a pretty challenging time for the clinical research segment in the country replete with evolving regulations, an ongoing court case and a significant trust deficit among both the public and possibly some regulators as well (post the </b><a target="_new" href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Flawed-GVK-studies-EMA-sticks-with-suspension-as-firm-fights-on-358568">GVK Biosciences case</a><b>). What is the ground situation like? Are sponsors still overly cautious and India off-radar for many? </b> </p> <p> <b>Naz Haji:</b> This is indeed an interesting time to be in India. The last two years were challenging for clinical research in the country but since December 2014, the Indian regulators have taken steps to address many of the challenges faced by stakeholders. While the intent is to build a more robust and scientific framework for the conduct of clinical research, it will take some time before we begin to see the real impact of these changes. Sponsors are beginning to re-evaluate earlier decisions to move studies away from India but restoring confidence and trust takes time. All stakeholders have an important role to play in rebuilding this trust given the high burden of disease we have in the country and the need for more investment in clinical research. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Are there grey areas that urgently need to be addressed in the interim?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> There is a fair amount of clarity in the regulation so we do not see grey areas. What we would welcome are a review of and addressal of some areas that continue to be a concern like a more predictable review and approval process for clinical trial applications, rationalization of the mandated audio visual recording of the informed consent process and the removal of a cap on the number of trials an investigator can handle at any given point in time. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Earlier this year, the CDSCO highlighted efforts to expedite the trial approval process &ndash; an area of long-standing industry concern. In the first two months of 2015, subject expert committees (SECs) evaluated 201 of the 254 applications, yet trial approval data suggests that just 19 trials were approved up to April this year. How does one read these numbers?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> I cannot comment on this specifically as I am not privy to whether these applications were for new trials or amendments and whether additional information was asked for and approvals submitted are therefore still pending. However, feedback from the industry in general is that the approval process is much more efficient and streamlined with the appointment of more experts to the SECs and a published schedule of meetings. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: There are signs of a shakeout in the Indian CRO segment and some small and mid-sized units have either scaled down or put themselves on the block. Would Quintiles look at value buys in such a scenario or is inorganic growth in this region not really a priority currently?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> I cannot comment as business decisions are guided by several considerations. India is and will continue to play a strategic role in Quintiles' growth. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Could you share Quintiles' experience with the risk-based trial approach? How is it driving efficiencies, improving the quality of data in trials, especially in the APAC region/India? </b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> We cannot isolate India and the region as the risk-based monitoring (RBM) studies we do are global. Quintiles has evolved RBM using data-driven processes and insights to drive faster, more informed decisions that can improve a customer's probability of success. We are the RBM market leader and are currently engaged in more than 130 studies using RBM processes and policies, across more than 26,000 sites and 260,000 patients. We have a significant and growing team working on RBM in India and the work we are doing in this area is fairly advanced and industry leading. </p> <p> We have seen our RBM model deliver value in several areas including: </p> <ul> <li>the ability to impact clinical monitoring costs, with data reviews enabling reduced source data verification (SDV) models without impacting risk or quality, allowing redistribution of on-site visits and resulting in reduced clinical monitoring costs; </li> <li>decreased time to analysis-ready data, providing rapid access to data for subject-level reviews and medical monitoring, along with increased efficiencies during the data review process; and </li> <li>increased quality/reduced risk, with holistic, subject-level reviews identifying data quality issues not caught in a traditional model, and enabling cross-subject/cross-site reviews that might not be identified with traditional approaches. </li> </ul> <p> <b>Scrip: Some experts suggest that we are going to see more and more clinical trials include in-life phenotype data. Is this the future of trials and how are regulators viewing this?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> Overall, advancements in technology are playing an increasingly important role in our understanding and management of healthcare and disease. These advancements are also impacting the way clinical trials are being conducted and managed &ndash; remote-based monitoring, wearable devices, wearable sensors, etc., are all indicative of this trend. We will continue to see developments in this area with a focus too on how the data is captured and used, and the inter-operability of devices and technology. Regulators recognize the growing importance of the digital ecosystem and we believe they will take a pragmatic view towards developments in this area. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: With the emergence of wearable devices/mobile health, real-time patient information can be made available to sites. How well placed is Quintiles to make best use/advance such innovation?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> Quintiles is uniquely placed in this space in multiple ways. First, our superior technology platforms allow for integration with a broad range of input systems, including wearable devices. </p> <p> Second, Infosario One, our newly launched mobile platform, leverages best-in-class and reliable platforms that we can use not only with phones and tablets, but with the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; as well. Our deep understanding of country and regulatory requirements around how data can be captured and used, coupled with our strong technology foundation, allows us to build and partner with products that can help ensure the accuracy and safety needs of a clinical trial. Where some companies may have the technology and others may understand devices, Quintiles is able to assimilate both and overlay it with our superior delivery expertise and deep market knowledge on how to effectively run clinical trials. Whether it be in a Phase I trial all the way through a late phase trial, our global operational experience blended with our proven technology innovation offering positions Quintiles at the edge of innovation. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: Has Quintiles' Digital Patient Unit made an impact in the Asian region? Are tie-ups along the lines of the one with the American Diabetes Association some years ago a possibility in markets like India?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> I cannot comment on speculative questions about possible tie-ups but globally the digital patient is pushing the biopharmaceutical industry to make fundamental changes, many of which present solutions to a number of the industry's biggest challenges. Investing in patient-driven services and online communities that help to build a networked model of communication among patients, their health care providers and other stakeholders will be critical for the biopharmaceutical industry going forward. Companies that embrace the idea of digital patients and learn to successfully engage with them could distinguish themselves. </p> <p> <b>Scrip: What do you see as the next big disruptive innovation in the trials segment?</b> </p> <p> <b>NH:</b> It's very difficult to highlight just one innovation but if I had to, it would be Predictive Analytics. Quintiles recently announced two enhancements to its risk-based monitoring (RBM) solution, Data-driven Trial Execution (DTE). These enhancements enable study teams to identify the right signals and predict clinical trial site performance and potential patient safety issues before they occur. Called Predictive and Advanced Analytics, the capabilities combine advanced statistical monitoring and predictive analytics to improve precision in risk identification by better understanding underlying &quot;white noise&quot; from safety trigger processes. Predictive and Advanced Analytics are the first such model-based capabilities fully integrated into an RBM solution in the market today. </p> <p> Additionally, mobile and wearable technologies will be significant going forward. The evolution of wearable technology goes beyond just the gadget itself and encompasses the data it collects, the significance of this data, and how the data is interpreted. Organizations that are able to integrate all of this seamlessly will be able to harness the power of data across the drug development continuum to improve a customer's probability of success. </p>
