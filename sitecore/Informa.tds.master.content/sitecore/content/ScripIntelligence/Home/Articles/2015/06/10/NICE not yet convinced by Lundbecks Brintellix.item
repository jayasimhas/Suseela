<p>NICE wants more information on Lundbeck's novel antidepressant Brintellix (vortioxetine) before it gives it the green light for funding on the NHS in England and Wales. </p><p>In draft guidance issued for consultation, the institute said it was not yet minded to recommend vortioxetine for treating adults with major depressive episodes after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy. It has requested further clarification and analyses from the company to address the issues identified before it decides whether it would be a cost-effective use of NHS resources.</p><p>NICE's appraisal committee acknowledged that having more treatment options was important for patients, and that vortioxetine may be beneficial for some people with a major depressive episode after initial primary care generic SSRI therapy. But it concluded that there was no convincing evidence to show that vortioxetine was any more or less effective than other antidepressants. The committee members also felt the company had not sufficiently defined how vortioxetine would be used in the NHS, or reflected its potential position, within its economic model.</p><p>In response, Lundbeck told <i>Scrip</i> that it was pleased that the appraisal committee had recognised the need for a range of treatment options for major depressive disorder, and had acknowledged vortioxetine may be a valuable treatment option for people with MDD who are experiencing cognitive dysfunction. </p><p>"Whilst of course we are disappointed the committee have not at this stage granted a straight 'yes' decision, it should be remembered this is only a preliminary decision and we will fully engage with NICE to conduct the further analyses requested. MDD has a complicated and often lengthy treatment pathway, and so it is understandable that additional information will help determine whether there is a specific group of patients where most benefit can be demonstrated from a clinical and cost-effectiveness perspective."</p><p>The preliminary recommendations are now available for public consultation. Comments received during this consultation will be fully considered by the committee at its next meeting, after which the next draft guidance will be issued. </p><p>The multi-modal antidepressant received EU approval in December 2013 to treat major depressive episodes in adults. Vortioxetine is thought to act as a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B partial agonist and 5-HT1A agonist. </p><p>The price of a pack (28 tablets) of 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg tablets is &pound;27.72 (excluding VAT), although costs may vary in different settings because of negotiated procurement discounts.</p><p>Until final guidance is issued to the NHS, NHS bodies should make decisions locally on the funding of specific treatments. Once NICE issues its final guidance on a technology, it replaces local recommendations across the country. </p><p>
