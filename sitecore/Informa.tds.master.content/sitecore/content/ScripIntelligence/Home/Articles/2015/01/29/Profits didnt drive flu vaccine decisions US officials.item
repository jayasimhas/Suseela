<p>Profits did not drive the decision not to have manufacturers do a mid-course shift when it was recognized early on the H3N2 influenza strain had "drifted," and therefore would not match the vaccine that was produced for the Northern Hemisphere's 2014-15 season, US officials insisted during a Capitol Hill hearing on 3 February.</p><p>Rather, they said, the reason a separate monovalent vaccine was not pursued to address the drifted H3N2 strain, which has turned out to be particularly bad flu, was due more to a lack of manufacturing capacity. </p><p>The 2014-15 flu vaccine has ended up being only 23% effective for the overall US population &ndash; much less so for most American adults, demonstrating only 12% effectiveness for those 18-49 years and 14% for those 50 years or older (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/CDC-US-flu-vax-only-23-effective-12-most-adults-356168" target="_new">15 January 2015</a>).</p><p>"With this mismatch, we could have 50,000 Americans who could die this year of flu," asserted Representative David McKinley (Republican-West Virginia), noting that&rsquo;s more than the 47,424 US soldiers who died in combat in Vietnam.</p><p>"If an astounding 50,000 deaths and 200,000-plus hospitalizations does not equal an emergency then what is? Shouldn't we be treating this problem with more urgency?" demanded Representative Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which convened the hearing (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Timing-or-economics-US-vulnerable-after-flu-vaccine-mismatch-356203" target="_new">19 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said her agency first saw a handful of drifted H3N2 viruses in March 2014, with an analysis showing about 4% of those circulating did not match the strain that was selected just a few weeks earlier for the vaccine &ndash; the A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like virus. </p><p>By May, that figure had grown to 17%, and by about June, it was up to 36%.</p><p>But "despite a growing body of knowledge that the vaccine for the United States would not be effective, production went forward anyway for a number of reasons," Representative Murphy said.</p><p>Dr Robin Robinson, director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, however, argued "it would have been very, very difficult" for manufacturers to have shifted gears in June or July.</p><p>By September 2014, when the products had already reached the shelves in doctor offices, clinics and pharmacies, the mismatch of the H3 strain selected for the vaccine and the drifted viruses circulating in the US, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, had grown to more than 50%.</p><p>So the World Health Organization recommended manufacturers include the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 strain in the Southern Hemisphere's vaccine.</p><p>Members of the subcommittee wanted to know why, then, could manufacturers not have made a new vaccine at that point for the Northern Hemisphere, even in limited doses, to at least protect the most vulnerable US populations &ndash; like the elderly, babies and those with compromised immune systems.</p><p>Instead, declared Representative Murphy, "the American people were stuck with a vaccine that wasn't going to work for nearly 4 out of 5 people and nearly 9 out of 10 seniors."</p><p>Dr Schuchat insisted "there were many activities&rdquo; that were undertaken to address the emergence of the drifted strain.</p><p>She said the CDC even prepared a candidate vaccine virus against the drifted H3N2 strain last spring so that companies could produce a vaccine, although that product was not taken forward into production.</p><p>Dr Schuchat argued the issue of protection against the flu revolves around what strains are dominant, what efficacy the vaccine has and how many people can get the vaccine.</p><p>"A highly effective vaccine with very few doses available may not be as good as a moderate or low efficacy vaccine and a lot of doses available," she contended. </p><p>Dr Schuchat defended manufacturers not pursuing a monovalent vaccine against the H3N2 drifted strain, arguing it "has been quite challenging" to produce a product.</p><p>And, she said, even if a monovalent vaccine had been produced, she doubted Americans would be lining up to get it, given they already are not keen on getting the flu shot anyway &ndash; with only 46% of people in the US getting vaccinated against influenza during the last season.</p><p>"Flu is something scientists take seriously, but the American public takes for granted," she said. </p><p>Dr Schuchat said there are up to 35 million cases of the flu each year in the US, with as many as 600,000 of those hospitalized.</p><p>In the past five years, flu-related deaths have run from 5,300 to 39,000, she said.</p><p>Dr Schuchat reminded lawmakers that even in a good year, flu vaccines are only about 60% effective, with "a lot of morbidity and mortality."</p><p>While a vast majority of the strains selected for the annual flu vaccine have "been on track," she noted this is the fourth time "an important mismatch" has occurred in the past 20 years.</p><p>Vaccines licensed by the FDA for the current season include CSL's Afluria; GlaxoSmithKline's Fluarix trivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval trivalent and FluLaval Quadrivalent; MedImmune's FluMist Quadrivalent; Novartis' Fluvirin and Flucelvax; Protein Sciences' Flublok; and Sanofi's Fluzone trivalent and Fluzone Quadrivalent</p><p><b>Moving to a universal vaccine</b></p><p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said his researchers and those funded by his agency are getting close to a successful universal flu vaccine.</p><p>A universal influenza vaccine potentially could provide protection against numerous strains of influenza including those that drift or event shift, such that protection could be sustained over multiple seasons, Dr Fauci said.</p><p>Advances in the understanding of the structure and immunological characteristics of hemagglutinin (HA), a protein on the surface of the influenza virus targeted by the protective effect of the immune system, have shed light on the basic science behind universal influenza development, he explained.</p><p>Using advanced genetic and structure-based technologies, scientists have determined that most antibodies against the influenza virus target the head of the "mushroom-shaped" HA protein structure, Dr Fauci said.</p><p>But, he said, "the sobering news is that's a variable region, which tends to change as flu drifts from season to season, and it changes a lot when going to a pandemic."</p><p>In contrast, researchers have discovered that the stem, or sometimes called the stalk, region of the HA protein is relatively unchanged among different influenza strains, Dr Fauci said.</p><p>So, he said, given this stability, an immune response against this stem could elicit a broad immune response effective against multiple influenza strains.</p><p>The NIAID chief said his agency has intensified its universal influenza vaccine R&D activities focusing on the HA stem region, with researchers funded by the agency advancing several promising universal influenza vaccine concepts into early clinical trials.</p><p>He said they plan to test candidates in the next flu season.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
