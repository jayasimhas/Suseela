<p>With Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir; Gilead Sciences) and Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir; AbbVie) demonstrating cure rates approaching 100% in several patient subgroups, there is now a very high bar to market entry in the hepatitis C space. Pharmaceutical companies are left trying to provide incremental improvements in treatment duration and broader genotypic potency in order to differentiate newer products.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare has conducted an analysis of the commercial potential of the early-stage hepatitis C pipeline for assets that might still have a part to play in the treatment of hepatitis C.</p><p><b>Ultimate goal</b></p><p>The goal is clear, and achievable: a pan-genotypic, six- or eight-week regimen.</p><p>Pan-genotypic compounds obviously possess the greatest commercial potential because they increase the size of the target patient population while also providing physicians with the opportunity to standardize treatment for the majority of their patients. Shorter treatment duration will also be an important differentiator, reducing the time physicians are required to monitor patients and potentially improving adherence to treatment.</p><p>Gilead's Harvoni is currently battling it out with AbbVie's Viekira Pak, both particularly effective in patients with the genotype (GT)-1 virus, for the hearts and minds of payers. </p><p>Gilead is developing a successor to ledipasvir, GS-5816, which in combination with sofosbuvir may allow Gilead to expand into the remaining genotypes. Approval is slated for 2017. However, the sofosbuvir/GS-5816 combination is unlikely to shorten treatment duration beyond eight weeks.</p><p>Gilead is therefore likely to add additional compounds such as GS-9669 (non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor) or GS-9451 (protease inhibitor) to shorten treatment duration to six or eight weeks.</p><p>Data from the SYNERGY trial have shown that the addition of either compound to a Harvoni backbone is capable of producing maximum cure rates in GT-1 patients after just six weeks of treatment.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Michael Haydock tells <i>Scrip</i> that he expects both combinations would be clinically and commercially attractive if launched in Q3 2017, and could be superseded by a further combination with the pan-genotypic protease inhibitor GS-9857 in Q1 2020.</p><p><b>Pricing competition critical</b></p><p>As Gilead has learnt in recent weeks, pricing competition is essential to compensate for the later launch of 'me-too' products. Gilead may have assumed it had hepatitis C 'all sewn up' but the launch of Viekira Pak has made it clear that this is simply not the case. </p><p>Merck & Co and Achillion also possess candidates with multiple modes of action and potential pan-genotypic efficacy, and these companies are also forecast to market successful six- to eight-week regimens. These companies will have learnt important lessons on how to make a commercial success of a later-to-market treatment from the Harvoni versus Viekira Pak battle.</p><p><b>'Nucs' rule</b></p><p>Not surprisingly, Mr Haydock believes that the nucleotide NS5B inhibitor (nuc) class possesses the greatest commercial potential, and that candidates with this mode of action will form the backbone of future oral regimens. </p><p>The rapid adoption of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) as the gold standard of hepatitis C therapy has prompted huge interest in this mode of action. For example, in June 2014, Merck & Co agreed to acquire Idenix for $3.85bn in order to gain the latter company's developmental nucleotide NS5B inhibitors MK-3682 (formerly IDX21437) and IDX21459.</p><p>Mr Haydock expects that MK-3682 (Merck & Co) and ACH-3422 (Achillion) will pose serious competition to Sovaldi following their forecasted launches in Q3 2019 and Q4 2019, respectively. Both compounds will likely be marketed as part of six- to eight-week combinations with in-house protease inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors, and are expected to possess similar clinical profiles to Gilead's own triple combinations. "Combined with strategic discounts, we expect both combinations to challenge Gilead's dominance of the market and achieve blockbuster sales," he said.</p><p><b>NS5A inhibitors</b></p><p>Second-generation NS5A inhibitors with broader genotypic coverage and higher barriers to resistance will succeed first-generation products, predicts Datamonitor. </p><p>While the leading first-generation products such as Daklinza (daclatasvir; Bristol-Myers Squibb) and ledipasvir (GS-5885; Gilead) possess broad antiviral potency, they have low barriers to resistance against non-GT-1b viruses and also suffer from cross-resistance, notes Datamonitor. </p><p>Second-generation NS5A inhibitors represent the most common class in the early-stage pipeline, as companies attempt to demonstrate incremental improvements in genotypic coverage and potency against NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs).</p><p><b>Protease inhibitors</b></p><p>The currently marketed protease inhibitors possess relatively poor genotypic coverage, and are therefore restricted for use in GT-1 and GT-4 patients. However, early-phase protease inhibitors with broader genotypic activity will significantly increase the commercial potential of the class.</p><p>Datamonitor analysis suggests that GS-9857 possesses the greatest commercial potential of the early-phase protease inhibitors, because it could be incorporated into a fixed-dose combination with Gilead's successor sofosbuvir/GS-5816 backbone in a six- or eight-week regimen.</p><p>What is clear is that the dominance of the nucs will see non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors positioned as optional add-ons to boost efficacy in difficult-to-treat patients. They are currently the least attractive of the direct-acting antiviral classes due to their inconvenient twice-daily dosing schedules and the limited genotypic coverage of current late-stage candidates.</p><p><p><b>Table 1. <i>Selected drugs in early-stage development for hepatitis C (Source: Datamonitor Healthcare)</i></b></p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Molecule</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Phase</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Mechanism of action</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Forecast US launch </b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Forecast target patients</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Forecast market advantage</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ABT-493</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NS3/4A protease inhibitor</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AbbVie</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2018</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GT-1/2/3 chronic hepatitis C (US/5EU); GT-1/2 chronic hepatitis C (Japan)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Does not require ritonavir boosting and has improved potency against GT-3a viruses and against several GT-1 RAVs</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>ABT-530</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Phase II</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>NS5A inhibitor</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>AbbVie</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>2018</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GT-1/2/3 chronic hepatitis C (US/5EU); GT-1/2 chronic hepatitis C (Japan)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Excellent potency against several viral genotypes and GT-1 RAVs.
