<p> Many people argue that the surge in initial public offerings by biotechnology companies suggests a bubble in danger of imminent explosion, but is the industry's IPO market really surging? It depends on how you interpret the numbers related to first-time stock offerings so far in 2014 versus 2015. </p> <p> On the one hand, only 29 drug developers launched IPOs in the US during the first half of this year, including 10 in June, compared with a whopping <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-IPOs-surge-in-first-half-of-2014-41-companies-raise-2.6bn-352992" target="_new">41 biotech offerings</a> between January and June of last year (excluding medical device and diagnostics companies). On the other hand, the number of IPOs has fallen, but the total value of those offerings was slightly higher. Therapeutics companies raised $2.6bn during the first half of 2014 and $2.8bn was raised by 12 fewer firms through 30 June of this year. </p> <p> When you slice and dice the data, you could make several arguments for and against the question of whether the biotech industry is in a bubble that's about to burst. One also might argue that investors are showing some discipline that may keep bad investments from spoiling promising opportunities. </p> <p> The biggest biotech IPO ever occurred in June &ndash; an offering that grossed $315m before overallotments for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-bubbles-as-money-pours-in-358929" target="_new">Axovant Sciences</a> &ndash; and the month's 10 drug developer offerings was the most of any month this year. However, June also had some of the smallest therapeutics IPOs of 2015 and of the IPO boom that began in late 2012: <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Seres-soars-while-3-other-IPOs-fall-flat-359151" target="_new">BioPharmX</a> grossed $10m and Pieris Pharmaceuticals grossed $25m in offerings that priced at just $2.75 per share. </p> <p> It remains to be seen if July will top June or if the second half of 2015 will have more biotech offerings than the first half. There were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-72-US-IPOs-gross-5.7bn-in-2014-values-rising-in-2015-357399" target="_new">72 drug developer IPOs</a> in 2014, so there would have to be 44 IPOs during the rest of 2015 to beat last year's total. However, only 11 of the 40 companies that filed registration documents this year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to support a potential IPO remain in the queue. Five companies opted to postpone or withdraw their offerings. </p> <p> See the graphic below for more comparisons of 2014 and 2015 plus other biotech IPO fast facts.
