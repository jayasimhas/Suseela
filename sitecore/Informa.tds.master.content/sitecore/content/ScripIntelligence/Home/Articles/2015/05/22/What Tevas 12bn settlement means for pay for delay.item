<p>Drug manufacturer giant Teva was practically at the courthouse steps when it settled on 28 May for $1.2bn with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over what the agency said were illegal efforts by the company's subsidiary Cephalon to block US generic competition of its $1bn blockbuster narcolepsy and sleep apnea drug Provigil (modafinil). </p><p>The FTC's lawsuit against Teva, filed in 2008, was set to go to trial 1 June.</p><p>The agency had asserted Cephalon, which Teva acquired in 2011, had "unlawfully protected" its Provigil monopoly through a series of reverse-payment patent settlements &ndash; often called pay-for-delay deals &ndash; with four generic drug makers in late 2005 and early 2006, paying them a total of about $300m to keep their generic modafinil off the US market for a certain amount of time.</p><p>Teva was actually one of the firms that had entered into one of those deals with Cephalon. The other three generic makers were Barr Laboratories, which Teva also acquired, Ranbaxy and Mylan.</p><p>Teva already <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Teva-to-pay-512m-to-settle-Provigil-class-action-357995" target="_new">agreed to pay $512m</a> to settle a class-action lawsuit involving direct purchasing firms, which also asserted Cephalon was trying to keep the generics off the market through the pay-for-delay deals.</p><p>The FTC said the $512m and other settlements can be credited against the government's fund according to the terms of the stipulated order for equitable monetary relief. Any remaining funds will be paid to the US Treasury. </p><p>The settlement must be agreed to by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez noted during a 28 May media briefing. </p><p>As part of the settlement, Teva also agreed to no longer enter into reverse-payment patent settlements, she said.</p><p>The FTC said it has filed the proposed consent decree in the district court.</p><p>Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley told <i>Scrip</i> in a statement the company was "pleased to have reached an agreement with the government."</p><p>"In relation to the consent decree, Teva believes it is the right path for our company, for the industry and for the patients we serve," Ms Bradley said.</p><p>The FTC has long held that pay-for-delay deals cost US consumers $3.5bn per year, or $35bn over a decade, because Americans end up paying for the more expensive brand-name drugs when the cheaper copycat versions are not available.</p><p>"The FTC is committed to putting a stop to these kinds of deals," Ms Ramirez told reporters.</p><p>Pharmaceutical companies, in particular, she asserted, have gotten "very creative" in going around antitrust laws.</p><p><b>FTC challenges</b></p><p>The FTC has sought legal action against several drug makers that have entered into the pay-for-delay deals, accusing them of being anticompetitive, although the regulatory agency mostly has ended up on the losing side of the challenges &ndash; getting the thumbs down by US appeals courts at the Eleventh, Second and Federal Circuits, which all ruled the agreements are permissible so long as they do not exceed the potential exclusionary scope of the patent.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, however, sided with the FTC in one case &ndash; declaring that the "scope of the patent test" improperly restricts the application of antitrust laws and is contrary to the policies underlying the <i>Hatch-Waxman Act</i> and a long line of Supreme Court precedent on patent litigation and competition.</p><p>But it was the Eleventh Circuit's ruling the Supreme Court decided to hear in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Did-Hatch-Waxman-mistake-create-pay-for-delay-deals-341515" target="_new">March 2013</a>.</p><p>That case involved patent settlement agreements between Solvay Pharmaceuticals, now part of AbbVie, and generic firms Watson Pharmaceuticals, now a subsidiary of Actavis, Paddock Laboratories and its partner Par Pharmaceutical.</p><p>Those deals involved AbbVie's testosterone-replacement drug AndroGel.</p><p>But in that case, the FTC came out the big winner &ndash; with the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SCOTUS-Antitrust-applies-in-pay-for-delay-but-gotta-prove-it-344160" target="_new">Supreme Court ruling 5-3</a> that pay-for-delay agreements can be subject to antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court did not declare pay-for-delay deals presumptively illegal in its June 2013 decision in <i>FTC v Actavis</i>, the court said the agreements have the potential for genuine anticompetitive effects because they permit a brand-name drug company to eliminate the risk of competition, maintain a monopoly and share the benefits of the monopoly with its potential competitor.</p><p><b>The disgorgement remedy</b></p><p>While the amount of the settlement between the FTC and Teva is notable, Washington lawyer Jeffrey Brennan, an antitrust partner at McDermott Will & Emery, said what stands out as significant is the fact all five of the agency's commissioners backed the agreement &ndash; demonstrating there remains a bipartisan desire to continue to pursue pay-for-delay challenges.</p><p>Also important is the use of disgorgement in the Teva settlement, Mr Brennan told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"Requiring Cephalon to surrender ill-gotten profits is especially warranted here because the challenged patent settlements arose out of litigation derived from a patent procured by fraud," the commission said in a statement.</p><p>The fact all five commissioners signed on to the proposed stipulated order shows they approved of the use of disgorgement as a proper remedy concerning Teva &ndash; which hasn't always been the case in other challenges, said Mr Brennan, who also is a formerly chief of the FTC's Health Care Services and Products Division.</p><p>FTC commissioners Maureen Ohlhausen and Joshua Wright &ndash; two Republicans on the panel &ndash; even felt compelled to issue a separate statement to explain why they thought disgorgement was appropriate in the Teva case, although they said their comments served another purpose, too, which was to declare the commission has provided no real guidance of using that remedy in competition cases.</p><p><b>Reading the tea leaves</b></p><p>As with most settlements, it's hard to read into the tea leaves exactly why Teva decided to make a deal with the FTC, Mr Brennan said.</p><p>He anticipated most drug makers considering pay-for-delay deals would likely look more to the June 2013 ruling by the Supreme Court &ndash; for which plaintiffs must still prove at a trial under the rule of reason by a preponderance of the evidence that the outcome was anticompetitive &ndash; and other outcomes in litigation when weighing what to do.</p><p>Nonetheless, he said, the Teva settlement shows the FTC remains serious about the pay-for-delay issue.</p><p>"The FTC has made no bones about the fact that it feels quite strongly pay for delays are anticompetitive and it hasn't shown any signs of backing off, and this settlement today reinforces that," Mr Brennan said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
