<p>A large-scale trial being run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing an experimental monovalent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) Ebola vaccine from NewLink and its partner Merck is underway in earnest in Sierra Leone, with more than 200 people already enrolled, 90 of whom have been vaccinated, a top official from the US health agency told reporters on 14 April.</p><p>But the STRIVE trial, which is being funded largely by US taxpayers under a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Funding-deal-gives-Ebola-5.4bn-FDA-NIH-slight-boosts-355535" target="_new">$25m emergency appropriation from Congress</a>, is meant to do more than test a vaccine, said Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC.</p><p>"Through STRIVE, the CDC is strengthening the existing research capacity of institutions in Sierra Leone, and providing training and research experience to hundreds of Sierra Leone staff, which we hope will be helpful to the country in the future," Dr Schuchat told reporters during a media briefing.</p><p>She said about 350 local people in Sierra Leone have been hired and trained to conduct the STRIVE study.</p><p>Physical infrastructures in the country have been updated and existing structures have been renovating, Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>"We hope our study partnership will accelerate the availability of effective vaccines and leave this region stronger and more resilient against future infectious disease threats," she declared. </p><p>STRIVE was designed to enroll 6,000 frontline healthcare workers and others at high risk of Ebola exposure, like those cleaning facilities where care is provided to infected patients, laboratory technicians, administrative staff, surveillance and ambulance teams or people responsible for swabbing deceased persons who died of the virus, Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>Study participants are being paid in the trial under approval from US and Sierra Leone ethics boards and the FDA, but those payments are minimal - $10 for enrolling and $30 after getting vaccinated, Dr Schuchat said, noting those are Sierra Leone dollars and not US.</p><p>"That will pay for their transportation and the time involved in the study," she said. </p><p><b>Change in plan</b></p><p>The STRIVE trial, which had been expected to launch <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-hopeful-for-January-start-of-Ebola-vaccine-trial-355804" target="_new">much earlier</a> in the year, was initially intended to be a stepped-wedge study, in which participants would have been randomized in a sequential roll out of the vaccine over a number of periods and by the end of the trial, all would have randomly received the shot.</p><p>But because of the rapid decline in the number of people with Ebola in Sierra Leone, the CDC "adjusted" the design to "maximize its chances of success," Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>Now, STRIVE is using an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">individually randomized study design</a>, in which participants are randomized to receive the rVSV vaccine immediately or in six month from now.</p><p>All participants will receive the vaccine and all will be followed for six months afterwards, Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>The CDC also will collect information on safety and immune response, so that even if the study is unable to reach its goal of an efficacy estimate, the information can contribute to licensure through using the animal rule, in which the US permits a product's effectiveness to be demonstrated in animals when it is unethical or not feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans.</p><p>"A disease like Ebola was never expected to have a large scale Phase III study done of vaccine efficacy," Dr Schuchat said.</p><p>Because of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/WHO-Ebola-remains-emergency-vaccine-trials-a-challenge-357842" target="_new">drop off of Ebola cases</a>, the National Institutes of Health already has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">run into trouble</a> with enrollment in Liberia of its Phase III trial of rVSV and another vaccine developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and GlaxoSmithKline, known as cAd3-EBOZ, and is trying to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Liberia-studys-27000-enrollment-no-longer-makes-sense-357890" target="_new">expand that study into Guinea</a>.</p><p>Dr Shuchat said the CDC never considered the idea of not carrying out the STRIVE trial when case counts decreased.</p><p>"We are going forward with the study, but we've adjusted it," she told reporters.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
