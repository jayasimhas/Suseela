<p>There were no surprises in Celgene's fourth quarter and year-end 2014 earnings report, since the company gave investors guidance through 2020 earlier in January, but Celgene is on track to diversify beyond its market-leading multiple myeloma drug Revlimid (lenalidomide) through ongoing research and development as well as continued dealmaking.</p><p>Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene's full-year revenue jumped 18% from 2013 to $7.7bn, including $7.6bn in product sales, and the company's 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) soared 24% to $3.71, which was in line with analyst consensus of $7.6bn and $3.71, respectively (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4Q-preview-Amgen-Biogen-BMS-Celgene-Novartis-Pfizer-and-Roche-356329" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>). Celgene preempted its earnings report by reporting $7.6bn in net product sales for 2014 on 12 January and the company forecast $9bn to $9.5bn in 2015 sales. </p><p>Revlimid is Celgene's biggest seller by far and it is expected to retain that title for years to come as the company gains approvals for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and other indications, and as the drug gains traction in combination treatment regimens for multiple myeloma (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/New-therapies-combinations-improving-myeloma-survival-more-on-the-way-355892" target="_new">31 December 2014</a>). Revlimid sales rose 16% from 2013 to almost $5bn in 2014 and the drug is expected to contribute as much $5.7bn to Celgene's 2015 sales.</p><p>In its full-year 2014 earnings report, Celgene stuck with previously announced net product sales target of $13bn to $14bn for 2017, including $7bn from Revlimid. The company expects $17bn of its $20bn in projected 2020 sales to come from its hematology and oncology franchises. The other $3bn will come from immunology and inflammation products.</p><p>Celgene's 2017 forecast includes $1.5bn in sales from Pomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) for multiple myeloma, $1.5bn to $2bn from the solid tumor drug Abraxane (paclitaxel albumin-bound) and $1.5bn to $2bn from the arthritis and psoriasis drug Otezla (apremilast). However, all three products have a long way to go to catch up to the company's 2017 guidance.</p><p>In 2014, Abraxane sales grew 31% year-over-year to $848m, Pomalyst/Imnovid generated $680m in its first full year on the market in the US and EU, and Otezla produced $70m in sales. </p><p>Celgene has been adding approved indications to Abraxane's label and the company expects to have a European Commission approval decision for the drug in combination with carboplatin as a first-line treatment for lung cancer by the end of the first quarter of 2015. Recent data in neoadjuvant breast cancer also are being reviewed for potential regulatory submissions. </p><p>Otezla was approved in the US for psoriatic arthritis in March and for psoriasis in September, and the oral therapy won approval in the EU for both indications in January after a positive (CHMP) decision from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in November (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgenes-Otezla-gains-US-OK-in-psoriatic-arthritis-350820" target="_new">21 March</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Celgenes-Otezla-OKd-in-plaque-psoriasis-354098" target="_new">24 September</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/EU-blesses-Celgenes-oral-psoriasis-drug-355210" target="_new">22 November 2014</a>).</p><p>Future growth at Celgene depends on sales gains for marketed drugs in approved and future indications, but the company also is investing a lot of time and cash in the hunt for new product candidates in earlier stages of development (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Celgenes-head-dealmaker-strikes-a-fair-balance-356314" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>). </p><p>Celgene is one of a handful of large biotech firms with rapidly growing financial "firepower" to buy or license external assets given the company's double-digit sales growth (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/REPORT-Pharma-steps-up-MandA-but-specialty-companies-dominate-356066" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>). With $7.5bn in cash and securities as of 31 December versus $5.7bn at the end of 2013, Celgene has plenty of capital on hand to compete with big pharma companies that also are trying to build up their R&D pipelines.</p><p>"We believe that Celgene has differentiated itself through long-term investments in global operating infrastructure, organic product extension strategies, strategic acquisitions and a broad collaborative framework. The fruit of these investments is visible in the company's robust growth profile, which is driven both organically and via strategic transactions," William Blair analyst John Sonnier wrote in a 29 January report.</p><p>Celgene closed up 1.6% at $120.87 per share on 29 January following its 2014 earnings report. The company's market cap is $96.5bn.</p><p><p><p><p>
