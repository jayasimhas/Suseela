<p> Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. was centre-stage last week, initially getting the second week of third-quarter earnings under way by reporting what the analysts from Jefferies suggested at the time was a 'solid' set of results. Those from JP Morgan described Valeant's beating of consensus estimates of sales and earnings as 'modest'. Unfortunately, that was not where the story ended. </p><p> After that early part of the week, it seemed that whatever the numbers and whatever the company, earnings season became overshadowed by the captive specialty pharmacy revelations that started to emanate from Valeant's earnings call. </p><p> In attempting to address its last operational <i>faux pas</i> on price gouging in its <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">third-quarter results</a>, Valeant announced the divestment of the Neuroscience and Other division, which it may have hoped would have put its recent controversies behind it. The proposed spin-off, however, brought with it the clouds of reduced sales growth in the remaining business, the absence of its traditional price rises, a volume-based growth model that has been so ridiculed at GlaxoSmithKline Plc, and a high level of debt which may be unaffected by the spin-off. The Jefferies analysts' summary of Valeant's results - 'Growth outlook remains solid' - and the JP Morgan analysts' post-spin assessment - 'compelling valuation' - were more quickly than usual out of date. While the analysts from Jefferies mentioned the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fraud-Accusations-Vex-Valeant-Slam-Specialty-Shares-361167" target="_new">commentary on Valeant's specialty distribution partner</a> during its conference call, nothing except a short position could have prepared Valeant's shareholders for the media storm and share price falls that came next. </p> <p> <p> As the week wore on, more and more branded and specialty pharmaceuticals companies, like Allergan Plc, were forced to interrupt the careful preparations for their third-quarter earnings announcements with statements distancing themselves from Valeant's alleged use of captive specialty pharmacies to inflate sales. Valeant scheduled a second press conference a week after their first to address these issues, but it is difficult to see how much clarity can emerge. Channel stuffing through non-specialty pharmacies is difficult to detect, as the Valeant-acquired <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Salix-sinks-as-audit-admission-hurts-MandA-potential-354915" target="_new">Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. debacle</a> of last year demonstrated, and there are virtually no independent data on sales and prescriptions via specialty pharmacies. Fortunately, some good news did manage to shine through the dark clouds of the specialty pharmacy storm with <a href="http://1c120fbf-0097-11dd-8b43-dd483f25146c" target="_new">Roche Holding AG </a>doing what <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-When-JnJ-Speaks-Others-Copy-361113" target="_new">Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) couldn't do the previous week</a> by reporting an increase in sales that beat consensus estimates by 1%. By retaining its freedom from from reporting quarterly earnings, Roche only has quarterly sales to worry about, but it made the best of a 'robust' quarter, according to the analysts from Citigroup, raising sales guidance for the full year. </p> <p> <p> The J&amp;J approach to the third quarter was reprised by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lilly-CEO-Lechleiter-On-Drug-Pricing-The-Facts-Tell-Us-A-Different-Story-361188" target="_new">Eli Lilly &amp; Co. It beat consensus estimates</a> of third-quarter earnings by 17%, but this was driven by cutting operational expense and colored by a 1% fall in sales. Similarly, in a busy, multifaceted third-quarter earnings announcement, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Belt-Tightening-Biogen-Looks-To-Narrow-Therapeutic-Focus-361166" target="_new">Biogen, Inc. announced a beating</a> of analysts' consensus estimates of sales and earnings that had been rebased down significantly after drastic misses in the previous two quarters. Biogen's announcement, like that of J&amp;J's the previous week, included share buy-back plans that were initially well received by investors. An 11% cut in its workforce also undoubtedly helped the Biogen share price, as did growth in the <i>Tecfidera</i> (dimethyl fumarate) franchise, although the latter was achieved at the cost of greater promotional spend and a one-time positive inventory effect in a week where channel-stuffing should have been top-of-mind. I would have expected a significant workforce reduction to be associated with weakness in the stock price, especially as it was combined with the announcement of the failure in all the endpoints of the <i>Tysabri</i> (natalizumab) Phase III study in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. On the day of Biogen's announcement, however, it was one of the few stocks that finished the day in positive territory. I still find myself at the other end of the continuum of the analyst community on Biogen from JP Morgan's analysts, who described Biogen's results as 'A step in the right direction'; I'm somewhat closer to those at Piper Jaffray, whose research piece was entitled 'More steps forward than back, but challenges remain'. </p> <p> <p> A quotation that has been mistakenly attributed to Lenin, 'The purpose of terrorism is to cause terror', resonated with the revelations concerning Valeant last week. Firstly its pricing policies and then its alleged captive distribution efforts reverberated through the sector, terrorizing competitors and investors alike. The bright spots in last week's earnings news seem to have been overwhelmed by the ensuing political and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">legal events</a> which, added to the FDA's recent spate of rejections, look likely to overshadow any further rays of sunshine that attempt to emerge from the clouds of this third-quarter earnings season. </p> <p> <p> The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Roche and Allergan. </p> <p><p> <p> <i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
