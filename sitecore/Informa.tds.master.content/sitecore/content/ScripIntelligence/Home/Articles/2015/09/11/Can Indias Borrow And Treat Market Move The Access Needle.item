<p>Are innovative financing schemes to improve access to breakthrough, expensive drugs the way forward in self-pay markets like India? And can microfinance firms move the needle in such markets marked by low health insurance penetration? </p><p>While the jury may still be out on some of these issues, experimentation efforts with financing schemes both in the drugs and devices segment seem on the uptrend in India.</p><p>The chief of a foreign multinational explained to <i>Scrip</i> how there is a difference between the "ability" and "willingness" to pay for novel therapies and that more and more firms have begun to recognize the nuances. </p><p>"Equal monthly instalment (EMI) schemes probably define the ability to pay much better and willingness to pay is about whether you are really convinced about the therapy. If you combine both well you get much better results. People have begun to understand this and you'd probably see more and more of this happening," the official told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Typically, under such financing schemes, patients can stagger payment of the actual therapy cost over a specified period via EMIs.</p><p>MSD (as Merck & Co is known outside the US and Canada) was perhaps among the first drug firms to ensure that its hepatitis C therapy, interferon alfa 2b, can be accessed in India at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/MSD-Indias-out-of-the-box-Hep-C-financing-how-why-and-what-next-352206" target="_new">"cash flow" levels</a> that a patient, with probably average means, may possibly be comfortable with, though the arrival of sofosbuvir is believed to have seen a scale back of the initiative. </p><p>More recently Dr Reddy's Laboratories indicated that it was doing a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dr-Reddys-Tests-Financing-Model-For-Sofosbuvir-In-India-359789" target="_new">pilot financing initiative</a> for sofosbuvir. Others like Boehringer Ingelheim India too have indicated that it is evaluating financing models for its oncology as well as other critical care products, while Medtronic offers financial assistance for its cardiac stents. </p><p>Some microfinance firms appear to have made important contributions in the space, though pharma industry experts say it's still early days.</p><p>Jose Peter, co-founder and CEO of Arogya Finance, a unique social healthcare venture, which offers medical loans to the "traditionally un-bankable" in India, said that currently most of the expensive treatments reach only 10-20% of patients who could benefit from the therapy, mainly due to challenges in awareness, availability and affordability. </p><p>"While all these issues need to be addressed, affordability is the single most important aspect in the decision -making process of the patient and the doctor/care giver," Peter, a former CFO of the retail finance firm, Tata Motor Finance, told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Arogya Finance uses innovative risk assessment tools that allow it to finance people outside the formal banking system and its business model is structured in a way, that it directly pays the medical bills of an individual to the hospital or the healthcare service provider.</p><p>So far Arogya Finance has lent $1.5m to 782 patients across four regions and 10 Indian states. </p><p>Arogya also noted how millions of Indians are unable to pay out of pocket for medical emergencies and often money is borrowed at high interest rates or is organized by selling personal assets or simply ignoring much needed medical attention. This, it estimates, leads to 40m people falling into poverty every year. </p><p>Arogya says it has taken a step to "bridge this gap" by offering loans at reasonable terms to those who lack formal income proof, in the process creating a lifeline for people falling into poverty due to unexpected health shocks.</p><p>"More and more such offerings should be made. The problem is, not many financial institutions are comfortable with the patient profile, to be able to provide such facilities," Peter added.</p><h2>Way Forward</h2><p>Some experts, however, say a hybrid approach, including the "Gilead model", is the way forward to improve access to breakthrough, pricey therapies, though it is the cost of drugs that is often under the spotlight in out-of-pocket markets like India. </p><p>Health insurance penetration in India is estimated at about 25% of the population, with around 19% covered by government-sponsored health insurance schemes and the rest under private insurance, according to a recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch research report.</p><p>The chief of the foreign multinational firm, though, underscored that while people focus on the cost of the medicines, few look at the pharmacoeconomics behind it. </p><p>He referred to the hypothetical example of 100 people "saved" from hepatitis C "degeneration" in next six months in India. "Imagine what could have happened if they had degenerated into hepatitis C&#8230; what would have happened to their medical costs, the burden on the family, the economic stability of the family? These are costs are never talked about. It is actually saving a lot of money."</p><p>Others noted how naysayers accuse pharma of profiteering and appeal to it for compassion and understanding while doing "precious little" to control spiralling costs across the spectrum of health care. </p><p>"Medicine prices are a small subset of and directly proportional to the overall health care costs. Multinationals in India are caught between a rock and a hard place because this rationale makes no sense in this out-of-pocket market. That is why financing schemes were deemed as a clever way to encourage caregivers to buy these medicines whose prices cannot be reduced due to a variety of reasons such as reference pricing and parallel trade," an industry pundit with a frontline foreign firm told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He also referred to how Gilead is probably the first company that broke this paradigm with Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and hoped that many others follow the lead and that financing schemes "do not end up becoming the way forward" in India. </p><p>Last year Gilead entered into <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cut-price-generics-in-sight-as-Gilead-licenses-Sovaldi-353966" target="_new">licensing deals</a> with several India-based firms including Cipla, Zydus Cadila, Hetero, Strides, Ranbaxy and Mylan Labs to develop sofosbuvir and the single tablet regimen of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for distribution in 91 developing countries. </p><p>Experts like Dilip Shah, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, which represents leading domestic firms, though, believe that a combination of both government financing and the "Gilead model" is the way forward in India.</p><p>"For the rich, one can add co-payment as the third element for access to expensive medicines," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He does not favour debt-financing for breakthrough pharmaceutical products and believes that it would leave patients to the "mercy" of the patent holder. </p><p>"How can a government abdicate its responsibility to a private commercial entity?"</p><p>Micro finance companies can help, Shah added, but stressed that it did not resolve the issue of access and affordability, given their limited reach.</p><p>The industry pundit with the foreign firm noted that debt-financing schemes for breakthrough drugs are not a win-win for stakeholders and merely address the "symptoms" and does nothing about the "malaise."</p><p>He, though, had some radical suggestions to truly improve access by reducing the cost of medicines. "There are two ways to do this. One &ndash; pressurize governments around the world to de-regulate and liberalize the health sector and two &ndash; abolish or reduce patent life and think of new ways to incentivize pharma R&D," he said </p><p>Until then, we can only hope to come up with cleverer financing options for prices that are, in the long run, "unsustainable," he maintained. </p><p>Others like Utkarsh Palnitkar, partner and head of life sciences practice at KPMG India, said the "pricing burden" of breakthrough products would require to be dealt with innovative approaches.</p><p>"In the current scenario, debt financing from the financial institutions can be a beneficial route for health care providers. The initiative can be enabled only through effective co-ordination of government, funding institutions and pharmaceutical companies,"Palnitkar told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>He added that while it&rsquo;s an "appealing" concept and might be beneficial for the pharmaceutical companies as their financial infrastructure will be stabilized and the patients can have continued access to the expensive treatment, the profits for payers is "questionable" to some extent.</p>
