<p>David Horn Solomon spent six years heading up Zealand Pharma, developer of the GLP-1 agonist Lyxumia (lixisenatide), which has travelled a bumpy road in the hands of licensing partner Sanofi. He is now CEO of Bionor Pharma, a company that is hoping to make headway with its HIV vaccine. Rather a challenge, but Dr Solomon believes the company is a clear two years ahead of the competition and with his guidance stands a real chance of being the first to tackle the 'What's next?' question in the treatment of HIV.</p><h2>background</h2><p>Bionor has been around in its current form since 2010, when former nutraceuticals-focused Norwegian company Nutri Pharma sold its main asset to Orkla for a decent sum of money and decided to get into the therapeutic vaccines space with the acquisition of Bionor Immuno. </p><p>"So for the last 4-5 years, Bionor has been busy but a bit disorientated," explains Dr Solomon. "It was very science and academia-focused, without a real commercial strategy or path to market."</p><p>Dr Solomon took the helm in January and "there are some very exciting features to this company," he says. "We have a therapeutic vaccine against HIV called Vacc-4x. It consists of four overlapping peptides that target a sequence of p24 that is conserved in all strains of HIV." </p><p>In previous clinical trials, Vacc-4x has demonstrated a significant reduction of HIV viral load and a long-term immune response in infected patients. Vacc-4x has been designed to elicit a cell-based immune response by generating T-cells which can recognize and destroy infected HIV cells.</p><h2>hide and seek</h2><p>"Then comes the important part, which was figured out about two years ago. The real issue in terms of biology is that the HIV virus, once people are well treated with antiretroviral medicines, hides in reservoirs. These reservoirs are found in dendritic cells in the skin, in the brain, in the testes in men, in the gut, and the observation was made that if you have patients that for whatever reason stop their antiretroviral therapy, all of a sudden you get raging viremia &ndash; 400,000 particles per ml suddenly appear in the bloodstream. Where did it come from? The reservoirs. So that was a useful observation, but the question was, what do you do with it?"</p><p>And this is how Bionor believes it is ahead of the competition. Last year at the Global HIV meeting in Melbourne, Bionor presented data showing that Celgene's romidepsin (Istodax; approved to treat lymphoma) &ndash; if given as a one-time infusion &ndash; "blasts out up to 400,000 particles per ml from the reservoirs," says Dr Solomon.</p><p>"So that was a really important observation: HDAC inhibitors &ndash; normally cancer medicines used in PTCL and other rare forms of leukemia and lymphoma &ndash;are safe and tolerable in HIV patients and they actually shock the virus out from the reservoirs."</p><p>Bionor used this observation in its Phase Ib/IIa study called REDUC. The open label study in 20 patients has the goal of both applying the latency reversing approach (using romidepsin) and its HIV vaccine Vacc-4x together. "We're asking the question, in an open label study, can we release the virus from the reservoirs into the bloodstream and then can we clear the bloodstream of viral particles using the therapeutic vaccine?"</p><h2>interim excitement</h2><p>On 4 May Bionor reported data from an interim analysis of 9 of the 20 patients. "At the start of the trial in November, we showed that romidepsin alone in these nine patients resulted in a huge viral load in the bloodstream. On 4 May, we reported that 7 of these 9 patients had no detectable virus present in the bloodstream. So we have established, in an interim analysis of an open label study, that a combination of Vacc-4x training the immune system on the one hand, and romidepsin blasting out the virus on the other, results in the vaccine clearing the virus."</p><p>On 5 May, Bionor put out another release announcing the assembly of 11 of the world's most renowned HIV and clinical trial experts in Copenhagen to discuss the design of the next study, "we call it son of REDUC, and it is a proper blinded, randomized study that will look at about 160 patients where we can study properly if the combination of Vacc-4x and romidepsin provides the same results we saw in the interim analysis, a functional cure for HIV."</p><p>Dr Solomon believes the Bionor is "fundamentally interesting because this is the first time that anyone has shown that a therapeutic vaccine in HIV actually works and we believe that we are ahead of the competition by about two years. Companies such as like Gilead are in this space and they have latency reversing agents, theirs are TLR7 agonists. Others like GSK are working on other latency reversing agents, such as the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat. But all they have are the latency reversing agents, they can demonstrate convincingly that they can blast out the virus from the reservoirs, nobody has linked a vaccine to that."</p><h2>momentum</h2><p>This is why Dr Solomon believes Bionor has the lead and why it has to "tee-up this next study convincingly in a short period of time." It hopes to begin son-of-REDUC by the end of this year or early next year. "We have to get the study started in that timescale to keep the lead, to keep the momentum going. Meanwhile, lots of companies, large and small, are keen to talk to us about partnering. But of course what we don't want to do now is give up proprietary rights because its early days and we think we still have a lot more legs on our own that can keep this momentum going." </p><p>Dr Solomon and his team are busy talking to bankers and investors about raising money "because the idea is to fund this next trial properly so we can do a robust study." He acknowledges that a pivotal Phase III trial, which may require 1000+ patients, might be rather ambitious alone and Bionor will have to consider partnering "but at this point we want to take it as far as possible on our own."</p><p>The Phase IIb son-of-REDUC study will be expensive but the plan is to raise enough cash to fund the trial and some extra on top. "We think that's achievable given the interest already."</p><h2>precision medicine</h2><p>There is also a precision medicine angle that Bionor may be able to exploit. "It turns out that in addition to having Vacc-4x plus romidepsin, we also have a retrospective observation that if you use an antibody against a variable domain of HIV called C5, people who have high antibody titers against C5 respond to Vacc-4x better than patients who have a low antibody titer. This is retrospective so this is after you throw Vacc-4x at patients and you get the varying response in terms of viral load and then you sort it by C5. It turns out that high C5 titers are better responders, around 50% better in fact. It's significant enough, but it would need a prospective study and we're not ready for that yet." </p><p>Dr Solomon believes precision medicine could play a role in the future development of the treatment. "All diseases are heterogeneous and if you have some tool to segregate patients that are better responders to a medicine then not only is that good for patients but it's a much better way to conduct trials."</p><p>In the meantime, Dr Solomon believes the progress Bionor is making has come at exactly the right time. "Lots of companies such as ViiV, Gilead and AbbVie have all come up with credible antiretroviral medicines and patients are well treated today. But the question now is, What's next? What are we doing beyond creating a chronic disease? Are we working towards a functional cure? We are in a position to advance the field significantly now that we have a better understanding of the biology of HIV, and a cure is really where the public policy agenda is at."</p><p>
