<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on 1 June launched a key component of President Barack Obama's precision medicine initiative with the start of a Phase II study aimed at matching the most appropriate targeted therapy or combinations of treatments to patients based on the molecular profile of their tumors.</p><p>With 2,400 sites and numerous arms, the NCI-MATCH &ndash; Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice &ndash; study is the largest precision medicine clinical trial in history, US officials said at the annual meeting in Chicago of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p><p>Dr Doug Lowy, acting director at the NCI, said the MATCH trial, which is expected to start enrolling next month, was "unique" and "groundbreaking" because it pairs therapies to patients based on the specific genetic abnormalities in their tumors and not the types of cancers they have.</p><p>"There are no other cancer clinical trials of this size and scope that truly bring the promise of targeted treatment to patients whose cancers have specific genetic abnormalities," Dr Lowy said. "It holds the potential to transform cancer care."</p><p>The MATCH trial is expected to start out with eight drugs &ndash; FDA-approved medicines and experimental compounds &ndash; in 10 arms and eventually will incorporate more than 20 products into the trial.</p><p>Most of the arms in the Match trial will use single-agent drugs, but a few have combinations of medicines for which there are enough safety data and evidence the agents may be active against a particular genetic abnormality, the NCI said.</p><p>The design of the trial will allow for multiple drugs to be evaluated simultaneously, the agency said.</p><p>The initial drugs in the study are Pfizer's Xalkori (crizotinib) and Sutent (sunitinib); GlaxoSmithKline's Mekinist (trametinib) and Tafinlar (dabrafenib); Boehringer Ingelheim's Gilotrif (afatinib); AstraZeneca's AZD9291; Genentech's Kadcyla's (ado- trastuzumab emtansine); and Verastem's VS6063. </p><p>Dr Kathy Hudson, deputy director for science, outreach and policy at the NIH, told <i>Scrip</i> last month that pharmaceutical companies are "integral" to President Obama's precision medicine initiative because the firms will be providing the compounds for the NCI-Match study.</p><p>"They are critical partners," Dr Hudson said.</p><p>President Obama <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">first announced</a> the plans for the NCI-Match trial in January when he revealed the details of his precision medicine initiative, which he first <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">hinted to 10 days earlier</a> during his State of the Union address to Congress.</p><p>Just this past week, one of the most powerful members of Congress over healthcare, Senator Lamar Alexander (Republican-Tennessee), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, pledged to make precision medicine a "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Making-precision-medicine-a-reality-in-cancer-other-diseases-358677" target="_new">reality</a>" and said it would be a key part of the legislation he currently is tailoring with Senator Patty Murray (Democrat-Washington), the ranking member on the panel.</p><p>A House bill, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-hugged-Medicare-plans-squeezed-A-Cures-lovefest-358551" target="_new">adopted last month</a> by that chamber's Energy & Commerce Committee, already includes some precision medicine provisions. </p><p>Lawmakers, however, have yet to commit to the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-outlines-spending-wish-lists-for-FDA-NIH-356508" target="_new">$215m</a> President Obama said his administration will need to carry his initiative forward into fiscal year 2016.</p><p>About $70m of those funds are intended to go to the NCI for the Match trial and other activities aimed at scaling up efforts to identify genomic drivers in cancer and applying that knowledge in the development of more effective cancer treatment approaches.</p><p>The NCI said the Match study supports President Obama's overall initiative because the trial is an example of how the agency will accelerate the design and testing of tailored treatments for cancer by expanding genetically based clinical cancer trials, exploring fundamental aspects of cancer biology and establishing a national cancer knowledge network intended to generate and share new knowledge to fuel scientific discovery and guide treatment decisions.</p><p><b>Study details</b></p><p>The primary endpoint of the NCI-MATCH trial &ndash; the design of which has undergone about two years of planning &ndash; is overall response rate, or the proportion of patients in the study whose tumors shrink by a predefined amount over a specific time period, officials said. </p><p>The secondary endpoint is six-month progression-free survival.</p><p>The study is being led by ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, which is part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). </p><p>The trial will be conducted at 2,400 NCTN sites across the US initially starting with 10 arms, with additional arms added over time as the study progresses, the NCI said.</p><p>Trial investigators plan to screen about 3,000 patients during the full course of the NCI-MATCH trial, with the aim of enrolling about 1,000 in the various treatment arms.</p><p>Each arm of the trial will enroll up to 35 patients. The trial's design calls for at least a quarter of the 1,000-patients enrolled to involve people with rare types of cancer. </p><p>To be eligible for the Match study, participants must be 18 years or older with solid tumors or lymphomas that have advanced following at least one line of standard systemic therapy or with tumors for which there is no standard treatment. </p><p>The study will have two enrollment steps. </p><p>Each patient initially will enroll for screening in which samples of their tumor will be biopsied and then undergo DNA sequencing to detect genetic abnormalities that may be driving growth and could be targeted by one of a wide range of drugs being studied. </p><p>The NCI said the Match study will use a single DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients' tumors. The test, which was developed by the NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory in Frederick, Maryland, looks for 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by drugs in the Match trial, the agency said. </p><p>If a molecular abnormality is detected for which there is a specific substudy available, patients will be further evaluated to determine if they meet the specific eligibility requirements within that arm. </p><p>Once enrolled, patients will be treated with the targeted drug regimen for as long as their tumor shrinks or remains stable. </p><p>A pediatric version of NCI-MATCH also is in development and is expected to launch in 2016. It will be led by the Children's Oncology Group, which also is part of the NCTN. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
