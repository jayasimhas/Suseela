<p>This is the time of year when I supervise MPhil students from the University of Cambridge who are researching and writing their dissertations. At this level, students should be able to demonstrate some quantitative analysis. In an assignment that only lasts a few months, that usually means that they conduct some primary market research. Thankfully, students can learn from my mistakes: I never want them to have that nauseous feeling you get when you read the results of a $30,000 market research study and realize that you did not have the most commercially important question in the questionnaire.</p><p><p>Ironically, after another week of biotech retrenchment, investors should be asking the important question of whether the investment bank research that is presented to them is useful. With valuations falling, most acutely in the engineered T-cell space, sell-side analysts seem to be leaning on market research to justify the share prices of companies that are already heading in the opposite direction from their aspirational target share prices.</p><p><p>In market research, like clinical trials, bigger is better. No one, except <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Dyaxs-missing-no-effect-dose-357680" target="_new">perhaps the investors in Dyax</a>, should take clinical trial results with arms of 4 or even 9 patients as the basis for a considered investment decision. By the same token, no one should take too seriously market research based on a handful of doctors, especially if they are high prescribers. High prescribing physicians typically prescribe a lot of all drugs, not just the one you are researching. So the question to a high-prescribing physician 'how likely are you to prescribe drug X?' is likely to get a high positive response rate and will be closely followed by that physician scrutinizing the pages of his national formulary so that he can prescribe drug X to his next patient (and yes, these high prescribing doctors that sales reps spend their days seeking out and cultivating are mostly male). When the analysts from Piper Jaffray recently hosted a call with n=1 practicing physicians specializing in medical cannabis with a practice of more than 2,500 patients, it was not really surprising that the call "highlighted a bright outlook for GW Pharmaceuticals' Epidiolex (cannabidiol)". This bright outlook is presumably undimmed by the fact that Epidiolex has so far only had results from uncontrolled, investigator-sponsored expanded access studies not conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices, and that GW Pharmaceuticals' first cannabis-derived drug &ndash; Sativex (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol), which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Surprise-Phase-III-failure-of-GWOtsukas-Sativex-in-cancer-pain-356019" target="_new">recently failed a placebo-controlled Phase III study</a> in cancer pain &ndash; had sales last year of only &pound;4.4m.</p><p><p>Another small-sample market research-based research note was again produced by the analysts from Piper Jaffray when they hosted a call with n=1 key opinion leaders (KOLs) to discuss the results of Athersys's recently failed phase II study of its MultiStem stem cell product in stroke. Even after the failed study, Piper Jaffray maintains its 'overweight' recommendation on Athersys (as indeed it does for GW Pharmaceuticals), so it was not surprising to find that the research note reported the KOL "cautiously optimistic on MultiStem stroke results" despite it having failed the primary and secondary endpoints of the study.</p><p><p>Even larger numbers of physicians in a market research study may not, unless randomly selected and stratified by prescribing habits, a useful piece of market research make. But a recent Jefferies survey of n=56 endocrinologists and primary care physicians found that 35% of those surveyed did not know about MannKind's recently launched inhaled insulin product Afrezza. As the analysts from JP Morgan pointed out when they reported MannKind's first-quarter results and Afrezza's sales of $1.1m, there are a number of serious impediments to Afrezza's uptake, including a requirement for lung function testing. If these restrictions and the results of the market research were incorporated into Jefferies' model, its target price would fall to $2 per share. Despite this, Jefferies maintains its buy rating and price target of $9 per share. Fortunately, in the face of such evidence, not everyone is in agreement. The analysts from JP Morgan downgraded MannKind to underweight and withdrew their previous price target of $6 per share. Even more realistically, the analysts from Piper Jaffray lowered their price target to $3.50 per share. </p><p><p>The point of doing market research is to improve the precision of the valuation of a company. The only thing worse than mistakenly not asking the right questions of the right physicians is to use a small or unrepresentative sample of respondents and then to ignore what they tell you anyway. I have never believed sell-side share price targets since I assumed that they started with an aspirational share price number significantly above where the stock is trading, and worked it back to numbers of patients or prescriptions. Seeing analysts ignore key metrics like real sales and damning responses from physicians, I can easily believe that sell-side research is not the truth, but it is still stranger than fiction.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
