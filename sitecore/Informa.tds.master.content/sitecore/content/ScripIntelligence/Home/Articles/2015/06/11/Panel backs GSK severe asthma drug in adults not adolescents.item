<p>GlaxoSmithKline won the full support of an FDA advisory panel on 11 June for the company's severe asthma drug mepolizumab as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with eosinophilic inflammation.</p><p>But the committee said it could not endorse the use of the drug in adolescents 12-17 years because of a lack of safety and efficacy data in that population.</p><p>"I was disappointed because there are a small number of adolescents with very severe disease who have a very high treatment burden, particularly with oral corticosteroids," said Dr Ian Pavord, a professor of respiratory medicine at Oxford University, who conducted some of the early clinical testing of the drug.</p><p>He acknowledged work was needed in the adolescent age group.</p><p>But, Dr Pavord told <i>Scrip</i> after 11 June meeting of the FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC), "we are very delighted with the unanimous approval for adults over the age of 18 with serious eosinophilic asthma."</p><p>Mepolizumab, a first-in-class, anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5), is intended to treat a very specific population of patients with difficult-to-treat asthma &ndash; those with eosinophilic inflammation, which makes up about 3% of 25 million patients with asthma in the US, Dr Pavord said.</p><p>Patients with severe asthma account for 50% of all direct healthcare costs related to asthma, a GSK spokeswoman told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"These are patients who are having recurring asthma attacks, despite high intensity treatment," Dr Pavord said, noting those patients already have run through maximum doses of inhaled steroids and other medicines, which have failed to control their disease.</p><p>Asthma often is characterized by an accumulation of white blood cells, or eosinophils, in lung tissues. In general, eosinophil levels correlate with severity and frequency of exacerbations of asthma.</p><p>IL-5 is the main promoter of eosinophil growth, activation and survival, and provides an essential signal for the movement of eosinophils from the bone marrow into the lung. </p><p>Mepolizumab inhibits IL-5.</p><p>"It's a very selective inhibitor of eosinophilic inflammation," Dr Pavord explained.</p><p>The drug, he said, works like a "laser-guided missile."</p><p>To ensure mepolizumab is given to the right patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, Dr Pavord noted that an easy "CBC" blood test can be done. </p><p>He said the FDA was "very supportive" of using eosinophilic as a biomarker in developing mepolizumab for severe asthma.</p><p>The drug, Dr Pavord said, "is the first real individualized treatment that we've had for asthma," which he said is "no longer a one-size-fits-all" disease.</p><p>"It's about identifying the right group of patients," Dr Pavord declared.</p><p>Mepolizumab is an injectable medicine designed to be administered subcutaneously once every four weeks. The drug is intended to be used on top of inhaled steroids.</p><p>While no studies have been completed showing whether mepolizumab reduces the use inhaled steroids, Dr Pavord said data have demonstrated patients have been able to reduce their intake of oral steroids &ndash; which he noted generally come with several side effects.</p><p>"So it's oral steroid-sparing," he said.</p><p>At the 11 June FDA advisory committee meeting, the PADAC voted 14-0 that GSK's efficacy data provided substantial evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit of mepolizumab 100mg once every four weeks to treat severe eosinophilic asthma. </p><p>But the committee voted 9-5 that the data failed to demonstrate the same in the adolescent population.</p><p>The PADAC voted 13-1 mepolizumab's safety had been adequately demonstrated in adults, but in a 12-2 vote, the committee said the data fell short in patients 12-17 years.</p><p>In another 14-0 vote, the panel said the available efficacy and safety data supported approval of mepolizumab 100mg for adults, but it voted 10-4 the drug was not ready for approval to treat adolescents.</p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision by 4 November on GSK's biologic license application for mepolizumab, which was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GSK-submits-mepolizumab-NDA-MAA-in-eosinophilic-asthma-354879" target="_new">submitted</a> last year.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
