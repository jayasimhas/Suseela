<p> Allergan plc CEO Brent Saunders traded up from the $8.7bn sale of <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292">Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc.</a> in 2013 to the $66bn merger of Allergan and Actavis plc earlier this year as the companies he helmed were acquired or made their own big buys, bringing the dealmaker's two-year transaction total to $152bn, and now Saunders could double that number if Pfizer Inc. proposes a suitable acquisition price for Allergan. </p> <p> Pfizer and Allergan confirmed on Oct. 29 that the companies recently initiated friendly merger talks, but without a deal on the table no one outside of the two companies knows how much Pfizer might pay to surpass Johnson &amp; Johnson as the largest health care company in the world. With a $121.4bn market cap, if Pfizer were to pay a 20% premium to Allergan's $308.47 per share stock price as of Oct. 30, a merger would be valued at $145.7bn, which means that a single transaction would nearly equal Saunders's 2013-2015 dealmaking tally. </p> <p> Analysts have estimated that <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-To-Solve-Tax-Woes-With-Allergan-Mega-Merger-361292">a Pfizer acquisition of Allergan</a> would bring in a premium of at least 20% more than Allergan's current valuation with a <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PfizerGan-Whats-it-Worth-158bn-361313">cash-and-stock price tag</a> ranging from $147bn to $158bn &ndash; topping the $119bn that <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Game-over-as-AstraZeneca-rejects-final-119bn-Pfizer-bid-351897">Pfizer might have paid</a> for AstraZeneca last year if the deal hadn't been rejected, and besting Pfizer's acquisition of Warner-Lambert Co. for $90bn in 2000. </p> <p> Saunders was president of the consumer health business at Schering-Plough Corp. when Merck &amp; Co. bought the company for $41bn in 2009 and he was the main representative on Schering-Plough's side of the table as the two companies <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-and-Co-to-buy-Schering-Plough-in-41-billion-deal-118113">prepared to integrate their operations</a>. The experience has served him well as he's led several other companies through major transactions and integrations since then. </p> <p> But his recent run of dealmaking started when Saunders, as CEO of Bausch &amp; Lomb, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-confirms-8.7bn-purchase-of-Bausch--Lomb-343536">sold the eye care company</a> to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International for $8.7bn. Then, while serving on the Forest Laboratories Inc. board of directors, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Former-Bausch--Lomb-CEO-Saunders-to-head-Forest-Icahn-approves-346468">he was hired as the CEO</a> and struck <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-in-25bn-Forest-buy-rumor-350092">a $28bn deal to sell Forest</a> to Actavis five months later. Before the merger, however, Forest <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-bets-on-growth-with-2.9bn-Aptalis-buy-349184">paid $2.9bn for</a> Aptalis Holdings Inc. and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Forest-gaining-relevant-GI-position-with-Furiex-buy-351489">agreed to buy</a> Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc. for up to $1.46bn. </p> <p><preform><iframe src="//e.infogr.am/saunders_deal_tally?src=embed" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></preform></p> <p> Saunders <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Forests-Saunders-takes-lead-role-on-Actaviss-new-leadership-team-351859">was named CEO of Actavis</a>, based on his dealmaking and business acumen, to <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/INTERVIEW-Actavis-CEO-Saunders-staying-put-as-Allergan-deal-nears-close-357214">co-lead the company with</a> former CEO and current chairman Paul Bisaro while Actavis began to <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-will-become-Allergan-to-emphasize-branded-pharma-focus-356827">increase its brand-name business</a> beyond its historical focus on generics. </p> <p> Actavis then <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Actavis-builds-antibiotic-presence-with-675m-Durata-deal-354319">acquired the antibiotics firm</a> Durata Therapeutics Inc. for up to $820m in October 2014 and <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-buys-UK-generics-firm-for-306m-356363">generics specialist</a> Auden McKenzie for $472.6m in January before the Allergan transaction closed in March and the company took on the Allergan name in July. </p> <p> Saunders <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Big-paydays-ahead-as-Actavis-buys-Allergan-for-219-per-share-355111">swooped in to save Allergan</a> from an unwanted, hostile acquisition by Valeant with Actavis paying $66bn for the specialty pharma company, which was best known for its <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-does-Actavis-get-in-66bn-Allergan-buy-355110">wrinkle-reducer and migraine headache reliever</a> Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) and the dry eye drug Restasis (cyclosporine). </p> <p> Since the transaction closed, the new Allergan has purchased <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Beyond-Restasis-Allergan-buys-Oculeve-dry-eye-device-359267">dry eye device maker</a> Oculeve for $125m, a <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-migraine-portfolio-grows-with-Merck-CGRP-antagonists-359295">portfolio of CGRP antagonists</a> from Merck for up to $375m, <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Allergan-paying-560m-for-Naurex-stays-quiet-on-rumored-generics-sale-to-Teva-359627">depression drug developer</a> Naurex for $560m and paid $2.1bn for Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which developed the <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Allergan-Uses-Its-Cash-For-Kythera-359794">double chin reducer</a><i>Kybella</i> (<a target="_new" href="http://##http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Kytheras-chin-fat-drug-OKd-in-US-358128">deoxycholic acid</a>). </p> <p> Allergan also <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Mega-Deals-or-Not-Allergan-Transformation-Under-Way-359815">accepted an offer it couldn't refuse</a> to focus entirely on its brand-name products by <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/With-36bn-from-Teva-what-should-Allergan-buy-next-359644">shedding its generics business</a> in a $40.5bn transaction with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Theres-No-Out-For-The-Allergan-Deal-Teva-CEO-Says-361297">will close as planned</a> whether Pfizer buys Allergan or not. (The $152bn deal tally calculated by <i>Scrip</i> does not include some of the smaller divestitures completed while Saunders was CEO at Actavis/Allergan.) </p> <p> But generics aren't necessarily a deal-breaker for Pfizer, which profits from both branded and generic medicines. In fact, analysts began to imagine <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Analysts-play-MandA-chess-with-Actavis-Pfizer-352617">a Pfizer acquisition of Allergan</a>, when it still was known as the big generics player Actavis, back in July 2014. </p> <p> If it does buy Allergan, Pfizer's mega-merger dealmaking may come to an end for a while, since it is likely to take several months or more for Pfizer to integrate Allergan into the company. </p> <p> So, where does that leave Saunders? Will another company hire him to find and acquire new assets for their portfolios? </p> <p> One thing seems certain: If he doesn't stay with Pfizer, as often happens when an acquired company merges with its acquirer, Saunders should have no shortage of job offers. </p> <p><p>
