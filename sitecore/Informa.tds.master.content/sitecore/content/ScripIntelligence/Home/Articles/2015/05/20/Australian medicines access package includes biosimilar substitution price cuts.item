<p>The Australian government has produced a new five-year package designed to ensure patient access to medicines subsidized under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) while promoting the scheme's sustainability and the quality use of medicines. </p><p>Announced on 27 May, the PBS Access and Sustainability Package includes a one-off 5% cut in the price of single-brand drugs, reductions in generic medicine prices, biosimilar substitution by pharmacists, and the delisting of certain non-prescription drugs. </p><p>The package is expected to produce budget savings of some Aus$6.6bn over five years, although taking account of re-investment in various sections of the pharmaceutical and pharmacy sectors, the net savings will be around Aus$3.7bn, the government says. </p><p>The Generic Medicines industry Association (GMiA) and the Australian Pharmacy Guild have each signed up to the package via separate five-year strategic agreements that overlap in some parts while containing provisions specific to each sector. </p><p>The GMiA said its agreement recognized the "essential role of generic medicines and biosimilars in delivering affordable healthcare through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme", as well as the "significant" savings that can be delivered by greater competition. </p><p>In the case of the Pharmacy Guild, the government has agreed to a package of funding measures worth Aus$18.9bn over five years, including the delinking of pharmacists' remuneration from the prices of medicines and the introduction of a pharmacy "handling fee", which health minister Sussan Ley said meant reductions in drug prices would not affect pharmacists' incomes. </p><p>The R&D-based industry body, Medicines Australia, has not yet signed up, but it has agreed a "Letter of Intent" with the government for a five-year strategic agreement that would "provide patients and industry with a degree of stability and certainty". </p><p>The Access and Sustainability Package is the latest move in a general overhaul of medicines and pharmacy funding. The federal 2015 budget <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australian-cash-for-new-drugs-comes-with-strings-358398" target="_new">announced earlier this month</a> allotted an additional Aus$1.3bn for new medicines and vaccines, together with a requirement for savings of Aus$252.2m in the form of price cuts for certain PBS-listed drugs, as part of an overall healthcare savings package. </p><p>Ms Ley said that the government had doubled the number of medicines listings since coming to office to more than 650, which represented an investment of nearly Aus$3bn in just over 18 months, and that the demand on the PBS for new listings would continue to grow over the next five years.</p><h2>The measures</h2><p>Among the measures in the package are the following:</p><ul><li>An increase (from three to six) in the number of times PBS medicine prices can change each year (from 1 July 2015).</li><li>The substitution of biosimilar medicines at pharmacy level based on clinical recommendations of the PBAC (details of the criteria that will be used to determine eligibility for substitution will be given in a separate article in <i>Scrip</i>). </li><li>A one-off statutory price reduction of 5% on all brands of pharmaceutical items on the F1 (single-source) formulary after they have been listed on the PBS for at least five years (from 1 April 2016).</li><li>Removing the originator brand from the calculation of the weighted average disclosed price of medicines under the price disclosure arrangements for medicines that have been on the F2 (multisource) formulary for three years or more (from 1 October 2015). Under price disclosure, the prices the government pays are adjusted to reflect more closely the price at which medicines are supplied. Removing originators from the calculation is expected to lead to price reductions because originators tend to maintain higher prices than other brands and therefore draw up the weighted average price. </li><li>Applying the drug price disclosure arrangements to combination medicines on the F2 (multisource) formulary (from 1 April 2016).</li><li>Delisting selected over-the-counter medicines from the PBS as recommended by the PBAC (from 1 January 2016).</li><li>Allowing approved pharmacists to discount the PBS patient co-payment by up to Aus$1 per script (from January 2016).</li></ul><p>As the PBS operates under the National Health Act of 1953, some of the key measures have to be approved via the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Bill 2015, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 May. They include those on combination medicines, the one-off price reduction, removing the originator brand from F2 price calculations, and the optional Aus$1 discount on the pharmacy co-payment.</p><h2>"Extensive consultation"</h2><p>The government said the package was the result of "extensive consultation and negotiation across the whole PBS supply chain", and that over four months it worked with more than 20 stakeholder groups, including the GMiA and Medicines Australia, to develop "a strongly supported package of measures. Inputs and ideas were canvassed and received from all sectors and "detailed negotiations were held with the pharmacy and pharmaceutical industry, as well as consumer organisations".</p><p>It will change pricing arrangements for PBS medicines and facilitate improvements to the pharmaceutical sector, and taxpayers and consumers will benefit from lower prices for both innovator and generic medicines listed on the PBS," the government added.</p><p>Ms Ley described the move as "one of the biggest reforms of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme proposed in the last decade". The GMiA agreement "could see some of Australia's most common medicines for cholesterol, heart conditions and depression halve in price &ndash; in some cases by as much as Aus$10 per script for general patients &ndash; saving chronic users upwards of Aus$120 or more each year from October next year". </p><p>The agreement would also see the government improve the rules around incentives for pharmacists to offer patients the option of cheaper generic versions of medicines, as well as a Aus$20m campaign to increase consumer confidence in the use of biosimilars, the minister added.</p><h2>"Constructive dialogue," says GMiA</h2><p>The GMiA said the strategic agreement was the result of "constructive and respectful dialogue between the GMiA and the government over the past three months and is the first strategic agreement GMiA has signed with the Australian government". It would "support the ongoing supply of affordable generic and biosimilar medicines in Australia and deliver a five year period of certainty for the industry that provides them".</p><p>GMiA chair Mark Crotty said the association and the government had "a common interest in the ongoing and reliable access to affordable generic medicines and biosimilars, a strong PBS that can meet the current and future needs of Australians, and having a sustainable generic medicines sector".</p><p>The GMiA added that no further price-related changes would be made to the F2 formulary, and that the Department of Health and the GMiA would "work collaboratively to identify, and resolve quickly, any unintended consequences of budget savings particularly where they may impact on the reliable supply of vital, affordable medicines for Australian patients".</p><p>Medicines Australia announced on 27 May that it had agreed to sign a Letter of Intent for a similar five-year agreement, and that it expected to have it converted into a binding strategic agreement by 18 June. </p><p>The association said that if finalized, the agreement would "provide Australian patients and the medicines industry with a degree of stability and certainty in providing ongoing access to innovative medicines delivered through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme". A spokesman told <i>Scrip</i> the association was still negotiating the final details of the agreement with the health minister, so it would be "inappropriate to comment on the specific contents of the Letter of Intent at this stage".</p><p>CEO Tim James said "in response to the government&rsquo;s budgetary challenges, we have agreed to meet all of the government&rsquo;s savings targets". He said his members had been given "a number of undertakings and concessions regarding any future price-related savings throughout the life of the agreement". </p><p>The challenge for the government and industry, he said, was to "ensure that the measures in this agreement, while delivering savings for the budget, improve, not worsen, access to medicines for all Australians". While the agreement contained cuts to medicines already proven to be cost-effective, "we welcome the limited stability and certainty that this agreement will provide over the coming five years", he added.</p>
