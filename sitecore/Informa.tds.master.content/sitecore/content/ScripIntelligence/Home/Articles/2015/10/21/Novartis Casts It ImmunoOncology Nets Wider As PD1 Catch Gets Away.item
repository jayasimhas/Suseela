<p>Novartis has revealed a series of deals which widen its net in immune-oncology, and hopefully compensate for falling behind some of its competitors in this key development area. </p><p>"Novartis has missed the boat with PD-1s &ndash; its own candidate is a long way off the market and the deals made here could be a sign it is trying to increase the probability of finding the next big immunotherapy class instead," suggests senior Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Dr Joseph Hedden.</p><p>Novartis is acquiring Admune Therapeutics and has signed licensing agreements with Palobiofarma <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Xomas-Novartis-Deal-Distracts-From-Gevokizumab-Flop-360778" target="_new">and XOMA Corporation</a>.</p><p>The pharma giant currently has four candidates currently in clinical trials and five more agents expected to enter the clinic by the end of 2016. These include novel checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) technology, myeloid cell targeting agents, and STING agonists. </p><p>Currently Novartis' myeloid cell targeting program (MCS-110) and checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 (PDR001), LAG-3 (LAG525), are in Phase I trials. The CART program (CTL019) is in Phase II trials. The anti-TIM-3 program (MGB453) is expected to enter the clinic by the end of 2015 and a STING agonist (MIW815), through collaboration with Aduro Biotech, and GITR agonist are slated to enter the clinic in 2016.</p><p>The acquisition of Admune adds an IL-15 agonist program currently in Phase I trials for metastatic cancer. The licensing agreement with Palobiofarma gives Novartis development and commercialization rights to PBF-509, an adenosine receptor antagonist currently in Phase I trials for non-small cell lung cancer. The agreement with XOMA gives Novartis development and commercialization rights to XOMA's TGF-beta antibody programs.</p><p>All three programs will be explored as monotherapies and in combination with therapies in Novartis' immuno-oncology and targeted therapy portfolios, said the pharma giant. </p><p>"The latest deals bring in three more candidates that are unlike anything Novartis already has," notes Hedden. Within its own portfolio it already had the capability to test a range of immuno-oncology combinations, and now with these licensing deals there is the potential to test many more combinations."</p><p>According to Hedden, the combination of checkpoint inhibition with the IL-15 and TGF-beta drugs is an interesting prospect. "We would hope to see some kind of synergistic activity in boosting the immune system here, as the drugs involved all have an effect on the function of T-cells."</p><p>There is an approved combination of dual checkpoint inhibition (Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo and Yervoy) "but we do not yet have cases of a checkpoint inhibitors approved with another immunotherapy class &ndash; though other companies are also exploring this angle," says Hedden. "I'm sure Novartis will use its own checkpoint inhibitors in combination trials, but it is unclear whether these new agents might also be tested with PD1s that are already approved or are close to market." </p><p>Hedden believes this might be a good strategy to tap into the immuno-oncology market in indications like melanoma and NSCLC where Novartis will be behind its peers.</p><p>Novartis acknowledges it has some catching up to do. "The first wave of immuno-oncology therapies has demonstrated the impact this approach can have in treating certain types of tumors," said Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research. "To realize its full potential requires exploration of the complex system of biological pathways in the tumor microenvironment with agents that can stimulate the immune system to attack a wider variety of tumors." </p><p><b>Palobiofarma</b></p><p>Palobiofarma (based in Pamplona, Navarre, Spain) said that under the agreement Novartis would acquire exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Palobiofarma's adenosine A2A receptor antagonist PBF-509, currently entering Phase I trials in NSCLC. Additionally, Novartis will get access to several adenosine-related patents from Palobiofarma related to the role of adenosine in immunotherapy. Palobiofarma will receive an upfront payment of $15m and is eligible for milestone payments as well up to double-digit tiered royalties on net sales. </p><p>Julio Castro, CEO of Palobiofarma, said the deal was "one of the best agreements ever signed in the history of the Spanish biotechnology, and we are very proud of it. We have good reasons to believe that the current agreement is just the start of a successful research and development collaboration between the two companies." </p><p>Palobiofarma was founded in 2006. Three of Spain's most well-known venture capital firms, Inverready, Fitalent and Sodena, are investors in the company. </p><p>
