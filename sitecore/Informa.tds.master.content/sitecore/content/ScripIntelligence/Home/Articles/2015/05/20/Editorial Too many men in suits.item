<p> The other day I stumbled across a crowd-sourcing Tumblr site that sent me hunting for examples to contribute. <i>Congrats, you have an all male panel!</i> is a satirical Tumblr page where posters can add examples documenting all-male panels or audiences at academic lectures, seminars and conferences. </p> <p> Unsurprisingly there are already a lot of posts, including one of an all-male board discussing geopolitics for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a story about a men-only conference in Jerusalem focused on women's health. In true Tumblr meme-obsessed fashion, each post has been granted a seal of approval for its inclusion on the site: a big thumbs up from man's man, The Hoff. </p> <p> <img src="-/media/BF0E973CDB92497F9F3E8BD008D7EE97.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>image credit: allmalepanels.tumblr.com</i> </p> <p> The pharma industry has been highlighted on numerous occasions for its lack of women in top jobs and we are still waiting to see a female CEO take the helm at a big pharma firm. So I thought it would be like shooting fish in a barrel to find a conference listing of all-male speakers to post on this Tumblr site. I was wrong. </p> <p> On the R&amp;D side, the industry is much more equally balanced. When skimming the programs of presentations coming up at the ASCO, ADA and ASM medical meetings I struggled to find male-only panels for important talks. Furthermore, ASM has more than one symposium dedicated to contributions in microbiology from female scientists. </p> <p> However, female attendees at this year's BIO conference, an event focused more on the business- and money-side of things, will surely be able to add a few good men-in-suits group shots to the Tumblr site. Looking at the list of attendees for this year's event, in the top 50 names alphabetically there are eight women listed against 42 men. </p> <p> So BIO ladies, dig out your inner-Instagrammer, because in shaming the industry with photos of its male dominated business events, maybe (at risk of sounding a bit like a Tumblr activist dreamer) it will help to push change. </p> <p> Check out <i>Congrats, you have an all male panel</i>! <a target="_new" href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">here</a>. </p> <p> <b>Related articles: </b> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ANALYSIS-Women-know-your-place---in-the-boardroom-337746">Women: know your place &ndash; in the boardroom</a> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Half-a-century-of-women-prime-ministers-still-no-Pharma-CEO-341922">Half a century of women prime ministers; still no Pharma CEO</a> </p> <p> <a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Phemale-pharma-more-women-more-revenue-340930">Phemale pharma: more women, more revenue?</a> </p>
