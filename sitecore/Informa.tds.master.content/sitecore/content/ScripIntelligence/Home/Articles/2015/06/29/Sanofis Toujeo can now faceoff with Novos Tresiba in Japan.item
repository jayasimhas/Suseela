<p>Sanofi's Lantus follow-on product Toujeo (insulin glargine), a next-generation insulin, has been approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan, but the product faces tough competition in the region from Novo Nordisk's already marketed Tresiba (degludec). </p><p>Toujeo, which is already available in the US and Europe, has been given the green light now in Japan for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It will be sold under the trade name Lantus XR in the country where Sanofi estimates there are approximately 9.5 million people living with diabetes.</p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Rajan Sharma told <i>Scrip</i> that although Sanofi has been successful with the launch of Toujeo in multiple countries so far, it will face tougher competition in Japan. "Uptake of Novo Nordisk's Tresiba has been considerably stronger in Japan than in Europe mainly due to pricing," he said. "As Toujeo and Tresiba essentially compete on the same benefits (reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia and longer duration) Sanofi may have to price Toujeo more favourably to safeguard its position."</p><p>Mr Sharma added that he expects the majority of uptake in Japan will be patients switching from Lantus to Toujeo rather than new insulin users. However he said, "Sanofi has set itself up for this, both products use the same device so there's no need for new training etc. This gives Toujeo the best opportunity to capitalize on Lantus's market dominance."</p><p>The MHLW's approval is based on the results of the EDITION Phase III study program, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Toujeo compared with Lantus in more than 3,500 adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were uncontrolled on their current therapy. The EDITION program included the EDITION JP 1 and JP 2 studies, which involved over 450 Japanese people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Toujeo is now also available inthe US, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands and has been registered in Australia. Sanofi noted the product would become available in other countries in the coming months.</p>
