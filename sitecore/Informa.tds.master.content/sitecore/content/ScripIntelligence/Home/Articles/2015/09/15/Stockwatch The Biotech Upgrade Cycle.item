<p>One of the positive investment attributes of the technology sector is the upgrade cycle. The continual advancements that result in faster speed, longer battery life and more features translate into consumer demand that justifies discarding last year's phone in favour of this year's model. With so many biotech companies coming to the market in the current IPO window, many are developing drugs that are upgrades of those already on the market. </p><p>Last week there were at least three examples of why the rush for these upgrades may not be the panacea in biotech that it is in technology investing.</p><p><p>In a 'positive' announcement, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/XenoPort-Sinks-On-Psoriasis-Drug-Safety-No-Big-Gain-For-Fumarates-360463" target="_new">Xenoport, Inc. reported the results</a> of two dosages of its placebo-controlled three-arm Phase II study of XP23829 (monomethyl fumarate prodrug) in 200 moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients. While the efficacy of XP23829 measured against placebo met the primary endpoint of superiority on the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score, placebo may not have been the standard of care over which doctors and patients were expecting an upgrade. Even before I started to look at the PASI scores of the oral and injected agents already approved to treat psoriasis, the share price of Xenoport was falling and from an initial rise at the open, it closed the week down over 40%. Xenoport's patented prodrug technology is, in its own words, "designed to offer physicians and patients an effective, better tolerated and easier to use therapeutic option". It was at least the tolerance of this upgrade that tripped Xenoport up. The analysts from Cowen thought that "neither its efficacy or safety profile appeared compelling or differentiated" while those from Jefferies suggested that the share price fall was a result of the "high gastrointestinal side effects and the perception that the drug is not differentiated enough". If a more poignant demonstration is needed of how valued the Xenoport prodrug upgrade is over first generation drugs, investors need only to look at the sales of Xenoport and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-gives-up-on-Horizant-as-XenoPort-decides-to-go-it-alone-336991" target="_new">former partner GlaxoSmithKline Plc's drug Horizant</a> (gabapentin enacarbil) for the treatment of restless legs syndrome. Last quarter <i>Horizant</i> generated sales of $8.2m, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sun-finally-shines-on-Horizant-as-FDA-OKs-GSK-XenoPort-RLS-drug-313687" target="_new">four years after its FDA approval</a>.</p><p><p>There was a different reaction from investment bank analysts and investors when the results of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Intra-Cellular-Surges-On-First-Phase-III-Schizophrenia-Data-360490" target="_new">Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. placebo-controlled study</a> were reported last week. In contrast to Xenoport, Intra-Cellular Therapies saw its share price rise by nearly 13% on the week after announcing a positive Phase III three-arm study with only one of the two doses of ITI-007 &ndash; an atypical antipsychotic &ndash; showing statistically significant superiority over placebo after four weeks in 450 schizophrenia patients. As with the Xenoport announcement, I started to look up the published studies on risperidone, a generic atypical antipsychotic approved to treat newly diagnosed schizophrenia patients. Risperidone appeared to have at least as good activity as ITI-007 on the primary endpoint of the composite change from baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. By the time I had looked this up, and without an obvious safety signal, the share price of Intra-Cellular Therapies was on the ascendency supported by the analysts from Cowen who noted the "encouraging dose-dependent improvement" and those from Ladenburg Thalmann who suggested "ITI-007's multi-billion dollar potential with efficacy in schizophrenia comparable to [generic] risperidone". </p><p><p>At the back of my mind, I had started to distinguish between the upgrades at technology companies, which are based on improved product attributes over the last version of the product, and product upgrades at biotech companies which seem to be based only on activity over placebo. Even the EMEA, with its tacit focus on cost-effectiveness, demands an active comparator to approve a drug, while the FDA is still stuck in the placebo-controlled era and could probably have prevented the commercial disaster formally known as <i>Horizant</i> by asking for best standard-of-care study arms with and without <i>Horizant</i>. A misleading improvement on this situation was demonstrated by the downsized IPO of Nibriva Therapeutics AG last week. Nibriva has just raised $92m to fund the Phase III study of its lead product lefamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Lefamulin has been billed as a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Nabriva-raises-120m-to-take-new-class-of-antibiotic-into-Phase-III-357698" target="_new">new class of antibiotic</a>, even though the pleuromutilins already have an approved member of that drug class &ndash; Altabax (reptamulin) &ndash; which was a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-Yard-sale-drug-development-332937" target="_new">dismal commercial failure</a>. One of the other indications for lefamulin is acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) where Nibriva completed a Phase II study way back in 2011. This was a three-arm study of two doses of lefamulin against comparator vancomycin. Generic vancomycin is a strange comparator since it is generally reserved for resistant infections and because of its high minimum inhibitory concentration and static activity, may have been included in the study as an easy hurdle to beat (except on price).</p><p><p>As the stock market continues its pull-back, many companies are competing for fewer investors' attention in touting their newly upgraded products. In comparison with Apple, Inc. which aired its new upgraded products last week, biotech companies that announce positive studies with efficacy endpoints measured against a placebo or a low-bar generic comparator would be like Apple comparing the iPhone 6S with a non-smart brick phone from the last century. For those companies that avoid the standard of care comparator arm, eventually there will be trouble on the <i>Horizant</i>.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
