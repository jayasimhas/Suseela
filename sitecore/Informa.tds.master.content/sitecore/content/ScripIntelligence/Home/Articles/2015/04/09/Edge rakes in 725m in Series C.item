<p><p>Brain treatment developer Edge Therapeutics has hauled in $72.5m in a two-part Series C financing that closed in April and included a number of high net worth individuals, family offices and private foundations, as well as venture investors that will help move the company's brain injury drug into late-stages. </p><p>Berkeley Heights, NJ-based Edge announced 09 April that it has completed the second part of its C round. The most recent financing of $56m was led by Venrock and included Sofinnova Ventures, Janus Capital Management, funds managed by Franklin Advisers, New Leaf Venture Partners and BioMed Ventures. The first portion of the money - $16.5m &ndash; was completed in December and came from non-venture investors. </p><p>As part of the second portion of the offering, Venrock partner Dr Anders Hove and Sofinnova managing partner Dr James Healy joined the company's board of directors. </p><p>Edge intends to use the cash to complete a Phase I/II study of its lead therapeutic, EG-1962, and move the drug into Phase III pivotal study. EG-1962 was designed to improve the outcomes for patients that have suffered an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSUH), or ruptured brain aneurysm. </p><p>Preliminary data from the Phase I/II NEWTON study showed that 11 of the 18 patients, or 61%, who received EG-1962 showed a favorable outcome on the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (eGOS), which measures patient recovery based on a scale of one to eight, with one equaling death and eight equal to good recovery. Patients who received a favorable score in the NEWTON study had an eGOS score between six and eight when measured 90 days after treatment. Meanwhile, only one of six, or 17%, of those patients in the trial given Bayer's calcium channel blocker Nimotop (nimodipine). </p><p>Edge intends to use the money from the financing to enroll further patient cohorts in the NEWTON study and hopes to announce topline data in later this year. </p><p>EG-1962 contains nimodipine, but the polymer-based microparticle allows for better outcomes and a more favorable side effect profile than the older drug, according to the company. The drug also has a more favorable mode of administration &ndash; EG-1962 is delivered as a single dose, while oral Nimotop is given every four hours over a 21-day period. </p><p><p><p>
