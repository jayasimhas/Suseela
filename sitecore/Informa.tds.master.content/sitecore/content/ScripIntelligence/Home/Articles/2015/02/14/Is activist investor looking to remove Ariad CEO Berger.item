<p>Ariad Pharmaceuticals is not commenting on news reports that its largest shareholder, the Greenwich, Connecticut-based activist investor Sarissa Capital Management, intends to launch a proxy fight to replace the company's chairman and CEO Harvey Berger.</p><p>Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Ariad's stock never recovered from a decline that began in October 2013 when safety concerns were raised about Iclusig (ponatinib), which led to the leukemia drug's brief removal from the market 10 months following its US FDA approval (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ariad-suspends-Iclusig-sales-temporarily-on-FDA-concerns-shares-plummet-347774" target="_new">1 November 2013</a>). The company's stock closed up 6.5% at $7.35 per share on 13 February, bringing its market cap to $1.4bn, which is about a third of its $22.52 value in September 2013 before the Iclusig safety issues came to light.</p><p>An Ariad spokeswoman declined to comment on Sarissa's intentions for the company.</p><p>Iclusig was back on the market by January 2014 with restrictions on which patients could take the drug, but the damage to Ariad's stock value was done (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Iclusig-back-on-US-market-Ariad-rises-349430" target="_new">20 January 2014</a>). By February 2014, Sarissa founder and chief investment officer Alexander Denner &ndash; protégé of the notorious activist investor Carl Icahn &ndash; was named to Ariad's board of directors for a two-year term and he'd been granted authority to approve the company's appointment of another independent director (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Ariad-appoints-activist-investor-Denner-to-board-350204" target="_new">24 February 2014</a>).</p><p>Sarissa owns 12.9m shares of Ariad stock, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which noted that Dr Denner acquired 22,665 more shares on 31 January. Sarissa's 6.9% stake in the company makes the hedge fund Ariad's largest shareholder.</p><p>Dr Denner also claimed a seat on the Vivus board of directors in 2013 after majority shareholder First Manhattan Co staged a successful coup to replace several board directors based on disappointing sales for the weight loss drug Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate) following its FDA approval in 2012 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Vivus-CEO-resigns-FMC-gains-board-majority-in-settlement-345135" target="_new">19 July 2013</a>).</p><p><p><p><p><p>
