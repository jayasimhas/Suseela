<p>It's unclear whether it was simply another example of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s inability to clearly communicate or there's some actual wrongdoing going on, but the company's shares took a beating on Oct. 21, with the stock freefalling 40% &ndash; a walloping that spread to other drug makers in the sector.</p><p>The trigger: Allegations made by short-selling firm Citron Research that Valeant has questionable relationships with two specialty pharmacies &ndash; even accusing them of conspiring to create "phantom accounts."</p><p>Citron, which called Valeant the "pharmaceutical Enron," asserted the whole scheme was "a fraud to create invoices to deceive the auditors and book revenue."</p><p>Valeant, however, shot back &ndash; although several hours later, long after the damage had been done.</p><p>"We categorically deny the allegations made in the Citron Report," a spokesperson told Scrip. </p><p>"Citron's false and misleading statements about Valeant appear to be an attempt to manipulate the market in an effort to drive down Valeant's stock price," the spokesperson said in an email response to questions. </p><p>"We are confident in our full compliance with all applicable accounting rules, regulations and laws," the Valeant spokesperson said.</p><p>Shares of Valeant closed at $118.61, down $28.13, or about 19%.</p><p><b>Specialty Pharmas Hit</b></p><p>Shares of other drug makers in the specialty pharma space also got knocked about on Oct. 21, including Allergan plc, whose stock took a 10% hit, before closing at $159.00, down $4.42, or 1.7%, and Horizon Pharma plc, whose shares tumbled 14.2%, closing at $14.83, a loss of 43 cents, or 2.8%.</p><p>Allergan and Horizon both issued statements on Oct. 21 claiming they do not own or have ownership stakes in specialty pharmacies.</p><p>While Horizon said some of its medicines are distributed by both specialty pharmacies, those entities are "fully independent."</p><p>Allergan said it "does not rely on specialty pharmacies for the distribution" of its products. But it also said 3% of its branded sales are distributed through "unaffiliated specialty pharmacies," the majority of which are "unique" specialty products, namely Botox Therapeutic (onabotulinumtoxinA) and Zenpep (pancrelipase).</p><p>But the panic on Wall Street reflected investors' concerns there's likely to be more scrutiny of the entire specialty pharma sector and the way those companies price and distribute their products.</p><p><b>Already Under Fire</b></p><p>Valeant already has been under fire for its practices of buying up older drugs and increasing their prices, which triggered <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">investigations on Capitol Hill</a> and probes by federal prosecutors in Massachusetts and New York, which sent separate <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-Subpoenaed-Price-Hikes-Bring-Patient-Assistance-Scrutiny-361076" target="_new">subpoenas</a> to the company earlier this month, the firm disclosed on Oct. 14.</p><p>Valeant said most of the materials requested by the subpoenas were related to documents for the company's patient assistance programs, and also included requests related to financial support provided by the company for patients, distribution of its products, information provided to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and pricing decisions. </p><p>On Oct. 19, Valeant said the "turmoil" over its pricing practices had driven the company to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">change its strategy</a> to seek fewer transactions focused on what it called "mispriced products."</p><p>CEO Michael Pearson said he believed the current environment, in which he said biopharmaceutical firms were being aggressively attacked, would lead all drug companies to employ "more modest" pricing of their medicines in the future.</p><p><b>An Undisclosed Relationship</b></p><p>During Valeant's Oct. 19 <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Probes-Drive-Valeant-To-Fewer-Price-Based-Transactions-361119" target="_new">quarterly earnings call</a>, the company for the first time disclosed a "contractual relationship" with Pennsylvania-based Philidor Rx Services and said it even had purchased an option late last year to acquire the specialty pharmacy.</p><p>Pearson explained that "given accounting rules, we consolidate Philidor's financials." "Inventory held at Philidor remains on Valeant's books and is not included in the specialty pharmacy channel inventory," he told investors and analysts. </p><p>Even though an "increasing percentage" of Valeant's revenue is coming from products dispensed through multiple specialty pharmacies, Pearson said the company had not previously discussed those relationships because it was a "competitive advantage that we did not want to disclose to our competitors." </p><p>But he said the company was talking about it on the earnings call to clear up "incorrect assertions by some."</p><p>Pearson also acknowledged Valeant was in a dispute with another specialty pharmacy, R&O Pharmacy, which he said was in the drug company's network and for whom the pharma had shipped $69m "at wholesale prices" worth of medicines &ndash; representing about $25m at net prices. </p><p>"R&O is currently improperly holding significant amounts it receives from payers," the Valeant chief claimed, although Pearson said he could not comment further on the active litigation.</p><p><b>A Smoking Gun?</b></p><p>Before Valeant's call, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation (SIRF) had reported on Oct. 19 about Valeant's lawsuit against R&O. SIRF also reported R&O had a relationship with Philidor and said the latter specialty pharmacy had a complicated "financial connection" to Valeant.</p><p>Citron said it was SIRF's report that triggered Valeant to disclose its relationship with Philidor and the R&O lawsuit.</p><p>In its report, Citron asserted Philidor and R&O "are the same company and share management" &ndash; what it called a "smoking gun."</p><p>Citron cited as evidence the fact that the two specialty pharmacies use the same patient privacy disclosure, which it said were "in fact formatted identically" on both companies' websites &ndash; pointing out that R&O referred to itself on its online page as Philidor.</p><p>Citron also said the two pharmacy companies share the same toll-free number, even though the firms are located across the country from each other.</p><p>In addition, Citron said Valeant and Philidor had created "an entire network of phantom captive pharmacies," pointing out there are the same privacy notice appearing on several other "ghost ship" putative pharmacy websites.</p><p>"Valeant has created a network of 'pharmacies' as clones of Philidor," Citron charged, insisting those entities exist "merely for the purpose of phantom sales or stuff the channel, and avoid scrutiny from the auditor."</p><p>But Valeant called Citron's report "erroneous." </p><p>Philidor, Valeant explained, provides back-end services, including call center, claims adjudication, IT and logistics support, as well as compliance/HIPPA regulation guidance, to other pharmacies, including R&O Pharmacy, which the drug company said includes "a common call center phone number serviced by Philidor for the Philidor network pharmacies. </p><p>It said all shipments to Philidor and other pharmacies in its network, including R&O, "are not recorded in Valeant's consolidated net revenue." </p><p>"Sales are recorded only when the product is dispensed to the patient," Valeant said, adding that all sales to Philidor and its network pharmacies are accounted for as intercompany sales and are eliminated in consolidation. </p><p>"They are not included in the consolidated financial results that Valeant reports externally," the drug company claimed.</p><p>Long after the US markets closed, Philidor finally weighed in on the matter &ndash; declaring it "does not currently have a direct equity ownership in R&O Pharmacy or the affiliated pharmacies, but does have a contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval."</p><p>Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said Philidor's explanation was "far better" than Valeant's.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
