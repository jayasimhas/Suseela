<p>President Barack Obama had a message for Democrats, and Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) in particular, who oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): "They are wrong."</p><p>Appearing on the <i>MSNBC</i> political program <i>Hardball</i> on 21 April, President Obama defended his trade agenda, specifically the TPP &ndash; a pact among Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and the US.</p><p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biopharmaceutical Industry Organization both support the TPP and have pushed to get 12 years of exclusivity protection for biologics included in the final agreement.</p><p>The Generic Pharmaceutical Association, however, has <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GPhA-raises-objections-to-TPP-IP-text-354680" target="_new">objected</a> to the TPP, specifically the intellectual property measures.</p><p>The TPP has been at the center of President Obama's trade agenda and he's been wrangling from the beginning of his tenure in the White House to obtain trade promotion authority (TPA) &ndash; often called fast track &ndash; which would give him the power to negotiate international trade agreements, like the TPP, which would then go to Congress for an up-or-down vote, with lawmakers no longer able to amend or filibuster the deals.</p><p>Late last week, House and Senate committee leaders <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/US-bill-seeks-to-speed-Asia-Europe-trade-deals-357925" target="_new">introduced</a> a bipartisan TPA bill, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, which could help President Obama seal the deal on the TPP, which is in the final stages of negotiations.</p><p>But the president has had a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Obama-faces-more-trade-pushback-from-Dems-356352" target="_new">tough time</a> convincing members of his own party to support the TPA and the TPP, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Nevada), who said he's never trusted trade deals.</p><p>Senator Warren has taken particular issue with the TPP's proposal for the creation of <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Trade-deal-seeks-to-empower-firms-to-challenge-governments-357505" target="_new">investor-state dispute settlement tribunals</a>, which would determine if a nation's laws harmed a firm's or investor's expected future profits and if so, claim damages for actions that have been shown to reduce the value of an investment, or "indirect expropriation."</p><p>Ms Warren has charged that such a measure would challenge US sovereignty.</p><p>"I love Elizabeth. We're allies on a whole host of issues. But she's wrong on this," President Obama declared on the <i>Hardball</i> program. "When you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is, when you dig into the facts, they are wrong."</p><p>If the US is going to success as an economy, where about 11 million of the high-paying jobs in the nation are directly related to exports overseas, Mr Obama said, "then we've got to be able to craft the kinds of trade deals I'm talking about."</p><p>At a 21 April Capitol Hill hearing, Senator Ron Wyden (Democrat-Oregon) &ndash; one of the Democrats who has been on President Obama's side &ndash; insisted the TPA legislation "throws out the old playbook" on trade.</p><p>"This legislation will help make sure the warning bells go off earlier and more loudly when other countries try to break the rules," Senator Wyden said during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is the ranking member. "And it will help stop other countries and companies that try to make end-runs around our laws."</p><p>"This legislation goes further than any TPA bill to protect American sovereignty. It guarantees that trade deals cannot change US law without congressional action," he said.</p><p>And, Senator Wyden said, the TPA will "fight the excessive secrecy that causes people to be skeptical about trade."</p><p>The TPA bill, which is expected to come up for a vote by the Senate Finance Committee on 22 April, also will protect Congress' ability to "hit the brakes on a bad trade deal," the Oregon Democrat declared. </p><p>"This bill is not a green light for the Trans-Pacific Partnership or any trade deal that comes before Congress," he said. "What this legislation does is raise the bar for future trade deals and challenge our negotiators and foreign countries to meet it. If they fail, Congress can stop a bad deal dead in its tracks."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
