<p><p>Acorda CEO Ron Cohen says the company would be interested in expanding its infrastructure and establishing a presence in Europe now that its pipeline is progressing.</p><p>The biotech executive told analysts on the company's second quarter earnings call on 30 July that Acorda is "very interested in ex-US" business development.</p><p>"Most of our pipeline we own for worldwide distribution and commercialization," said Mr Cohen. "So, we would like to find a sound business development opportunity with good industrial logic for establishing at least the European commercial base for the company, because we think that could be very valuable going forward as our pipeline develops.</p><p>Expanding its infrastructure to the EU isn't the only business development the company has been eyeing. Acorda is looking to add products to its pipeline or even add already marketed products. </p><p>"We are also looking more broadly at opportunities -- particularly in late-stage development -- similar to what you saw us do with Civitas, where we have a lot of confidence in the available products and data," said the exec. </p><p>Mr Cohen was quick to note that the biotech is also interested in "some in-market products, because we have an outstanding specialty sales force."</p><p>"So, having additional products to put in the bag even if they are not blockbusters would be incrementally accretive and also help us establish the groundwork for future growth," he added. </p><p>Beyond Ampyra (dalfampridine), the multiple sclerosis drugs that helps patients with mobility, Acorda has several drugs in its pipeline, including CVT-301 for the treatment of off episodes in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and Plumiaz for the treatment of seizure clusters in epilepsy. </p><p><p>
