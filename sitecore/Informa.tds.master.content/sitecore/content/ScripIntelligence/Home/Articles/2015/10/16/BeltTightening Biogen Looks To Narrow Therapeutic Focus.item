<p><p>Despite beating sales estimates for its blockbuster oral multiple sclerosis therapy <i>Tecfidera</i>, Biogen Inc. has decided it needs to cut costs, announcing Oct. 21 a plan to reduce headcount by 11% and prune some non-core programs from its pipeline.</p><p>On its third quarter earnings call, the big biotech unveiled its corporate restructuring at the same time that it disclosed a <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-Problems-For-Biogens-Tysabri-361159" target="_new">Phase III failure</a> for <i>Tysabri</i> in secondary progressive MS, saying it would stop that label-expansion effort for natalizumab.</p><p>The cutback is intended to reduce Biogen's run rate by $250m by year-end and clear the way for increased commercial support of Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which achieved blockbuster sales during its first year on the market and increased to $2.91bn in 2014. During the past quarter, the immunomodulator posted worldwide sales of $937m, up from $787m one year earlier, while US sales rose 6% quarter-over-quarter, to $754m.</p><p>That increase ends a slight turndown in Tecfidera sales driven by safety concerns around the deadly brain disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), dating back to a case reported in <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogens-Tecfidera-Dogged-By-PML-360555" target="_new">October 2014</a>.</p><p>For the quarter, the Cambridge, Mass.-headquartered firm reported total revenues of $2.8bn, up 11% year-over-year, which CEO George Scangos said reflects a redoubled commercial effort behind Tecfidera.</p><p>"Our market research continues to indicate that prescribers believe Tecfidera has a very strong benefit/risk profile. However, patient growth in the US and Germany remains challenging, and we're actively working to improve this dynamic," he told the earnings call. "We've increased sales calls for Tecfidera as we continue to educate physicians on Tecfidera's strong efficacy and favorable safety profile and its label and monitoring requirements. We've also increased our direct-to-consumer marketing in the US, including a recently launched television campaign that some of you may have seen."</p><p>Investors have been concerned about the firm&rsquo;s sales and marketing efforts following the departure of Exec VP-Global Commercial Operations Tony Kingsley, announced earlier this month. Scangos credited Kingsley with playing an instrumental role in several successful launches for Biogen over his five-year tenure. He added that John Cox, executive VP of pharmaceutical operations and technology, would lead the commercial team on an interim basis.</p><p><b>Restructuring End-Game</b></p><p>Scangos called the staff cutbacks "extremely difficult" but added that the restructuring, which includes an increased share buyback initiative to return value to shareholders, is necessary to put Biogen on the best possible footing going forward.</p><p>"As part of our effort to focus on key commercial initiatives and high potential pipeline candidates, we've also made the decision to discontinue several pipeline programs, [which] includes Tecfidera in secondary progressive MS as well as certain programs in immunology and fibrosis research, including anti-TWEAK,&rdquo; an antibody meant to block an immune cell protein implicated in lupus, the exec said.</p><p>"Importantly, we plan to reinvest the savings from this restructuring into key commercial initiatives and a number of prioritized programs across our emerging, mid- and late-stage pipeline, including commercial initiatives aimed at increasing sales of marketing therapies, including new direct-to-consumer marketing programs for Tecfidera," he added.</p><p>Emphasis will be increased on advancing pipeline programs including aducanumab, a Phase III amyloid-blocking antibody; BAN2401, a Phase II anti-amyloid beta antibody; and E2609, a Phase II BACE1 inhibitor, for Alzheimer's disease. The firm is capitalizing on the reinvigorating success seen with aducanumab in March &ndash; it&rsquo;s already started two Phase III trials.</p><p>Biogen is also sticking with building its MS franchise with anti-LINGO, a Phase II blocker of a protein needed to make myelin for multiple sclerosis, and will focus on ISIS-SMNRx, a Phase III candidate for spinal muscular atrophy partnered with Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p>CFO Paul Clancy elaborated further on the corporate restructuring, saying "the reduction was the result of a number of actions including the consolidation and elimination of certain overlapping groups across the organization in analytical and operational support and in marketing, resizing portions of the company where we felt there was excess capacity, including in our manufacturing operation, resizing our ex-US commercial operation, and reductions driven by our de-emphasis of certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research in the termination of certain development programs."</p><p>In a same-day note, Jefferies analyst Brian Abraham said that the cuts, while expected, should be appreciated by investors.</p><p>"Combined with clear improvements in expense control this quarter (e.g., SG&A $478M vs. $532M consensus), this should help streamline the story more so, in light of MS market changes," the analyst said. "The cut programs, such as anti-TWEAK, were not core drivers, in our opinion. Buybacks [were] even greater than expected &ndash; $3bn in 3Q and an additional nearly $1bn thus far in October &ndash; reflecting prioritization of capital deployment and returning cash to shareholders more aggressively."</p><p>Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen applauded the increased emphasis on a narrower pipeline in her Oct. 21 note on Biogen.</p><p>"While threats to Biogen&rsquo;s older products are well-known, we think the market doesn&rsquo;t assign enough value to Biogen&rsquo;s pipeline, and we&rsquo;re encouraged that management is further focusing on its competitive advantages &#8230; in neurology with the new restructuring plan," she said. "While each individual neurology program has risk, we think this strategy supports Biogen&rsquo;s ability to demonstrate value. The Lingo program could be among Biogen's biggest opportunities (data mid-2016 in MS)."</p><p><b>Scangos On Deal Strategy, Price Controversy</b></p><p>Scangos said Biogen will continue to add to its priority R&D areas through deal-making, pointing to a September <a href="http://#https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/Publications/The-Pink-Sheet-Daily/2015/9/9/Biogens-S1P-Modulator-License--A-Good-Deal-Done-Too-Late?" target="_new">partnership</a> with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp. on Phase III-ready MS candidate MT-1303, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, as an ideal example of what the biotech is seeking.</p><p>"We are constantly looking for interesting opportunities that are consistent with our strategy, that are in our areas of expertise. I would say there is no sweet spot. It's a question of value of what you get for what you pay," he said. "So, we're looking at some small things. We're looking at some large things. And it's not so much a question of the size but of making solid strategic medical and financial decisions."</p><p>The exec also expounded on the ongoing controversy over drug pricing that has been a central issue in early positioning for the 2016 presidential race.</p><p>"I don't expect that rhetoric to go away anytime soon," he said. "I think the industry is preparing a thoughtful presentation of a different perspective on drug prices and the value that we bring to patients and to the medical community. In the end &#8230; it's what everybody says, but it's true. In the end, things are going to be priced according to the value that they bring to patients, right?"</p><p>"I believe that if we bring forward innovative drugs that make a difference in the lives of patients, that those will continue to get attractive pricing," Scangos continued. "And that's why we're working on the kinds of drugs that we're working [on], aducanumab and SMNRx and LINGO for MS. Those potentially can make a magnitude of difference that will continue to justify good reimbursement even in a tough pricing environment."</p><p><p>
