<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into China's life sciences sector will increase by 177% to &pound;128.2bn by 2020, as the rapidly ageing population drives demand for healthcare services and the Chinese government makes efforts to relax controls. So says a new report from global law firm King & Wood Mallesons, <i>Branching Out: Investment Opportunities in China in 2020</i>.</p><p>The overall investment climate in China is changing, led by the government's current Five Year Plan (its 12th) and the latest Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (CGFII). The new initiatives also highlight the particular channels the government has identified as benefiting from outside contributions.</p><p>Laws and policies have been adjusted to lighten restrictions on foreign investors to encourage them to participate in the Chinese market. Many industrial sectors are undergoing a process of liberalization, with government administrative procedures for foreign investments being revised and simplified, explains Stuart Fuller, global managing partner. "Over recent years, the Chinese authorities have taken steps to make investment into China easier and to change investor perceptions of the Chinese market and its opportunities." </p><p>For example, the 2011 Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign-Invested Industries (the bible for foreign investors) has taken healthcare out from the "restrictive" category and foreign investors are now allowed to establish wholly foreign-owned hospitals in seven pilot regions.</p><p>The fact that this liberalization process encompasses the pharmaceutical industry may come as a surprise. Few of us will have forgotten the embarrassing headlines GlaxoSmithKline has had to contend with over the past couple of years.</p><p>However, China's increasingly ageing population and lifestyle changes have shifted the prevalence of disease, increasing the demand for medicines, particularly for chronic conditions. Similarly, improving healthcare is expected to lead to higher levels of diagnosis and greater treatment of conditions such as cancer and respiratory diseases, which again will result in greater demand. China needs foreign investment to meet domestic demand, says Mr Fuller.</p><p><b>Hong Kong Gateway</b></p><p>There are a number of routes into investing in China, which are outlined in the report. Using Hong Kong as a gateway into China is a popular and growing strategy, principally because the legal system is much more familiar to outsiders than the system operating in Mainland China. </p><p>However, "As Mainland China begins to liberalize, it is clear that the role of Hong Kong as the gateway will diminish. This will be due to developments such as the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which will enable foreign investors to invest directly into certain sectors that were previously restricted. Funds will also flow more freely than they have in the past. It is expected that over time, additional free trade zones will be declared. This will not only increase the ability, but also the willingness of foreign investors to buy into China," claims partner Josh Cole.</p><p><b>bilateral treaty</b></p><p>Negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty between the EU and China are continuing. Currently most member states have their own treaties with China, resulting in a complex patchwork of agreements that are no longer fit for purpose. </p><p>"There are enormous untapped opportunities that a bilateral investment treaty could unlock. For a deal to be done, both sides will need to compromise. But a treaty with balanced and high standards of protection and an efficient dispute resolution mechanism will create legal certainty for investors and could deliver huge benefits," explains partner Christopher Humpe.</p><p><b>paying for increasing demand</b></p><p>Meeting rising healthcare costs will be a challenge for the Chinese, as it is for governments around the globe. The report explains that, like many countries, China has systems for price regulation &ndash; at both central level through the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and local level. For drug pricing, China has a system under which: 1) for drugs listed in the Directory of Drugs for National Basic Medical Insurance and drugs not listed in the Directory but monopolistically manufactured and distributed, prices are fixed or guided by the Government; and 2) for other drugs, prices are regulated by the market. </p><p>In terms of reimbursement through the medical insurance system, China has adopted a policy of 'Expenditure Control for Medical Insurance' which may have an impact on drug demands and drug prices as well as profits generated which may also put pressure on pricing for drug companies, particularly for multinationals.</p><p><b>barriers to healthcare investment</b></p><p>China's healthcare system is fragmented across its provinces, resulting in varying business conditions. Investing in the Chinese life sciences industry is further complicated by the country's industrial policy, which generally favors domestic firms. Foreign-owned businesses are subject to more stringent operational conditions, such as data disclosure, and issues such as pricing control can have a negative impact on FDI returns.</p><p>For example, the Essential Drugs List consists of 520 items with capped prices and 20 categories of drugs (totaling 400 varieties) that are subject to price cuts of an average of 15%. The level of certain state regulation of prices is set to increase further, with proposals for a National Development and Reforms Commission to oversee the cost of medical devices.</p><p>The Life Sciences industry has also been subject to intensified anti-corruption and anti-monopoly investigations, with the Chinese government pursuing foreign pharmaceutical companies in this regard. </p><p>However, King & Wood Mallesons' analysis suggests investors are not going to be put off &ndash;total FDI in the life sciences space is set to rise from &pound;46.3bn in 2014 to &pound;128.2bn in 2020, a cumulative annual growth rate of 19%. But this shouldn't come as a surprise. According to Deloitte, China is gearing up to become the world's largest pharmaceutical market by 2020 &ndash; with a value of $250bn&ndash; and this year pharmaceutical sales are estimated to reach $125bn.</p><p>While there is a long journey ahead for the Chinese economy as it undergoes reforms and opens itself up to competition, the opportunities available for foreign investors with a well-informed strategy are clearly worth the effort, concludes the report.</p>
