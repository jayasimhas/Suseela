<p>Following its entry into North America and China, South Korea's Green Cross is set to make inroads into the rapidly growing Russian pharmaceutical market through a strategic partnership with Nanolek to commercialize biologics.</p><p><p>Under the contract, Green Cross will firstly provide finished biologic products exclusively to the Russian pharma company. After it finishes transferring production know-how, it then plans to provide raw materials of the medicines for local production by Nanolek, which will also handle clinical trials, regulatory approvals, production and commercialization.</p><p><p>Green Cross did not disclose the financial terms of the deal nor which specific biologics will be supplied. But the firm told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> that "In the initial stage, Green Cross will ship completed biologics such as vaccines and blood derivatives and biobetters to Nanolek." It has not been decided yet when the first shipments of Green Cross's completed products will start.</p><p><p>Green Cross's main lines include vaccines, plasma derivatives and recombinant proteins, and through the strategic partnership it is aiming to share with the Russian firm its technology and expertise. The South Korean company is also aiming to build a foothold for expansion of its business in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, as well as the wider European market.</p><p><p>"This partnership is a perfect strategic fit for Green Cross's global business model," said Dr E C Huh, president of Green Cross, noting that the firm would share in the longer-term commercial success of Green Cross's products in Russia.</p><p><p>Green Cross is also looking to tap into demand in Russia as the country tries to reduce its dependence on drugs from Europe and other Western countries. "Our project with Green Cross will make socially significant drugs more accessible and minimize the state's financial burden for the procurement of these drugs outside of Russia," said Mikhail Nekrasov, CEO of Nanolek.</p><p><p>"Making possible the domestic production of a number of biopharmaceuticals is our contribution to the implementation of the government policy in developing the Russian pharmaceutical industry."</p><p><p>The Russian government has been actively supporting the sector under the "Pharma 2020" development strategy, the aim of which is for more than 50% of the medicines distributed in Russia to be manufactured by domestic pharma firms.</p><p><p>Currently, some statistics show that imported medicines account for more than 90% of the Russian market, although other estimates put the imported medicine ratio at 75% or more.</p><p><p>Russia's pharmaceutical market is one of the most attractive growth markets in the emerging European region, mainly due to its absolute size along with a rising economy and increasing government investment in healthcare.</p><p><h2>Broader Expansion</h2><p><p>The latest deal is part of Green Cross's ongoing efforts to expand its global presence amid a challenging business at home.</p><p><p>In China, it operates a plant producing plasma derivatives and on 6 March signed a memorandum of understanding with the Guizhou provincial government in China for an investment in the cell therapy sector. Under the MoU, the company will build a production facility in the southwestern Chinese province in order to produce and distribute cell therapy products in the country.</p><p><p>The firm also operates a plasma center in the US and in April last year announced that it would build a new biologics manufacturing facility in Montreal, Canada, as part of efforts to expand its biologics business to North America.</p><p><p>The company anticipates the new plant, for which construction will begin in the first half of 2015 for completion in 2019, will be Canada's only plasma fractionation facility.</p><p><p>As vaccines and blood derivatives currently account for more than 60% of its total sales, Green Cross has been trying to add momentum to its pipeline through biobetters and biosimilars, including a biosimilar version of Roche's breast cancer agent Herceptin (trastuzumab).</p><p><p>Green Cross also has an agreement with Rockville, Maryland-based MacroGenics to develop and sell in South Korea the latter's breast cancer monoclonal antibody MGAH22, a modified biobetter of Herceptin.</p><p><p>In South Korea, Green Cross is currently selling Hunterase (idursulfase), a biobetter of Shire's Elaprase (idursulfase) for Hunter syndrome, the development of which was partially supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p><p><p>Although it is already selling Hunterase in the Middle East and North Africa, Green Cross said it was also planning clinical trials in the US, Europe and China as it shifts away from biosimilars because of the large number of other South Korean companies already in this sector.</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
