<p>The FDA is facing a unique situation in which lawmakers are in the midst of revamping some of the agency's drug and device review and approval processes, while regulators have just launched the latest rounds of industry user fee negotiations, with it all expected to come to a head during the 2016 US presidential and congressional elections.</p><p>That crash of events is the first time such an occurrence has happened, declared Dr Stephen Ostroff, acting commissioner of the FDA, who is trying to brace his agency for the impact.</p><p>Indeed, even though the fifth round of the <i>Prescription Drug User Fee Act</i> (PDUFA) was finalized in 2012 during the last US presidential election &ndash; in which President Barack Obama won a second term &ndash; the process was well underway the year before.</p><p>And while PDUFA V was actually finalized as part of a larger bill &ndash; the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act </i>(FDASIA), which added other programs to the agency's plate, like the breakthrough therapy and qualified infectious disease product designations and the Patient-Focused Drug Development program &ndash; the user fees took center stage, with the other components of legislation coming along for the ride.</p><p>Even then, FDASIA was an FDA bill.</p><p>Now, though, the House and Senate efforts to overhaul the US biomedical enterprise not only affects the FDA, but largely, if not more so, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services having a smaller role in the legislation.</p><p>And even if the House is able to reconcile its bill, the <i>21 Century Cures Act</i>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Cures-aint-law-yet-Senate-concurrence-may-be-tricky-359391" target="_new">passed on 10 July</a>, with the Senate's effort, dubbed Healthier Americans, which is "<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Senate-chance-to-improve-Cures-but-dont-expect-soon-359643" target="_new">just in its infancy</a>," Dr Ostroff anguished over how the FDA will handle implementing the ambitious amount of provisions lawmakers have in mind for the agency without sufficient resources and whether <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PDUFA-VI-launches-Not-Pluto-flyby-but-has-potential-359452" target="_new">PDUFA VI</a> will fill in the funding gaps.</p><p>The acting commissioner said he's been insisting all along that "you can't do these in isolation."</p><p>"You can't have one set of discussions related to user fees and a completely separate set of discussions related to what may show up in these bills unless there's going to be total funding support for what comes out of the bills," Dr Ostroff told the FDA's Science Board during a 29 July meeting.</p><p>"One has to somehow inform the other," he said.</p><p>"It's a bit of a conundrum," Dr Ostroff said, calling the converging events a "very unusual constellation" of occurrences.</p><p>Dr Ostroff noted the difficulty in starting the PDUFA VI process without knowing what may ultimately wind up in the FDA-NIH biomedical legislation.</p><p>PDUFA VI, he said, "clearly will have to wait" until the biomedical bill &ndash; whatever the House and Senate eventually end up calling their combined legislation &ndash; is finalized.</p><p>He noted the House included $550m in the Cures bill. But separate analyses by the FDA and the Congressional Budget Office have put the estimated amount the agency will need to carry out the legislation's provisions at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-1bn-needed-to-cover-Cures-costs-358495" target="_new">around $900m</a>, Dr Ostroff said.</p><p>"We certainly think $500m is considerably better than no additional resources, which was what was in the earliest versions of this," he told the Science Board members. "But some of the things that were in there we'll clearly have to figure out how they get resourced if they end up in the final version of this, because if there aren't resources one way or the other, then it will come at the expense of some of the other things we're currently doing."</p><p>Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, at separate <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NIH-Thanks-for-the-funds-FDA-Wheres-ours-358162" target="_new">House</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Dont-break-whats-working-FDAs-Woodcock-urges-Congress-358096" target="_new">Senate</a> hearings in April warned lawmakers not impose new requirements without providing the funding to do the job. </p><p>Dr Ostroff pointed out the House and Senate currently are in the midst of getting the fiscal year 2016 budget done &ndash; although with lawmakers escaping Washington next week for their month-long summer recess, Congress likely will need to do a short-term continuing resolution by 1 October before finalizing an omnibus budget bill later in the fall.</p><p>He noted the appropriations bills that came out of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-closer-to-gaining-added-funding-is-it-enough-359314" target="_new">House</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Senate-appropriators-advance-FDA-spending-bill-359474" target="_new">Senate</a> committees gave the FDA a slight boost &ndash; pointing out it could have been worse, given the "extremely austere" caps appropriators were held to meet.</p><p>The appropriations bills have "very small increases" for <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-aims-to-shift-power-back-in-antibiotics-favor-356410" target="_new">antimicrobial resistance</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">precision medicine</a> activities, but "not nearly the amounts" the FDA needs to carry out President Obama's initiatives in those areas, the FDA chief said.</p><p>While the Senate bill was "relatively clean" in its language, the House "was not," Dr Ostroff said, noting some worrisome language about wanting to change the so-called "deeming rule" timeline, which will affects tobacco products, with the FDA particularly concerned about the effect on regulating e-cigarettes. </p><p>"We don't know what the future holds for these bills," Dr Ostroff said.</p><p>But one thing he said he'd like to see is more funding to replace or refurbish the FDA's field laboratories and district offices. </p><p>"These are not the spectacular jewels you see here on the White Oak campus" &ndash; the agency's headquarters in Maryland &ndash; Dr Ostroff said. "It's very important that if you want to do first-rate science, you need to have first-rate facilities."</p><p>Those field facilities, he said, are "our frontline and they do important work."</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
