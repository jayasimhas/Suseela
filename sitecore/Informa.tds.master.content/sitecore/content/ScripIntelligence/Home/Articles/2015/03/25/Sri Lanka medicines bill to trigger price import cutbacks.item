<p>Sri Lanka's new National Medicines Regulatory Authority Bill has set out a clutch of rules pertaining to the prescription, pricing and registration of medicines - a move some experts say could bring about significant price cuts and pare the number of brands on the market there.</p><p>The new bill provides for the establishment of a National Medicines Regulatory Authority which would be responsible for the regulation and control of registration, licensing, manufacture, importation and other aspects pertaining to medicines, medical devices and borderline products. Clinical trials conducted in Sri Lanka will also fall under its ambit.</p><p>Borderline products are defined as those that have combined characteristics of medicines and foods, medicines and medical devices or medicines and cosmetics. Imports are said to constitute the bulk of Sri Lanka's estimated $500m pharmaceutical market.</p><p>The new bill, which was recently cleared by Parliament, mandates physicians to write generic names in prescriptions, though a brand name could be mentioned if so required by the medical practitioner. </p><p>The bill, as per details shared by industry, also states that a medical practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon may write "only the brand name" of a medicine in the prescription where the drug prescribed is a "combined medicine" for which the generic name is not available.</p><p>It also assigns pharmacists a pivotal role in dispensing an alternative brand of the same generic drug in case a brand name drug prescribed is unavailable or unaffordable to a customer, subject to the latter's "consent". However, pharmacists who fail to disclose the brands of medicine available in the pharmacy of the generic medicine, and their prices to the customer at the time of sale, would be construed as having committed an offence, details in the bill suggest.</p><p>A health policy expert in Sri Lanka told <i>Scrip</i> that big companies have since appointed "internal committees" on identifying the way forward as "drastic reductions" in brands were likely. He also underscored the need for a "good public communication strategy" to enhance the level of awareness of consumers.</p><p>The expert, though, said that Sri Lanka's ministry of health will have to set up the new authority, which would then need to gazette the regulation. "Until such time it is business as usual," he said.</p><p>Some firms exporting to Sri Lanka, though, suggest that while the new regulation encourages doctors to prescribe generic names of medicine, they probably have the "freedom" to mention brand names as well. </p><p>"We believe branded generics, particularly the leading brands already established in the market, will continue to prevail and enjoy major share," Dr Shawkat Haider, general manager, Bangladesh's Beximco Pharma, told <i>Scrip</i>. Sri Lanka accounts for 10% of Beximco's export sales and the firm's key products there include metered dose inhalers, nasal sprays and infusions. </p><p>On whether the new bill could cut back imports into Sri Lanka sharply and if firms like Beximco may consider local joint venture (JV) manufacturing as an option, Dr Haider said that Sri Lanka remained an important market in South Asia for Beximco and that the firm had gained the trust and confidence of doctors and patients. </p><p>"We have already faced competition and price has gone down over the last few years. In the shorter term, further price erosion may affect those offering conventional me-too generics. But Beximco has a portfolio of specialized niche products where competition is relatively less," the Bangladeshi firm said.</p><p>Dr Haider said that Beximco had been approached by a few Sri Lankan firms for a JV in the country. </p><p>"We are actively reviewing those and if found feasible we may opt for that in the future."</p><p>Last year, Sri Lanka signed a MoU with Bangladesh to procure pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p>The bill also stipulates the setting up of a pricing committee, which the new regulatory authority would consult to determine the "introductory price" of medicines, medical devices and borderline products at the time of registration, based on certain criteria.</p><p>The regulator is expected to consider, among others, factors such as the prevailing market prices of similar products within the same therapeutic class and international reference prices. In the case of NCEs, prices in the "region" and the benefits and the cost effectiveness are to be weighed.</p><p>The bill also mandates the setting up of a Medicines Evaluation Committee (MEC), which is expected to conduct a technical evaluation of products that come up for registration. The benefits and risks attached to such medicines and their quality, efficacy cost, and cost effectiveness in keeping with the national medicines policy would be evaluated.</p><p>E-mails sent to the Sri Lanka Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industry, which represents a clutch of local and foreign firms, on pricing and other issues in the new Bill, remained unanswered till the time of going to press. </p><p>Dr Haider said that Sri Lanka had long regulated pharmaceuticals as part of its health policy and the new rules are expected to impose price controls on essential medicines, besides curtailing the current list to further restrict imports. </p><p>He claimed, though, that most of the essential medicines already face "tremendous" price pressure and such measures should be preceded by "judicious and careful" evaluation. </p><p>Beximco believes that it is important to carefully observe how the regulations impact the healthcare system, particularly in terms of improving access and also checking low cost, sub- standard drugs which may infiltrate the market, if not properly controlled. </p><p>"As Sri Lanka aims to develop and strengthen generic drug capabilities, which is a lengthy process involving tremendous technicalities and issues of compliance, any drastic measures overnight such as excessive control of price and wholesale restriction on imports may put the entire industry in disarray," Dr Haider claimed. </p><h2>Allegations</h2><p>Significantly, the passage of the bill was preceded by dramatic allegations of graft in Parliament by Sri Lanka's president Maithripala Sirisena.</p><p>Reports in the Sri Lankan media said that President Sirisena referred to how a "powerful politician" of the previous regime had been bribed by the pharmaceutical industry to "misplace" the drafted bill pertaining to the national drug policy.</p><p>President Sirisena said that a draft bill he had prepared when he was health minister had gone missing in 2011 with the "blessings of higher-ups" of that regime. </p><p>The Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry, however, sought to distance itself from the issue and reacted sharply against the allegations. The industry body is reported to have said that it has always supported the National Medicines Regulatory Authority as a necessary requirement for the healthcare sector. It has claimed than an NGO has been levelling unfounded allegations against the pharmaceutical industry, creating unnecessary doubts among the public.</p>
