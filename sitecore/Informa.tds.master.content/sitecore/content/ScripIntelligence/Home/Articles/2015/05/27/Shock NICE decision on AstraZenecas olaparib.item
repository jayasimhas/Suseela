<p>In a surprise move, NICE &ndash; the HTA body for England and Wales &ndash; has issued a preliminary decision not to recommend AstraZeneca's PARP inhibitor Lynparza (olaparib), listing a series of worries. The drug was approved in December for women with relapsed, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who have inherited BRCA mutations (BRCAm).</p><p>NICE's appraisal committee cited a number of concerns which contributed to the negative recommendation. These included the fact that the key clinical effectiveness evidence in AstraZeneca's submission came from a subgroup analysis of a Phase II trial (Study 19). "The committee was concerned that this subgroup had been identified post hoc and had a small sample size of 136 patients," said NICE. "Most of the Study 19 trial population had been tested for BRCAm retrospectively rather than before enrolment into the study, because it had not been [the company's] intention to pursue a marketing authorization specifically for the BRCAm population."</p><p>The committee noted that olaparib had demonstrated progression-free survival, but this had "only been assessed at three-monthly intervals in the trial, and therefore it was not possible to determine the exact time at which disease progression occurred." In addition, overall survival data are still immature.</p><p><b>QALY query</b></p><p>The committee also considered the fact that AstraZeneca's cost-effectiveness analysis excluded the costs of testing for a BRCA mutation. It noted that the base-case probabilistic ICER estimated by the company for olaparib compared with routine surveillance was &pound;49,146 per QALY gained. However, the committee considered that this was likely to be an underestimate "because [the company] did not incorporate the cost of tumor testing to identify patients with the non-inherited mutation, and it overestimated the overall survival gain associated with olaparib." </p><p>The list price of olaparib is &pound;3,950 per pack, with each pack containing 448 capsules of 50mg each (equivalent to 28 days' treatment of 16 capsules per day at continuous full dose of treatment). The company has agreed a patient access scheme with the Department of Health. </p><p>AstraZeneca, needless to say, is furious.</p><p>"While NICE recognizes that olaparib represents a significant step forward in the management of these cancers, it has not considered olaparib to be eligible for end-of-life consideration despite 19% and 3% five year survival rates for stage 3 and 4 ovarian cancer, respectively," the company noted in a statement. </p><p>"NICE cited the relative immaturity of the long term survival data that are currently available for olaparib as a reason for the negative recommendation. However, the data from Phase II trials clearly show that olaparib provides an important quality of life benefit to patients by significantly increasing the time it takes for the disease to progress and the time to further chemotherapy cycles. There was an 82% risk reduction in time to progression versus standard 'watch and wait', which is the largest ever effect for this outcome in women with ovarian cancer (11.2 months versus 4.3 months: HR 0.18, p<0.0001). in="" addition,="" around="" a="" quarter="" of="" women="" taking="" olaparib="" had="" not="" relapsed="" after="" two="" years,="" and="" over="" 20%="" were="" still="" being="" treated="" successfully="" after="" three=""></0.0001).></p><p><b>'exquisitely targeted'</b></p><p>Mark O'Connor, senior principal scientist at AstraZeneca's Oncology Innovative Medicines unit, told <i>Scrip</i>: "I was part of the original team in Cambridge that discovered olaparib and was the lead scientist for the eight years leading up to the EMA approval in December. Olaparib is licensed for an exquisitely targeted group of patients with the BRCA mutation who we know will gain the most benefit from treatment. The recent announcements by both the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) and NICE are not only incredibly disappointing for me personally but, more importantly, devastating for the women who are waiting for this treatment." </p><p>He went on: "The UK government has an ambitious life sciences strategy, specifically to use genomic research data to stratify patient populations and produce more targeted therapies &ndash; and yet, despite this, patients in England and Wales are being denied access to olaparib while women in other European countries are already benefiting from treatment."</p><p>In the UK, around 4,000 women die from ovarian cancer each year and survival rates lag behind other European countries. Up to 21% of women with the most aggressive 'serous' form of ovarian cancer have the genetic BRCA mutation. Besides olaparib, the only treatment option for these women at the advanced stage is repeated rounds of systemic chemotherapy. </p><p>"The draft recommendation by NICE sharpens the contrast between the EMA's approach to accelerating access to personalized medicines that have shown clear and demonstrable clinical benefit in patients with life threatening disease and very limited alternative treatment options, and the approach of NICE and the CDF," the company statement continued. "While AstraZeneca supports the government's Accelerated Access to Medicines Review and NHS England's proposals for a more sustainable, reformed CDF, the resulting proposals will not be implemented until next year at the earliest. AstraZeneca is therefore calling on the government to introduce urgent transitional measures as soon as possible to ensure patient access to newly licensed medicines that have been approved on the basis of unprecedented early trial data."</p><p>Lynparza is one of the UK firm's key new anticancer products: AstraZeneca had estimated that the ovarian indication was worth $2bn in peak annual sales, and it is also in Phase III in second-line gastric cancer, BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer and adjuvant and metastatic BRCA-mutated breast cancers. The PARP inhibitor was a key asset in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/How-AstraZenecas-revivified-pipeline-could-boost-Pfizer-351815" target="_new">oncology portfolio</a> coveted in Pfizer's thwarted attempt to buy AstraZeneca last year.</p><p>AstraZeneca also presented data at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) conference in Philadelphia in April suggesting olaparib may also benefit men with prostate cancer.</p><p>In an interview with <i>Scrip</i> not long after Lynparza's launch earlier this year, Menelas Pangalos - executive vice president of innovative medicines and early development at AstraZeneca, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/PROFILE-AstraZenecas-Mene-Pangalos-on-yin-and-yang-not-believing-your-own----press-and-his-part-in-Soriots-vision-356773" target="_new">described</a> the approval of the drug in ovarian cancer as his proudest professional moment. </p><p>The closing date for comments on this preliminary recommendation are 22 June, and the second appraisal committee meeting is on 30 June. </p><p>AstraZeneca says it will work to provide the additional information needed to support a positive final decision.</p><p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Speedy-EU-approval-for-AZs-key-new-anticancer-Lynparza-355737" target="_new">Speedy EU approval for AZ's key new anticancer Lynparza</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-defies-advisers-OKs-AZs-ovarian-cancer-drug-Lynparza-355773" target="_new">FDA defies advisers; OK's AZ's ovarian cancer drug Lynparza</a></p><p><p>
