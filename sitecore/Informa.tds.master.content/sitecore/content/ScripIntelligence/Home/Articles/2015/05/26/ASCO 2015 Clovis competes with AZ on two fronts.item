<p><p>Clovis Oncology could have two blockbusters on its hands, despite competing with AstraZeneca on multiple fronts &ndash; particularly in lung and ovarian cancer. Data the company presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting this weekend reinforces the company's timelines to launch its two lead drugs in as many years. </p><p>Clovis presented data on its next generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor rociletinib (CO-1686) and its oral PARP inhibitor rucaparib &ndash; both of which are in direct competition with drugs from AstraZeneca's portfolio. Yet, analysts believe that even if Clovis could grab a fraction of the market, its drugs could still be blockbusters. In markets this big, there is likely room for multiple entrants with strong data. </p><p>Data from both companies has trickled out over the last couple years &ndash; largely good, but sometimes not meeting investor expectations. Both of these categories have been closely watched and each new incremental piece of data has pitted the big pharma against the small biotech. </p><p>CEO Patrick Mahaffy said in an interview prior to the release of the data on 30 and 31 May that the company's offerings at ASCO this year are "a large update for investors" and offer "a good view of a broad program." Clovis intends to launch both drugs on its own in the US and expects to file rociletinib immediately with a potential launch this fall, said Mahaffy, followed by the filing of rucaparib in the middle of next year. </p><h2>Rociletinib in lung cancer</h2><p>Clovis presented highly anticipated data from the Phase II TIGER-X study of rociletinib in patients with very advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). "This is a population that has had three or four prior treatments and it just reinforces that when you conduct your trials in American patients at universities you are going to get a very advanced lung cancer population," noted Mahaffy. </p><p>Patients in the trial who were T790M-positive had a 60% overall response rate (ORR) with 90% showing disease control. There was a median 8 month progression-free survival rate in the 270 heavily pretreated patients that are T790M-positive. </p><p>Meanwhile, there was a 37% ORR in patients who were T790M-negative. Of those patients that were plasma-genotyped T790M-positive, there was an ORR of 57% and disease control of 80%. </p><p>The trial included 456 patients overall, with 243 being centrally confirmed tissue T790M-positive, 35 being centrally confirmed T790M-negative, and 147 being plasma T790M-positive. </p><p>The most serious adverse events were hyperglycemia &ndash; an issue that the company contends is easily controlled by metformin. The issue was dose-dependent and observed in 17% of patients treated with</p><p>rociletinib 500mg (20/119), 24% of patients treated with the 625mg dose (56/236), 36% of patients treated with the 750mg dose (34/95) and 33% of patients treated with the 1000mg dose (2/6).</p><p>The company determined that, based on the trial results, the ideal dose of rociletinib is the 500mg dose. </p><p>Clovis believes that the drug, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in May 2014, could offer a better alternative with reduced toxicity for first-and second-line NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. </p><p>"We effectively delivered a progression free survival response in a third or fourth line setting that was similar to what you see in a first line setting, which is remarkable given the characteristics of our patients," said the executive. </p><p>Analysts are watching this data closely because a positive response in T790M-negative patients could mean that Clovis will file for approval in both populations, expanding the market for the drug. The market has the potential to be worth $2bn annually for patients positive for the mutation and as high as $6bn for multiple patient populations. </p><h2>AstraZeneca's offering</h2><p>The big pharma presented data from its Phase I expansion cohort of its study of AZD929 in first line patients with EGFR-positive NSCLC. </p><p>Fifty-two of the initial 60 patients enrolled continued onto the expansion phase of the AURA study, which showed that 81% had a progression-free survival at 9 months, with the longest duration of response at the data cutoff being 13.8 months. There was an ORR of 73%. </p><p>"These preliminary data demonstrate the potential of AZD9291 in treatment-na&iuml;ve advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation. These promising results with AZD9291 will be studied further by the ongoing Phase III FLAURA trial in the first-line setting," said Suresh S. Ramalingam, Chief of Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, who was the lead principal investigator for the FLAURA study.</p><h2>Rucaparib in ovarian cancer</h2><p>While Clovis' PARP inhibitor rucaparaib is not as far along in the clinic, the company is hopeful that it could enter the ovarian cancer market in late-2016/early-2017. The drug would be in direct competition to <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-defies-advisers-OKs-AZs-ovarian-cancer-drug-Lynparza-355773" target="_new">AstraZeneca's already-approved</a> Lynparza (olaparib), which gained the FDA greenlight in December for ovarian cancer. Lynparza is indicated as a monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.</p><p>After an advisory committee meeting and the approval of Lynparza, which set the regulatory tone for the space, Clovis added another 300 patients to its mid-stage ARIEL2 study and has converted the trial to a registrational study. Rucaparib is the only PARP inhibitor with FDA's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Clovis-ovarian-cancer-drug-rucaparib-dubbed-breakthrough-357685" target="_new">Breakthrough Therapy</a> Designation. </p><p>Clovis presented data from ARIEL2, a Phase II study in platinum-sensitive BRCA-mutant and BRCA-like patients, which the company says is about 60% of the patient population. </p><p>The overall response rate in BRCA-mutant was 82%, with a disease control rate of 94% and a median progression-free survival of 9.4 months. </p><p>Results from Study 10, a Phase 2 study of heavily pretreated germline BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer</p><p>Patients that was also presented at ASCO, demonstrated an ORR of 74% with a median duration of response of 11 months. </p><p><p>
