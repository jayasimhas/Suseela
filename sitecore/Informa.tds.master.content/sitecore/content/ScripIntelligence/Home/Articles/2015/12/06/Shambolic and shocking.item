<p>"Shambolic and shocking" was how the pharma industry's self-policing body in the UK described Sanofi's procedures for dealing with patient organizations in a recent case report. It said the company's "long-term systemic failure across the entire Sanofi business regarding multiple payments to multiple patient organizations" was "a very serious matter". </p><p>So how did the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority, the arm's-length organization that polices the ABPI's voluntary code, punish Sanofi for its long-term, extensive and systemic failures in managing and reporting its financial and other interactions with patient groups? In time-honored fashion, with a "public reprimand" and "advertisements in the medical, pharmaceutical and nursing press". </p><p>The public reprimand takes the form of a front page mention in the PMCPA's <a href="http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/cases/Code%20of%20Practice%20Reviews/2015%20May%20Review.pdf" target="_new">Code of Practice Review</a>. While locally embarrassing, this is not exactly a high-profile way to be shamed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sanofi has been named first out of nine big pharma firms for corporate reputation in a PatientView survey of 73 UK patient groups.</p><p>In further analysis the survey found that among the ways in which Sanofi was perceived to have performed well was its increased "commitment to working with patient organizations across Europe during 2014". Interesting.</p><p>It should be noted that Sanofi was not playing in the premier league of corporate reputation. Only 17% of the patient groups surveyed thought the pharma industry overall was "excellent" or "good" at acting with integrity (compared with 29% in a global survey of 1,150 patient groups), while only 14.3% of UK patient groups thought industry was "excellent" or "good" at pricing its products fairly. (These scores fell well short of the 72.9% and 67% rates of "excellent" or "good" for, respectively, innovation and high-quality, useful products.)</p><p>This week the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences launched a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Lack-of-trust-in-medicines-prompts-UK-review-358978http:/www.acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/evaluating-evidence-launch/" target="_new">review</a> of the evaluation of evidence on medicines. England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies requested the review because of her concern about a commonly held view that doctors and scientists cannot be trusted and are compromised by industry.</p><p>That public perception is probably not enhanced by the presence of a guard dog that barks only softly and can't or won't bite when pharma behaves unscrupulously.</p>
