<p>An Indian court did not hold back the launch of Biocon's biosimilar version of Roche's Herceptin (trastuzumab) for two additional indications - early breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer - but had some tough words against the Bengaluru-based firm on its apparent "conduct" in obtaining regulatory approval of the carton, labels and the package insert.</p><p>The hotly contested case in the Delhi High Court between plaintiff Roche on one side and partners Biocon and Mylan and the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on the other, saw a string of allegations and counter-allegations from both sides, including Biocon's reference to Roche attempts to act as a "super regulator."</p><p>Biocon received Indian regulatory approval for the additional indications for its biosimilar trastuzumab in March 2015 and approval for the carton, labels and package insert on July. 28. </p><p>"Pertaining to approval already granted in March 2015 for launch of two additional indications, as already mentioned, the same be launched and the court is not inclined to pass interim order at this stage. However, the objections of the plaintiffs and submissions of the defendants would be considered and decided on merit in the pending interim applications," Judge Manmohan Singh said in an order dated Aug. 13.</p><p>The court, though, said that the approval of carton, labels and package insert was granted "contrary" to a previous interim order. </p><p>"Once the court finds that the order has not been complied by the party whose hands are unclean, no benefit of equity goes in favour of that party. The conduct of defendant No 2 [Biocon] in obtaining the approval of carton, labels and purchase of insert was in improper way and contrary to the interim order already operating," the order said.</p><p>With respect to the package insert, the court said that the reproduction of data for information to public - doctors and patients - cannot be allowed and that an "interim order is being passed in this respect till the disposal of pending interim applications."</p><p>It, though, clarified that Biocon would during the period be entitled to "use different data" in the package insert which shall not be contrary to the interim orders already granted against the defendants after obtaining the approval.</p><p>Judge Singh also frowned upon the fact that "none of the defendants" had informed the court that Biocon had applied for approval of two additional indications before the regulator despite discussions of the two indications "many times during the hearing of the applications."</p><p>Roche told <i>Scrip</i> that it cannot comment on the case "due to legal reasons", while Biocon did not immediately comment on the court order.</p><h2>Roche's Arguments</h2><p>Roche contended that the approval and launch of Biocon's biosimilar (marketed as Canmab) for additional indications is in violation of previous interim orders. It pointed out that the Indian firm does not have any independent data for seeking approval for additional indications. </p><p>The approval and proposed launch for additional indications violates the injunction and was granted by relying and using Roche's data and proposed to be used on the new package insert, it argued. In a hearing last year Roche alleged that the package insert of the biosimilar version was a "slavish copy" of its package insert.</p><p>The Delhi High Court, in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Mylan-confident-on-biosim-Herceptin-in-India-despite-Roche-tactics-349941" target="_new">interim order</a> dated Feb. 5, 2014, restrained both Biocon and partner Mylan from "relying upon or otherwise referring to" Roche's Herceptin and its second brands Herclon or Biceltis, or any data relating to trastuzumab marketed as the three brands cited. This included data relating to its manufacturing process, safety, efficacy and sales in any press releases, public announcements, promotional or other material and from claiming any similarity with the three brands. </p><p>Roche's counsel argued that testing for the additional indications is mandatory under applicable law and in the absence of such tests, the launch of the biosimilar for the additional indications is "illegal and against public health and safety."</p><p>Roche also alleged that the Indian firm pursued applications for approval of the additional indications during the pendency of the suit, while "deliberately not disclosing these facts" before the court and "delaying a determination of the present proceedings."</p><p>It also underscored that Biocon and Mylan have themselves claimed to be conducting clinical trials globally for early breast cancer and gastric cancer, and therefore data relating to metastatic breast cancer cannot be extrapolated for the two indications outside India. </p><p>"If such trials are required to be conducted outside India for regulatory approvals, a similar standard should be applied by the defendants for obtaining and granting approvals in India," Roche argued.</p><p>Roche further pointed out that as per paragraph 10.7 of the WHO Guidelines, immunogenicity data in immunosuppressed patients (metastatic breast cancer) would not allow extrapolation to an indication in which patients are not immunosuppressed (early breast cancer). </p><p>"Extrapolation of the clinical data relating to one therapeutic indication to another is not automatic. It must be therapeutically justified with safety and quality data."</p><h2>Biocon's Views</h2><p>Biocon, however, argued that the approval of the two additional indications was granted as per "due procedure" under the India's drugs regulations. </p><p>The Indian firm said that as per the Guidelines on Similar Biologics issued by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), it has met all the conditions for extrapolation, i.e. safety and efficacy data from the metastatic breast cancer indication (for which Phase 3 clinical studies were conducted) to the additional clinical indications. </p><p>It also underscored that it has been granted approval for additional indications after obtaining the requisite clearances from the expert bodies/the drugs regulator that have followed an "extensive approval process" in strict compliance of law and that Roche ought not to be permitted to act as a "super regulator."</p><p>Among a string of other arguments, Biocon also said that the indications as sought to be approved by it are not beyond the already approved indications for which Roche's drug/reference drug has already been approved. The practice is also internationally accepted, it added. </p><p>Biocon had in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Fresh-twists-and-turns-in-Indian-Herceptin-biosimilars-case-359680" target="_new">previous hearing</a> also alleged that despite a previous order, Roche had "communicated" with the DCGI, "misleading" it and asked the regulator not to grant the approval of the carton, labels and package insert. </p>
