<p>The FDA on 24 July gave Amgen and its subsidiary Onyx Pharmaceuticals the go-ahead to market Kyprolis (carfilzomib) in combination with Celgene's Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd) to treat patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy.</p><p>Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer, affecting about 96,000 people currently in the US, with more than 24,000 new cases diagnosed annually.</p><p>The disease killed more than 11,090 last year.</p><p>Kyprolis previously had gained an accelerated approval in the US as a single agent to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent, and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. </p><p>The FDA granted the expanded use for Kyprolis based on data from Amgen's ASPIRE study, which demonstrated that patients treated in the KRd arm lived 50% longer, or 8.7 months, without their disease worsening, versus patients treated with Revlimid and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) alone. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 26.3 months in the KRd arm, versus 17.6 months in the Rd arm. </p><p>The most common adverse events in the Kyprolis arm were pneumonia, myocardial infarction and upper respiratory tract infection.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
