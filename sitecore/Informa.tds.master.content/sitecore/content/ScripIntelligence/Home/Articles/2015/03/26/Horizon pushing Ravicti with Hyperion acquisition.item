<p><p>Horizon Pharma has a strong plan in place to improve the market share of its latest orphan disease product now that it has acquired Hyperion Therapeutics for $1.1bn. The deal fits squarely into the company's strategy and satisfies rumors that Hyperion was going to be acquired. </p><p>"As we've discussed before, our business development strategy consists of five key components, each of which were met with the Hyperion transaction. US marketed products and/or companies leveraging our core commercial strengths in primary care, orphan or specialty diseases, products with differentiated clinical benefits and long proprietary lives, products with annual net sales of $20 million to $200 million, and transactions that are immediately accretive to our earnings," said Horizon Chairman, President and CEO Tim Walbert in a 30 March call with investors.</p><p>The Dublin-based rare disease drugmaker <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Horizon-Pharma-swoops-in-on-Hyperion-357569" target="_new">announced 30 March</a> that it is acquiring Hyperion for $46 per share in an effort to gain its two treatments for urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which affect around 2,100 people in the US, with approximately 1,100 diagnosed. </p><p>While a liver transplant is the only cure for the diseases, Ravicti (glycerol phenylbutyrate), approved by the FDA in February 2013 to treat seven of the eight UCDs, is used as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of UCDs for patients greater than two years of age who cannot manage their treatment by dietary protein restrictions and or amino acid supplementation alone. It is a tasteless, odorless oral liquid taken three times daily. </p><p>Meanwhile, Buphenyl is a branded generic of sodium phenylbutyrate which is approved for three of the eight UCD subtypes which Hyperion acquired as part of its strategy to penetrate this market more fully. It is available in tablet or powder form. </p><p>Sodium phenylbutyrate has its share of poor side effects and can be somewhat cumbersome to patients &ndash; 20 to 40 pills have to be taken daily and the drug often gives patients an offensive body odor. The high sodium content in the pills also requires patients to restrict sodium in other areas of their diet. </p><p>Horizon admits that Hyperion has put a strong effort behind the launch of Ravicti and intends to work to expand the market. Ravicti launched in March 2013 and had sales of $94.4m in 2014. Currently, Ravicti commands about 30% of the market share of the ultra-orphan disease set. </p><p>"Hyperion has done a great job of educating the patient and physician community on the clinical benefits and improved control for patients on Ravicti versus Buphenyl. Among our key priorities as we incorporate both these products into our commercial portfolio will be to further expand on Hyperion's efforts to transition Buphenyl patients to Ravicti, as well as driving patient outreach to those who have been diagnosed with UCDs but are yet untreated," said Walbert.</p><p>Walbert noted that Hyperion acquired the older branded generic as part of a strategy to further penetrate the UCD market and now research shows that physicians would prefer Ravicti over Buphenyl due to the more favorable side effect profile, as well as the more convenient dosing. </p><p>"In addition, we will leverage our current orphan disease infrastructure to enhance the market penetration of RAVICTI. Our priorities will include increasing direct-to-patient communications, providing significant physician education in support of the benefits of Ravicti over Buphenyl, and drive increased diagnosis, and particularly expanding newborn screening for UCDs," added the exec. </p><p>In that vein, Ravicti is also being developed in other patient populations &ndash; there are currently clinical trials ongoing in children under two years of age, as well as babies younger than two months old. A supplemental NDA filing is expected in the second quarter 2016 for patients two months to two years of age, and year-end 2017 for patients less than two months of age.</p><p>"These patient age groups are important for the marketing purposes and we believe can expand Ravicti uptake. Patients today are often diagnosed at these ages and are prescribed Buphenyl, leading to the challenge of now requiring them to be switched over to Ravicti upon reaching two years of age," said Walbert. </p><p>The EU approval application has been delayed by a request for data in patients as young as two months of age. Responses to CHMP are due in late April of this year. "We expect a decision from CHMP in Europe late this year or early 2016." Late-stage label negotiations are ongoing in Canada, with marketing approval expected in the second half of 2015.</p><p><p><p>
