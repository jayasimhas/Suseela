<p>The Australian government is seeking feedback on a biosimilar awareness initiative for health professionals and consumers that will benefit from A$20m ($14.5m) in funding over the 2015-2018 period. </p><p>The project, which is aimed at securing the confidence of stakeholders in biosimilar medicines, will highlight their safety, quality and efficacy as well as their potential for achieving savings on the medicines bill and freeing up funds to pay for innovative new drugs. It will also aim to prevent what the government calls "misinformation" about biosimilars.</p><p>It has just kicked off with the publication of an implementation framework on which stakeholders are being asked to comment by Oct. 26. Any feedback will be used to inform the longer-term development and implementation of the awareness project, and will also be provided to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), which decides whether drugs should be funded through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). </p><p>Noting that the project is part of the PBS Access and Sustainability Package <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Australian-medicines-access-package-includes-biosimilar-substitution-price-cuts-358612" target="_new">announced in May</a> this year, the government said: "Engagement with stakeholders is critical to the success of the initiative, to ensure that messages are accurate and consistent and that key issues are addressed through the project." </p><p>The Department of Health (DoH) said the initiative would require a collaborative effort involving the department, healthcare professionals, consumer groups and industry, including work with the Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (GMBA; formerly the Generic Medicines Industry Association). </p><h2>Rationale </h2><p>Explaining the reasoning behind the project, the DoH said that while biosimilars offered the opportunity to increase patient access to biological medicines and to achieve lower prices for the PBS, the "unique nature and (current) small volume" of biosimilars "means they are not always well understood."</p><p>It noted that in July this year, the PBAC held a consumer hearing on biosimilars where there appeared to be some misunderstandings about biosimilars and biosimilar substitution. "Anecdotal evidence also suggests that there are varying levels of understanding about biosimilars amongst prescribers, pharmacists and patients," it said.</p><p>Communication activities under the awareness initiative will cover questions such as the nature of biosimilars, their comparable quality and safety profile in relation to the reference drug, their cost-saving potential, the creation of headroom to fund innovative drugs, and the "a"-flagging of biosimilars for the purposes of pharmacy substitution (including the ability of prescribers to prevent substitution).</p><p>Key issues identified to date include: </p><ul><li>improving overall awareness of the PBS and the future potential of biosimilar medicines;</li><li>supporting patient choice by improving understanding of biosimilars by patients and their families;</li><li>providing education to help healthcare professionals meet their patients' clinical and information needs with regard to both prescribing and dispensing biosimilars; and </li><li>meeting the communication and information needs of stakeholders, including the PBAC, when a particular biosimilar is being considered or recommended for listing on the PBS, especially where brand substitution may apply.</li></ul><p>Communications activities this year will focus on providing information on a case-by-case basis to support understanding of any biosimilar medicines recommended for listing on the PBS. After the consultation period, a broader project will be implemented over the three-years to establish the needs of key groups and provide targeted information to support those needs. "This will require more time to implement," the DoH notes.</p><p>
