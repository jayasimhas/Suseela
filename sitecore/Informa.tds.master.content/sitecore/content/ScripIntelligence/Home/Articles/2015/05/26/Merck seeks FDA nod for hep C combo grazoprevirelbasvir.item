<p>After some back-and-forth with the FDA over the status of the breakthrough therapy designation of Merck's experimental hepatitis C virus (HCV) combination drug grazoprevir/elbasvir (100mg/50mg) &ndash; which was eventually tweaked &ndash; the company is now seeking approval of the product in the US, announcing after the markets closed on 28 May it had submitted a new drug application (NDA).</p><p>Merck is asking the FDA to approve the once-daily single tablet of grazoprevir, an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and elbasvir, an NS5A replication complex inhibitor, to treat HCV patients with genotypes (GT) 1, 4 or 6 infection. </p><p>The grazoprevir/elbasvir NDA is based in part on data from Merck's pivotal C-EDGE clinical program and its C-SURFER and C-SALVAGE trials, which evaluated the combination drug, with or without ribavirin, in patients with chronic HCV. </p><p>The FDA had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Merck-HCV-NS34A-NS5A-combo-gains-FDA-breakthrough-status-347566" target="_new">granted BTD status</a> to grazoprevir/elbasvir in October 2013.</p><p>The designation was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/All-too-easy-Obama-signs-US-FDA-user-fee-bill-without-fanfare-332602" target="_new">created</a> in 2012 under the <i>Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act</i> to help expedite the regulatory process.</p><p>But on 4 February, Merck revealed the FDA had notified the company in late January that regulators <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Healthy-HCV-market-kills-Mercks-breakthrough-status-356534" target="_new">planed to rescind</a> the designation, citing the availability of other recently approved treatments for GT1 patients &ndash; likely Gilead Sciences' <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-combo-HCV-drug-OKd-price-dents-shares-354407" target="_new">Harvoni</a> (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) and AbbVie's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Viekira-OKd-AbbVie-prices-under-Gileads-Harvoni-355775" target="_new">Viekira Pak</a> (paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir).</p><p>The FDA, however, reversed course in April, declaring that rather than rescinding the BTD for grazoprevir/elbasvir, regulators were <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-replaces-rather-than-rescinds-Mercks-HCV-breakthrough-status-357726" target="_new">replacing</a> it for a more focused indication: HCV GT1 in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.</p><p>The agency also granted a second BTD for the combination drug as a treatment for patients infected with chronic HCV GT4. </p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb had gone through a somewhat <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-latest-target-for-breakthrough-status-loss-356576" target="_new">similar process</a> with the FDA, although that firm eventually lost two of the three BTD's granted last year for its daclatasvir-based HCV drug regimens.</p><p>But the FDA ended up <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-amends-rather-than-rescinds-BMS-HCV-breakthrough-358529" target="_new">amending</a> the third BTD for BMS, reflecting the data from the firm's Phase III ALLY-1 trial evaluating a 12-week regimen of daclatasvir plus Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), granting the status instead for HCV GT-1 patients with advanced cirrhosis and those who develop GT-1 HCV recurrence post-liver transplant.</p><p>Shares of Merck closed at $60.89, up $1.19, or about 2%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
