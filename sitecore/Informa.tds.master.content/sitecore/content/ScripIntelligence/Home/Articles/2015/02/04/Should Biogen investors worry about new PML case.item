<p><p>Biogen's blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) could be under closer scrutiny now that another case of a deadly brain disease has been revealed by the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> on 08 April. </p><p>The letter written by doctors from the University Medical Center Utrecht and the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, both in the Netherlands, representing the PML in Dutch MS Patients Consortium revealed a case of treatment-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in a 64-year-old woman without severe lymphocytopenia that was being treated with compounded dimethyl fumarate.</p><p>PML has been known to crop up in patients taking certain MS drugs long-term &ndash; Biogen's Tysabri (natalizumab) has had a long-running problem with the issue &ndash; but drugmakers have learned to screen patients better for certain signs that could indicate whether they will develop the fatal brain condition. Tysabri, for example, has a companion diagnostic that tests patients for the presence of JVC antibodies &ndash; those that are negative are less likely to develop PML. The creation of the test has led to fewer cases of PML for Tysabri patients and has bolstered sales of the drug &ndash; Tysabri brought in $1.9bn for Biogen in 2014. </p><p>So far there have been few incidences of PML in patients taking Biogen's new MS drug Tecfidera &ndash; which had one of the most successful drug launches in recent history. Approved in May 2013, the drug is already a blockbuster; Tecfidera <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tecfidera-pushes-Biogen-revenue-40-higher-in-2014-356453" target="_new">brought in</a> $2.9bn in 2014, its first full year on the market. The first case of PML in a Tecfidera patient showed up in October 2014 and the patient had severe lymphocytopenia, a condition that results in extremely low levels of white blood cells in the blood. It was believed that only patients with severe lymphocytopenia could develop PML. The <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Biogens-Tecfidera-US-labeling-revised-to-reflect-PML-death-355263" target="_new">drug's label was revised</a> to reflect the PML death. </p><p>The case of PML revealed in the <i>NEJM</i> article 08 April was not in a patient taking Tecfidera, but who was being treated with its active ingredient &ndash; dimethyl fumarate (DMF) &ndash; for psoriasis. The PML case was diagnosed on 18 July, 2014 and the patient died on 26 August. The patient had been taking the drug since June 2012 and had tested negative for the JCV antibodies; tests done after her death showed she was positive for JCV. </p><p>"To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of compounded DMF&ndash;associated PML in a patient without severe lymphocytopenia, a situation that was previously thought to be unlikely. Since the number of patients who are being treated with DMF is rapidly increasing after approval of delayed-release DMF (Tecfidera) as first-line treatment for relapsing&ndash;remitting multiple sclerosis, our case raises important questions with respect to safety monitoring," wrote the authors of the letter. </p><p>Analysts are trying not to read too much into the news &ndash; Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum showed concern, but ultimately believes it's a non-issue. "The issue raised by this case is that if PML can occur in patients taking DMF without severe lymphocytopenia, then PML cases may be less predictable and/or occur even with mild lymphocytopenia in certain cases. However, at the end of the day PML rates for patients taking Tecfidera continue to appear very, very low as BIIB has reported that over 135,000 MS patients have been treated with Tecfidera globally since launch, and there has only one case of PML in a patient with prolonged severe lymphocytopenia," he wrote in an 09 April alert to investors. He further noted that it was not "an apples to apples" comparison. </p><p><p><p>
