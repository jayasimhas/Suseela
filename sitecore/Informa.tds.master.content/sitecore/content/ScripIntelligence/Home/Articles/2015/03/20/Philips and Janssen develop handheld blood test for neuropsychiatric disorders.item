<p>Janssen is teaming up with Philips to develop a handheld blood test that the firms say will improve the care of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p>Philips will be responsible for the development and manufacturing of the handheld test, which will be based on its Minicare I-20 system, currently in development. Janssen will be responsible for the clinical studies to validate the test, as well as the commercialization of the final product.</p><p>Philips' Minicare I-20 is an immunoassay-based system that consists of a handheld analyzer, dedicated software and a single use, disposable cartridge containing the application-specific test. The device is being developed to detect multiple target molecules at low concentrations within the same blood sample and to show the results on the analyzer display within minutes. </p><p>The firm did not say what biomarker(s) the project would be looking at, or even what disease was involved. "[The test] is designed to detect certain target molecules in the blood of patients with a specific neuropsychiatric disorder. The goal is to provide doctors with an additional source of real-time, relevant information that they can use to enhance the care of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders." The company has products and research projects in such neurological disorders as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's. </p><p> Philips told <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>Clinica</i> that it was not releasing more information "in part for competitive reasons and in part given the early stage of the development process. However, we can say that this is multi-year collaboration and both sides have a strong vested interest in this collaboration."</p><p>It also declined to say when the device might be approved, merely adding: "Philips and Janssen have developed an ambitious development schedule for this complex undertaking."</p><p>
