<p>With the world experiencing three major health crises in the past decade &ndash; severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1 pandemic influenza and Ebola &ndash; and the potential for other emerging diseases to turn into an epidemic, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), there's a critical need for the rapid evaluation of experimental therapies, US officials said, laying out their argument in an Aug. 5 <i>Perspectives </i>article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>. </p><p>"The serious impact of these emergencies and the lack of effective therapies warrant moving forward with clinical testing as soon as possible," said Drs. Nicole Lurie, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the FDA's Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products, and Luciana Borio, the agency's chief scientist.</p><p>"Public health leaders need to take action before the next new threatening infectious disease emerges," the US officials said. </p><p>They insisted that one high-priority action that needs to be addressed is the development and prepositioning of "scientifically sound" and "widely accepted" protocols by global public health authorities, so they can be ready for use at the onset of a deadly outbreak "wherever it strikes." </p><p>The experience over the past year with Ebola in West Africa indicated the "usual phased development approach" could be sped up and shortened on the basis of what's known about a drug candidate, the severity and acuteness of the disease and the limited window of opportunity for studying an investigational medicine, they contended. </p><p>In emergency situations, the officials argued it may be "appropriate to accept greater-than-usual degrees of uncertainty and risk in order to move rapidly to clinical trials, with the goal of getting safe, effective therapies to patients sooner."</p><p>They proposed that a common protocol in which multiple therapies &ndash; even those at very early stages of development &ndash; are simultaneously evaluated against a shared control group in an adaptive randomized trial, could serve as a model for rapidly evaluating promising, but unproven, therapies for the current MERS-CoV outbreak and potential future epidemics.</p><p>Under the design, the shared control group is initially given the best available supportive care until a therapy is identified that improves outcomes.</p><p>Once an experimental medicine is found to be effective against the disease, it's incorporated into the supportive care all trial patients are receiving and the study may continue to evaluate the added benefit of the other investigational drugs, the US officials explained.</p><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) earlier this year launched a trial using that protocol to test experimental therapies against the Ebola virus. </p><p>The first drug being evaluated in the NIH study is Mapp Biopharmaceuticals' three-drug monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapps-moment-of-truth-efficacy-trial-starts-356995" target="_new">ZMapp</a>, which entered the public spotlight last year when it was used in humans for the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tiny-biotech-Mapps-Ebola-drug-thrust-into-spotlight-353192" target="_new">first time</a> to treat two Ebola-infected American aid workers, Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebold, who were volunteering in Liberia when they contracted the disease.</p><p>The drug also was used in other patients, although not always with successful outcomes.</p><p>Last summer, the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-gambles-24.9m-to-speed-Ebola-drug-ZMapp-353682" target="_new">awarded</a> Mapp $24.9m to speed the development of ZMapp. The contract ultimately could be worth $42.3m for the tiny San Diego-based biotech.</p><p>If ZMapp is proven effective in the NIH trial, it will be incorporated in the control group against which other therapies are tested, the US officials noted.</p><p>Drs. Lurie, Cox and Borio argued the NIH study protocol is "very efficient" because it includes frequent pre-specified interim evaluations of the accruing data, employing Bayesian analytic techniques, to identify a winner or a harmful product as early as possible. </p><p>They also insisted it could allow earlier clinical testing of investigational drugs to accelerate identification of safe, effective therapies, thereby making them available to patients sooner, the US officials said.</p><p>But they also acknowledged using such a protocol requires close cooperation among researchers, drug developers and public health and regulatory authorities globally.</p><p>The US officials pointed out that work is needed to augment global clinical trial infrastructure, streamline processes for careful ethical review of multisite international studies and establish model agreements for managing data and addressing intellectual property issues. </p><p>If the world is going to act on the lessons learned from crises like the Ebola epidemic, "there is no time to waste in getting this work done," they said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
