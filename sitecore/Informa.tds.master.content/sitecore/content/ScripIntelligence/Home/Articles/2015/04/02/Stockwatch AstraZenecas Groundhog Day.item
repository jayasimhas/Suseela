<p>The Groundhog Day ritual which took place in Philadelphia last week predicted another six weeks of winter. Had Punxsutawney Phil surveyed the public markets for life sciences on his way out of his burrow, he would have seen even more signs of a potential prolonged freeze ahead for some companies.</p><p><p>There was no let-up in the icy wind of currency translations that continues to whistle through this earnings season (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-The-devil-in-the-currency-detail-356502" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 2 February 2015</a>). Roche affiliate Chugai reported full-year 2014 financial results that met analysts' consensus estimates and beat its own typically conservative guidance. As Chugai buys its drugs from Roche in (now expensive) Swiss francs, its earnings guidance for 2015 was lower than consensus estimates. Merck & Co reported sales that were in-line with analyst estimates and earnings that were either in-line, or 1% ahead of estimates depending on whether you were of the GAAP or non-GAAP persuasion, respectively (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Q4-EARNINGS-Merck-pushes-pipeline-as-competition-currency-hit-revenue-356549" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 February 2015</a>). Not surprisingly, Merck's 2015 guidance was below consensus expectations largely because of currency headwinds. </p><p>If that was as bad as the earnings week got, then we probably wouldn't be staring down the barrel of an extended winter. However, big pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies added their own company-specific salt into the wounds of foreign exchange pressures. Perhaps the biggest shock was not that Gilead Sciences exceeded consensus sales and earnings estimates, although with the change-over from Sovaldi (sofosbuvir)-based regimens to Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, I at least had not been expecting Gilead's fourth-quarter results to be so good. No, it was Gilead's 2015 expectation of gross-to-net discounts of up to 46% on the list prices for its HCV franchise that took everyone by surprise (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Gilead-sales-soar-but-investors-sour-on-HCV-drug-discounts-356529" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 February 2015</a>). It was not pleasant for holders of Gilead or AbbVie when the markets opened the next day. However, I was able to find at least a couple of crumbs of comfort to tide me through mid-winter.</p><p><p>Firstly, I would hope that AbbVie has now recognized that its initiation of a pricing war in highly active HCV antivirals was a momentous commercial error. Not only is AbbVie's product slightly less active and inferior in terms of compliance to Gilead's, but also AbbVie has seen its share price and market share plunge lower than Gilead's (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-2015---Year-of-the-Grinch-355920" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 January 2015</a>). As a result, other than the patients covered by Express Scripts' National Formulary agreement, almost every other US HCV-infected patient can get the best product (Harvoni) at an average 46% discount on the manufacturer's selling price (MSP). At least, the patients' pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) will get the discount on Harvoni. The patients' co-payment or their employers' health insurance premiums seem unlikely to benefit as there has been more than a hint from some PBMs that their financial results will be flattered as a result of this discounting. </p><p><p>Secondly, Gilead's average discount to MSP does not mean that this month's MSP is set in stone. These days, quarterly price increases for branded pharmaceuticals are as regular as the tides. While the current discounts to MSP may be contractual, they probably now have less than a year before expiry. So if discounts narrow and MSPs rise, many would expect the substitution of Gilead's Harvoni by AbbVie's Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir). However, by that time, physicians and their patients will have come to appreciate the most active compound that encourages the greatest compliance, and a substitution with the cheaper Viekira Pak so that the PBM can pocket the difference in price may be much less palatable.</p><p><p>While the market has spoken on the short-term effects of these pricing wars on the share prices of Gilead and AbbVie, it has likewise judged HCV wannabes Achillion, Enanta Pharmaceuticals and Merck as being so late to the party that they may as well not have bothered to come at all. To add insult to injury the FDA made a similar judgement by revoking Breakthrough Designation status for Merck's and Bristol-Myers Squibb's HCV antiviral combinations still in phase III (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BMS-latest-target-for-breakthrough-status-loss-356576" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 February 2015</a>).</p><p><p>Gilead's challenges in discounting may be compensated for by market share and at least they have come about as a result of launching new products &ndash; just the sort of operational excellence we demand from growing companies. Contrast these challenges to those faced by AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi, which all reported various shades of dismal results last week, although two of the three managed to divert attention away from their inability to launch and sell new products with one-off non-operational sweeteners. I found myself agreeing with the "kitchen-sink" description of AstraZeneca's results by the analysts at Citigroup, and the analysts from Danske Bank who downgraded them to a 'Sell' (<a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AstraZeneca-will-behave-like-a-biotech-in-2015-says-Soriot-356571" target="_new">scripintelligence,com, 5 February 2015</a>). Whereas Gilead may have just passed the shortest day of its winter of commercialization, AstraZeneca, like Punxsutawney Phil, will see its winter going on for a long time yet.</p><p><p>The Magna BioPharma Income fund holdings include Chugai, Merck, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
