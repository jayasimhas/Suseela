<p>Unlike the temporary blips of the last year when pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Corp. went to war with Gilead Sciences, Inc. on drug pricing, or Federal Reserve chair Yellen warned on the frothy valuations of early-stage biotech companies, this time it is different. Firstly it has lasted longer than previous pull-backs, secondly, like the stock market retrenchment that followed the tragedies of September 11 2001, there is no direct connection with life science stocks, and thirdly, the supposedly unrelated initiating factor &ndash; China's slowing economic growth and the bursting of its stock market bubble &ndash; was in temporary remission on Thursday and Friday last week but life science stocks still traded off on both days. This time I am afraid that the market means it and as generalists continue to rotate out of life sciences, there are reasons to believe that bigger is going to be better as the investors who are left focus on tangible investment attributes for a change.</p><p><p>One of the reasons that many observers gave for the three-year bull market in biotech stocks was the increasing number of drugs that the FDA has been approving each year. While that is true, I am starting to sense a renewed differentiation between the FDA approvals of tiny non-viable biotech products, and those of future blockbuster products at much bigger companies. Last week, the shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. fell by more than 10% on the day the analysts from Citibank initiated coverage with a 'Sell' recommendation. With sales last quarter of a pitiful $1.4m, Keryx disproves the naive assumption that an FDA approved drug can only bring stock price success. Contrast Keryx's failure with the successes of recently approved drugs at much bigger companies like Gilead Sciences with its <i>Sovaldi</i> (sofosbuvir)-based regimens for the treatment of HCV infection and the anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies from Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) Co. While there are smaller biotech companies still trying to develop drugs against HCV and PD1, bigger companies have gotten there first and the share price <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/JandJ-banks-on-Achillion-for-leg-up-in-next-generation-hep-C-drug-race-358518" target="_new">disappointment that accompanied Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s licensing</a> of its anti-HCV NS5A inhibitor to Johnson & Johnson probably reflects Achillion's position as an also-ran in the HCV pecking order against Gilead; small and now insignificant. What both companies have in common is that the share prices of Gilead and Achillion were both volatile last week &ndash; but Achillion is now down 37% year to date whilst Gilead is still 8% above water for the year.</p><p><p>One of the hottest areas for investors in the last nine months has been the rise of the engineered T-cell therapy companies like Kite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Juno Therapeutics, Inc. As interesting but early the data are on these companies' experimental therapies, I was struck how possibly premature the companies were when after their IPOs they <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Versant-raises-305m-venture-fund-plus-deal-notes-from-PfizeriTeos-JunoOpus-CHIBayBio-355559" target="_new">announced 'exclusive' licenses with the NIH or other companies</a> on intellectual property which made me wonder how they managed to IPO with such an incomplete investment proposition. But investors do not need to invest in Kite or Juno, whose share prices are down over 6% and 31% year to date, respectively, to have exposure to the latest developments in CAR-T. As the analysts from Citibank wrote last week, the CART-19 therapy from Novartis AG (whose share price is still up over 2% year to date) has shown what appears to be a functional cure in some of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated.</p><p><p>There is at least one area that not just plays to the defensive characteristics of life science investing, but also comes bang up to date with one of the sector's biggest challenges &ndash; drug pricing and reimbursement. This is biosimilars. Smaller companies have tried their hand at biosimilars, but cannot generally be seen to have achieved success: take for example Protalix Biotherapeutics, Inc. with its product for Gaucher disease <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/PfizerProtalix-Gaucher-drug-Elelyso-OKd-in-US-pediatrics-353614" target="_new">approved in 2014</a>. Protalix booked total company sales of less than $4.6m last quarter, including royalties from partner Pfizer. Meanwhile, last week, big company Novartis (through its generics business Sandoz) pulled the rug from under not just any small biosimilar company, but one of the bigger biotechs when it launched the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">first US biosimilar</a> against Amgen Inc's., <i>Neupogen</i> (filgrastim). Other big pharma companies have their own biosimilar armories: Merck has its biosimilar to Abbvie's blockbuster <i>Humira</i> (adalimumab), while Pfizer's recent acquisition of Hospira was motivated in part by the latter's biosimilar portfolio. The take-home message would be that if you wanted exposure to biosimilar launches in the near future, big companies seem to be the only companies that can give it to you.</p><p><p>As more and more portfolio managers return to their desks after the Labor Day holiday and look at the damage that the bear market has inflicted on their portfolios since mid-July, there is likely to be a further flight away from risk, if not from the equity asset class in favour of just cash. For those of us that have to provide life science exposure to our investors come fair weather or foul, it won't be via the riskiest early-stage companies that have until recently been so favored by generalist investors. Those who live at the pleasure of a bull market, suffer in a bear market, only quicker.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
