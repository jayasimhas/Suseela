<p>The cost of hepatitis C drugs has prompted strong reactions across the world from India to Spain, but not so in Brazil where the government looks close to agreeing a favorable price with the manufacturers. Unfazed by its faltering economy and increasingly unsustainable healthcare system, Brazil's health ministry says it is set to offer free access to Bristol-Myers Squibb's Daklinza (daclatasvir), Gilead's Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and Janssen's Olysio (simeprevir).</p><p>The health ministry recently announced that patients would soon access these new medicines and that the regulator ANVISA has just registered Daklinza, with Sovaldi and Olysio to follow soon. The drugs will have to go through the country's health technology appraisal system, CONITEC, but given the confidence of the government's announcement it would be surprising if the drugs did not make it on the national health system's list of approved drugs. Most likely CONITEC's assessment will restrict the patients that qualify for the drug. Grupo Esperan&ccedil;a, a hepatitis patient group, believes that the drugs will make it onto the list of drugs for free distribution, but it is concerned that only patients with more severe fibrosis/cirrhosis will be eligible.</p><p>Grupo Esperan&ccedil;a told <i>Scrip</i> that the government had managed to agree a" very important discount" on the drugs that won't break the health system. Janssen declined to comment on its pricing discussions, while Gilead and BMS said prices had not yet been finalized. BMS said it was in active discussions that were aligned with its tiered pricing model. This considers a country's economic development, burden of disease and commitment to addressing hepatitis C. Gilead confirmed Sovaldi was under regulatory review and that it was in the advanced stages of price negotiations. It says it is using the prevalence of disease, the per capita GNI and the government's commitment to scaling up treatment to set the price. Hepatitis C is indeed a public health priority in Brazil, and the government has a department dedicated to tackling AIDS, hepatitis and STDs. The government estimates that between 1.4 and 1.7 million people have hepatitis C in Brazil. </p><h2>relief</h2><p>Companies with expensive treatments that are of interest to the Brazilian government may be relieved by the news that the country is co-operating with the manufacturers. These breakthrough hepatitis C drugs come with a hefty price that is driving the global debate of how to keep access to drugs affordable. India has rejected one of Gilead's patent claims for Sovaldi (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Gilead-reconfirms-India-Sovaldi-plans-despite-patent-challenge-356180" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 15 January 2015</a>) and Spanish patients and politicians have demanded tough measures to secure access to the treatments (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Hepatitis-C-treatment-gets-political-in-Spain-356342" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 23 January 2015</a>). Sovaldi's list price in Spain is &euro;42,000 for a 12-week treatment cycle. Previously Brazil has not shied from taking such action in the name of public health. In 2007, it issued a compulsory license for Merck & Co's antiretroviral Stocrin (efavirenz) and subsequently began producing its own version. Its prior consent mechanism &ndash; which allows ANVISA to veto patents if they are a threat to public health &ndash; has also angered the pharmaceutical industry (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Companies-challenge-Brazilian-regulators-right-to-veto-patents-356196" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 16, January 2015</a>). </p><p>The government will certainly be under pressure to make sure the new treatments are affordable. The country's constitution guarantees the right to universal healthcare, which has led to the problematic trend of patients suing local authorities to get access to medicines. Drugs commonly sought through the courts have included the hepatitis C protease inhibitors telaprevir (Janssen's Incivo) and boceprevir (Merck's Victrelis). </p><p>Moreover, Brazil's economy is faltering, with inflation rising above target, economic growth projected to slow and declining government revenues. This makes it even harder to fulfil the constitutional pledge of universal healthcare and is deepening concerns over the future of the healthcare system.</p><p>Debate continues as to how to ensure the system is sustainable. According to local media reports, the health minister has suggested levying a tax to raise money. The health ministry denied this, but said that it was necessary to discuss a new way of financing the health system. One option, it said, was to use money accrued in the state's oil fund. However the availability and scale of oil revenues in the short-term is currently in question thanks to the dramatic slump in oil prices, which have more than halved since mid-2014. A sustained period of low oil prices would also put into question longer-term revenues as future production projects may be delayed. Brazil's high-growth but investment-intensive oil sector also faces uncertainty due to a corruption scandal at state oil company Petrobras that has implicated government ministers.</p><p>Interfarma, the local pharmaceutical industry association, told <i>Scrip</i> an oil fund was a good idea and that healthcare was a priority for such a fund. It said it was watching developments closely but that it was more important that the economy was restored to strong growth. This would yield tax revenue, which was good for healthcare, it said.</p>
