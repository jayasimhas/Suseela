<p>France's two main agencies dealing with medicines regulation and health economic evaluations, ANSM and HAS, have begun internal investigations into claims that former senior members of their key committees held secret meetings with pharmaceutical company representatives at which money and gifts exchanged hands in advance of drug approval and reimbursement decisions. The two agencies have said they are also referring the matter to the Public Prosecutor.</p><p>The allegations were made in an article by the French news organization Mediapart, which claimed that over a period of more than 20 years from the late 1980s, chairs, vice-chairs and members of the two committees responsible for drug approvals and reimbursement decisions formed a "small group of friends" that secretly advised pharmaceutical companies on the best way of presenting their drug approval and reimbursement application dossiers. </p><p>It said that the officials concerned met representatives of various pharma firms in hotels in Paris and Marseille to discuss their forthcoming applications, and that they accepted payments of up to &euro;60,000 in return for advice, but failed to declare any of this to the relevant authorities. In the case of the transparency committee, whose recommendations are used in making reimbursement decisions, the payments "did not guarantee a favorable decision" but companies "hoped that the committee would take a more kindly view" of their applications, the Mediapart article said. </p><p>Following the publication of the article, ANSM said its director general and the health minister had decided to set up an internal administrative inquiry to look into the role of those named in the article. HAS, which has overseen the transparency committee since it was set up in 2005, said it too was launching an internal inquiry into these "serious allegations", noting that some of the alleged activities took place before 2005.</p><h2>The players</h2><p>In its article, Mediapart named five individuals that it said had acted as paid consultants to pharma firms without ever declaring these activities: Gilles Bouvenot and Bernard Avouac, who chaired the transparency committee from 2003 to 2014 and from 1989 to 1998 respectively; Jean-Pierre Reynier, vice-chair of the approvals committee from 1994 to 2002; Christian Jacquot, a member of the approvals committee from 1996 to 2012; and Renée-Liliane Dreiser, a former expert on the transparency committee. </p><p>The article noted that while much of the drug licensing work of the approvals committee has since been taken over by the European Medicines Agency's centralized procedure, the transparency committee still plays a key role in assessing and making recommendations on the medical benefits (SMR) of new drugs and any improvements over existing therapies (ASMR). These recommendations are taken into account in subsequent decisions on drug reimbursement and pricing. </p><p>The group held most of their clandestine meetings with representatives of pharma firms in Marseille, south-east France, far from the HAS premises in Paris, according to the Mediapart article. It cited a former member of the transparency committee, who wished to remain anonymous, as saying that there were "two types of meeting. One was at a very early stage, when a company wanted to know how to develop its product in order to have an SMR or an ASMR five or six years down the line. The other was shortly before the dossier was filed with the transparency committee. We met in Marseille, in the Sofitel [hotel] or at the faculty of pharmacy. And sometimes in Paris in hotels like the Méridien Montparnasse. The pharmaceutical company often sent a person in charge of market access, a medical director, or possibly a scientific representative&#8230; We advised them mostly on what to bring out [in the dossier], on the best way to present things."</p><p>He said he personally was given between &euro;1,000-1,500 per meeting, and "it was always in cash. I maybe found an envelope in the dossier I was sent, or an envelope in my hotel room, on my bed."</p><p>Jean-Pierre Reynier told the Mediapart journalists that "most of the meetings on product development strategies took place in hotels but there was nothing clandestine about it". Asked for details, he said it was "very fuzzy in my head", adding that he asked for the money to be paid by the company in the form of the apprenticeship tax (which helps to fund academic training).</p><p>Christian Jaquot, a pharmacotoxicology specialist, told Mediapart that the meetings were held mainly in Marseille, where Professor Bouvenot and Professor Reynier lived. He said he was there "as 'Mr Sensible' in view of my experience. As for the remuneration, I don't remember exactly. It was very modest."</p><p>The article said that Professor Bouvenot had given very different accounts of his own involvement. At first, he said that "our meetings were very numerous in the 1990s", stressing that he ceased his consultancy activities after he was appointed chair of the transparency committee in 2003. </p><p>However, the Mediapart article points out, between 1997 and 2003 he held various key positions including vice-chair of the approvals committee, scientific adviser on medicines to the directorate general of health, chair of the national drug prescription observatory, and vice-chair of the committee on drug advertising and the proper use of medicines. </p><p>Asked about this subsequently, Professor Bouvenot did not deny that he had advised the pharmaceutical industry in parallel with these responsibilities up to 2003. But neither did he declare any of these activities when he took over at the transparency committee, even though as chair he would be dealing with products "on which he may have given advice a few years earlier", the article noted. Professor Bouvenot said that "at that time you only had to declare interests that were to come. I did not take into account the months before, but my day of arrival at the HAS."</p><p>Dr Avouac would neither confirm nor deny the allegations, and Dr Dreiser did not respond to requests for comment, Mediapart said.</p><h2>Company views</h2><p>It also spoke to a number of former employees of pharmaceutical companies about their involvement in these consultancy exercises. A former manager at Lundbeck, for example, claimed to have taken part in a meeting at the Sofitel in Marseille in the presence of Prof Bouvenot and Ms Dreiser, to whom a fee was paid, although Prof Bouvenot said all he could recall was an official meeting with a Lundbeck representative at the HAS. </p><p>Mediapart talked separately to two managers from Lilly, who at the time had a product that was about to come before the transparency committee. One of them said they had met Ms Dreiser and that "at the beginning, it was business as usual. And then in my office, Dreiser asked me: 'Are there any microphones in here?' She suggested to me that I should buy the decision of the committee. As I recall, she asked for &euro;100,000 and proposed a meeting with Bouvenot, in Marseille, a few days before the committee [meeting]. It was unthinkable. I protested. Avouac replied: 'Your colleagues are doing it.' When I said no, they answered: 'You won't get there without us'."</p><h2>HAS and ANSM prepare to investigate </h2><p>In statements on their websites, both HAS and ANSM explained the steps they were taking to address these allegations, and the actions they had already taken to increase transparency and avoid conflicts of interest among their committee members and other personnel. </p><p>HAS said that the Public Prosecutor was "the competent body to conduct the investigations necessary to establish the truth of all the facts reported, some of which date back to before the creation of the HAS in 2005." It said that if the allegations proved to be true, they would "go against the prevailing regulatory obligations on experts and committee members in terms of managing conflicts of interest".</p><p>It said that it had had a system for managing conflicts of interest in place since 2005, under which all committee members and external experts must fill in a declaration of interests form including any links with pharmaceutical companies. These forms are examined whenever a medicine comes under evaluation, and any person with a potential conflict of interest is excluded from discussions on that product. It said that committee members and experts are obliged to respect strict confidentiality on dossiers under evaluation, and that it too publishes declarations of interests of its members and experts as well as accounts of meetings and committee opinions.</p><p>ANSM said that since the regulatory reform law of 2011 following the Mediator affair, it had tightened up on transparency by, for example, putting committee agendas online, recording committee meetings, and publishing verbatim minutes. It said that declarations of interests of staff were published where appropriate, as were those of external experts working on behalf of the agency. It has also published a list of activities that are incompatible with the holding of a position on an ANSM body. Pharmaceutical companies no longer have a representative on the agency's bodies. </p><p>
