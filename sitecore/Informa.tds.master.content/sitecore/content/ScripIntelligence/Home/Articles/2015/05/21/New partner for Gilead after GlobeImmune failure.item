<p><p>Gilead Sciences partner GlobeImmune was hit hard by the failure of its mid-stage hepatitis B drug, leaving the big biotech to likely look for new partnerships in the space, speculate analysts. </p><p>Shares of GlobeImmune dropped 52.18%, or $4.30, to close at $3.94 after the company announced that GS-4774 failed a Phase II study of the drug in patients with hepatitis B, the most common form of liver disease. </p><p>The 178-patient trial was testing how effective GS-4774 plus oral antiviral therapy is in maintaining long-term viral suppression. At 24 weeks, the drug did not show a reduction in antiviral surface antigens (HBsAg), but a mean reduction of -0.17 log10 reduction at week 48 compared with -0.04 log10 reduction for the oral antivirals alone. The difference was not statistically significant. </p><p>Three patients receiving the highest dose of GS-4774 had HBsAg reductions between -0.94 and -3.89 log10 at 48 weeks. There was no difference in HBsAg reductions between the two lowest dose groups and the control at the 48-week mark. </p><p>"We look forward to collaborating with our partner Gilead Sciences, Inc. to identify potential next steps for GS-4774 in this patient population as well as to seeing the results from the second ongoing Phase 2 trial of GS-4774 in HBV treatment-na&iuml;ve patients," said GlobeImmune President and CEO Dr Timothy Rodell. </p><p>Hepatitis B affects nearly 400m Americans and is harder to treat than hepatitis C. Now that companies like Gilead have effectively created a cure for the more easily treated form of the disease, the industry is turning to hepatitis B. </p><p>The pair teamed up in 2011 to develop the vaccines for hepatitis B, including GS-4774. Gilead paid and an undisclosed upfront fee, as well as a milestone payment in 2013 at the onset of Phase II. </p><p>Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas estimates the opportunity in hepatitis B could be worth $15bn to Gilead, but says the programs are too early for them to be included in the models. The company is also developing the TRL-7 agonist GS-9620 in hepatitis B &ndash; the drug is currently in Phase II. </p><p>"The good news with this T-cell activating drug is some slight evidence of a dose response and better effect over longer period of time &ndash; but in our view it&rsquo;s not impressive enough and Gilead Sciences will need more options," said RBC Capital's Michael Yee in a 27 May note. </p><p>"Their 2nd program GS-9620 in Phase II is interesting but we also think this won&rsquo;t be enough and down the road we predict Gilead Sciences will have to do more deals in this space and is probably watching/tracking two leading albeit early players in Hep B: Tekmira Pharmaceuticals and Assembly Biosciences," the analyst added. </p><p>Both Tekmira and Assembly added about 4% to their share prices on the news. </p><p><p><p>
