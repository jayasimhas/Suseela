<p>Verseon, a technology-based pharmaceutical company headquarter in California, has floated on the other side of the Atlantic, on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) &ndash; a move apparently validating London's growing life sciences strength.</p><p>Eliot Forster, CEO of the UK's MedCity, said the decision for a Californian company to list on the London Stock Exchange was a "coup" for Britain.</p><p> "While traditionally we have not been able to unlock the levels of investment that you find in the US, what we can increasingly offer is significant funding from investors that are willing to take a long-term view," he said. He added that this forward-looking investment strategy is "extremely attractive to companies developing new medicines, and I expect it to result in more London IPOs by both UK and international companies." </p><p>Mr Forster believes the UK's competitive fiscal environment and opportunities to partner with world-leading academic and healthcare centers will also attract start-up drug developers. MedCity is an enterprise that unites the life sciences sector in London and the greater south east of England in order to stimulate greater economic growth.</p><p>Verseon's co-founder and CEO Adityo Prakash echoed Mr Forster's words. "The AIM market has allowed us to attract many long-term institutional investors whose outlook fits nicely with our vision for the growth of the company and execution of our business model," he told <i>Scrip</i>. "We were impressed by the long-term only view of many institutional investors we met in the UK."</p><p>Mr Prakash added that Verseon had a more global view of clinical trials so Europe, with a base in the UK, fit nicely into the firm's future development plans. "Obviously, it does not rule out a US listing in the future, but there is no desire to get on the quarterly reporting treadmill just yet," he said. </p><p>"London's AIM has a strong reputation for placing fast growing, innovative companies on an international platform," Mr Prakash said. </p><h2>IPO details</h2><p>Verseon's commencement of trading on 7 May follows the placing of 32,569,047 new common shares at a placing price of 202 pence per share &ndash; raising gross proceeds of &pound;65.8m (approximately $100m). The company has 149,739,909 shares in issue, giving Verseon a market capitalization at the placing price of approximately &pound;302.5m. </p><p>Founded in 2002, Verseon has an in-house drug discovery platform which it describes as a systematic, computationally-driven solution to achieve the molecular modelling accuracy necessary for rapid and cost-effective drug discovery.</p><p>The platform designs hundreds of millions of novel, drug-like synthesizable molecules for each drug program Verseon launches, and selects the most promising candidates for synthesis and laboratory testing. Verseon says this strategy means that "unlike a typical biotech," it is not reliant on the success or failure of a single drug candidate in the clinic. The company says its platform is applicable to virtually any disease indication with known target protein structure.</p><p>Currently, all of its assets are in preclinical stages, in the areas of anticoagulation, diabetic macular edema, and solid tumors. The lead indications for anticoagulation therapy (the most advanced of Verseon's programs) are related to cardiovascular conditions associated with blood clots.</p><p>Mr Prakash said that while Verseon did not plan to license its proprietary platform technology, it is open to partnerships for its drug candidates. "One of the key uses of the proceeds of this IPO is to fund current programs to the point where they can be out-licensed to larger pharma or biotech partners or progressed into the clinic internally," he said.</p><p><p>
