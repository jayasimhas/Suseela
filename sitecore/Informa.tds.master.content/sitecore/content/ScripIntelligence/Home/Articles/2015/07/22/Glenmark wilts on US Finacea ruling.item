<p>Shares of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals weakened on Indian bourses following news that a US court had upheld a patent covering the skin treatment Finacea Gel (azelaic acid) and ruled that the firm had infringed on claims therein. </p><p>The US Court for the District of Delaware said, amid a string of observations, that Glenmark had not met its burden to prove, by "clear and convincing evidence", that certain claims of US Patent No 6,534,070 (the '070 patent) patent are invalid for obviousness. </p><p>"The court also finds that the secondary considerations of unexpected results and commercial success, but not copying, support this finding of non-obviousness," District Judge Robinson said. </p><p>The plaintiffs - Intendis, Intraserv and Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals - had in March 2013 filed a suit against Glenmark for infringement of the '070 patent, which expires in November 2018.</p><p>Finacea Gel, 15%, is indicated for topical treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea. Bayer is the exclusive distributor of Finacea.</p><p>Glenmark had earlier claimed to be the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-eyes-cream-of-derma-crop-with-US-FTF-for-generic-Finacea-341247" target="_new">first to file</a> (FTF) an ANDA for a generic version of Finacea Gel, entitling it to 180 days of market exclusivity in the US. In fact, the product found specific mention as one of the prominent FTF opportunities in the company's presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference earlier this year. </p><p>Glenmark's shares ended at INR993 ($15.50), down by 4.21%, on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 28 July.</p><p>Some analysts said that the US court decision defers the potential launch of Glenmark's generic well beyond the current fiscal, though the product's delta would have realistically featured in FY17 had the court case gone the firm's way and regulatory approval come through. </p><p>The Finacea generic was seen contributing around $8-10m to Glenmark's topline in the current fiscal as per some estimates, though a clutch of recent ANDA approvals is expected to buffer some of the potential hit.</p><p>Last month Glenmark received final FDA approval for the extended-cycle oral contraceptive, levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol tablets and also calcipotriene cream 0.005%. In May this year, Glenmark announced the receipt of final FDA approval for generic desmopressin acetate tablets.</p><h2>copying</h2><p>Among a range of arguments in the US Court for the District of Delaware , the plaintiffs claimed that Glenmark copied the '070 patent and Finacea to make its generic gel and that the alleged copying was particularly egregious given the availability of non-infringing alternatives such as Skinoren cream and various metronidazole-based formulations. </p><p>Bayer marketed and sold a topical 20% azelaic acid cream (Skinoren) prior to Finacea.</p><p>The district court, though, referred to previous cases where the Federal Circuit held that it "do[es] not find compelling ... evidence of copying in the ANDA context where a showing of bioequivalency is required for FDA approval" as also that "Copying in the ANDA context is not probative of non-obviousness because a showing of bioequivalence is required for FDA approval."</p><p>The court, accordingly, held that, even if the process of reverse-engineering Finacea amounted to copying of the '070 patent, "such conduct is not persuasive evidence of non-obviousness."</p>
