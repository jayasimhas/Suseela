<p>Japan has issued approval recommendations and other regulatory decisions for a batch of drugs including Celgene's myeloma therapy Pomalyst (pomalidomide), which now looks set to be approved and possibly launched in the country within the next few months.</p><p>Celgene's novel immunomodulatory drug received a positive recommendation for the orphan indication of refractory multiple myeloma, for which around 11,000 people are being treated and roughly 4,000 new diagnoses are made in the country every year.</p><p>Other currently approved therapies in Japan include Takeda Pharmaceutical's Velcade (bortezomib; marketed through Janssen Pharmaceuticals) and Celgene's own Revlimid (lenalidomide), approved in 2010 in combination with dexamethasone for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.</p><p>Pomalyst is used in patients whose disease has progressed after at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib.</p><p>The preliminary recommendation from an advisory committee of the drugs and food sanitation council still requires formal endorsement by the ministry of health, labour and welfare, but marks a significant step towards approval following the regulatory submission for Pomalyst in the third quarter of 2014.</p><p>New drugs also require reimbursement price listing under the National Health Insurance scheme before they can be launched, which for Pomalyst now looks feasible within the calendar first half of the year.</p><p>Also recommended was ViiV Healthcare's triple therapy for HIV/AIDS Triumeq, and GlaxoSmithKline's Incruse Ellipta. Triumeq, which combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor dolutegravir with the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors abacavir and lamivudine, is already approved in the US and Europe for HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Incruse's active ingredient, the anticholinergic umeclidinium, was launched in Japan last year in combination with vilanterol, a long-acting beta-2 agonist, as Anoro Ellipta. Both products are marketed for the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with Incruse being used as a long-term maintenance therapy.</p><p>The ministry also confirmed that Taiho Pharmaceutical's Lonsurf (TAS-102), which combines trifluridine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor tipiracil, has met its conditional approval and post-marketing safety surveillance conditions.</p><p>The drug was launched in Japan last year for colorectal cancer refractory to other therapies following an expedited review, and just been submitted for colorectal cancer in the EU. An NDA was accepted for review last month in the US., where it has fast track designation for the indication.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Product</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Indication</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Dopram (doxapram)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Kissei Pharmaceutical </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>apnea in premature and underweight infants (based on data in public domain; new indication)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Elplat (oxaliplatin)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Yakult Honsha</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>postoperative adjuvant use in advanced/recurrent gastric cancer (new indication)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>maintenance therapy for COPD symptoms</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Lonsurf (trifluridine and tipiracil)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Taiho</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>unresectable advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer (conditional approval restrictions lifted)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Pomalyst (pomalidomide)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Celgene</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (orphan)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Triumeq (abacavir, dolutegravir, lamivudine)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>ViiV Healthcare</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>HIV (orphan)</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><p>The committee also issued a positive recommendation for a prototype, cell cultured pandemic flu HA vaccine from Kaketsuken (orphan status).</p><h2>Other Recommendations</h2><p>In several additional decisions issued in February, the council's advisory committees gave preliminary nods to Actelion Pharmaceuticals' Opsumit (macicentan) for the once-daily treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and Bayer's Xarelto (rivaroxaban) for the additional indications of treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism and the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism.</p><p>Xarelto, filed for the new uses in May last year, is already approved in Japan for a number of indications including prevention of ischemic stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients. Opsumit, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is licensed to Nippon Shinyaku for co-development and marketing in Japan.</p><p>Genzyme Corp's Cerdelga (eliglustat) received preliminary clearance for the orphan indication of Gaucher's disease, for which it is positioned as an oral first-line therapy for type 1 patients.</p><p>All new drugs are pending final formal approval by the ministry of health, labour and welfare, and thereafter will require reimbursement price listing before launch.</p><p>This article first appeared in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news/2015/3/4/recommendation-edges-pomalyst-closer-to-japan-launch" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a><i>.</i></p>
