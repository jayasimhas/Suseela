<p><p>While Actavis is fully engaged in integrating the Allergan business, the company reported a strong first quarter. Actavis CEO Brent Saunders used the company's first quarter conference call to reassure investors that the company still values its generics business, despite speculation that it might join the current generics consolidation frenzy.</p><p> "I think the generic industry is in a bit of turmoil right now with two hostile situations going on and you know my views on hostile situations &ndash; it tends to destroy value and cause lots of distractions," said Saunders during the 11 May call, speaking of the ongoing negotiations between Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan and Perrigo. "When you look at our business up almost 20% on topline this year, firing on all cylinders, an R&D pipeline that is the envy of the industry, continuing to just beat on first to files in the US time and time again, launching 100 brands. . . I think it is something that we take a lot of pride in and we see a lot of connectivity to generics and our branded business."</p><p>The executive added that "strategically we value that business."</p><p>Saunders also noted that the company is not in the market for any transformational acquisitions at the moment &ndash; although bolt-ons are not out of the question. </p><p>While Actavis is working hard to integrate its Allergan acquisition &ndash; which closed mid-March, Actavis' generics and international business brought in $1.7bn during the quarter, up 12% over the year-prior. </p><p>Growth was driven by strong sales of key products and new product launches including generic versions of Concerta, Lidoderm, Intuniv and OxyContin. Internationally, our Generics business was negatively impacted by the strengthened US dollar, but at constant currency rates this business grew 20% versus prior-year quarters," said Tessa Hilado, Actavis chief financial officer. </p><p>Allergan on track</p><p>The integration of the $68bn purchase is on track, said Saunders. The company noted that it is rapidly rationalizing its pipeline and has confirmed 70 projects that from the combined pipeline that will move forward, with 50 of those in late or registrational stages. </p><p>The company intends to update the investor community on the combined pipeline at an upcoming investor day. </p><p>Actavis boasted the progress of several key assets during the first quarter, including the approval of Avycaz (ceftazidime-avibactam) for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, the launch of the combination Alzheimer's disease drug Namzaric (memantine/donepezil), as well as an expanded indication for Botox in upper limb spasticity. </p><p>For the first three months of 2015, Actavis reported revenues of $4.23bn, up 59%. Earnings per share were up 23% to $4.30 apiece, excluding all Allergan and Forest acquisition-related costs. Including those costs, Actavis reported a loss of $1.85 per share. </p><p><p><p>
