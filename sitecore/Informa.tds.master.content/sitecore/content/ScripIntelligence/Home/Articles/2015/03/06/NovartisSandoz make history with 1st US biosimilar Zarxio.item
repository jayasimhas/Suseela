<p>Novartis and its Sandoz unit made history on 6 March, gaining the first approval of a biosimilar in the US &ndash; Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz). </p><p>&ldquo;Dozens of organizations representing consumers, seniors, payers, pharmacists, purchasers, pharmacy benefit managers, labor unions, retail pharmacies, managed care pharmacies and other health care stakeholders have long-anticipated this moment,&rdquo; declared Ralph Neas, president and CEO of the Generics Pharmaceutical Association. &ldquo;It is deeply gratifying to have our collaborative efforts to educate policymakers and promote access, affordability and competition in the biologics sector, realized today.&rdquo;</p><p>The FDA&rsquo;s blessing on the drug came as little surprise to anyone, given the &ldquo;lovefest&rdquo; at the 7 January meeting of the agency&rsquo;s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, which voted unanimously the totality of evidence supported licensing for all five indications sought by the firms for their version of Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim), a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/FDAs-1st-biosimilar-adcomm-a-lovefest-355994" target="_new">08 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-biosimilar-1st-to-win-FDA-panel-backing-355993" target="_new">08 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-No-meaningful-differences-between-Amgens-Neupogen-Sandoz-biosimilar-355934" target="_new">05 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The FDA accepted that advice and OK&rsquo;d Zarxio to treat patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy; those with acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy; patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation; people eundergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy; and patients with severe chronic neutropenia.</p><p>Based on the January ODAC vote, Sagient Research&rsquo;s <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had given Sandoz&rsquo;s biosimilar a 95% chance of gaining the FDA&rsquo;s nod, which was 11% above the average probability of approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Dr John Jenkins, director of the FDA&rsquo;s Office of New Drugs, noted that under the <i>Biologics Price Competition and Innovation (BPCI) Act</i> &ndash; the provision that gave US regulators the authority to approve biosimilars, which was enacted in 2010 as part of the <i>Affordable Care Act</i> &ndash; a biosimilar can only be approved by the agency if it has the same mechanism of action, route of administration, dosage form and strength as the innovator biologic, or reference drug, and only for the indications and conditions for use as the latter product.</p><p>While the FDA&rsquo;s focus during a review of an innovator biologic is on the product&rsquo;s ability to demonstrate it is safe, effective and meets the agency&rsquo;s quality standards, a biosimilar&rsquo;s application review is centered on showing there is no clinically significant difference between the two medicines and the biosimilar version is highly similar to the reference drug from an analytical standpoint, he explained.</p><p>&ldquo;Patients and the healthcare community can be confident that biosimilar products approved by the FDA meet the agency&rsquo;s rigorous safety, efficacy and quality standards and can be expected to be as safe and effective as the reference biological product,&rdquo; Dr Jenkins told reporters during a 6 March briefing.</p><p>The facilities where the biosimilars are made also must meet the FDA&rsquo;s standards, he said.</p><p>Dr Jenkins emphasized that Zarxio was cleared in the US as a biosimilar, but was not approved as an interchangeable product &ndash; meaning it cannot be substituted for the reference biologic without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the product.</p><p>He also raised the issue of costs of biosimilars &ndash; noting the intent of the BPIC Act was to &ldquo;provide patients with access to lower-cost safe and effective biological products.&rdquo;</p><p>Novartis and Sandoz, however, have yet to disclose Zarxio&rsquo;s pricing, but have insisted it would be competitive.</p><p>At the 7 January ODAC, Dr Mark McCamish, head of global biopharmaceutical and oncology injectables development at Sandoz, said he could not say whether Zarxio&rsquo;s price would be less than Neupogen &ndash; declaring the issue was &ldquo;complex.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Nonproprietary naming debate</b></p><p>Since the enactment of <i>BPIC Act</i>, there have been many questions about the FDA&rsquo;s plans non-proprietary names for biosimilars and interchangable biological products, Dr Jenkins said. </p><p>In the case of Zarxio, the FDA has designated a &ldquo;placeholder nonproprietary name&rdquo; as filgrastim-sndz.</p><p>But, Dr Jenkins stressed, the FDA&rsquo;s decision for Zarxio&rsquo;s nonproprietary name &ldquo;should not be viewed as a statement about a general naming policy for biosimilar products.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;While the agency has not yet issued a draft guidance on how biological products marketed, we intend to do so in the near future,&rdquo; he told reporters. </p><p>&ldquo;Based on the comments and internal discussions we will finalize and then plan to implement that policy broadly,&rdquo; Dr Jenkins said. &ldquo;At this time, it&rsquo;s premature to know whether the name we applied to the filgrastim-sndz product may or may not change based on the finalization of the naming policy.&rdquo;</p><p>But the Biotechnology Industry Organization took issue with the FDA assigning Zarxio a placeholder nonproprietary name before the guidance was issued &ndash; calling that action "unfortunate." </p><p>Dr Jenkins said, however, it was not unusual or unprecedented for Zarxio&rsquo;s nonproprietary name to have a suffix or for the FDA to have distinguishing names.</p><p>Indeed, in 2012, Teva won US approval to market tbo-filgrastim, a short-acting recombinant form of G-CSF, which is sold as Granix. But he emphasized that drug is not a biosimilar and was reviewed under the agency's 351(a) biologics license application process and not as a 351(k) (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Tomatotomahto-Teva-tbo-filgrastim-OKd-but-FDA-says-not-biosimilar-to-Neupogen-334470" target="_new">30 August 2012</a>).</p><p>While the FDA cannot reveal the number of biosimilar applications, known as 351(k)s, currently under review, Dr Leah Christl, associate director for therapeutic biologics at the agency, pointed out there are four other products for which their sponsors have publicly disclosed that information &ndash;Apotex&rsquo;s version of filgrastim and its biosimilar of Amgen&rsquo;s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim); Hospira&rsquo;s epoetin alfa version of Amgen&rsquo;s Epogen and J&J&rsquo;s Procrit; and Celltrion's infliximab biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson's Remicade (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-2nd-biosimilar-under-FDA-review-seeks-filgrastim-OK-356810" target="_new">18 February 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Apotex-biosimilar-of-Amgens-Neulasta-under-FDA-review-355732" target="_new">18 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Hospira-seeks-FDA-nod-for-EpogenProcrit-biosimilar-356100" target="_new">13 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/First-US-biosimilar-MAb-on-the-horizon-as-Celltrion-files-Remsima-353328" target="_new">11 August 2014</a>).</p><p>Celltrion had expected to have its 351(k) application discussed by the FDA&rsquo;s Arthritis Advisory Committee on 17 March, but the agency recently postponed that meeting because of pending information requested by regulators (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Will-FDA-adcomm-be-lucky-for-Celltrion-infliximab-biosimilar-356630" target="_new">09 February 2015</a>).</p><p>The FDA has not yet rescheduled the Celltrion <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/ucm433919.htm" target="_new">adcomm</a>.</p><p>Dr Jenkins said it was not necessary for the FDA to include Sandoz&rsquo;s comparative clinical trial data in Zarxio&rsquo;s labeling &ndash; insisting &ldquo;those data are not necessary for the prescriber to safely and effectively use the products in their patients.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr Christl said the FDA intends to issue guidance on labeling of biosimilar products, &ldquo;which will provide a more comprehensive overview of the agency&rsquo;s policy position.&rdquo;</p><p>She noted that particular guidance is on the 2015 guidance agenda for CDER, &ldquo;so we are working on that and definitely hope to issue that draft guidance in the future.&rdquo;</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
