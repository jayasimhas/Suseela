<p><b>The EU regulatory system has brought some positive results in the area of non-prescription medicines, but further progress is needed to meet the expectations of the self-care sector, says Hubertus Cranz</b>.</p><p>Without any doubt, the European Medicines Agency has been a great success. In 20 years, the EMA has established itself as one of the leading regulatory agencies in the world. Although the original focus was more on medicines containing new molecules, the agency also had an impact from the beginning on the regulatory climate for non-prescription medicines, which in volume terms make up 50% of the pharmaceutical market.</p><p>This impact became even more evident through changes in the legislative system in past years. Three elements were particularly important.</p><h2>Centralised procedure</h2><p>The first was the extension of the optional use of the centralised procedure (CP) to non-prescription medicines. While this led to a few medicinal products being switched from prescription to non-prescription medicines, over 10 years the results have been mediocre, with only four successes. </p><p>Changing the legal status of a product from prescription to non-prescription is usually not a simple exercise but it turned out to be particularly difficult in a centralised context. Although the EMA's drug evaluation committee, the CHMP, decides on scientific grounds following the criteria enshrined in the legislation, the differences in terms of self-care policies and medical culture at national level have a clear impact on centralised switches. The investment in terms of resources for companies is enormous and as a consequence of the low success rate and unpredictable outcome, hardly any applications have been filed recently. </p><p>The CP is the route for innovation par excellence for the self-care sector as a number of products authorized via the CP would be potential candidates for switching and would have to use this procedure to change their legal status. The innovation potential of the self-care sector is therefore dependent on a well-functioning CP. Building on years of constructive dialogue, for example through the EMA-AESGP platform, both sides will need to intensify their efforts to find solutions to unblock this critical issue.</p><h2>Herbal medicines</h2><p>The second element &ndash; the establishment of a fully-fledged Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products in 2004 &ndash; was unprecedented and was hugely welcomed by our sector as an acknowledgement of herbal medicines as a full therapeutic option for patients and consumers in Europe. Since then, more than 100 EU monographs have been finalised and a wide range of guidelines have been adopted, which made an important contribution to the European harmonisation process in this area. </p><p>Nevertheless, the development of the herbal market remains below expectations, because often regulators at national level take some degree of liberty with the EU monographs. For the AESGP, it is also important that well-established use and paediatric indications should be more routinely reflected in EU monographs. The number of list entries remains very low due to the fact that genotoxicity data are seen as lacking for a number of plants. The AESGP advocates that the threshold be made reasonable, in particular, when the same plant is extensively used in food or is freely available on the market in other product categories. </p><h2>Pharmacovigilance</h2><p>Thirdly, one of the goals of the new pharmacovigilance legislation was to take a more proportionate approach, to streamline procedures and to gain efficiencies, resulting in cost reductions overall. The actual impact was often the opposite, with dubious implications for public health. The task ahead is to correct the law's implementation to ensure it respects the legislator's intent. </p><p>The AESGP is looking forward to continuing its constructive exchanges with the EMA for the benefit of all those involved, and above all the citizens of Europe.</p><p><i>Dr Hubertus Cranz is director general of the Association of the European Self-Medication Industry (AESGP).</i></p><p><i>This is the latest in a series of articles marking the 20th anniversary of the European Medicines Agency. In the run-up to the invitation-only scientific conference that the EMA is holding to mark the anniversary in London on 18 March, you'll be able to read what key individuals and stakeholders in the European pharmaceutical regulatory network have to say about the challenges the EMA and the network are facing and where they are headed as the agency moves into its third decade.</i></p><p><b><i>Previously in this series</i></b><i>:</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Fernand Sauer reviews the first two decades and offers advice for regulators at all levels",</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Fernand-Sauer-reviews-the-first-two-decades-and-offers-advice-for-regulators-at-all-levels-357045" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, <i>3 March 2015</i>.</p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A decade of expansion, collaboration and new legislation", by Thomas LÃ¶nngren,</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-decade-of-expansion-collaboration-and-new-legislation-357061" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, <i>4 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "Independence and transparency are the key to fulfilling the EMA's public health commitments", by Health Action International,</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-Independence-and-transparency-are-the-key-to-fulfilling-the-EMAs-public-health-commitments-357084" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, <i>5 March 2015.</i></p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "A short history of the European Medicines Agency", by Ian Schofield,</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-A-short-history-of-the-European-Medicines-Agency-357112" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, <i>6 March 2015</i>.</p><p><i>The EMA at 20: "CHMP chair on HTA, patient involvement and dealing with uncertainty", by Francesca Bruce,</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/The-EMA-at-20-CHMP-chair-on-HTA-patient-involvement-and-dealing-with-uncertainty-357139" target="_new">scripintelligence.com</a>, <i>9 March 2015</i>.</p><p>
