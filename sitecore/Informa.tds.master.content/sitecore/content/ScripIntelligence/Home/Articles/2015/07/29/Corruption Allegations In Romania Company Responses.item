<p>A number of pharmaceutical firms with business units in Romania are under investigation following allegations of bribery and corruption in the region &ndash; including big pharmas GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Roche Holding AG, Pfizer Inc., Novartis AG and Teva Pharmacetuical Industries.</p><p>Between nine and 14 pharmaceutical companies are apparently being investigated by Romania regulator, the National Anti-corruption Directorate (DNA). The firms have been accused of bribing doctors to prescribe certain cancer drugs to patients.</p><p>These allegations could be a crucial blow to what had been seen as a thriving market for pharma. In the first quarter of 2015, according to market analysis company Cegedim, sales of prescription medicines reached &euro;836m in Romania. This marked a rise of 10.7% from the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>And the bad press also doesn't bode well for GSK as the firm is already dealing with the backlash of a number of corruption allegations in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Wittys-bonus-scythed-as-GSK-still-recovers-from-China-scandal-356983" target="_new">China</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-GSK-corruption-allegations-emerge-351278" target="_new">Poland</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-GSK-corruption-allegations-emerge-351278" target="_new">Iraq</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/No-systemic-issue-insists-GSK-amid-yet-more-corruption-allegations-351350" target="_new">Jordan and Lebanon</a> in 2013-2014. GSK was fined a record sum of $486m in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Officially-guilty-GSK-fined-486m-for-Chinese-bribery-354041" target="_new">September 2014</a> after it was officially found guilty of bribery by the Changsha Intermediate People's Court in Hunan Province. </p><p>Romanian regulator, DNA, told <i>Scrip,</i> "On July, 28, 2015, following the legal authorizations issued by the competent court, house searches were performed in 61 locations situated in the municipalities of Bucharest and the counties of Ilfov, Sibiu, Mure?, S?laj, Cluj, Bistri?a-N?s?ud and Timi?."</p><p>DNA confirmed the searches targeted the "offices of trade companies as well as houses of natural people," and are related to "suspicions of corruption offences regarding the manner in which a series of medicines were prescribed and purchased by certain health institutions and medical doctors in Romania."</p><p>The investigators could not confirm exactly which pharma firms were included in the investigation. "For the time being, we are not able to provide more details regarding the people or companies involved in the investigation, because such information can be detrimental to the proper course of the criminal investigation," DNA said. However, <i>Scrip </i>has received confirmation from several companies rumored to be involved in the investigation. Here's what they had to say on the matter: Â </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Response to Scrip queries</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Comments</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>GSK</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>"Our understanding is that authorities in Romania have launched a sector wide investigation in which the focus is on oncology medicines. We are cooperating fully with requests for information in relation to this inquiry."</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>GSK has been loudly claiming it is assessing its sales practices since news emerged of its "shameful" bribery activities in China in the summer of 2013. Another corruption allegation if proved true could derail the drug maker's supposed progress in applying new polices and rules for its sales reps. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Roche</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>"We can confirm that Roche Romania was among the 61 locations visited by the DNA. Roche is fully cooperating with authorities, and will provide all required information. As this is an ongoing investigation initiated by the public institutions in charge, as a standard practice, Roche is not in a position to provide more details."</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Roche was one of the first companies to announce its involvement in the Romania investigations. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Novartis</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>"We can confirm that Novartis sites were among the locations visited by Romania's National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) in relation to their investigation announced on July 28, 2015. Novartis cooperated fully with the authorities while on site and will continue to support their ongoing investigation as requested. We cannot comment further on this ongoing investigation."</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Novartis was also involved in the sector wide corruption allegations in China, in 2013. The pharma was not subsequently investigated by Chinese authorities but it did launch an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Novartis-confirms-investigation-into-China-bribery-allegations-345935" target="_new">internal investigation</a> into possible misconduct by its business teams. </p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Teva</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>"Teva is, and will continue to, fully cooperate with the authorities in this matter."</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Allergan PLC (Actavis)</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>"We understand that the Romanian government is conducting an investigation into the industry practices of engaging with healthcare professionals and has visited up to 14 companies, including Actavis Romania. Allergan, and the local Romanian office, are cooperating fully and transparently with the Romanian government and will continue to do so. Allergan is deeply committed to operating with integrity and within the scope of applicable laws and regulations and continues to maintain a robust compliance program."</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Actavis was initially the company targeted in the anticorruption sweep by local authorities; however the company has recently acquired Allergan in a $68bn takeover and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Actavis-renamed-as-Allergan-358976" target="_new">adopted this name</a> for its combined business. The combination of the two firms created a new top-10 pharma company by revenues.</p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Glenmark Pharmaceuticals</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Glenmark told <i>Scrip</i> that Romania makes up a diminutive part of its overall business, so there is not much in this region to be concerned about. </p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><p><p><p>Other pharma businesses reportedly involved in the ongoing investigation in Romania include Pfizer, which was unavailable to comment prior to publication of this article, Alvogen and Egis Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>The Romanian anticorruption office was first notified of this case on the June 22, it said. However, the investigation is related to "perpetration of corruption offences and assimilated to those of corruption, committed among 2012 - 2015."</p><p>According to local publication<i>The Romanian Insider</i>, oncology clinics, hospitals and drug distributors were including in the searches on July 28. Also, around 16 doctors who run oncology departments in state hospitals or coordinate parts of the national oncology sub-program are under investigation, according to judicial sources.</p>
