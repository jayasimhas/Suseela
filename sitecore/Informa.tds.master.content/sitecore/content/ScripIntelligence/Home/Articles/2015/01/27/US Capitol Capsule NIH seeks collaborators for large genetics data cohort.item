<p>While the concept of precision medicine &ndash; prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account &ndash; is not new and already is being used, such as with targeted cancer therapies, President Barack Obama wants to expand its application to cover many different diseases, particularly those that have scientists stumped.</p><p>But to do that, the president's team of health officials and scientists is going to need collaborators, including from the biopharmaceutical industry, said Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who will be leading much of the effort under Mr Obama's precision medicine initiative. </p><p>President Obama unveiled the outline of his new initiative during a White House ceremony on 30 January &ndash; calling on Congress to fund the effort with an initial $215m as part of the administration's fiscal year 2016 budget request (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Building a framework to unleash the full potential of precision medicine, Mr Obama said, "will give us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs that we have ever seen."</p><p>"Precision medicine is a new way of discovering and developing medicines starting an understanding of the from root cause of the disease, not just the symptoms, but really the underlying biology that causes the disease," explained Dr David Altshuler, executive vice president of global research and chief scientific officer at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, whose cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco (ivacaftor), which treats patients with specific mutations, was highlighted by President Obama as an example of where medicine should be going. </p><p>Dr Altshuler called the president's precision medicine proposal "timely." </p><p>"We believe that if done right, this can lead to acceleration in the whole process of developing new medicines," he told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"This is one of the biggest things to happen in medicine in a very, very long time," said Dr Jo Handelsman, associate director for science at the White House Office of Science and Technology, who will play a key role in coordinating the agencies involved in President Obama's initiative. "It will really make the future health of people in America totally different."</p><p>The president first talked about launching a precision medicine initiative in his 20 January State of the Union address (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The recent developments of large-scale biologic databases, such as the human genome sequence, powerful methods for characterizing patients, like proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays and even mobile health technology and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data have now made it possible to pursue a large-scale precision medicine initiative, Dr Collins said in a 30 January opinion piece in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, in which the NIH chief was joined by the head of the National Cancer Institute, Dr Harold Varmus. </p><p>What is needed now, they said, "is a broad research program to encourage creative approaches to precision medicine, test them rigorously and ultimately use them to build the evidence base needed to guide clinical practice."</p><p>At the heart of the president's proposal is the creation a research cohort of one million volunteers, whose gene, metabolite and microorganism profiles will be collected, along with additional information from medical records and other sources.</p><p>Dr Collins said the NIH plans to assemble the research cohort, in part, from some existing cohort studies &ndash; many of which have been funded by the agency &ndash; which already have collected or are well positioned to collect data from study participants willing to be involved in the new initiative. </p><p>But he noted that creating such a resource will require extensive planning to achieve the appropriate balance of participants and the development of new approaches to participation and consent.</p><p>It also will require forging strong partnerships among existing cohorts, patient groups and the private sector. </p><p>One company open to exploring those opportunities with the NIH is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, whose genetics center has now sequenced 25,000 people under a partnership with Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems, one of the largest integrated health systems in the US.</p><p>They are on track to sequence 50,000 people per year, said Dr Aris Baras, executive director of R&D initiatives and deputy head of the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC), which was formed in January 2014 as a subsidiary of Regeneron. </p><p>RGC's scientific advisory board chairman, Dr Richard Lifton, a professor of nephrology and chairman of the genetics department at Yale University, actually will be leading a blue-ribbon panel that will be formed by the NIH to help guide the specifics of how President Obama's precision medicine initiative will be run, Dr Collins told reporters on 30 January. </p><p>But Dr Baras said his team at RGC and Geisinger will need to learn more about the details of the initiative &ndash; which are still in the early stages of being worked out &ndash; before making any decisions to climb on board.</p><p>"I think it's too early to really say," Dr Baras said.</p><p>He noted Regeneron has partnered before with the NIH on other projects, including the agency's Knockout Mouse Project. </p><p>RGC's sequencing project with Geisinger aims to sequence up to 250,000 people &ndash; a goal that was recently raised from 100,000, thanks in large part to recent technological advances &ndash; and connect that information with clinical data.</p><p>"While everyone very excited about the discoveries made in genetics and genomics, we are now in an era where the technology has advanced to the point where those genetic discoveries are going to be coming much more fast and furious," said Dr Alan Schuldiner, vice president of translational genetics at RGC. "To do that, one needs to build an infrastructure across hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of patients who are linked to electronic health record data."</p><p>RGC's goal is to look at human genetics as a model to inform Regeneron's drug discovery and development "and to shed some light on understanding new biology," Dr Baras said.</p><p>Under the Geisinger collaboration, the two fully share all the data, he said, noting they have common research interests, but each also has independent interests.</p><p>"We want to look at the genetics of each one of our drug targets," he said. "We can find individuals out there who have mutations in the genes our drugs target, and then we can try to understand what the clinical associations are with those mutations. Those then can help us understand and validate our hypotheses around our drug targets."</p><p>RGC also will look for novel discoveries and new drug targets, Dr Baras explained. </p><p>Dr Schuldiner said RGC also is taking other approaches, like characterizing the genomics of families, like those with Mendelian disorders &ndash; a project for which it is collaborating with Baylor University.</p><p>"For those kinds of studies, you don't need a million people, you just need one informative family to sequence," he explained. </p><p>RGC also has worked with the Clinic for Special Children to study the genetic basis of early onset and familial forms of pediatric disorders in Amish and Mennonite populations.</p><p>Dr Baras said Regeneron's approach is one that is fully integrated &ndash; going from genetic discoveries all the way through to developing therapeutics, noting that its first FDA-approved medicine, Arcalyst (rilonacept), went through that process, as did its PCSK9 inhibitor, alirocumab, which currently is under review at the US drug agency to treat hypercholesterolemia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-leapfrogs-Amgen-with-US-priority-review-for-alirocumab-356357" target="_new">26 January 2015</a>).</p><p><b>In other Washington news:</b></p><p><b>CDC chief: Must stop measles from getting foothold</b></p><p>The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made his rounds on the network Sunday political programs on 1 February to plead with parents to vaccinate their children against measles, as an outbreak of the highly contagious virus continued to spread in the US.</p><p>The CDC reported that in the past month, the number of cases of measles in the US has jumped to 84 in 14 states in an ongoing outbreak linked to Disneyland, in which an untold number of people were exposed in December 2014.</p><p>Updated figures from the California health department, however, pushed that nationwide figure above 100.</p><p>Now there's concern over a Bard College student who took an international flight from Germany to New York, where he then boarded a train when he was in the early stages of infection with the measles. </p><p>Appearing on <i>CBS' Face the Nation</i>, Dr Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said he expected the number of cases to go higher in the US during the current outbreak.</p><p>The best way to prevent measles, he insisted, is with vaccination.</p><p>But, he said, a over the past few years, a small, but growing number of parents have not gotten their kids vaccinated &ndash; with some still believing a discredited report from the late 1990s the vaccine causes autism &ndash; resulting in a building up of unvaccinated young adults, which he said "makes us vulnerable." </p><p>"The science is clear," Dr Frieden asserted, "study after study has shown there's no serious long-term adverse consequences from the measles vaccine."</p><p>"We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the US," he declared.</p><p>Appearing on <i>ABC's This Week</i>, Dr Frieden pointed out that children with compromised immune systems who are unable to get the measles vaccine are especially vulnerable to getting the measles. </p><p>He noted the CDC declared the measles eliminated in the US in 2000. </p><p>But people who have traveled abroad have brought measles back to the US, with those who haven't been vaccinated easily picking up the disease and spreading it to others who haven't got the shot. </p><p>Adults born between 1957 and 1971 also are vulnerable because the vaccine in the US was not very effective, so the CDC is urging those in that age group to get a booster shot. </p><p>The total number of measles in the US in 2014 was 644 in 27 states. </p><p><b>Lifting device tax aid precision medicine initiative? </b></p><p>President Barack Obama's top spokesman on 30 January tried to insist there was no reason to connect rescinding the medical device tax, which was imposed under the Affordable Care Act, and the administration's new initiative on precision medicine.</p><p>The precision medicine initiative, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, is part of a substantial investment Mr Obama "believes is necessary" in the kind of medical innovations that could serve to dramatically overhaul healthcare in the US, "in a way that would have tremendous benefits for the health and well-being of people all across the country."</p><p>Those investments, Mr Earnest said, have important economic benefits &ndash; with the potential for businesses to sprout up around the innovations developed.</p><p>But, he said, "I don't think there's any reason why that medical device tax would in any way limit the kind of innovation that the president believes could revolutionize healthcare and has great economic potential for both those well-established health care companies, but also new companies that could emerge as a result of some of this new technology."</p><p>Mandy of the companies that were at the White House on 30 January to launch Mr Obama's precision medicine initiative, however, had a different point of view and are pushing on Capitol Hill for the 2.3% excise tax on medical devices to be repealed, arguing that doing so would give those firms more funds to develop their products (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Mr Earnest said President Obama has "indicated a willingness to have a conversation with Republicans about the medical device tax." </p><p>"I know some of them have expressed some concerns about it, and we're certainly willing to have that conversation," he said.</p><p>This and past US Capitol Capsule columns are available at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/" target="_new">http://www.scripintelligence.com/capitolcapsule/</a></p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
