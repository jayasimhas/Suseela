<p>Pfizer's investments in research and development paid off during the second quarter when the company generated $11.9bn in revenue, including better than expected sales for the new breast cancer drug Ibrance (palbociclib) and the pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13.</p><p>The New York-based big pharma reported $500m more revenue than analysts predicted for the second quarter and Pfizer's non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 exceeded expectations by $0.04. The company indicated that it will continue to prioritize investments in R&D as well as mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its development pipeline and ensure revenue growth.</p><p>Chairman, president and CEO Ian Read said during the company's 28 July earnings conference call that Pfizer will spend wisely in the current competitive environment for M&A deals while staying focused on what already is in its R&D pipeline.</p><p>"I don't think we've lost out on any opportunities that would have made sense for our shareholders," Mr Read said.</p><p><b>R&D spend fuels sales growth</b></p><p>Pfizer revised its forecast for 2015 revenue to a range of $45bn to $46bn for the year versus prior guidance of $44bn to $46bn and increased its expected R&D expenditures to $7.3bn to $7.6bn versus a prior range of $6.9bn to $7.4bn. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in between $2.01 and $2.07 for the year compared with prior guidance of $1.95 to $2.05.</p><p>To justify its increased R&D expenses to investors, all Pfizer has to do is point to Ibrance and Prevnar, which were two important contributors to the company's second quarter sales. </p><p>Ibrance won early US FDA approval to treat certain breast cancer patients in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-wins-early-Ibrance-approval-in-breast-cancer-356525" target="_new">February</a> and the CDK 4/6 inhibitor was expected to generate $72m in sales for the second quarter, its first full quarter of sales, but the small molecule's sales came in at almost twice analyst consensus at $140m. </p><p>Pfizer will seek EU approval for Ibrance in the third quarter and an expanded US label based on the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizers-Ibrance-conquers-new-breast-cancer-territory-357900" target="_new">PALOMA-3</a> clinical trial results in the fourth quarter. US sales so far this year totaled $178m.</p><p>But Prevnar 13 had an even bigger impact on revenue, since second quarter sales jumped 37% from $1.1bn to $1.5bn on a year-over-year basis, including a 6% hit from foreign currency exchange rates that favored the US dollar. </p><p>Sales of the vaccine have been on the rise since results from the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizers-Prevnar-shows-significant-benefit-in-older-adults-350610" target="_new">CAPiTA</a> clinical trial in 2014 showed a significant decrease in community-acquired pneumonia among older adults and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that Prevnar 13 be administered routinely to all adults age 65 and older. Pfizer stepped up direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising as a result.</p><p>"With Prevnar 13, it looks like the DTC campaign for the adults indication continues to work with US sales up 86%, and [ex-US] sales grew 10% driven primarily by increased shipments with the Gavi Vaccine Alliance," UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a 28 July research note.</p><p><b>R&D investments for the future</b></p><p>Pfizer's investments in immuno-oncology, and in cholesterol-lowering treatments known as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, lag behind competing programs from the likes of Merck & Co, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals/Sanofi and Amgen. </p><p>Pfizer signed a deal with Merck KGaA in late 2014 to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-sides-with-Merck-KGaA-on-PD-L1-AZ-deal-out-for-good-355101" target="_new">co-develop</a> the German company's PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab (MSB0010718C). Pfizer executives told <i>Scrip</i><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Pfizer-promotes-underappreciated-RandD-pipeline-356297" target="_new">in January</a> that the deal fits into a cancer immunotherapy strategy that the company has been investing in for five years. </p><p>Pfizer plans to test avelumab in combination with other immuno-oncology assets and targeted cancer therapies, such as the company's Inlyta (axitinib) and Xalkori (crizotinib). Pfizer's pipeline also includes cancer vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies and drugs specific to other immune system targets, like 41-BB and OX40. </p><p>"We expect to have five different [immuno-oncology] drugs in the clinic this year and up to 10 different drugs by 2016," Mr Read said during Pfizer's earnings call. </p><p>He said the company will initiate as many as six Phase III clinical trials in partnership with Merck KGaA to test avelumab in lung, ovarian, renal, bladder and gastric cancers.</p><p>In terms of its PCSK9 program, Pfizer is on track to share results from its cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) for bococizumab in early 2018, which may keep the company's biologic competitive with the two leading PCSK9 competitors whose CVOT data are expected in 2017.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/SanofiRegeneron-win-1st-US-PCSK9-OK-with-Praluent-359621" target="_new">FDA approved</a> Regeneron's and Sanofi's Praluent (alirocumab) on 24 July and Amgen is expected to win FDA approval in August for Repatha (evolocumab). Pfizer hopes that bococizumab will be approved with a broad label based on the company's CVOT results around the same time that Regeneron, Sanofi and Amgen seek expanded labels for their PCSK9 inhibitors. </p><p><b>Acquisitions remain on the table</b></p><p>Fighting back against losses of patent exclusivity for key products &ndash; the arthritis pain drug Celebrex (celecoxib) and antibiotic Zyvox (linezolid) in the US and Lyrica (pregabalin) for nerve and muscle pain in the EU &ndash; Pfizer said it will continue to add assets to its pipeline via business development deals. </p><p>"While we have seen strong performance from our recent product launches, over the next few years we are looking at business development as a way to invest in generating sustained near-term and future growth knowing that the next wave of our potential major registrations or launches won't happen until 2017," Mr Read said.</p><p>He noted that the company has looked at essentially all of the transactions taking place in the industry and passed on a lot of those opportunities, because many of the assets or companies that were for sale did not meet Pfizer's strategic or financial priorities.</p><p>Mr Read emphasized that Pfizer won't be the highest bidder just for the sake of winning a bidding war, noting that: "We have the financial capacity to actually seek out the right deals at the right price that will create value for our shareholders."</p><p>He also noted that the company is more likely to invest in assets or companies that boost Pfizer's innovative drug portfolio rather than its established product portfolio, since the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Wheres-the-value-in-Pfizers-17bn-Hospira-buy-356578" target="_new">pending $17bn acquisition</a> of Hospira was a significant addition this year on the established side of the business.</p><p>Pfizer still is considering breaking up into two different businesses &ndash; innovative brands and established products &ndash; but the company has given itself until the end of 2016 to make a final decision. </p><p>Chief financial officer Frank D'Amelio said during Pfizer's earnings call that the company has spent about $300m to date on efforts to determine whether a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Major-acquisition-still-on-the-table-for-Pfizer-in-2015-358097" target="_new">breakup</a> is in the best interests of Pfizer and its shareholders, including $164m spent so far this year.</p><p>Pfizer's stock price gained almost 3% on 28 July to close at $35.35 per share following the company's second quarter earnings report.</p><p><p><p><p>
