<p>The FDA on 26 May said it was delaying until 8 September compliance with a requirement to electronically submit postmarketing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of adverse events linked to drugs and biologics.</p><p>The rule takes effect on 10 June, but regulators said they are allowing more time to comply for those who need to register for an account and test the submission process of the ICSRs using the new online Safety Reporting Portal (SRP).</p><p>The FDA's other option for submitting ICSRs is by directly sending them through the agency's "Electronic Submissions Gateway." </p><p>But the new SRP "creates a simple and efficient mechanism" for electronic reporting of ICSRs that does not require an internal database that is compatible with the International Conference on Harmonization-based direct submission system, the FDA said in a <i>Federal Register</i> notice posted online on 26 May.</p><p>Regulators said the new portal is intended to facilitate the secure electronic submission of postmarketing ICSRs and attachments to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, or FAERS.</p><p>To use the SRP, the ICSR information is entered manually into a web-based form and then submitted to FDA to be uploaded into the FAERS database, the agency explained.</p><p>The SRP may be used by anyone subject to mandatory postmarketing safety reporting requirements &ndash;manufacturers, packers and distributors &ndash; and firms seeking approval of drugs, biologics and generics.</p><p>The online portal also may be used by companies without approved applications, like compounding entities that are registered with the FDA as outsourcing facilities, regulators said.</p><p>The FDA noted that it will continue to accept postmarketing ICSRs submitted on the 3500A paper forms for 90 days after 10 June. </p><p>But the FDA said it expects full compliance with its final rule by 8 September.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
