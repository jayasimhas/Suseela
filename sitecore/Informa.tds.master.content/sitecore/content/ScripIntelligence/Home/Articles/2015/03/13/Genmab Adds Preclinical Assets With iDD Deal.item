<p>Antibody drug maker Genmab enhanced its intellectual property portfolio and preclinical pipeline on 18 March, paying &euro;2.5m ($2.66m) upfront to France's iDD Biotech SAS. Under the terms of the deal, Genmab will receive the rights to several antibodies and the related patents that are directed at the DR5 target. DR5, also known as TRAIL Receptor 2, is an emerging cancer target. While the assets are still preclinical, iDD is eligible to receive up to &euro;101.5m in development and sales milestones, as well as single-digit royalties on any products that reach commercialization. The iDD antibodies and patents will complement Genmab's existing portfolio, which includes the already-marketed chronic lymphocytic leukemia drug Arzerra (ofatumumab) and the Phase III multiple myeloma treatment daratumumab (<a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Genmab-rises-on-Phase-II-daratumumab-promise-in-double-refractory-myeloma-356537" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 04 February 2015</a>). </p><p><p>
