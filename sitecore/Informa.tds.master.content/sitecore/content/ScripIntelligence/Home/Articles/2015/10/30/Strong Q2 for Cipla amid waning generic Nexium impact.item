<p>Cipla reported robust growth in the second quarter ended September buoyed by one-off revenues from the US, but the company sought to temper full year top-line expectations in view of the strong showing in the first half. </p><p>Cipla said that while the outlook for 2015-16 remained "positive", growth in the second half was likely to be lower than in the first six months. Revenues in the first half were up 33.1% and the company expects full year top-line growth to be 20-22% over the previous year. </p><p>The company reported a 24.8% increase in revenues to INR34.52bn ($527m) during the second quarter ended September, while net profits leapt 44.4% to INR4.31bn during the period.</p><p>Formulation exports increased by 51.3% to INR18.74bn; export growth includes supplies of generic <i>Nexium</i> (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules) to Teva. Earlier this year, the FDA approved the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393" target="_new">first generic version</a> of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals. </p><p>Cipla's Global Chief Operating Officer, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, though explained that the "impact" of esomeprazole revenues in the quarter was "significantly lower" than in the first quarter.</p><p>"We expect a further decline going forward," Priyadarshi said in an investor call on Nov. 5.</p><p>Competition in the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Plan-B-takes-Dr-Reddys-Into-Hot-US-Nexium-Market-360726" target="_new">generic Nexium</a> space in the US has been on the rise, with a clutch of players including Mylan and Dr Reddy's Laboratories launching their products. </p><p>Cipla continues to manufacture generic <i>Pulmicort Respules</i> for partner Sandoz, which has launched all three strengths in the US, the Indian firm said. Sandoz had in July announced the introduction in the US of its budesonide inhalation suspension, a generic version of AstraZeneca's Pulmicort Respules inhalation suspension 1mg.</p><p>Exports of active pharmaceutical ingredients stood at INR2.26bn (+61%)</p><p>Domestic sales were flat at INR12.62bn during the quarter. The domestic Rx business grew in line with industry but the generics business declined by 20% due to portfolio rationalization and a seasonal impact due to a higher dependence on the acute portfolio.</p><p>Priyadarshi said that the firm had past done multiple in-licensing deals recently to augment the portfolio in niche high value areas like dermatology, which will start showing a "positive impact" in the balance of the year. </p><p>"We are confident of returning back to our earlier level of 15-16% growth in our Rx business by the end of the year," Priyadarshi said.</p><p>Cipla also expects to complete its $550m acquisition of InvaGen Pharmaceutical Inc. and Exelan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in the US by the end of December 2015. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-Injects-Scale-With-550m-US-Buy-360253" target="_new">acquisition</a>, announced in September, is expected to arm Cipla with a ready basket of on-market generic drugs and attractive filings in addition to a manufacturing base as it ramps up in the US. </p><p>The company's top brass, though, declined to provide any update on the Form 483 issued by the FDA against InvaGen's plant in Hauppauge earlier this year. A form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p>
