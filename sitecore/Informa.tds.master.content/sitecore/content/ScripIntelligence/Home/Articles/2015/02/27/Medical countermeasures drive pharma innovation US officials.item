<p>While the initial US response to the current Ebola crisis got off to a bumpy start, the fact there are two vaccines in efficacy trials in West Africa and several drugs in development against the deadly disease is proof the medical countermeasure (MCM) system is working, top officials insisted during testimony at a 26 February Capitol Hill hearing.</p><p>"We've now shown that with emerging infectious diseases, we can rapidly prepare and rapidly respond, actually doing things much earlier in the pipeline than we normally would," declared Dr Robin Robinson, director of the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).</p><p>But he also acknowledged that MCM research and development is "risky, lengthy and expensive, with many inexperienced developers failing."</p><p>Dr Robinson pointed out that in the past, many larger pharmaceutical companies avoided the MCM sector altogether.</p><p>But that has changed in recent years, with BARDA entering into contracts with firms like GlaxoSmithKline, which received funding to develop new antibiotics and also sold several thousand doses of its anthrax antitoxin to BARDA for the government's stockpile, and most recently with Merck, which won $30m, along with its partner NewLink Genetics, to support the development an experimental Ebola vaccine &ndash; one of the two currently being tested in West Africa (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-BARDA-antibiotic-pact-1st-biothreat-portfolio-response-343456" target="_new">23 May 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-wins-196m-US-BARDA-contract-for-anthrax-antitoxin-raxibacumab-346711" target="_new">20 September 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BARDA-grants-30m-to-advance-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-355800" target="_new">22 December 2014</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">3 February 2015</a>).</p><p>But much of BARDA's funding goes towards smaller firms to help them bridge the critical gap between early seed funding and when venture capitalists or other investors back the R&D process &ndash; the so-called "valley of death, Dr Robinson told members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.</p><p>BARDA transitions product candidates from early development into advanced development towards FDA approval and potential procurement through direct funding, public-private partnerships and technical core service assistance programs, he said. </p><p>BARDA was created in 2006 under the <i>Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act</i> (PAHPA) and was reauthorized in 2013 by the <i>Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act</i> for the purpose of accelerating the development of MCMs against biological threats, such Ebola and pandemic flu (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Whos-your-daddy-Obama-signs-PAHPA-reauthorization-341163" target="_new">14 March 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Too-late-to-stop-the-slow-grind-budget-damage-to-FDA-NIH-340476" target="_new">4 March 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/House-embraces-PAHPA-Reauthorizes-bill-critical-to-US-countermeasures-339284" target="_new">23 January 2013</a>).</p><p>Because there is no commercial market for MCMs, Congress also established Project BioShield, which is responsible for procuring countermeasures for stockpiling.</p><p>BARDA also has unique fast-track contracting authority, which is intended to help promising drugs move faster from clinical trials to production. </p><p>"BARDA is living up to PAHPA's mission of making our country better prepared and security against threats with the right medical countermeasures," Dr Robinson said. </p><p>Before PAHPA, the nation's MCM product development pipeline was "very small" &ndash; primarily focusing on anthrax, smallpox and pandemic influenza, he said. </p><p>But now, Dr Robinson said there are more than 160 MCMs in the development pipeline for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats and pandemic flu. </p><p>Eight of those products have received the FDA's approval in the past three years alone, with close to 20 gaining the agency's blessing since 2007, he said.</p><p>Dr Robinson said 12 products, including anthrax and smallpox vaccines and anti-neutropenia cytokine therapeutics for radiation illness, have been procured under Project BioShield, with another 12 in development, with expectations they will be ready for the government to buy by fiscal year 2018.</p><p>"We are driving innovation," Dr Robinson declared. </p><p>"A huge focus of our efforts is on innovation and new and better ways to do things &ndash; faster, better, cheaper," said Dr Nicole Lurie, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, whose office oversees BARDA. </p><p>Since 2010, BARDA has moved away from "one bug, one drug," to platforms, new technologies that can make MCMs quickly, Dr Lurie explained. </p><p>BARDA, she said, "has been a catalyst for a number of new technologies that we are seeing play out right in front of us with Ebola with new ways of making monoclonal antibodies."</p><p>Indeed, BARDA revealed just two days earlier that it had awarded contracts to biotech Medicago and nonprofit research and development firm Fraunhofer to make drugs similar to ZMapp, which is made of three monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured in tobacco-based plants, known as Nicotiana (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BARDA-funds-ZMapp-like-Ebola-drugs-from-Medicago-Fraunhofer-356931" target="_new">25 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Medicago and Fraunhofer will use their own proprietary tobacco expression systems to produce the antibodies.</p><p>BARDA also is looking at monoclonal antibodies that might work against multiple strains of influenza. </p><p>The agency also is supporting the development of stem cell therapies for radiological illnesses &ndash; something Dr Robinson said "that one would never have even thought about."</p><p>"We are at the cutting edge of innovation," he contended. </p><p>And as far as it goes for the assessment of novel MCM products for US approval, "We love innovation," declared Dr Luciana Borio, director of the FDA's Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats and acting deputy chief scientist. </p><p>"We are always looking for a way to engage and to support development of those products" she said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
