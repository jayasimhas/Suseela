<p>The future of AM Pharma is now largely in the hands of clinical and business decision-makers at Big Pharma. The Dutch biotech announced late on 11 May that Pfizer had spent $87.5m on an option to acquire the company for $600m. The option matures when the Phase II clinical trial in Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) of AM Pharma's lead product, recombinant alkaline phosphatase (recAP) is complete, sometime after the end of 2016. The option fee will go straight to shareholders, CEO Erik van den Berg told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>$87.5m is almost exactly the dollar equivalent of the &euro;65m that has been invested in AM Pharma since its founding in 2001.</p><p><i>Scrip</i> put it to AM Pharma's chair, Russell Greig, that the decision to distribute Pfizer's option fee directly to shareholders rather than fund further clinical programs or accrete corporate capital meant that the option was, in reality, a one way ticket to Pfizer: either the company becomes part of Pfizer, or it doesn't &ndash; in which case AM Pharma will be a company with a product that has either failed or underperformed, a company that is running out of cash, and that has lost a partner.</p><p>"We always have a Plan B," Dr Greig said, "We have to do that as a fiduciary duty." Pressed for what 'Plan B' might look like, he said: "If Pfizer declines the option, we would have to evaluate whether we agreed with their assessment of the trial result." He added that he thought Plan A &ndash;Pfizer taking up the option &ndash; was "the more likely". </p><p>"The option fee of $87.5m has satisfied all of the shareholders," said Dr Greig. "If Pfizer doesn't pick up the option, the company will continue to explore the use of recAP in AKI and ulcerative colitis. The company is financially healthy with enough financial 'runway' to take it beyond the completion of the trial."</p><p>Mr van den Berg added, "The idea of Pfizer seeing positive data from the Phase II trial, and not proceeding with the option, is a highly unlikely scenario. However, there are mechanisms within the contract that would enable AM-Pharma to regain control of the programs from Pfizer, and there are sufficient funds within the Company to create and alternative future."</p><p><p>Clarifying the terms of the deal, Mr van den Berg said that "Either Pfizer will exercise or not &ndash; they will own all the programs and assets of the company. All our programs are based on alkaline phosphatase, a connection that means that the options to split products out were unlikely." As well as the phase II on recAP in Acute Kidney Injury, and preclinical data in the treatment of the ultra-rare disease hypophosphatasia, AM Pharma is developing an oral form of recAP for ulcerative colitis.</p><p>Russell Greig concurred. "There are too many seasoned pharma people around the AM Pharma board. We didn't envisage that any company would have tolerated licensing indication by indication: that's an idea with a half-life somewhere between milk and yoghurt."</p><p><p>The current Phase II trial for recAP began in December 2014 and results are expected in the second half of 2016. Neither AM Pharma chair nor CEO could tell <i>Scrip</i> how long after completion Pfizer had to take up its option. Furthermore, it was not clear that that criterion for success or failure of the trial had been agreed by the two parties. "That depends on Pfizer", said Dr Greig, "Trying to anticipate the criteria at this stage would be difficult."</p><p>However, AM Pharma has a reason to anticipate a positive outcome for the recAP trial; this current trial is its second phase II trial of alkaline phosphatase in acute kidney disease. Back in 2010, it reported "stellar" data from a 36-person trial showing that a bovine form of alkaline phosphatase improved renal function and reduced length of stay at intensive care units. </p><p>Having determined that a bovine product, although palpably effective, might face additional commercial hurdles, AM Pharma raised another &euro;40m of venture capital in two tranches to allow it to develop recombinant human alkaline phosphatase. At the end of the current Phase II trial, Pfizer will have data from an additional 290 patients on which to base its acquisition decision. </p><p>
