<p>Advaxis and Incyte, two active collaborators in the immuno-oncology field, will test their drugs together in cervical cancer. The companies will co-fund and conduct a 20-patient Phase II clinical trial starting later this year to evaluate the Advaxis immunotherapy ADXS-HPV alone and in combination with Incyte's indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor epacadostat (INCB24360) in women with Stage 1 to 2a human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cervical cancer.</p><p>Princeton, New Jersey-based Advaxis announced last year that it will test ADXS-HPV in combination with AstraZeneca's programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor MEDI4736 and in August the company said it would evaluate its prostate cancer immunotherapy ADXS-PSA in combination with Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab), a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Advaxis-to-fund-combination-trial-with-AstraZenecas-MEDI4736-352980" target="_new">22 July 2014</a>).</p><p>Incyte also struck deals last year to test epacadostat in combination with Roche/Genentech's PDL-1 inhibitor MPDL3280A in lung cancer, AstraZeneca's MEDI4736 in lung and other solid tumors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck's Keytruda in lung and other cancers (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Genentech-combo-deal-Incyte-bags-another-anti-PD-bigshot-353108" target="_new">30 July</a>, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Bristol-Myers-Incyte-to-study-PD-1IDO1-combination-352007" target="_new">28 May</a>, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-partners-with-Pfizer-Amgen-and-Incyte-to-study-promising-cancer-drug-349840" target="_new">5 February 2014</a>).</p><p><b>ADDF, Pfizer combine resources for Alzheimer's drug research</b></p><p>The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) and Pfizer's Centers for Therapeutic Innovation (CTI) will invest in translational research projects focused on novel Alzheimer's drug targets with the goal of developing new small molecules for Alzheimer's and related dementias. Pfizer scientists and academic researchers affiliated with the big pharma company's CTI network will collaborate on ADDF and CTI-funded projects. The first application deadline for funding from the partners was due on 13 February.</p><p>"By leveraging our combined resources and proficiency, we believe we can speed up the discovery and development of new drugs for Alzheimer's disease and potentially benefit tens of millions of people," ADDF executive director and chief scientific officer Howard Fillit said in a joint statement with Pfizer. </p><p>The ADDF has given more than $70m to academic and biotechnology company researchers to fund 450 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs. Pfizer unveiled the CTI in 2010 and since then it has established partnerships with 25 academic centers and five foundations (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizer-kick-starts-academic-collaboration-initiative-with-UCSF-deal-306065" target="_new">17 November 2010</a>).</p><p>Going a few steps further than the ADDF-CTI alliance, the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) recently launched the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) collaboration with multiple stakeholders to advance drug candidates previously vetted in Phase I clinical trials into Phase II (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Overcoming-the-Alzheimers-challenge-I-SPY-style-356550" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>).</p><p><b>Affinivax gets PATH funding for pneumonia vaccine</b></p><p>Affinivax will collaborate with PATH &ndash; the nonprofit organization focused on bringing novel vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to the developing world &ndash; to advance the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's lead vaccine candidate for Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). PATH will assist Affinivax with product development, preclinical testing and manufacturing to identify a candidate to take into clinical trials. </p><p>The support comes less than four months after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation invested $4m in Affinivax's Multiple Antigen Presenting System (MAPS) platform for novel vaccines (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Five-VC-deals-three-public-financings-and-a-round-of-layoffs-354796" target="_new">31 October 2014</a>). MAPS enables high affinity bonding of protective polysaccharides and proteins in a single vaccine for a method of vaccine development that may be less costly than traditional vaccine platforms with products that induce a broader immune response. </p><p><b>Intrexon buying ActoGeniX for $30m cash and $30m stock</b></p><p>Germantown, Maryland-based synthetic biology company Intrexon is buying ActoGenix of Ghent, Belgium for $30m in cash and $30m in stock. Intrexon closed up 2.8% at $39.30 per share on 13 February, a new all-time for the company, after its initial public offering at $16 per share in August 2013 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/IPO-UPDATE-Intrexon-rises-81-in-2-days-also-Sophiris-Ruthigen-Acceleron-Iroko-345804" target="_new">10 August 2013</a>).</p><p>Intrexon will incorporate ActoGeniX's TopAct platform into its menu of product development technologies available for licensing to various partners. TopAct enables molecular engineering of food-grade microbes (Lactococcus lactis) to create novel therapeutic proteins and peptides for the targeted treatment of oral, gastrointestinal, metabolic, allergic and autoimmune diseases.</p><p><b>Four financings: Achillion, Idera, Melinta, Transition</b></p><p>*Basking in the glow of recently positive clinical trial results for its hepatitis C therapies, Achillion Pharmaceuticals priced 12m shares at $10.25 for net proceeds of $115.3m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Achillion-Regulus-chase-shorter-HCV-regimens-but-can-they-beat-Gilead-356631" target="_new">10 February 2015</a>). The cash will fund multiple clinical trials evaluating the potential for different combinations of lead drug candidates ACH-3102, ACH-3422 and sovaprevir to shorten the duration of hepatitis C treatment to as little as four weeks.</p><p>*Idera Pharmaceuticals will gross $75m from the sale of 20m shares priced at $3.75 each to advance clinical development of multiple programs. The Cambridge, Massachusetts and Exton, Pennsylvania-based company is developing drugs that modulate the activity of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas and rare and autoimmune diseases as well as gene-silencing oligonucleotides.</p><p>*Hercules Technology Growth Capital gave New Haven, Connecticut-based Melinta Therapeutics up to $30m in debt financing to complete a second Phase III clinical trial for the antibiotic delafloxacin and advance a new drug candidate into the clinic. The first $20m was loaned to Melinta in December and the last $10m will be provided in 2015 upon the achievement of certain milestones. The company reported positive results for its first Phase III study of delafloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in January (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Melinta-reports-Phase-III-success-for-antibiotic-356052" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>).</p><p>*Transition Therapeutics of Toronto, Ontario, Canada will gross $20m from the sale of 3.1m shares priced at $6.50 each to fund clinical trials for its drugs that treat central nervous system (CNS) and metabolic diseases, including ELND005 for Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome and TT401 (LY2944876) for type 2 diabetes and accompanying obesity.</p><p><b>Two IPOs launch, two companies file to go public</b></p><p>Only two drug development firms launched initial public offerings during the week of 9 to 13 February &ndash; two more than during the prior week &ndash; and neither company raised as much as they intended originally. That may be why only two more therapeutics companies filed for IPOs during the same week.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Company</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>IPO news</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Bellerophon Therapeutics;</p><p>Hampton, New Jersey</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Bellerophon sold 5m shares at $12 each for $60m in gross proceeds to fund development of the company's device-delivered therapies for cardiopulmonary and cardiac diseases.
