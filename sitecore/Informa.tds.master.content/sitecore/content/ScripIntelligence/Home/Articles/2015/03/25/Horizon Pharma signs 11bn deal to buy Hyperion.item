<p> Dublin-based Horizon Pharma is to acquire Hyperion Therapeutics in an all-cash deal worth $1.1bn or $46.00 per share, about a 35% premium to its average share price for the past 60 days. </p><p> The deal, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies, brings Horizon two orphan drugs, Ravicti and Buphenyl, to add to the five it already has and will &quot;expand the infrastructure&quot; of its orphan disease business, it says. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter to be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. Horizon expects sales of the two drugs in 2016 will add approximately $100m to its adjusted EBITDA, including cost synergies contributing more than $50m. </p><p> Both Ravicti and Buphenyl treat urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which affect around 2,100 people in the US, with approximately 1,100 diagnosed. Ravicti has also been filed in the EU, where the prevalence of UCD is similar to the US. Together they had net sales in the fourth quarter and full year 2014 of $30.8m and $113.6m, respectively, with Ravicti generating $94.4m in 2014. </p><p> The only cure for these diseases is liver transplant, but Ravicti was approved in the US in February 2013 for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of UCDs for patients greater than two years of age who cannot manage their treatment by dietary protein restrictions and or amino acid supplementation alone. It is approved for seven of the eight UCD subtypes, and is a tasteless oral liquid taken three times a day &ndash; a benefit over the older treatment sodium phenylbutyrate, which requires the administration of 20-40 pills per day and is associated with a severe body odor. The sodium content of the older product can also sometimes mean dietary restrictions for patients. </p><p> Buphenyl is a branded generic of sodium phenylbutyrate which is approved for three of the eight UCD subtypes which Hyperion acquired as part of its strategy to penetrate this market more fully. It is available in tablet or powder form and is can be prescribed to patients with neonatal onset and for those who are reluctant to switch to Ravicti. </p><p> Ravicti is currently undergoing clinical development in UCD patients younger than two years, and also younger than two months. A supplemental NDA filing is expected in the second quarter of 2016 for patients two months to two years of age, and year-end 2017 for patients less than two months of age. &quot;These patient age groups are important for marketing purposes and we believe can expand Ravicti uptake,&quot; said Tim Walbert, chairmen, president and CEO of Horizon in a conference call announcing the deal. </p><p> The EU approval application has been delayed by a request for data in patients as young as two months of age. Responses to CHMP are due in late April of this year. &quot;We expect a decision from CHMP in Europe late this year or early 2016.&quot; Late-stage label negotiations are ongoing in Canada, with marketing approval expected in the second half of 2015. </p><p> Ravicti has orphan drug exclusivity till February 2020 and also has two method of use patents expiring in 2030 and 2032 respectively. </p><p> &quot;One of our key priorities as we incorporate all these products into our commercial portfolio will be to further expand on our current efforts to transition Buphenyl patients to Ravicti. In addition, we will leverage our current orphan disease infrastructure to enhance the market penetration of Ravicti. Our priorities will include increase in direct to patient communications, providing significant physician education, and support of the benefits of Ravicti over Buphenyl, and drive increased diagnosis and in particular expanding newborn screening for UCDs,&quot; said Walbert. </p><h2> financing </h2><p> Horizon has secured $900m in debt commitments from Citigroup Global Capital Markets and Jefferies, which in addition to Horizon's cash and cash equivalents is available to finance the transaction, repay Horizon's $300m Senior Secured Credit Facility and pay fees as well as expenses related to the transaction. </p>
