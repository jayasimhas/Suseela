<p>Kura Oncology raised $60m in a private placement and plans to complete a reverse merger into a public company to support Phase II clinical trials for tipifarnib, a drug for which Johnson & Johnson's Janssen subsidiary suspended development in multiple cancer indications in 2008. </p><p>San Diego-based Kura is run by veterans of the PI3K inhibitor pioneer Intellikine, which Takeda acquired for up to $310m in late 2011 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Takeda-snags-Intellikine-in-bid-to-bolster-oncology-pipeline-325042" target="_new">21 December 2011</a>). Kura will focus on development of "precision medicines" that work well in genetically defined groups of patients, such as individuals whose tumors have RAS genetic mutations activated by farnesyl transferase, the target for tipifarnib. The previously abandoned drug appears to work particularly well in tumors with H-RAS mutations.</p><p>"I like to think of it as a drug ahead of its time," Kura president and CEO Troy Wilson told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Janssen tried to develop its farnesyl transferase inhibitor in an era when many cancer patients were not screened for genetic mutations that could be treated with targeted therapies, but the technology is available now to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from tipifarnib.</p><p><b>Financing for a new public company</b></p><p>"Kura is a new company formed to focus on a handful of assets where we think we can create real value for patients and, by extension, for shareholders," Dr Wilson said.</p><p>Kura's private placement was backed primarily by crossover investors that support private companies with near-term plans to enter the public market. Kura will complete a reverse merger with Zeta Acquisition Corp III, a public company with no prior business operations, and eventually will list its stock on the Over-the-Counter (OTC) Markets.</p><p>EcoR1 Capital led the private placement with participation from Fidelity Management & Research, ARCH Venture Partners, Boxer Capital of Tavistock Life Sciences, Partner Fund Management and other health care investors. </p><p>Dr Wilson said Kura chose the private placement and reverse merger route, because it provided the capital needed for development of tipifarnib as well as the ability for Kura to control when it goes public and at what terms. </p><p><b>Use of proceeds</b></p><p>Kura will use the funding to initiate a Phase II clinical trial for tipifarnib in the treatment of H-RAS mutant solid tumors in the second quarter of 2015. A Phase II trial in the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphomas will begin in the third quarter. The solid tumor study will enroll patients in two cohorts: one group with thyroid cancer and another with various types of tumors that highly express the H-RAS mutation, such as breast, bladder and urothelial cancers.</p><p>"Ten years ago, you couldn't run that trial. We know much more today than 15 or 20 years about how to target oncogenes," Dr Wilson said.</p><p>Both Phase II studies for tipifarnib will be single-arm, open-label, response-driven clinical trials. It should take about a year to recruit patients for each study and Kura expects to report response rate data from both trials while they are ongoing. </p><p><b>Background research</b></p><p>Kura initially formed in late 2014 to take a look at genetic mutations in cancer and translate the observations into drug candidates. RAS was one of the pathways that caught the company's interest early on, because patients with H-RAS mutations still are underserved by approved RAF inhibitors, such as Nexavar (sorafenib) and Stivarga (regorafenib) from Bayer and Amgen, as well as MEK inhibitors like Novartis's Mekinist (trametinib), which act on RAS.</p><p>Preclinical studies for tipifarnib in solid tumors show that the drug should work in H-RAS mutant cancer patients, while an early clinical trial conducted by the Mayo Clinic showed responses in subsets of patients with hematological malignancies. </p><p>Janssen failed to win US FDA approval for tipifarnib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2005 and by 2008 suspended development of the drug in AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, breast and pancreatic cancer, according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker database (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Johnson-and-Johnsons-tipifarnib-non-approvable-after-US-panel-thumbs-down-71244" target="_new">6 July 2005</a>).</p><p>However, based on the preclinical and clinical data reviewed by Kura, Janssen was willing to license tipifarnib to the company for oncology indications and the J&J subsidiary maintained a first right of negotiation to regain the drug if it works in Kura's clinical trials.</p><p>EB Pharma, a subsidiary of Eiger BioPharmaceuticals in Palo Alto, California, licensed tipifarnib from Janssen in December for virology indications, including a preclinical program for the treatment of hepatitis delta virus.</p><p>Kura's preclinical assets include an ERK1 inhibitor, which also will be developed to treat patients with RAS mutations, and a Menin MLL inhibitor. The ERK1 inhibitor will enter the clinic in early 2016, but the Menin MLL inhibitor is in earlier stages of preclinical development.</p><p><p><p><p>
