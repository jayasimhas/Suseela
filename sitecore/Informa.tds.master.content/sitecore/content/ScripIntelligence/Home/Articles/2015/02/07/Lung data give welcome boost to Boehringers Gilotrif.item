<p>Boehringer Ingelheim's Gilotrif (afatinib) has bested Astellas and Roche's Tarceva (erlotinib) in a Phase III study directly comparing the two therapies in advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung. </p><p>Data from the LUX-Lung 8 trial, the largest prospective Phase III head-to-head trial directly comparing two epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) directed treatments, have been published in <i>The Lancet Oncology</i>. Boehringer said it was "preparing regulatory submissions" for the product as a second-line therapy in SCC lung cancer patients on the back of the positive head-to-head trial results. The drug is already approved in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </p><p>Data from the LUX-Lung 8 study, which included 795 eligible patients randomly assigned to treatment arms (398 to afatinib, 397 to erlotinib), showed that treatment with Boehringer's product resulted in superior progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint) and overall survival (OS; key secondary endpoint) compared to Tarceva in this patient population. </p><p>Gilotrif extended OS of patients to a median of 7.9 months compared to 6.8 months on Tarceva, reducing the risk of death by 19%.<sup>Â </sup>In an updated PFS analysis, performed at the time of the OS analysis, patients treated with Gilotrif had a median PFS of 2.6 months compared to 1.9 months for Tarceva.</p><p>Treatment options for SCC of the lung are limited and this type of lung cancer is associated with a poor prognosis, with less than 5% of patients with advanced SCC surviving for five years or longer, Boehringer noted. </p><h2>Trouble outside of lung cancer</h2><p>Gilotrif's superior efficacy in SCC is a boost for Boehringer, which had been riding a rocky road recently with development activities of the drug, which have been suspended in several other oncological indications. However, it still doesn't help expand the product's use outside of lung cancer indications. </p><p>Late in 2014, Boehringer <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Its-curtains-for-BIs-Gilotrif-in-breast-cancer-355665" target="_new">pulled the plug</a> on studies of the product in breast cancer and according to Sagient Research's BioMedTracker, an affiliate of <i>Scrip,</i> the drug has also been suspended in prostate cancer and brain cancer. It has received a "program hold" in colorectal cancer. </p><p>Gilotrif is currently in development for head and neck cancer where it is being tested in Phase III trials, and solid tumors, currently in Phase I. However, BioMedTracker currently has the product's likelihood of approval rating for head and neck cancer at 33%, 2% below the average rating for a drug at a similar stage of development. The drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/OS-no-show-for-afatinib-in-PhIII-head-and-neck-trial-354227" target="_new">met its primary endpoint</a> of significantly delaying tumor growth versus chemotherapy in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer in a recent Phase III study in this indication late in 2014. But some observers raised concerns over the failure of the trial to demonstrate overall survival benefit.</p><p>Gilotrif is a novel, irreversibly binding inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. It is approved in a number of markets, including the EU, Japan, Taiwan and Canada under the brand name Giotrif and in the US under the brand name Gilotrif for use in patients with distinct types of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.</p><p><p><p><i>[Ed. This story was corrected on 9 July 2015. It previously stated that Gilotrif failed to meet its primary endpoint in a Phase III study in head and neck cancer. This has been corrected to note the study did meet its primary endpoint but failed to show OS benefit.]</i></p><p>
