<p>Prashant Tewari, managing director of the Indian generic firm USV is confident of the sustained dominance of oral medications in the diabetes segment in the country, even as new innovator therapies and strategic investments by foreign firms add to the competitive pressures.</p><p>In a interview with <i>Scrip</i>, Mr Tewari, whose firm accounts for around 16% share of the oral anti-diabetes drugs (OADs) market in India and also co-markets Novartis' vildagliptin, underscored why making a dent in therapies like metformin was akin to ''climbing a mountain'' for entrants and that Sanofi's investment in Apollo Sugar Clinic was unlikely to have a huge impact, at least for now, on the competitive diabetes segment. </p><p>The soft-spoken USV boss also outlined his firm's plans to commence Phase III clinical trials in the EU for PEG-filgrastim and increasing active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supplies to other partners in Japan in addition to Takeda. </p><p>First, his take on diabetes market. Mr Tewari noted that every therapy option in the diabetes segment had its place and claimed that so far no one option had led to the sharp decline of any other option. The only class that may have declined was that of single drug hypoglycemic agents. </p><p>''Insulins and insulin analogues have been around for almost ever&#8230;..diabetes is a highly underdiagnosed disease, so from our perspective oral drugs are the starting point and for a significant part of the life time oral drugs can manage the disease quite well,'' Mr Tewari said. </p><p>The Indian diabetes market is valued at around INR64bn($1.02bn) and growing at 22%, of which oral anti-diabetes therapies account for roughly INR49.5bn (+23%).Almost 90% of prescriptions in India are said to be for oral anti-diabetes drugs. </p><p>India has more than 63 million diabetics but just 6 million are estimated to get ''appropriate" treatment, some leading diabetologists say. </p><p>Novo Nordisk has launched Tresiba (insulin degludec) and the combination product Ryzodeg (insulin degludec and insulin aspart) in India, while Sanofi's Lantus (insulin glargine [rDNA] injection) continues its strong run in the country, though Mr Tewari did not appear unduly perturbed by either given USV's position in the OAD's segment. </p><p>''There are two markets over here and there's overlap between the two. As long as we make sure our options can address the needs of physicians and patients, we are in a comfortable space but not complacent. Obviously it&rsquo;s a very competitive market. Almost every fifth prescription is a USV drug&#8230; It's a pretty strong leadership,'' he noted. </p><p>Besides compliance issues with injectables, modern therapies are also not inexpensive, he noted. </p><p>USV's OAD revenues are in the region of INR7bn (+23%). USV's own insulin product, Mr Tewari says, is not a ''focus'' and has been ''declining'' &ndash; a scenario he adds he is ''ok with''.</p><p>On whether recent innovations in the metformin space by competition had impacted sales, Mr Tewari said that it was a ''mountain to climb'' for any company making inroads into that segment. </p><p>''The price is very low, it's in NLEM [drugs on India's national list of essential medicines have price caps], units are mind bogglingly large. We do roughly INR1bn [sales] in metformin. It&rsquo;s a marathon to run to reach significant size. Nothing happens overnight in this market,'' he said. Dr Reddy's Laboratories had earlier introduced Metsmall, a smaller tablet of metformin for patient convenience, and is said to have received an encouraging initial response.</p><p>Referring to the leadership position of USV's Glycomet (metformin), Mr Tewari noted how the 30-year old brand had penetrated ''very deep'' and now ''reached GP [general physician] level''. Glycomet is the market leader in metformin space and the number one prescribed brand in OAD market. </p><p>USV's generic versions of Byetta (exenatide) and Victoza (liraglutide) are also available on certain international markets, while sitagliptin in another product the firm is working on, though again not targeted at the Indian market.</p><h2>Sanofi </h2><p>The USV boss also sees no major impact, at least for now, of Sanofi's investment in Apollo Sugar Clinics that provide integrated diabetes care programs in India.</p><p>While there are clearly no indications of any preferential treatment for Sanofi products by Apollo, Mr Tewari noted that the sheer complexity of treating diabetes would require access to all therapy options.</p><p>''It is probably more about getting data and things like that,'' he said of Sanofi's strategy.</p><p>Last year, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared Sanofi's proposed plans to acquire 20% per cent of the total equity shareholding and exercise certain rights, in relation to management of Apollo Sugar Clinics. Sanofi can also raise its shareholding to 26%, an option that can be exercised during a certain period of time.</p><p>Some experts had then said the model could give Sanofi ''premium access'' to the massive infrastructure and reach of the Apollo Hospitals group, one of Asia&rsquo;s largest integrated healthcare organizations, and Apollo the backing of one of the world's leading drug makers, though it also raised some tricky questions on purchases from competition <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Why-Novo-may-need-to-watch-Sanofis-Indian-sugar-clinics-play-354320%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 7 October 2014)</a>. </p><p>Mr Tewari also drew parallels with Merck & Co's spin off of Medco Health Solutions, the leading US provider of prescription healthcare services some years ago. Medco was then reported to control the drug benefits of more than 60 million Americans who either got their prescriptions filled at retail drugstores or from Medco's mail-order units. </p><p>''Everybody had to spin it out&#8230; it has not worked anywhere in the world&#8230;.also because of conflict of interest claims,'' he noted.</p><p>''I doubt if Sanofi's move will have a significant impact on the [Indian] market''.</p><h2>Biosims & US </h2><p>USV is also looking at commencing Phase III studies for its biosimilar PEG-filgrastim in Europe.</p><p>''We have the full pathway mapped out from regulatory advice [in Europe] and based on that we will start studies. Europe is much more mature since they have approved biosimilars...their regulators are very well-versed. The risk factor reduces,'' Mr Tewari said. </p><p>For now USV is moving ahead with PEG-filgrastim on its own, though Mr Tewari did not rule out considering alliances for marketing.</p><p>USV is also preparing for a meeting with the FDA to take its biosimilar to the US, but the Mumbai-based firm is not keen on a play, at least currently, in the Indian market, which it believes is ''pretty crowded''.</p><p>''The Indian market has got lots of offerings and discounting is very high. Our present business focus is on diabetes, cardiovasculars, which has given us high growth. We see high potential for a long foreseeable future,'' Mr Tewari added. </p><p>The privately owned USV, with sales of around INR22bn, has held a leading position in the Indian OAD and cardiology market for several years now.</p><p>In the generic space, USV has 14 ANDAs approved in the US. The firm has a marketing alliance with Dr Reddy's Laboratories for products such as glycopyrrolate in the US.</p><p>USV is awaiting four approvals in the US in the next two quarters, which it expects will give it ''critical'' scale.</p><p>''Those four products are very critical for us,'' the USV boss said. He sees a sharp uptick in USV's international to domestic business mix currently at around 25:75, if some of these product opportunities in the US come through.</p><p>He, though, clarified that USV has no intent to ''imitate others'' and may not necessarily chase big generic opportunities such as those for Nexium.</p><p>''Wherever you have the big players with integrated plays and large commodity products, where you have 10s/100s of tonnes of production, we generally stay out. We are taking on niche products&#8230; some complexity,'' Mr Tewari said, but emphasized that there was competition in every space in the US generic market currently.</p>
