<p>Dr Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), said he's "making big plans" for the one-million person national research cohort he was charged last month with establishing by his boss, President Barack Obama. </p><p>And while the NIH chief acknowledged there's many challenges ahead, he said the cohort has been his "dream" to create since he led the effort to sequence the human genome.</p><p>"It's been a little breathtaking to contemplate putting together something on this scale," Dr Collins declared. "But it is magical to be able to contemplate, certainly after some of us have been laboring through this trying to figure out a way to make this happen for more than a decade."</p><p>"This is a wonderful dream," he said. But he admitted it's "a dream that still has lots of parts to be filled out." </p><p>President Obama tasked Dr Collins and his NIH staff with the job of collaborating with the nation's best and brightest experts from multiple sectors to focus on how emerging technologies, like wearable electronics and smart phones, could be combined with human genome sequencing data and patient information from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) to develop and deliver patient-specific therapies &ndash; precision medicine. </p><p>At a two-day meeting at the NIH's campus on 11-12 February, the fundamental question a group of 80-plus scientists from multiple sectors were puzzling over was, "What is the problem the cohort would try to solve?" </p><p>Over the course of the discussions arose some possible uses for the cohort (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Data-security-diversity-debated-at-precision-medicine-Super-Bowl-356706" target="_new">12 February 2015</a>).</p><p>First, Dr Collins said, there will be chances to identify and test a wide variety of biomarkers and predictive strategies for a range of common diseases, "because you'll have opportunities to see who develops those diseases."</p><p>"That is something that could be extremely valuable," he insisted. "Frankly, the genetic part of that will be the smallest part. The part that will probably be most valuable are all the analytes that you're going to be able to track in individuals for whom you have this longitudinal data on this scale. And that ought to be pretty interesting."</p><p>While there are various ways to predict risk of disease &ndash; typically through the use biosamples &ndash; the cohort will provide a way to obtain an unbiased quantitative determination of risk, whether environmental exposure or genetics, Dr Collins explained.</p><p>It also could provide a powerful test bed for mobile applications for health maintenance and chronic disease management "to actually find out do these things work. Do you get data you can trust and do they actually improve outcomes?" he said. </p><p>Dr Collins said the national research cohort also could be the best opportunity for rigorous tests of pharmacogenomics, "because you will have people with genotypes who are going to need drugs prescribed."</p><p>There also could be chances to determine phenotype of loss of function mutations for many human genes &ndash; what Dr Collins referred to as "the human knockout project."</p><p>The one-million person cohort also opens up the potential for improving the use of EHRs, "not just for researchers, but for the participants themselves," he said. </p><p>"We need that kind of laboratory on a scale of this sort to find out how to do this better," Dr Collins said.</p><p>The cohort also could offer an opportunity to examine the ability of healthcare delivery systems to respond quickly to evidence.</p><p>"You have the chance for shortening what otherwise is a dreadfully long cycle time between evidence being generated and evidence being applied in healthcare delivery," Dr Collins said.</p><p>A big question that was raised at the two-day meeting was how to ensure there is the right blend of bringing together existing cohorts and starting new ones.</p><p>"I don't think we can answer that right now, because I'm not sure we've figured out what is the practical potential here of the blend of existing cohorts and if you could do that, what you would be sorry you missed and how you fill that in," Dr Collins said. "That's going to be a very important task for the next step."</p><p>Scientists also pondered over what's unique about establishing a national cohort. </p><p>They also debated why one million was selected as the number needed for the cohort.</p><p>"From the very beginning, I hoped we could consider that a floor and not a ceiling," Dr Collins said. "If we can do more and can afford more, we should do it."</p><p>Dr Collins noted the scientists at the forum also wrangled over ensuring the cohort examines addressing health disparities &ndash; something he said is a "high priority in this country, not only to identify what the causes are but the interventions that would actually improve that situation."</p><p>"If we miss that opportunity with this kind of a large-scale cohort, we will, I think, be very regretful, as will the entire nation," he said.</p><p>The question of whether children should be included in the cohort also was discussed, but there was no consensus reached.</p><p>"That's going to require more attention" beyond the two-day discussion, Dr Collins said. </p><p>Also needing further examination and debate is whether to link up with other international cohort projects, he said.</p><p>One big concern the NIH must face is ensuring sustainability of the cohort, given Congress' poor track record on funding the agency in recent years, he noted.</p><p>But Dr Collins said he remains optimistic, especially given the interest in the precision medicine initiative &ndash; not just from President Obama, who first announced his plan during his State of the Union address, officially unveiling it 10 days later &ndash; but from the public (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-launches-precision-medicine-initiative-details-scarce-356275" target="_new">21 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Obama-unveils-215m-bold-precision-medicine-initiative-356457" target="_new">30 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-NIH-seeks-collaborators-for-large-genetics-data-cohort-356479" target="_new">2 February 2015</a>).</p><p>Indeed, over the course of the NIH's two-day forum, there were about 2,400 people observing the meeting via videocast or WebEx, with vigorous activity on Twitter, in which there were nearly 4,000 tweets about the discussion. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
