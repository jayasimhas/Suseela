<p>Shares of Tekmira jumped 6.7% on 23 April after researchers reported positive preclinical data for the firm's experimental Ebola drug, TKM-Ebola-Guinea, which contains an "adjusted" siRNA cocktail.</p><p>The results, reported in the journal Nature, showed the drug demonstrated 100% survival of nonhuman primates infected with the West Africa Makona strain of Ebola virus, previously referred to as the Guinea strain. </p><p>Complete survival was observed even when treatment did not begin until three days after viral exposure, a time point at which animals were five to six days away from death.</p><p>"These results underscore the adaptability of our siRNA-LNP technology in response to emerging infections," said Tekmira CEO Dr Mark Murray. "In this case, we rapidly went from new viral sequence data availability, to clinical product adapted to the new Makona strain."</p><p>TKM-Ebola-Guinea currently is being evaluated in a Phase II clinical study in Sierra Leone with results expected in the second half of 2015. </p><p>The study is being conducted by the University of Oxford on behalf of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), with funding by the Wellcome Trust.</p><p>The Makona variant of the Ebola virus is responsible for the current outbreak in West Africa.</p><p>Tekmira's earlier version of its Ebola drug, TKM-Ebola, targeted the Central African Ebola virus variants.</p><p>But after genomic sequencing identified the Makona variant, Tekmira modified its RNAi therapeutic to specifically target the strain circulating in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p><p>"The ability to rapidly and accurately match the evolving genetic sequences of emerging infectious agents is one of the powerful features of RNAi therapeutics," the firm said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
