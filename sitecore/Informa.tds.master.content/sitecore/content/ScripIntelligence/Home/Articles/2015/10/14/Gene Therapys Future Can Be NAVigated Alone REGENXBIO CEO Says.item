<p>Having netted $148m in its September initial public offering, REGENXBIO, Inc. is moving toward the clinic with its first two gene therapy candidates and believes it &ndash; and its licensees &ndash; are positioned to succeed in gene therapy where earlier attempts failed. Coming out of a "quiet period" after its IPO, which sold 7.2 million shares at $22 apiece, REGENXBIO CEO Kenneth Mills talked to <i>Scrip</i>'s sister publication <i>"The Pink Sheet" DAILY </i>about his company's plans and strategies, as well as why its novel adeno-associated virus (NAV) vectors might be more viable than the first iteration of AAV-based therapies.</p><p><p>With a current pipeline of five preclinical candidates &ndash; licensing deals have resulted in 18 other candidates being developed by other companies with NAV technology &ndash; REGENXBIO plans to begin clinical development in the first half of 2016 with two &ndash; RGX-501 for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and RGX-111 for mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type 1 (also called Hurler syndrome). The other preclinical candidates are for MPS type 11, also known as Hunter syndrome, X-linked retinitis pigmentosa and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). While four of those are rare diseases, Mills said the NAV technology offers potential in a broad range of therapeutic indications, which is part of why REGENXBIO has done so many platform licensing deals, but the company now wants to focus also on being a drug-development firm.</p><p><p>"The things that drive us are understanding what the technology is capable of and trying to find diseases that suit what the technology is good at," he said. "And what our technology is good at is transferring a gene into cells in humans and then expressing a protein at a high level. So we look for diseases that need that mechanism of action in order to reconstitute a function and show a clinical benefit." </p><p><p>"Often the diseases we will focus on are not only just rare, but they usually are recessive diseases so where genetically there's nothing, there's no signal, and we are able to provide and introduce back some level of function in protein," he continued. "Monogenic, single-gene, recessive diseases are definitely a primary target."</p><p><p>Beyond that niche, however, REGENXBIO also sees NAV-based gene therapy as offering new solutions for acquired diseases in which there is a clear mechanism of action that needs to be agonized or antagonized.</p><p><p>"[If] we can produce something that either agonizes or antagonizes an MOA that is well defined, we think that makes sense," Mills said. "Anti-VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor] is a great example. It's clinically understood to benefit a lot of diseases, wet AMD is one of them, as well as areas of oncology. And because the biochemical pathway for VEGF inhibition is well characterized, we focus on that, on how to transfer genes that inhibit VEGF when they translate proteins."</p><p><h2>Safe Vectors Are Not Enough</h2><p>REGENXBIO's programs stem from adeno-associated virus research conducted by James Wilson at the University of Pennsylvania since the 1990s. Mills explained that while the second generation of gene therapies used one of six adeno-associated viruses as a targeting vehicle, clinical studies repeatedly showed that while this modality was safe, it was not terribly effective at transferring genes.</p><p><p>Wilson, however, discovered roughly 150 additional AAVs that over time have been shown to be much more effective in transferring genes, while offering similar safety.</p><p><p>"It took about five years of additional work &ndash; not just in Wilson's labs at Penn but he also shared and distributed the vectors to a huge number of academics, hundreds bordering on maybe 1,000 over that five-year period," Mills noted. "The data emerged from that was an enormous amount and showed higher amounts of expression and longer gene expression across many different tissue types and in many different animals and models of disease."</p><p><p>A 2010 study at St. Jude's Research hospital in hemophilia really demonstrated the difference, he added. "Previous studies had been done in hemophilia B with an AAV vector that had not demonstrated any efficacy, had shown safety but hadn't shown any durable expression of the clotting factor that is associated with hemophilia B," Mills said. "As soon as somebody switched to the new vector, in this the case called AAV8, they immediately saw high levels of expression, arrested some symptoms and materially made clinical improvements in patients even at the lowest doses."</p><p><p>The first patient dosed in that trial was still expressing the clotting factor as of a follow-up visit in 2014, Mills added.</p><p><h2>Restoring LDL Receptor Function</h2><p>In HoFH, RGX-501 is intended to help patients who have little or no LDL receptor activity gain or improve such function, which will aid in the natural process of clearing serum cholesterol levels. "What we are doing is enabling the reconstitution of LDL receptor function," Mills explained.</p><p>"Our gene in RGF-501 &#8230; encodes the LDL receptor and basically establishes and puts that function back into the liver so the LDL receptor is expressed and is active."</p><p><p>The company thinks this candidate offers potential as both monotherapy as well as possibly in tandem with other cholesterol-lowering drugs, including the burgeoning PCSK9 class. But, as Mills pointed out, gene therapy could offer utility for patients in whom PCSK9 inhibitors would offer no benefit, because such drugs need at least some LDL receptor function to work.</p><p><p>"Inhibition [of PCSK9] allows more receptors in the liver to retain function but the point is that this is only useful when people have LDL receptors to begin. When you have none, PCSK9 inhibition does nothing for you," he said. "There's the potential that gene therapy with compensatory and complementary products fits into a standard of care that we think and hope that will help these patients not just improve, but build a case for them getting back to normal."</p><p><p>This article has also been published in" <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/the-pink-sheet" target="_new">The Pink Sheet</a>" DAILY.
