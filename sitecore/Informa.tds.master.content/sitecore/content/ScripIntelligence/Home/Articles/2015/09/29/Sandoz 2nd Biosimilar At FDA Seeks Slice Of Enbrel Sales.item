<p>With the FDA's acceptance of its 351(k) application, Novartis unit Sandoz has moved closer to gaining the agency's approval to market a second biosimilar &ndash; this time, a version of Amgen's tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor Enbrel (etanercept), which reported $9bn in global sales in 2014, with close to half of that coming from the U.S.</p><p>Sandoz said it is seeking approval for its etanercept biosimilar &ndash; of which the company thinks is the first to be under review at the FDA &ndash; of all of the same indications Enbrel's U.S. labeling currently carries: rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in patients 2 years or older psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis.</p><p>Sandoz currently is the only company with an approved biosimilar in the U.S. &ndash; Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), which was referenced on Amgen's human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Neupogen (filgrastim).</p><p>The company gained that approval on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/NovartisSandoz-make-history-with-1st-US-biosimilar-Zarxio-357116" target="_new">March 6</a>, although because of its ongoing legal battle with Amgen, Sandoz was not able to put Zarxio on the U.S. market until <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/1st-U.S.-Biosimilar-Arrives-Zarxio-Launches-Legal-Saga-Ongoing-360244" target="_new">Sept. 3</a>.</p><p>The legal saga between the two companies is ongoing, with Amgen and Sandoz <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Will-Amgen-Sandoz-Tango-Across-Old-Ground-360426" target="_new">waiting for a decision</a> from the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on whether it will <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AmgenSandoz-Zarxio-Fight-Not-Done-Rehearing-Sought-360073" target="_new">rehear</a> the firms' arguments after a three-judge panel on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Court-rules-biosimilar-patent-dance-optional-but-delays-Zarxio-359555" target="_new">July 21</a> gave each side a win, but also each side a loss.</p><p>Sandoz said its 351(k) application for its etanercept biosimilar consists of a "comprehensive" data package, which includes data from analytical, functional, preclinical and clinical studies.</p><p>The company said it believes the two pivotal clinical trials, a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers and a confirmatory safety and efficacy trial in patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis will provide confirmation of similarity to Enbrel established in prior analytical comparability investigations.</p><p>Sandoz pointed out it has several biosimilars across the various stages of development, including five programs in Phase III trials or registration preparation.</p><p>The firm said it plans to make 10 regulatory submissions in the next three years.</p><p>There currently are at least three other 351(k) applications pending at the FDA for biosimilars of pegfilgrastim from Apotex, referenced on Amgen's Neulasta; epoetin alfa from Pfizer unit Hospira, referenced on Amgen's Epogen; and infliximab from Celltrion, referenced on Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen's Remicade.</p><p>The FDA is seeking to make some changes that will affect the nonproprietary names (INNs) of biosimilars &ndash; declaring in August the agency wants those products, and in fact all biologics, to carry a unique <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/4-Letter-Word-FDAs-BiosimilarsBiologics-Distinction-360142" target="_new">four-letter suffix</a>.</p><p>Some biologics already are slated to undergo a change of their INNs, including Zarxio, whose active substance name will be changed from filgrastim-sndz to filgrastim-bflm.</p><p>The FDA also plans to hold a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/US-Capitol-Capsule-Improving-The-Biosimilars-Review-Process-Whats-Needed-360698" target="_new">public meeting on Dec. 18</a> to seek the public's input on how well regulators are completing their program goals under the <i>Biosimilar User Fee Act</i> and what should be retained, changed or discontinued to improve performance.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
