<p>GlaxoSmithKline will not be selling off part of its stake in the HIV joint venture ViiV Healthcare via an IPO because of a "strong positive outlook" for the business. The decision was announced alongside the company's first quarter results and details of CEO Andrew Witty's plans for the "new GSK" following the multi-billion dollar asset swop with Novartis, which closed in March. The update helped GSK's share price increase by almost 1% (6 May) with investors pleased to hear about GSK's reduction of its &pound;4bn payback scheme to a &pound;1bn special dividend and details of an accelerated cost-savings plan. </p><p>GSK says its financial performance this year will be impacted by the dilutive effect of the Novartis transaction and the continued effect of 2014 headwinds. However, it then anticipates an improvement in performance with revenues and earnings expected to increase over the five year period 2016 to 2020.</p><p><b>Advair</b></p><p>On GSK's lung drug Advair, which sees its final patents expire next year, Sir Andrew said the chances of a generic reaching the US market in 2016 were "vanishingly small." However, for the first time, the company has factored a US generic to Advair in its sales estimates for the next five years. </p><p>"The company continues to expect sales of Advair to decline, but with the ongoing transition to newer products, total respiratory sales are expected to return to growth in 2016," said Sir Andrew. By 2020, GSK expects total respiratory sales to be at or above the level of sales in 2015, whether or not there is generic competition to Advair in the US in the period.</p><p>"The attrition against Advair may very well be nowhere near as bad as bringing it down to between &pound;200m to &pound;300m in 2020 [1Q 2015, for comparison, was &pound;392m]. But the point is simply to make the case that even if it's pretty aggressive in terms of the loss of share for Advair in America, we can still deliver."</p><p><b>volume for growth</b></p><p>The firm is banking on volume demand for its products to increase, particularly in emerging markets, as governments and payers focus on cost effective drugs to meet increasing healthcare needs, such as vaccines and OTC medicines. "Pharmaceuticals remains an important part of the business but it's no longer the dominating part of the business," Sir Andrew said on a conference call accompanying the quarterly financial presentation. "The world we're in and the industry we're in spends an awful lot of time talking about price and price pressure, but the reality is when you look beyond that particular point, the opportunity that exists is volume on a global basis, absolutely gigantic pools of volume in the healthcare marketplace," he added. "We believe that going forward, the anxieties and the pressure on this industry will only increase. The pressure on pricing in Europe and America will continue to be sustained. The ability of companies to achieve super high prices for product after product in a small number of markets is limited."</p><p>GSK continues to expect transaction synergies of around &pound;1bn annually. However, Sir Andrew says that following the close, GSK identified opportunities to accelerate delivery of the overall program. "As a result, over 50% of total savings are now expected in 2016 (versus 2017) and the program is expected to be substantially complete in 2017 (versus 2019)." </p><p>This will allow GSK to pay an annual dividend of 80p for each of the next three years (2015-2017). </p><p>However, the firm has decided to reduce the planned return to shareholders from the proceeds of the Novartis transaction. It now plans to return about &pound;1bn (20p per share) to shareholders via a special dividend to be paid alongside GSK's Q4 2015 dividend payment, instead of the previously proposed $&pound;4bn. </p><p><b>quarterly numbers</b></p><p>For the quarter, GSK's sales increased 1% to &pound;5.6bn with positive contributions from Vaccines (+10%) and Consumer Healthcare (+24%) offsetting a decline in Pharmaceuticals (-7%). Pharmaceutical turnover represented very strong growth from ViiV (+42%) offset by Oncology divestments and sales declines in Advair and Established Products. </p><p>Core EPS for the quarter was 17.3p (-16%) CER, declining primarily as a result of mix pressures on the Pharmaceuticals margin and the dilutive impact of the transaction. The decline was partly offset by ongoing cost reductions and a lower tax rate (20%). Q1 2015 total EPS of 167.8p benefited from the pre-tax transaction gain of &pound;9.3bn. GSK declared a Q1 2015 dividend of 19 pence. </p><p>"Mid-term revenue and EPS guidance looks to be broadly in line or slightly below consensus expectations, though the flat dividend of 80p for the next three years will reassure income funds," noted Jefferies analysts.</p><p>"The outlook beyond 2016 is steady, if unspectacular," added analysts from Berenberg. GSK expects revenue growth of low- to mid-single-digits for 2016-20, and EPS growth of mid- to high-single-digits for the same period. "That is not different from the broader European sector," they noted.</p>
