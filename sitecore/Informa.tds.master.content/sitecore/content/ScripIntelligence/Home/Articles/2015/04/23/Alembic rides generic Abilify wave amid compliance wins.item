<p>Shares of Alembic Pharmaceuticals surged on Indian bourses, after the US FDA cleared the first set of generic versions of Otsuka's schizophrenia and bipolar disorder drug Abilify (aripiprazole). </p><p>Teva and the Indian firms Hetero Labs and Torrent Pharma, also received FDA approval to market generic aripiprazole in multiple strengths and dosage forms on 28 April.</p><p>Nimish Mehta, founder of Research Delta Advisors, said that generic Abilify could be a significant contributor to the earnings of firms like Alembic, despite potential competition anticipated from multiple players, including more Indian firms.</p><p>By the end of June, an additional four-five players are expected to vie for a share of the generic aripiprazole market, estimated at $500m to $1bn, assuming a price erosion of 80-90%, Mr Mehta noted.</p><p>"We expect generic Abilify to be a $60-70m product for Alembic in 2015-16, with higher margins initially and a decline thereafter, though still lucrative, as competition heats up," Mr Mehta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>The Alembic stock ended up 6.48% at INR479.50 ($7.6) on the Bombay Stock Exchange on 29 April.</p><p>News of the approval came just a day after Alembic's top brass, in its traditional conservative style, stated in a post results investor call that the firm was awaiting FDA approval and that there were several "moving parts" in the Abilify case.</p><p>The <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-OKs-1st-generic-copycats-of-Otsukas-Abilify-358101%5d" target="_new">FDA approval</a> for generic aripiprazole versions is to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder only and the labelling will omit all information related to treatment of Tourette's disorder. </p><p>Otsuka has previously indicated that it expected <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Otsuka-Quantifies-Generic-Abilify-Hit-Mourns-President-356778%5d" target="_new">North American sales</a> of Abilify to plunge 42% to $2.86bn in calendar 2015, although global sales of Abilify Maintena, a once-monthly depot formulation, are expected to rise from JPY17.1bn in calendar 2014 to JPY55.5bn this year. </p><p>Alembic, which is in the process of setting up its own front-end in the US, made two ANDA applications filings during the quarter, with cumulative ANDA/NDA filings now at 68. A filing for warfarin is expected in the current quarter. The company had earlier indicated that it expected to make a 505(b)(2) <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Robust-Q1-for-Alembic-amid-fine-tuned-exports-353073%5d" target="_new">filing for warfarin</a> around February 2015. </p><p>Alembic's joint managing director Pranav Amin said that he expected most products to be handled by the firm's own front end from 2016-17.</p><p>For the quarter ended March 2015, Alembic reported a 9% increase in revenues to INR5.08bn, while net profit stood at INR703m(+15%). The international generic formulations business grew by 8% to INR1.47bn.</p><h2>FDA audit </h2><p>Alembic also appeared to fare well on the manufacturing compliance front amid recent run-ins of leading Indian firms with the US FDA over compliance issues</p><p>Alembic said that its formulations facility in Panelav had "successfully passed" an US FDA audit without any 483 observations. Ditto for its bio-equivalence center. A form 483 is a notice of the FDA's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p>"Our focus this year has been compliance of plants, removing bottlenecks of future R&D filings and improving our supply chain efficiencies and we will continue to focus on this in the future as well," Mr Amin underscored during the investor call.</p><p>Alembic had earlier outlined its intent to implement a strategy to <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Alembic-Q2-sales-up-13-eyes-derisked-manufacturing-354575%5d" target="_new">derisk its manufacturing</a> operations over the next two years, against the backdrop of the firm's dependence on the Panelav site. </p><p>The firm's India branded formulations business stood at INR2.32bn (+16%) in the quarter, with the specialty and acute segments improving by 22% and 11% respectively. Alembic's top brass, though, referred to a potential hit of about INR170m in the current year, following a price reduction on the firm's Althrocin (erythromycin) brand.</p>
