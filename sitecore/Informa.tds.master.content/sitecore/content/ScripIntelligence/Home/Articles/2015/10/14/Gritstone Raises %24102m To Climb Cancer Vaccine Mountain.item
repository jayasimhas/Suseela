<p>Just as rock climbers use gritstones to scale massive peaks, the San Francisco-based startup Gritstone Oncology raised $102m for the development of neoantigen-containing cancer vaccines that may help the immune system mount a targeted attack against tumors.</p><p>Gritstone co-founder, president and CEO Andrew Allen &ndash; the rock climber responsible for the startup's name &ndash; is building the company based on research from some of Gritstone's other co-founders, who found that checkpoint inhibitors activate T cells that target tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNAs). The new company, with input from Allen's lung cancer drug development background and advice from other experts, hopes to generate proof-of-concept data for its cancer vaccines based on those recent neoantigen findings in less than two years.</p><p>Allen co-founded Clovis Oncology and was the Boulder, Colorado-based company's chief medical officer until he <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Clovis-Oncology-names-CMO-359096" target="_new">left this year to focus on Gritstone</a>, whose chairman is Clovis co-founder, president and CEO Patrick Mahaffy. </p><p>Clovis is expecting a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Clovis-NSCLC-Drug-Rociletinib-Wins-FDA-Priority-Review-360737" target="_new">US FDA decision by the end of March</a> on a new drug application (NDA) for the targeted lung cancer drug rociletinib. A European Medicines Agency (EMA) review of a marketing authorization application (MAA) for the oral, selective EGFR inhibitor also is ongoing.</p><p><b>Tough Rock Climb Ahead</b></p><p>With Clovis's first drug candidate nearing potential FDA and EMA approvals, and with Gritstone just getting started, Allen has the perspective to note that "building a biotech company is like tackling a tough rock climb &#8230; After a long sequence of tiring moves, you finally reach success."</p><p>Gritstone's strategy is based on the research of co-founders Tim Chan and Naiyer Rizvi, whose work with lung cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center focused Allen's immuno-oncology vision on neoantigen-based cancer vaccines. </p><p>The doctors published research showing that checkpoint inhibitors &ndash; such as PD-1 inhibitors, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck & Co.'s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) &ndash; activate T cells that target neoantigens, which are antigens created when tumors mutate. </p><p>Gritstone intends to build on those findings, by identifying the best neoantigens to include in personalized therapeutic vaccines, which will help a given patient's immune system identify and kill tumors that express those neoantigens. The company will use genetic sequencing to analyze tumor samples and manufacture personalized vaccines for each patient based on the neoantigens specific to their tumors.</p><p>"The goal is to move quickly into the clinic," Allen said. "We will sequence the patients' tumors, introduce neoantigens that we think they will respond to, and analyze what happens."</p><p>He recruited Foundation Medicine alum Roman Yelensky to serve as Gritstone's executive vice president of bioinformatics and sequencing. Yelensky and Allen have worked together since Clovis hired Foundation more than three years ago to develop a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Cloviss-rucaparib-shows-BRCAness-in-interim-Phase-II-355150" target="_new">companion diagnostic for the PARP inhibitor rucaparib</a>. </p><p>Allen noted that Gritstone will need to treat hundreds of patients to test its technology and identify neoantigens that produce the greatest immune response, and to determine if other immuno-oncology drugs should be used in combination with the company's vaccines. </p><p>He noted that Gritstone's $102m in Series A venture capital is expected to last through 2017, but the company may be able to generate proof-of-concept data before then &ndash; by late 2016 or early 2017.</p><p>The Series A financing was co-led by Versant Ventures and The Column Group with Clarus Ventures. Other backers included Frazier Healthcare Partners, Redmile Group, Casdin Capital and Transformational Healthcare Opportunity, a special-purpose vehicle for private investors.</p><p><b>Enlisting Help With The Climb</b></p><p>Gritstone also will use its venture capital to embark on a business development campaign to acquire cancer vaccine technology &ndash; peptides, nucleic acid sequences or other options &ndash; to deliver neoantigens that may kick start patients' immune systems.</p><p>"There have been a lot of people working in the space who are excited about using their technology on something like neoantigens," Allen said. "We have been getting a lot of in-bound calls. We are in a strong position to be able to conduct something of a beauty contest to meet our needs."</p><p>Competitor Neon Therapeutics raised a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Neon-Elcelyx-Lead-Flurry-Of-Private-Company-Fundraising-360848" target="_new">$55m Series A round</a> at the end of September to develop cancer treatments that target neoantigens, but Neon is focused on therapeutic vaccines as well as T cell therapies.</p><p>"I won't be surprised to see more companies moving into [the neoantigen] space," Allen said.</p><p>He's had a long-standing interest in immuno-oncology, but hasn't worked in the field since he was with Chiron Corp., which Novartis <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Novartis-completes-Chiron-acquisition-62939" target="_new">acquired in 2006</a>. After Chiron, but before Clovis, Allen was chief medical officer at Pharmion Corp. until it was acquired by Celgene <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Celgene-completes-Pharmion-buy-56893" target="_new">for $2.9bn in 2008</a>.</p><p>To boost his and Gritstone's expertise, Allen and the company have enlisted the help of experts in various areas of immuno-oncology.</p><p>Other Gritstone co-founders include the lung cancer expert and drug developer Jean-Charles Soria, a professor at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris; King's College London professor Graham Lord, a clinician and scientist in the field of lymphocyte biology; and Mark Cobbold of Massachusetts General Hospital, who is an expert in antigenic-peptide binding and recognition by T cells.</p><p>Gritstone is nearing 10 employees, but Allen expects the company's head count to reach 20 to 25 by early 2016 with 35 employees working from its San Francisco headquarters or its Cambridge, Massachusetts genetic sequencing site by the end of 2016.</p><p>"There's nothing more satisfying than to work with really great people on a tough problem," Allen said.</p><p><p><p><p>
