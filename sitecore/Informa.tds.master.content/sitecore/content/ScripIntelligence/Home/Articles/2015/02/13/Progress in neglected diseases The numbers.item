<p> The latest status report from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), shows there are nearly five times as many medicines in development for so-called neglected tropical diseases than there were 10 years ago. </p> <p> In 2005 there were 32 R&amp;D projects that focused on developing new medicines for the treatment of 11 neglected conditions. But in its latest status update on pharma R&amp;D in the field, the IFPMA noted that there were 168 medicines in development. </p> <p> In vaccines the number of R&amp;D products for neglected diseases has also risen swiftly: in 2006 there were 49 candidates in the pipeline, but it 2014 that figure had climbed to 186 potential vaccines. </p> <p> In 2014 the total number of pipeline medicines in development was split across the following 11 conditions. </p> <p> <preform><script id="infogram_0_number_of_pipeline_products_for_11_ntds" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?938" type="text/javascript"></script></preform></p> <p> But as pharma's progress continues in certain conditions, it appears that some neglected diseases remain forgotten. </p> <p> For example, with 48 new medicines and two vaccines in development, tuberculosis is becoming a well-served disease population. However, for conditions such as soil-transmitted helminthic (STH) diseases, progress has not been as forthcoming. There is just one medicine and no vaccines in development. </p> <p> STH infection is found mainly in areas with warm and moist climates where sanitation and hygiene are poor, including in temperate zones during warmer months. STHs are considered neglected diseases because &quot;they inflict tremendous disability and suffering yet can be controlled or eliminated,&quot; says the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). </p> <p> According to the CDC, approximately 807-1,121 million people worldwide are infected with the parasitic worm Ascaris; around 604-795 million people are infected with whipworm; and approximately 576-740 million people have contracted hookworm. Between them STHs account for a major burden of disease worldwide. </p> <p> There have been no new treatments for STH diseases approved since 2005. The one product accounted for in the IFPMA 2014 records is Janssen R&amp;D's (Johnson &amp; Johnson) Phase III trial chewable formulation of the currently available therapy mebendazole. </p> <h2> Funding for NTD R&amp;D </h2> <p> IFPMA highlighted that pharmaceutical companies are the third largest funder of R&amp;D for neglected tropical diseases. </p> <p> In 2012, the public sector provided nearly two-thirds ($2bn, 63.2%) of global funding for R&amp;D followed by the philanthropic sector contributions ($631m, 19.9%) and the pharmaceutical industry ($527.2m, 16.7%). </p> <p> <preform><script id="infogram_0_funding_in_ntds-8" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?60i" type="text/javascript"></script></preform></p> <p> But over the last 10 years, as the number of products in development for neglected conditions has been on a steady increase, funding from all sources has remained relatively flat. And the majority of pharmaceutical spending in this area has been focused on just three diseases: dengue, tuberculosis and malaria. </p> <p> The IFPMA did note that the number of pharmaceutical industry centers dedicated to neglected diseases R&amp;D has increased. </p> <p> For example in 2014, Merck KGaA launched an R&amp;D Translational Innovation Platform in Geneva, Switzerland. Merck KGaA's project is focused on schistosomiasis and helminthic diseases and malaria co-infections. </p>
