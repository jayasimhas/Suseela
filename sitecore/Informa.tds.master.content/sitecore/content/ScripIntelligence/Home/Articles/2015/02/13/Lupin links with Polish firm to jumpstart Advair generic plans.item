<p>Lupin has unveiled plans for a significant step up in the inhalation therapy segment, with back-to-back announcements on its efforts for a generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's blockbuster asthma/COPD product, Advair/Seretide (salmeterol/fluticasone), and the launch in the US of a device to enhance delivery of aerosol therapies.</p><p>Several firms including Sandoz, Mylan and Cipla are already entrenched in the generic Advair space though Lupin expects its deal with the Polish biopharmaceutical firm Celon to help potentially shave off some part of the traditional timelines involved in taking their generic to key markets.</p><p>Lupin and Celon expect to jointly develop fluticasone/salmeterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), a generic version of Advair Diskus. Celon would make supplies to the Indian firm, which will be responsible for commercialization in the US, Canada, Mexico, and other key markets. </p><p>Lupin told <i>Scrip</i> that Celon had earlier commercialized its version of GSK's Seretide in Poland and that the Indian firm hopes to pursue a generic filing in the US in about 12-14 months.</p><p>GSK was reported some years ago to have filed a copyright infringement suit against Celon though the latest position on this was not immediately clear. Celon is reported to believe that its product (marketed as Salmex) is equivalent to Seretide. </p><p>Lupin's CEO Vinita Gupta said that the collaboration with Celon marked an important milestone in the company's efforts to evolve its global inhalation pipeline. </p><p>Ms Gupta said that Celon's experience in development and manufacturing fluticasone/salmeterol DPI in Europe coupled with Lupin&rsquo;s expertise in inhalation product development and commercialization in the US and other markets will accelerate the development of generic Advair Diskus for global markets.</p><p>Lupin, which had earlier set up a dedicated centre of excellence for inhalation research in Florida, has also been building its people pipeline in the space roping in scientists such as Dr Xian-Ming Zeng from Teva.</p><p>Both Lupin and Celon hope to work to complete a ''time-bound'' R&D program to ensure successful registration in targeted markets. </p><p>Some analysts, however, claimed that Lupin's upside could potentially stand ''diluted'' given that firms that own the technology generally demand a significant portion of the returns. </p><p>''We were under the impression that Lupin was developing its own technologies in the inhalation space for regulated markets, so upsides could now be potentially be pared,'' one analyst told <i>Scrip</i> .</p><h2>competition</h2><p>Potential competition from the new Lupin-Celon combine comes at a time when GSK's US business has been flagging, with sales down 10% in 2014 following formulary and contract changes to Advair. </p><p>GSK said at the time of its 4Q results earlier this month that it expects global Seretide/Advair sales to continue to decline in 2015 given sustained price pressure in the US and Europe, generic competition in Europe and continued uptake of its new respiratory portfolio.</p><p>Sales of Advair were down 25% in 2014, though some analysts had noted how the product's 4Q sales of &pound;1.1bn were a little ahead of their forecast <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-2014-revenues-fall-but-shares-climb-on-upbeat-respiratory-talk-356544%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 4 February 2015)</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Sandoz's salmeterol/fluticasone product, AirFluSal Forspiro, has been approved in about 13 European countries, as well as South Korea and Mexico. The product has been launched in five nations, including South Korea, the company said last November.</p><p>Cipla has already launched its generic Advair metered-dose inhaler (MDI) &ndash; marketed as Serroflo in Germany and Salmeterol/Fluticasone Cipla in Sweden <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ciplas-Advair-generic-hits-Europe-eyes-Breo-version-353665%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 2 September 2014)</a>. The company also recently indicated that it had been awarded its first tender for Serroflo in Germany. Another Indian firm, Glenmark, has previously received approvals for its generic Advair MDI in Mexico and the Philippines <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Glenmark-gets-first-generic-approvals-for-Advair-MDI-349093%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 3 January 2014)</a>. </p><p>In September last year, Mylan said it planned to initiate Phase III clinical trials for its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline's Advair Diskus and that it hoped to be the first to bring to the US market an AB-rated, substitutable generic form of the product. Patents on the active ingredients used in Advair expired in 2010, though the US patents on the Diskus inhaler device run until 2016.</p><h2>device</h2><p>Separately, Lupin's US subsidiary has launched InspiraChamber Anti-Static Valved Holding Chamber (VHC) under a licensing pact with the New Jersey -based respiratory R&D firm, InspiRX. </p><p>Lupin has exclusive rights to promote, distribute and market the InspiraChamber VHC in the US. The device is designed to enhance delivery of aerosol therapies.</p>
