<p>Johnson & Johnson says it is increasingly confident its anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab will get final approval in both the US and Europe after being fast-tracked by regulators in both regions for treating multiple myeloma, an incurable blood cancer. </p><p>J&J's Janssen Biotech Inc. in July completed a rolling US BLA submission for the drug based on data from the Phase II SIRIUS trial, the Phase I/II GEN501 trial, and three other studies. The first-in-class therapy received breakthrough therapy designation in the US in May 2013, and Janssen has filed a request with the FDA for priority review. In Europe, the company received an accelerated review assessment from the European Medicines Agency in late September.</p><p>"We're hoping for a rapid path to approval in both regions," J&J's global oncology chief, Peter Lebowitz, said.</p><p>The breakthrough therapy designation given daratumumab for the patient population identified in the BLA is multiple myeloma patients who have been treated with at least three prior lines of therapy, including both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or who are double refractory to a PI and an IMiD. The completion of its BLA submission in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients is likely to bring a US user fee goal in March 2016 or earlier.</p><p>"Daratumumab is the next big thing for J&J in oncology," Lebowitz said in an interview. The US-based group licensed the drug from Genmab A/S of Denmark in 2012. </p><p>"It is a completely novel mechanism treating a patient population that has exhausted other options, and has single-agent activity. No antibody has been approved for multiple myeloma, and there's never before been an antibody that has had a single agent activity, and daratumumab checks those boxes," Lebowitz told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>"Our original approval date expectations for daratumumab were way beyond what we're expecting now. We've cut timelines probably by one and a half to two years because the drug looks really good. So our plan for daratumumab is we have a double refractory trial, that's the population, because they're refractory to two different therapies, and we're moving it earlier and earlier in combination development." </p><p>J&J hopes to position daratumumab as a new backbone treatment for multiple myeloma, an orphan disease. Five Phase III clinical studies with daratumumab in relapsed and front-line settings are currently ongoing, and more studies are planned in other malignant and pre-malignant diseases on which CD38 is expressed, such as smoldering myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. </p><p>"Multiple myeloma is an area we at J&J know very well because we developed Velcade outside the US," Lebowitz said, referring to the proteasome inhibitor also known as bortezomib for multiple myeloma for which J&J in 2003 in-licensed the ex-US rights from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Ltd., now owned by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Velcade (bortezomib) and Celgene's immunomodulators Thalomid (thalidomide) and Revlimid (lenalidomide) today form the foundation of current standard treatments for primary, maintenance, and relapsed multiple myeloma in the US. </p><p>Drugs currently on offer for multiple myeloma are wide ranging. Even heavily pre-treated patients have multiple options, including two new molecular entities recently approved for third-line use, Amgen Inc.'s Kyprolis (carfilzomib) in 2012 and Celgene Corp.'s Pomalyst (pomalidomide) in 2013. More new options are under regulatory review, such as daratumumab and Takeda's ixazomib, and in development, like Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s elotuzumab. </p><p>J&J got a late start in immuno-oncology compared with some of its peers but the company's Janssen pharmaceutical unit has set a goal to compete in the next wave of second generation drugs. By playing a game of catch-up, largely by using smart partnering deals like its one with Genmab, it has now built a successful oncology franchise, specializing in hematology and prostate cancer. </p><p>Lebowitz said the US-based company was now looking to expand deeper into cancer R&D, relying on a combination of internal development and additional M&A.</p><p>"We have three oncology disease areas that we focus on: blood cancers (heme malignancies), then comes prostate cancer. And the third area that we're looking at now is lung cancer," he explained after giving a presentation at The Economist Events' inaugural 'War on Cancer 2015' meeting in London on Oct. 20.</p><p>"We have several molecules coming behind daratumumab: JNJ927/ARN-509 is a big prostate cancer drug that we've already started two Phase III studies on; we have a couple of things in Phase II such as imetelstat for which we plan to eventually submit a filing in relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis, and CSL362, both for heme malignancies but with different mechanisms of action and each addressing clear unmet need. And then we've just entered a number of assets into Phase I.</p><p>He said J&J's recently announced partnering deal with Swedish biotech Alligator Bioscience AS, under which Janssen Biotech gets exclusive worldwide rights to Alligator's ADC-1013 in Phase I development, is another example of its immune-oncology strategy. The monoclonal antibody targets CD40, an immuno-stimulatory receptor found on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells.</p><p>"We believe Alligator's ADC-1013 will play into the complete immune-oncology regimen. What it does is stimulate a lot of different immune cells in different ways. The main issue with CD40 is that some companies in the past have taken CD40s into the clinic and they've been fairly toxic. This one, based on the pre-clinical data, might have a better profile and avoid some of the toxicity. ADC-1013 is already in Phase I so patients are getting treated with it now. Our hope is to combine the anti-CD40 from Alligator with a number of our other programs, including the vaccine programs that we have, as well as some of the other immune modulators, and we have some very nice preclinical data with different combinations," Lebowitz said.</p><p>Nonetheless, the company is selective about where it wants to pitch itself in immmuno-oncology. For example, in the much-hyped area of CAR-T therapies, J&J has held back. Lebowitz pointed out that while that medical approach offers great promise, big risks also exist.</p><p>"CAR-Ts are very interesting and compelling. They're also highly problematic in a lot of ways. We haven't made a massive investment in there. What we're also trying to do there is try to develop a next generation approach where you potentially don't have to use autologous cells &ndash; you take them out and you put them back in - the potential of this mechanism is to have an off the shelf approach to cell therapy and we're working with Transposagen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc on some of those approaches. We haven't jumped in with two feet yet because we think the technology needs some time to mature. There's a lot of excitement around CAR-T which is well-founded but there is some real scientific and technological realities that need to be sorted."</p><p>In the meantime, the executive is highly bullish about expansion prospects for Imbruvica (ibrutinib), the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor J&J developed with partner Pharmacyclics Inc., which was acquired by AbbVie Inc. in May for $21bn. The product, already approved for mantle cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as CLL in high risk patients with a certain genetic mutation called 17 p del, and Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, is also being tested in a number of other indications.</p><p>"Clinical trial results for Imbruvica just continue to look better and better. Our approval is in relapsed refractory disease and we're going to have news that's going to be presented at ASH in frontline chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and it looks really good. I can't tell you just how good, but it looks very good," Lebowitz told <i>Scrip</i>.</p>
