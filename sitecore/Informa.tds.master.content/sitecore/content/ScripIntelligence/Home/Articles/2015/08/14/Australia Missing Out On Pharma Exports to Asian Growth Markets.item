<p>Australia stands to miss out on opportunities to increase pharmaceutical exports to the burgeoning Asian markets unless the government takes the necessary steps to boost the biopharmaceutical sector and encourage investment in R&D and high-tech manufacturing, says the industry group Medicines Australia.</p><p>The group has just published statistics showing that five years ago medicines were Australia's largest manufactured export sector, bringing in more than A$4bn ($2.95bn), but now they have slipped to second place behind motor vehicles. It says that if this trend continues they will soon fall to third place. </p><p>In the first six months of 2015, exports declined by 28.5% to A$1.06bn, and in June they were 30% down over the corresponding month in 2014, Medicines Australia says, suggesting that the government has failed to grasp the importance of stemming this decline by taking action that will boost exports, particularly to Asian countries.</p><p>"At a time of growing demand for innovative, safe and effective medicine products in Asia, particularly in China, Australia is set to miss out on an enormous economic and job creating opportunity if our politicians fail to get the policy settings right," it declared.</p><p>It's not just trade in innovative medicines that is feeling the pinch: the decline is being seen across the whole pharma sector, and there seem to be no simple explanations for the fall, but rather a whole host of factors. </p><p>A spokesperson for Medicines Australia said the association was currently exploring the reasons behind the decline. "There are many factors likely to influence exports &ndash; exchange rates, global investment decisions by companies, and appropriate incentives to invest and retain advanced manufacturing &ndash; and we're working to better understand which factors are having the most impact," the spokesperson said. </p><p>"Suffice to say, it is concerning that the government claims to be open for business yet the right conditions and policies are not coming together to drive growth and raise exports to emerging regional markets. This is vital to growing Australia's economy now and into the future."</p><h2>Well Placed For Asia</h2><p>Mainly because of its geographical location, Australia is well placed to supply the markets of Asia, from where Medicines Australia says much of the growth in demand for pharmaceutical products will come over the next decade or so. </p><p>Australia is "uniquely placed to meet this demand," the spokesperson said. "It is not only strategically located but also has a highly-skilled labour force, a mature distribution infrastructure, a history of excellence in research (including clinical research) and a long-standing and well-justified reputation for manufacturing safe, high-quality medicines and vaccines. The government is missing these opportunities now and before long it will be too late."</p><p>While the fall in the value of the Australian dollar can help to make exports more competitive, on its own this will not reverse the decline and "cannot compensate for the enormous challenges facing industry and the broader Australian economy as the mining boom comes to an end," according to Medicines Australia.</p><p>As to what the government should be doing, the industry body sketched out some ideas in a submission last year to the Senate Economics References Committee's inquiry into the Australian Innovation System. The broad thrust of the proposals was to secure existing investment in pharmaceuticals in Australia, encourage the development of the local bio-pharmaceutical sector, and attract new direct foreign investment.</p><p>Also that year, in partnership with AusBiotech, which represents the medical biotechnology sector, it put forward a similar three-point plan to build what it called "a stronger, more sustainable and more vibrant biopharmaceutical industry in Australia."</p><p>This plan urged the government to put in place a stable, predictable and efficient business operating environment, enable growth in the local biopharmaceutical sector, and implement incentives to encourage investment in R&D, high-tech manufacturing, skills development, and public-private partnerships.</p><h2>Lack Of Engagement</h2><p>But Medicines Australia claims that there has not been enough government engagement with industry to get these conditions in place. "This coupled with a lack of current policy tools to ensure that the sector is positioned to meet the growing Asian market means that Australia is a less attractive proposition as an investment destination for manufacturing and is certainly not as globally competitive as it could be," the spokesperson said.</p><p>The association doesn't expect the situation to change any time soon: "There doesn't seem to be any current indication from the government that changes to these areas will be priorities in the near future."</p><p>Medicines Australia bemoaned this apparent lack of engagement earlier this year too, when the health minister decided not to sign a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australian-industry-disappointed-as-govt-snubs-stability-deal-359121" target="_new">strategic agreement</a> that would have provided industry with some policy stability over the coming five years in return for measures such as drug price cuts. Its CEO, Tim James, said the government had simply announced some "significant" price cuts with no guarantees against further reductions, something that "sent a shiver down the spine of this industry" and "puts future investment in medicines in Australia at risk."</p><p>Meanwhile, the Senate's report on its inquiry into the innovation system, which was originally expected by July this year, has twice been postponed, first to 10 August and now to 15 October. The inquiry is looking at how to address the challenges facing Australia's industries and jobs posed by increasing global competition in innovation, science, engineering, research and education. Medicines Australia said it did not know the reason for the delay, but added that "we eagerly await the recommendations from the committee and the government's response."</p>
