<p>Lupin has launched Salix's Zaxine (rifaximin) for hepatic encephalopathy in Canada&ndash; the first brand to hit that market following the duo's alliance last year.</p><p>The launch is perhaps interesting given that it comes just as the Canadian firm Valeant has wrapped up its <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Valeant-completes-Salix-purchase-357658%5d" target="_new">acquisition</a> of Salix. </p><p>A Lupin spokesperson maintained that there has been no change in the terms of the firm's licensing arrangement with Salix, since the Valeant deal. </p><p>On future products, Lupin said that it will have the right, at any time within 90 days after receipt of a future Canadian product notice, to acquire the exclusive right to market, distribute and sell the relevant product in the territory by providing "notice" to Valeant, Salix.</p><p>Valeant had earlier indicated that it expects to cut $500m from the combined company's costs within six months through "R&D rationalization" and by <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-ups-offer-for-Salix-Endo-throws-in-the-towel-357310%5d" target="_new">pruning</a> corporate overheads. </p><p>Lupin, which is in the process of establishing a foothold in Canada, expects to promote Zaxine to hepatologists and gastroenterologists through its own specialty sales force. </p><p>Zaxine 550mg has been approved by Health Canada under priority review for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence in patients 18 years of age or above.</p><p>Last year, Lupin and Salix Pharmaceuticals entered into a <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-to-take-Salix-products-to-Canada-353863%5d" target="_new">distribution agreement</a> under which Salix had granted Lupin the exclusive rights to market, distribute and sell Zaxine, Relistor subcutaneous injection for opioid-induced constipation, and potential future dosage forms, strengths, and indications for such products. </p><p>The Indian firm then said that it also has the option to exclusively sell other gastroenterology products in Salix's pipeline when approved by Health Canada. The market for gastroenterology products in Canada (excluding biologics) is estimated at about $1.35bn, data provided by Lupin said. </p><p>In 2009 Lupin and Salix had entered into collaboration to develop and commercialise an extended release formulation of rifaximin using Lupin's bioadhesive drug delivery technology. In 2011, the collaboration was expanded such that Salix received exclusive worldwide rights (excluding India) to Lupin's technology and technology jointly developed by the Indian company and Salix for all rifaximin products for human use.</p>
