<p>Shares of Pfizer got about a 2.5% boost on 8 January after the company disclosed the FDA currently has no plans to convene its Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) to scrutinize the new drug application (NDA) for palbociclib &ndash; news that had some on Wall Street speculating the pharma giant could win an earlier-than-expected approval of the experimental breast cancer medicine.</p><p>The FDA had set 13 April for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) decision date when it granted a priority review this past October of the NDA (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Verdict-expected-for-Pfizers-palbociclib-in-April-354440" target="_new">14 October 2014</a>).</p><p>But with no ODAC, the decision could potentially come sooner.</p><p>Pfizer is seeking approval to market palbociblib under the brand name Ibrance as a first-line therapy in combination with letrozole as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer who have not received previous systemic treatment for their advanced disease (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Pfizer-seeks-to-market-palbociclib-in-ERHER--breast-cancer-353433" target="_new">18 August 2014</a>).</p><p>The oral drug selectively inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 to regain cell cycle control and block tumor cell proliferation.</p><p>Palbociclib gained the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation &ndash; a status intended to expedite the regulatory process (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Pfizers-palbociclib-wins-breakthrough-status-342000" target="_new">11 April 2013</a>).</p><p>In its 8 January statement, Pfizer said it has entered labeling discussions with the FDA and "hopes to be able to bring Ibrance to patients who need it as soon as possible."</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, has put the likelihood of palbociclib gaining the FDA's blessing at 94%, which is 12% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>Not convening an advisory committee, said Evercore ISI analyst Dr Mark Schoenebaum, means the FDA has likely already reached a verdict on palbociclib.</p><p>Combining the news of no ODAC with the disclosure about the labeling discussions is a "net positive" &ndash; "In other words, it's plausible the FDA has made up its mind to approve the drug," Dr Schoenebaum declared, adding that only time will tell.</p><p>Others on Wall Street, however, said they were surprised the FDA has no plans for an ODAC, given the small amount of data submitted with the NDA, which was based on the results of its Phase II PALOMA-1 trial, which compared palbociclib at the 125mg once-daily dose three out of four weeks in repeated cycles in combination with letrozole versus letrozole 2.5mg once daily on a continuous regimen alone in post-menopausal women with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer. </p><p>The study achieved its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival for the combination of palbociclib and letrozole versus letrozole alone &ndash; 20.2 months versus 10.2 months.</p><p>Final results for the secondary efficacy endpoints of duration of treatment and clinical benefit rate demonstrated superiority in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm, versus letrozole-only arm. </p><p>An initial assessment demonstrated a median overall survival (OS) of 37.5 months in the combination arm, versus 33.3 months in patients who received letrozole alone.</p><p>The OS observation at the time of final PFS analysis, however, was not statistically significant. </p><p>Pfizer said follow-up OS analysis will be conducted following the accrual of additional events.</p><p>The combination of palbociclib and letrozole was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with previously reported data, the company said. </p><p>The most commonly reported adverse events in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm in PALOMA-1 were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue and anemia. </p><p>Shares of Pfizer closed at $32.50 on 8 January, up 65 cents, or 2%.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
