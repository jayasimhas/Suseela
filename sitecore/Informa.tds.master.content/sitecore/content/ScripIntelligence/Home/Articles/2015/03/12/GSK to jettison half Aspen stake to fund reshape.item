<p> GlaxoSmithKline plans to sell around half of its 12.4% stake in South Africa's largest listed pharma company Aspen Pharmacare &ndash; worth around $890m &ndash; through a placing to institutional investors. Having closed the landmark megadeal with Novartis last week, GSK is taking the opportunity to assess strategic options. CEO Sir Andrew Witty said ahead of the close that it would be &quot;disingenuous&quot; to say that the Novartis transaction did not give him &quot;options for different structures that may enhance shareholder value.&quot; </p><p> In 2013, GSK <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-sells-off-part-stake-in-partner-Aspen-348277" target="_new">sold around one-third</a> of its then 19% stake in Aspen for &pound;425m. The move came four years after it paid &pound;279m for a 16% stake in the company. The move was widely seen as profit-taking at a time when GSK needed a buffer against a drop in earnings. </p><p> On the latest Aspen move, Simon Dingemans, GSK's CFO, said GSK commercial partnership with Aspen was &quot;long and successful&quot; and GSK's investment in the company had &quot;significantly&quot; grown in value over time. &quot;As we continue to reshape the group around our core franchises and drive the benefits from the Novartis transaction, optimizing our financial flexibility to invest behind these priorities is key.&quot; This was the &quot;right time to realize further value from this successful relationship. We continue to believe in the strategy of Aspen and we remain committed to working together in the future.&quot; </p><p> The offering is expected to comprise 28.2 million Aspen ordinary shares equivalent to around 6.2% of Aspen's issued share capital. The offer price will be determined by means of an accelerated bookbuild offering process which is to start immediately. </p><p> After the proposed transaction, GSK will retain around a 6.2% stake in Aspen and will not dispose of any shares in Aspen for a period of 180 days following completion. </p><p> The net profit on disposing of the Aspen stake will not be included in core operating profit and core EPS in 2015 and it is expected that GSK will no longer account for Aspen as an associate going forward. </p><p> In October last year, GSK <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-gains-25-stake-in-Aspens-Japanese-subsidiary-354377" target="_new">transferred some of its mature products</a> to Aspen's new subsidiary Aspen Japan KK, in return for a 25% stake in the company. </p> <p><p>
