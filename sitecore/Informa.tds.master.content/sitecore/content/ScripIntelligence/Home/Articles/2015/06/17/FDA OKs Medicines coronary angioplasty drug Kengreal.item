<p>Apparently already anticipating an approval from the FDA, Wall Street paid little attention on 22 June when the agency actually gave its nod to The Medicines Company (MDCO) to market its intravenous antiplatelet agent Kengreal (cangrelor) &ndash; the news of which only pushed shares of the firm up as high as 2.8%, or 82 cents.</p><p>Kengreal, a synthetic small molecule, was approved by the FDA as an adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for reducing periprocedural thrombotic events in patients who have not been treated with an oral P2Y12 inhibitor and are not being given a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, had put the chances of Kengreal gaining the FDA's blessing in the PCI indication at 95%, which is 10% above the average probability of US approval for the same indication based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p>MDCO said it anticipated making Kengreal available next month.</p><p>The company said the drug is the first and only intravenous reversible P2Y12 platelet inhibitor with an immediate onset of action for patients undergoing PCI that, in clinical trials, was shown to reduce the risk of periprocedural thrombotic events.</p><p>PCI, commonly known as coronary angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat narrowed arteries found in coronary heart disease. </p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, PCI is performed on about 500,000 people each year in the US.</p><p>"Kengreal has the potential to address the unmet needs of these patients and is well-suited for contemporary US practice in the cath lab," the company declared.</p><p>In April, the FDA's Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-cardio-panel-backs-approval-of-Medicines-cangrelor-357902" target="_new">voted 9-2</a>, with one abstention, to recommend approval of Kengreal in the PCI indication &ndash; a decision that came after the agency's internal staff <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-reviewers-endorse-Medicines-cangrelor-back-to-CRDAC-357860" target="_new">endorsed the drug's</a> approval.</p><p>The 15 April meeting was the second go-around for Kengreal at the FDA's CRDAC, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Cool-drug-unconvincing-data-FDA-panel-rejects-MDCOs-cangrelor-350021" target="_new">initially rejected</a> the PCI indication on 12 February 2014 in a 7-2 vote.</p><p>The February 2014 panel also voted unanimously against approval for a second use of Kengreal as a therapy to maintain P2Y12 inhibition in patients with acute coronary syndromes or patients with stents who are at increased risk for thrombotic events, such as stent thrombosis, when oral P2Y12 therapy is interrupted due to surgery &ndash; the so-called bridging indication. </p><p>But after the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-rejects-The-Medicines-cangrelor-but-could-have-been-worse-351556" target="_new">rejected</a> MDCO's new drug application for Kengreal last year, the company dropped its pursuit, for the time being, of the bridging indication and refined the proposed use in PCI.</p><p>"The approval of Kengreal provides a new option for PCI," said Dr Clive Meanwell, MDCO's chairman and CEO, adding that the drug has the potential to decrease thrombotic risk in the acute care setting, while delivering value to the healthcare system.</p><p>He noted the firm also markets Angiomax (bivalirudin), a direct thrombin inhibitor, as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing PCI with provisional use of a GPI inhibitor; with or at risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome undergoing PCI; or those with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.</p><p>Kengreal's approval was based primarily on the efficacy results from MDCO's CHAMPION PHOENIX study, an 11,145-patient randomized, double-blind Phase III trial, which demonstrated the drug was superior to Bristol-Myers Squibb's Plavix (clopidogrel) in PCI. </p><p>The FDA said Kengreal significantly reduced the occurrence of heart attack, the need for further procedures to open the artery and stent thrombosis in the trial. </p><p>Regulators said about one in every 170 Kengreal patients had a serious bleed, versus about one in every 275 Plavix patients.</p><p>Kengreal is contraindicated in patients with significant active bleeding and in those with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any component of the product. </p><p>Shares of MDCO closed at $29.54 on 22 June, up 20 cents.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
