<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb is paying $60m upfront for an exclusive option to Prostvac, Bavarian Nordic's Phase III-stage prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeting cancer immunotherapy in development for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).</p><p>BMS is keen to explore the potential of Prostvac in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) in prostate cancer and also other agents in BMS's immune-oncology portfolio. BMS has an ongoing Phase III program for Yervoy in prostate cancer.</p><p>BMS can exercise the option within a designated time after data is available from the ongoing Phase III trial of Prostvac. Bavarian Nordic CEO Paul Chaplin told Scrip that the Phase III trial was started in 2012, and enrolment completed in December 2014. It has enrolled 1,200 patients in the pre-chemo setting, and typically this type of trial takes 18-24 months until a full data readout can be expected, "so we're looking at the end of 2016, start of 2017," he explained. He noted that three interim analyses have been scheduled, so there is a possibility that the data might be available earlier. </p><p>Prostvac was initially developed by the National Cancer Institute in the US, along with another compound called Panvac which utilized the same platform. Both programs were licensed to a privately held biotech called Therion Biologics. Therion was shut down by its investors after the failure of Prostvac to demonstrate progression free survival in a Phase II prostate cancer trial and the failure of Panvac in a Phase III trial in pancreatic cancer (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/Therion-up-for-sale-after-Phase-III-failure-64392" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 5 July 2006</a>). </p><p>Therion's assets were returned to the NCI, which continued evaluating them in various clinical studies owing to positive overall survival signals. These signals caught the eye of Bavarian Nordic, which went on to license the programs in 2009. "While obviously we are working towards the launch of Prostvac as a monotherapy, this is probably not the future of immune-oncology. Combination therapy is where the real potential is," said Dr Chaplin. There is a lot of excitement around checkpoint inhibitors such as the PD-1s, and boosting the effectiveness of these promising compounds is where products such as Prostvac could really make a difference, he believes. It is the combination potential of Prostvac that led Bavarian Nordic into signing a deal now and with BMS, rather than waiting until the data were out.</p><p>Bavarian Nordic recently reported promising OS data from an NCI-sponsored combination study of Prostvac and Yervoy at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium (26 February 2015). Was it this study that sealed the deal with BMS? "Yes and no," said Dr Chaplin. "Obviously we have been in discussions with BMS for longer than a few weeks."</p><p>An investigator sponsored Phase II study is currently in the planning stages to investigate the combination of Yervoy and Prostvac. The companies have also entered into an agreement by which they may conduct one or more combination studies of Prostvac and other agents from BMS's immuno-oncology portfolio.</p><p><b>deal terms</b></p><p>Under the deal with BMS, Bavarian Nordic would be entitled to a payment of $80m if BMS exercises the option, plus additional incremental payments starting at $50m, but with a potential to top $230m, should the median OS benefit of Prostvac exceed the efficacy seen in Phase II results. Furthermore, Bavarian Nordic could receive regulatory milestone payments of $110m, up to $495m in sales milestones as well as tiered double-digit royalties on future sales of Prostvac. The parties have also agreed to enter into a supply contract, under which Bavarian Nordic will undertake the future commercial manufacturing of Prostvac.</p><p><b>about Prostvac</b></p><p>Prostvac is a "ready to use" immuno-oncology agent that stimulates an immune response that attacks prostate cancer cells. Administered subcutaneously, Prostvac employs an active immunotherapy (vaccinia-fowlpox/TRICOM) technology platform. When PSA-TRICOM is presented to the immune system in the Prostvac regimen, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are generated that may recognize and kill PSA-expressing cancer cells and trigger an immune response to other tumor antigens.</p>
