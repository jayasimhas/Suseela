 <p> <p> <preform><p> The Scottish-born CEO of Pfizer Inc., Ian Read, has revamped the US-based drug maker and turned it into a Wall Street darling over the past five years via a series of moderate-sized acquisitions, spin-offs and strategic cost-cutting moves &ndash; but his next acquisition, if allowed by US authorities, seems likely to cement his reputation as a major deal-maker. </p><p> Under Read's leadership Pfizer is now courting Dublin, Ireland-based Allergan Inc. in a fresh tax inversion attempt despite changes to the tax rules announced by the US Treasury last year aimed at curbing some of the economic advantages of inverting. </p><p> Whether the 62 year-old Read can pull it off will largely determine his legacy at Pfizer's helm, a position he has had since taking part in a board room coup against his predecessor Jeff Kindler in December 2010. Read, an accountant and chemical engineer by training, immediately set to work as CEO to shore up the battered drug company's prospects and, with it, investor sentiment. </p><p><h4><img alt="Pfizer CEO Ian Read" refid="251224" version="c" src="-/media/07CF42F93581489CA35F0296769FA37E.ashx"></h4><h5> Pfizer CEO Ian Read </h5></p><p><p> Unlike his predecessor Kindler, an outsider and lawyer renowned for an abrasive leadership style, Read continued to perform his corporate functions in a characteristically calm, steady pace using an in-depth knowledge of the company where he has spent his entire career, having joined in 1978 as an operational auditor and then rising through the ranks, with stints in Mexico and as the country manager for Brazil before being made president of Pfizer's international pharmaceuticals division for Latin America and Canada in 1996. In 2001, he was appointed vice president of Pfizer and in 2006 promoted to president of worldwide pharmaceutical operations, a role he held until becoming CEO. His emerging markets background is seen as being invaluable given most of Pfizer's organic growth comes from sales in these markets. </p><p> According to Read, fixing Pfizer's fortunes after years of underperformance and sagging share price meant focusing on the company's &quot;innovative core&quot;. </p><p> Within the first eight months of being made CEO he sold off the group's drug formulation and delivery business, Capsugel, to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and announced plans to sell-off Pfizer's animal health and pediatric nutrition businesses. His recovery plans for Pfizer also meant cutting back heavily on R&amp;D spending, closing manufacturing sites and research facilities, and laying off thousands of workers. In February 2011, for example, Pfizer announced closure of its UK research and development facility in Sandwich, Kent, which at that time employed 2,400 people. </p><p> To help convince investors to buy and hold Pfizer stock, the board under Read's leadership pursued sizable share buyback programs which helped boost the company's stock price. He also initially pursued targeted but relatively small M&amp;A activities to expand Pfizer's footprint and activities. </p><p> That moderate approach changed significantly in April 2014 with news Pfizer was making a $100bn bid for AstraZeneca PLC, The UK's second-largest drug maker. For Pfizer, which has billions of dollars in cash locked up overseas, AstraZeneca's pipeline looked attractive but its biggest appeal was its domicile in the UK. Pfizer pays a higher corporate tax rate than most of its rivals and Read has often said he wants to change that by getting a more tax-efficient home base. Had he succeeded in buying AstraZeneca, it would have been the biggest takeover in British history and made Pfizer the world's largest drug company. Instead it sparked political controversy in the UK and the US and made Read, albeit briefly, a household name. </p><p> His biggest media moment in Britain was when he was called before a Parliamentary committee of MPs in May 2014 to explain his intentions for AstraZeneca. Read, naturalized as a US citizen in 2008, was at that hearing asked about the &quot;Pfizer coin&quot; he famously keeps in his pocket and which, on one side, says &quot;straight talk&quot; and on the other says &quot;own it&quot;. The CEO intoned that it represented ongoing &quot;cultural change&quot; at Pfizer under his leadership and is used to initiate tough conversations there. &quot;I believe strongly that everybody in the company needs to have a sense of ownership, hence 'own it', and to own it we need to have the ability to do straight talk,&quot; he explained. </p><p> The committee's MPs were not impressed by his overall message at the hearing, though, adding that they hadn't heard any &quot;straight talk&quot; from him on commitments to AstraZeneca jobs and R&amp;D. </p><p> One week later, on May 19, 2014, the New York City-headquartered Pfizer made a &quot;final offer&quot; of $92.48 per AstraZeneca share &ndash; comprising $41.63 in cash (45%) and 1.747 Pfizer shares (55%) &ndash; valuing the deal at $117bn &ndash; but that was rejected by the AstraZeneca board, which said the bid was too low and imposed too many risks, forcing the predator to walk away for six months. Hopes by AZ shareholders for a renewed bid later in the year were dashed when Pfizer signed a major cancer drug deal with Merck KGaA, selling its sharing rights to develop an experimental immunotherapy drug for a fee of $850m. Pfizer's failed attempt to buy AstraZeneca put a spotlight on the practice of tax inversion and contributed to the US government's move to crack down on it. </p><p> In September 2014, the US Treasury put out a notice about the changes to the tax rules. The amendments have not officially been implemented, but the notice carries a retroactive date that would have consequences for deals conducted in the interim. Now, with the presidential and congressional election year looming in 2016, another layer of uncertainty has been added. </p><p> Read is undeterred however. </p><p> At the company's Oct. 27 third-quarter results call &ndash; held before confirmation of Pfizer's talks with Allergan &ndash; the CEO said,&quot;Shareholders of Pfizer expect us to maximize the return, and the employees of Pfizer want to have a robust, successful company in the future ... To be successful in the future we need to have a competitive tax rate, so that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s an important issue for us.&quot;</p><p> In a nutshell, Read's M&amp;A method means mixing money and medicines in a tax-efficient manner. Also, Pfizer under Read's leadership is clearly on the path towards further corporate structural change. It could mean getting bigger before being broken up later into more efficient, profitable entities. Read's intimate long-term knowledge of Pfizer and his educational background should prove key tools: Read received his B.Sc. in chemical engineering from London University Imperial College in 1974. He earned his Chartered Accountants certification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales in 1978. </p><p> Allergan PLC, like AstraZeneca, has an attractive pipeline, a stable of therapies, and offers the possibility for operational synergies. But the Botox maker's sweetest asset again seems to be tax, thanks to Allergan's acquisition by Actavis in 2014 which gave it a corporate headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Whether or not an inversion would still make economic sense for Pfizer remains to be seen. One of the reasons Pfizer was able to justify paying so much for AstraZeneca was because it could use offshore cash to fund the transaction and because it could substantially lower its tax rate after completing the deal. Under the new US tax changes, Pfizer may not be able to access ex-US cash to fund the deal without paying US taxes on it. </p><p> Pfizer today is a $209bn colossus, having achieved that market cap and stature by spending more money on M&amp;A than any other drug maker. Pfizer has completed one large deal this year: the acquisition of Hospira Inc. for $16bn, which closed in September and will strengthen Pfizer's established products business. Hospira is the largest producer of generic injectable pharmaceuticals. </p><p>See our interactive timeline, with links to further coverage, for selected acquisitions and divestments made by Pfizer since Read became CEO.</p><p><escenic_non_breaking_space></escenic_non_breaking_space></p><h3>PFIZER'S RECENT DEALS</h3> <iframe src='//cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1R4t9Y54ZhMFrb0gzYo51IkKnf04a2XQ3s_A-elIphDU&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=900' frameborder='0'></iframe> </preform> </p>
