<p><p>Takeda has decided to end the development of a combination vaccine for polio and other disorders as part of a broader re-evaluation of its vaccines pipeline to focus on outstanding global needs.</p><p><p>The move, which came just ahead of the release of the Japanese company's third-quarter financial results later this week, sees the discontinuation of TAK-361S, a combination diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis and Sabin inactivated poliovirus (DTaP/sIPV) vaccine, which was in Phase II clinical trials in Japan.</p><p><p>Takeda's Japanese head office told <i>Scrip's</i> sister publication <i>PharmAsia News</i> that the Phase II program was completed back in November 2013 and showed TAK-361S to be safe and well tolerated with good immunogenicity. No other trials with the product, licensed from Biken (The Research Foundation for Microbial Disease of Osaka University), are ongoing, the company confirmed.</p><p><p>The decision was taken voluntarily "to focus on vaccine programs that address significant unmet needs in Japan and around the globe, including dengue, norovirus, influenza, Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib], and Enterovirus 71," Takeda told <i>PharmAsia News</i>. </p><p><p>The move forms part of a vaccine portfolio review to ensure that "R&D resources are directed toward the highest-impact programs for public health," the firm added in a statement, pointing to the current availability of other safe and effective DTaP/sIPV vaccines in Japan.</p><p><p>"Our highest priority is infectious diseases that threaten the lives of millions of people each year, and for which vaccines do not exist," the president of Takeda's US-based Vaccine Business Unit, Dr Rajeev Venkayya, explained in the statement.</p><p><p>The leading Japanese pharma firm has been supplying pediatric vaccines in Japan for more than 60 years, but set up the new dedicated vaccines division in early 2012 to build its activities in what it sees as a high growth area.</p><p><h2>remaining pipeline</h2><p><p>Takeda noted that two of its novel development-stage vaccines, for norovirus and dengue, are expected to enter Phase III clinical trials in the fiscal 2015-16 period (beginning this April). The company's Phase II two genotype, virus-like particle preventive vaccine for gastroenteritis caused by norovirus is the furthest on in development globally, for an infection that is being given high priority by the Japanese government.</p><p><p>Its tetravalent candidate for prevention of dengue, TAK-003 (formerly known as DENVax), is a live attenuated product in Phase II that has been shown in early studies to induce immune responses to all four serotypes of the mosquito-borne infection.</p><p><p>Regulatory submissions for the first dengue vaccine, Sanofi's CYD-TDV, are expected in the first half of this year.</p><p><p>Takeda's vaccines pipeline also includes a liquid product for Hib, TAK-816 (licensed from Novartis, which sells it elsewhere as Vaxem Hib), which was filed for Japanese approval in September 2013, and TAK-850, a cell-based product for the prevention of flu type A and B in Phase I/II that uses Vero technology licensed from Baxter International. (The Vero cell technology and related assets are in the process of being sold to Nanotherapeutics.)</p><p><p>Rounding out the portfolio is INV21, a Phase I inactivated whole virus particle vaccine also produced in Vero cells for the prevention of enterovirus 71, which causes human hand, foot and mouth disease.</p><p><p>Much of Takeda's current pipeline has been built up through licensing and acquisition deals, with the dengue and EV71 vaccines both originally developed by the US vaccines venture Inviragen, bought in 2013.</p><p><p>The norovirus candidate came from the acquisition of another US firm, LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals, in 2012. </p><p><p>Takeda received approval in Japan in March last year for a cell cultured prophylactic H5N1 flu vaccine and related prototype vaccine, which also use technology licensed from Baxter. They are being manufactured at a new Takeda facility in Hikari, Yamaguchi prefecture, the construction of which was supported in part by the Japanese government, given the products' potential use in a pandemic situation.</p><p>This article was first published in <a href="https://www.pharmamedtechbi.com/publications/pharmasia-news" target="_new">PharmAsia News</a>.</p>
