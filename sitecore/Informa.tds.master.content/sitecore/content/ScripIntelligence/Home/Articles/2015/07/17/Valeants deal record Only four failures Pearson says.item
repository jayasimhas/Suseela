<p><p>As if its better-than-expectations performance for the first half weren't enough, Valeant Pharmaceuticals' CEO Michael Pearson played up the company's deal-making track record during its second quarter earnings call on 23 July. </p><p>Pearson noted that by company standards &ndash; which demand an internal rate of return (IRR) of greater than 20% &ndash; Valeant has only had four failed deals out of about 140 since it began its deal-making spree in 2008. </p><p>"Since 2008, we have completed over 140 acquisitions, license deals and co-promote agreements and deployed over $40bn in capital. Our internal rate of return hurdles continue to be the highest in the industry," the exec told analysts on the early morning call. </p><p>"As we break down our deal performance into large, medium and small deals, our track record, I believe, speaks for itself. Our large transactions such as Biovail, Medicis and Salix have all performed in-line or ahead of deal model," Mr Pearson said. "For our medium size deals, those $300 million to $1 billion, 10 of the 11 transactions are tracking towards or delivering well above our 20% IRR hurdle. And all have delivered above our cost of capital."</p><p>As for the 50 or so smaller deals that the company has conducted &ndash; those under $300 million &ndash; several have performed better than expectations and only four &ndash; Neotensil in the US, Vita Direct in Russia, PFI in Australia and Vital Science in Canada &ndash; have failed to meet that standard by performing below cost of capital. </p><p>"An important part of our deal analysis is our targeted six-year payback period. We have reviewed our largest deals since 2008. We are pleased to report that five of these deals have already been paid back entirely, including Coria, Dow, Aton, Biovail, Ortho, and Dermik," he said. </p><p>Valeant's second largest acquisition &ndash; the $8.7bn deal for eye care specialist Bausch+Lomb in 2013 &ndash; is on track to be paid off and has already reached 30% of that target. </p><p>The company's largest acquisition, the $11bn purchase of Salix Pharmaceuticals earlier this year &ndash; beating out Endo in the process &ndash; has been a win for Valeant already. The gastrointestinal drug Xifaxan (rifaximin) was already approved for traveler's diarrhea when Valeant bought Salix, but the company gained a greenlight for a second, more profitable indication in May when FDA approved Xifaxan for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).</p><p>Total revenue for the second quarter from the Salix acquisition was $313m, with Xifaxan becoming Valeant's largest product. It made up about 5% of the company's $2.7bn in sales for the quarter ending 30 June. </p><p>The company began launching the drug in IBS-D at the end of June and is currently awaiting approval from the FDA on the marketing campaign, including direct-to-consumer advertising. DTC advertising has been a significant factor in the IBS segment, and Valeant is facing new competition from Allergan&rsquo;s Viberzi (eluxadoline). Pearson noted that prescriptions have increased to 33% year-over-year growth since the approval. </p><p>Valeant lost out on a major bid for Allergan, which closed on a merger with Actavis in March, but it has closed eight deals so far this year and the always acquisitive company will continue on its M&A spree as the year continues, the CEO noted. </p><p>"Our M&A strategies will always be a collection of sort of the tuck-ins or bolt-ons,&rdquo; said Mr Pearson, &ldquo;and opportunistically, larger acquisitions. One can never predict the timing of a larger acquisition. So, when those happen, those happen. But what you should continue to see at minimum is continue the bolt-on acquisitions." </p><p><p>
