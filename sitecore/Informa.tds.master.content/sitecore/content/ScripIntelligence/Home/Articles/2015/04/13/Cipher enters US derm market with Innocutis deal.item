<p><p>With a $45.5m acquisition, Cipher Pharmaceuticals has bought its way into the US market and landed a 31-person sales force to help it move its new swath of specialty dermatology products.</p><p>The Canadian biotech announced 13 April that it has entered the US market through its acquisition of Innocutis, a US-based spec pharma with a focus on medical dermatology. The acquisition, which will be paid in cash, includes payment of $3m in additional milestone payments over the span of three years should certain financial targets be met. Cipher closed on a private offering of $100m in aggregate Senior Secured Notes due 2020 through investments by Athyrium Capital Management in order to fund the acquisition. The remaining funds will go toward funding future acquisitions. </p><p>"Getting the commercial infrastructure that Innocutis has, with the 31 territories and the highly capable team down in Charleston, puts us in good position, not only to accelerate growth with their products to launch several products that we've acquired through previous acquisitions. This is a foundation for us to grow and build a high quality derm business," said Cipher CEO Shawn O'Brien in an interview. </p><p>Innocutis, which brought in $10m in product revenues in 2014, markets the drug Sitavig (acyclovir) for the treatment of cold sores, which was approved by the FDA in 2013. "We are combining with a partner that is ideally suited to realize the full potential inherent in Sitavig, a treatment breakthrough for herpes labialis. The product was recently launched in the U.S. and will be filed in Canada in 2016," Innocutis CEO Joe Pecora in a statement. "Together with Cipher, we are poised to extend the Innocutis growth story not only in the US but also in Canada with an unwavering focus on exceeding the expectations of patients and the medical specialists who treat them."</p><p>O'Brien admits that Innocutis didn't have the proper resources to market Sitavig in the US and is excited to grow that product. He believes it can achieve more than $100m in sales and is already coordinating with the sales team, he added during the interview with Scrip. </p><p>The acquisition of Innocutis fits squarely into Cipher's three-pronged growth strategy. The company has been looking to enter the US market through both product licenses and company acquisitions. Cipher is also hoping to expand its dermatology business in Canada and is hoping to acquire technology that could be transformative to the company. "This is not the end of our business development activity in 2015," added O'Brien. </p><p>Innocutis is the fifth deal Cipher has made since the beginning of 2015. The company gained the rights to three drugs for inflammatory dermatology treatments &ndash; Dermadexin, Pruridexin and ASF-1096 &ndash; from Denmark-based Astion Pharma for $4.8m. Dermadexin is already approved in the EU for seborrheic dermatitis, while Pruridexin was submitted for approval in Europe for chronic pruritis &ndash; a decision is expected in the first half of 2015. ASF-1096 is currently in mid-stages for discoid lupus erythematosus and has been awarded orphan status in Europe. </p><p>Cipher is planning to submit Dermadexin and Pruridexin for US approval in the first half and intends to seek approval in Canada shortly after. The company will also pursue an orphan indication for ASF-1096 from the FDA. </p><p><p>
