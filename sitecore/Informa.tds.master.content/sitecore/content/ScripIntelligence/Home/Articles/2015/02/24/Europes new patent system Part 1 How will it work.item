<p><b>This is the first in a series of articles by Paul England of law firm Taylor Wessing looking at various aspects of Europe's new unitary patent and Unified Patent Court system, which is expected to come into force in 2017. Here, Paul looks at the structure of the new system and the EU member states that will be taking part</b>.</p><p>In as little as two years from now, it is likely that the Unified Patent Court (UPC) and the European patent having unitary effect (unitary patent) will be in force. Together, they will introduce the most far-reaching changes for 40 years to how and where patent litigation is conducted, by whom, and on what kind of patent. Given the radical nature of these developments, it would be as well to start at the beginning, with two simple questions: what are the Unified Patent Court and unitary patent; and what are they intended to achieve?</p><p>The UPC is a 'pan-EU' court and the unitary patent is a 'pan-EU' patent, which can only be enforced, or revoked, in the UPC. The unitary patent is obtained by first applying for a European patent and then registering for unitary effect within one month of grant. The UPC will have a number of divisions across Europe: a Court of First Instance composed of local and regional divisions, together with a central division split between three locations &ndash; Paris, London and Munich. There will also be a Court of Appeal in Luxembourg. However, it's important to remember that, as with the branch offices of a bank, these divisions all belong to one court.</p><p>In practical terms, this means the UPC is a forum in which unitary patents (and European patents, as will be discussed in a later article) can be enforced simultaneously in all the ratifying member states, in one set of proceedings. It also means these patents can be revoked in all the ratifying states simultaneously. This is in contrast with the existing system, in which patents can only be enforced or revoked in national courts, often resulting in two or more parallel actions in different countries, as well as high legal costs and often inconsistent decisions. Indeed, it is the principal purpose of the UPC to replace the existing, fragmented system with a single route for enforcement and revocation procedures. It is hoped that this will result in cost efficiencies and consistent decision-making.</p><p>There are, though, limitations to the pan-EU scope of the new system. Of the 27 EU member states at the time, only 25 signed the UPC Agreement (shown in the table below). Ratification, the formal authorization of a treaty by government, is also required before the UPC can apply.</p><p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Signatories to the UPC Agreement</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Signatories that have ratified the Agreement</b></p>&nbsp;</td><td><p><b>Member states not currently participating in the UPC</b></p>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy*, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, UK</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Malta, Sweden</p>&nbsp;</td><td><p>Spain, Poland, Croatia</p>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><i>*Italy is not a participant in the unitary patent.</i></p><p>Spain and Poland did not sign because of political objections based on the language regime, and Croatia was not a member state at the time. The result is that decisions of the UPC cannot apply in these countries. So, whilst only 13 countries, including France, Germany and the UK, are required to ratify the UPC before it can come into force, the decisions of the UPC will only apply in these countries too &ndash; the more countries that ratify, the more will become subject to UPC decisions. So far six countries have ratified, but more ratifications, including that of the UK, are expected in 2015.</p><p>The unitary patent itself is a single right protecting an invention, which prohibits anyone but the owner - or their licensee - from practising that invention in all the participating EU member states that signed the unitary patent regulation (1257/2012/EU). </p><p>However, the participating member states don't include Italy or Spain (although Italy is a signatory to the UPC), because these countries object to the fact that Spanish and Italian are not official languages of grant of the unitary patent. And, because Poland did not sign the UPC Agreement, the unitary patent can have no effect there, either. Again, the number of ratifications is important: a unitary patent can only protect inventions in the member states that have ratified the UPC Agreement at the time unitary effect is registered.</p><p>Next in the series: What are the cost implications for my business?</p><p><i>Paul England is senior associate in the UPC Group at international law firm Taylor Wessing LLP.</i></p>
