<p>India's top drug firm, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, expects to use a "judicious balance" between reducing complexities in its vast manufacturing network and maintaining adequate and "fall-back" capacities for "critical" products as part of rationalization efforts aimed at deriving synergy benefits from the Ranbaxy acquisition.</p><p>While some of the assessment exercise is still underway, a senior Sun official outlined the broad contours of the company's approach and also underscored how it is vital to win back the regulator's trust across sites. </p><p>The official explained that while there are certain sites which are important from what they supply in terms of the type of products, some others are important in terms of the markets that they cater for.</p><p>"There will be sites which are probably very dedicated to markets&#8230; there may not be an opportunity for us to do much in the short term and we need to find ways of strengthening those sites. But if you have multiple sites to a market or for a single dosage form, there you may have an opportunity to do some amount of restructuring," the Sun official told <i>Scrip </i>in an exclusive interaction.</p><p>A team, the official added, was doing a detailed review of such aspects and hoped to "sort of define as to where we'd like to end up." </p><p>He declined to identify specific sites which are expected to be impacted by the review.</p><p>With about 45 facilities, the Sun-Ranbaxy combine's manufacturing footprint covers five continents, with products sold in more than 150 nations. Sun announced the closure of the merger with Ranbaxy in March this year.</p><p>Last month Sun <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Amid-Suns-FY16-earnings-gloom-some-little-gems-359545" target="_new">raised its target</a> for synergy benefits from the Ranbaxy acquisition by 15-20% compared with the original target of $250m by FY18. This, the company said, will be achieved by focusing on overall profitability improvement driven by revenue and procurement synergies, manufacturing rationalization and certain cost-management measures. </p><h2>Critical Products</h2><p>The Sun official also outlined how the firm's manufacturing rationalisation plans expect to weave in efforts to create a backup facility for its "critical" products. </p><p>In general, Sun expects to look at various dosage forms and tie this in with the markets being supplied to identify opportunities that may help the firm group sites "more densely." </p><p>In the case of a site where the capacity utilization is "relatively low" and where the firm sees an opportunity to bring more products to that site and increase capacity utilisation and hence "reduce the overall per unit overhead cost", it will do so. </p><p>"At the same time, if for critical products, we need to create a back-up so that we can do a filing out of two sites then we would also use that opportunity to file the product from a different site," the official said. </p><p>One such critical product may possibly include Sun's generic version of Novartis' Gleevec (imatinib mesylate). Last year, Sun announced a settlement with Novartis concerning the product under which the Indian firm can launch its generic version on Feb. 1, 2016.</p><p>The Sun official also referred to the example of the firm's Pharmalucence injectables site in the US.</p><p>"While we can file more products, we can also create a second site for some of the important products."</p><p>Sun <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-acquires-injectables-maker-Pharmalucence-352916" target="_new">acquired</a> the privately held US injectables manufacturer Pharmalucence in 2014. </p><p>He, though, explained that the second site approach "doesn't make sense" for the entire portfolio, given that there is "an economic cost" to be borne for a second filing.</p><p>The Sun official went on to refer to the need for a judicious balance between reducing the complexity of the overall manufacturing network alongside ensuring adequate capacity and sites, so that the company has "enough in terms of a fall-back or a contingency." </p><p>"We will need to do this balancing."</p><h2>Tainted Sites</h2><p>Asked whether it was generally worth pursuing setting right some of the tainted Ranbaxy sites, given the complexity and reputational issues involved, the official referred to how Sun's approach, in general, has been to remediate compliance issues as part of efforts to regain the trust of regulators. </p><p>A similar approach is expected to be considered for the erstwhile Ranbaxy sites, now part of Sun's fold.</p><p>The official referred to the firm's resolve to remediate Sun's Karkhadi site following the FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FDA-action-to-have-limited-impact-on-Sun-Marck-site-under-lens-too-350626" target="_new">import alert</a> against it despite the site not being a significant contributor to overall revenues. </p><p>"Our approach is one of working towards resolving the cGMP issues that have been identified," he said, referring to similar efforts at Sun's US arm Caraco's Detroit plant that was later <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Sun-to-shut-Detroit-site-123-employees-affected-351609" target="_new">closed</a>. </p><p>"We worked for three years, resolved the manufacturing issues, got an approval from the FDA to restart the [Detroit] site and about a year and half ago we decided to shut it down. We could have decided to shut it down much earlier."</p><p>However, the official said that Sun realises that the "complexity and magnitude" of challenge at the Ranbaxy sites is much higher and to that extent it would probably not be possible to "do everything together."</p><p>Sun had previously indicated that remedial action at Ranbaxy's Mohali, Dewas, Poanta Sahib and Toansa facilities was on track and that it was working towards the fulfilment of the requirements of the US consent decree.</p><p>"We will try to expedite the resolution for at least one of these facilities," a statement from Sun then added.</p><p>Last year, Ranbaxy had voluntarily <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Shake-out-in-works-as-Ranbaxy-intensifies-API-cleanup-350248" target="_new">put on hold</a> shipments from its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) facilities in Toansa and Dewas. The FDA had previously <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/More-trouble-for-Ranbaxy-FDA-bans-drugs-from-Toansa-facility-349561" target="_new">prohibited</a> Ranbaxy from manufacturing and distributing APIs from its facility in Toansa, and subjected it to certain terms of a consent decree of permanent injunction entered against Ranbaxy in January 2012. </p><p>Three of the firm's other sites in India &ndash; Dewas, Mohali and Paonta Sahib &ndash; are already operating under the consent decree. Ranbaxy previously pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $500m to settle felony charges of manufacturing and distributing adulterated drugs made at the Paonta Sahib and Dewas facilities.</p>
