<p>The positive opinion granted by the European Medicines Agency to a reversal agent that is expected to be used very rarely brings Boehringer Ingelheim one step closer to a potential healthy injection of additional sales for its anticoagulant <i>Pradaxa</i> (dabigatran). Datamonitor Healthcare predicts that Pradaxa revenues in the EU could rise by 15% by 2020, should the Pradaxa antidote <i>Praxbind</i> (idarucizumab) be approved this year. This is now expected following the positive recommendation from the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP).</p><p>"The eventual approval of Praxbind could help revive sales of Pradaxa, which have been declining since 2014. An antidote may help restore physician confidence in prescribing the drug, and we forecast that its approval could increase Pradaxa's use by over 15% within the first five years of the antidote's release in the EU," commented Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Aine Slowey.</p><p>Pradaxa's global sales in 2014 dipped by just under 1% to &euro;1.20bn, as confidence in the product was knocked by lawsuits involving claims of severe or fatal bleeding in patients taking Pradaxa, the bulk of which Boehringer Ingelheim <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Boehringer-to-pay-650m-to-settle-Pradaxa-litigation-352040" target="_new">settled out of court</a> in 2014. The German comapny maintains that it would have won the cases, but didn't want years of litigation hanging over it. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare forecasts that approval of the antidote in the US, a far larger market for Pradaxa, could add around 10% in sales there by the fifth year after launch. The US FDA <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BIs-Pradaxa-antidote-idarucizumab-wins-US-priority-review-358036" target="_new">granted a priority review</a> to Praxbind in April 2015, and it could be approved before year-end.</p><p>Boehringer Ingelheim said the antidote was designed to "help give clinicians confidence when using Pradaxa" but in reality would only be used on rare occasions when anti-coagulation needs to be reversed, for example when a patient is in a car accident. A UK spokesperson told <i>Scrip</i>, however, that from feedback it had received it would appear that Pradaxa sales had been held back not so much by the lack of an antidote &ndash; "since most physicians are aware the half-life is already less than warfarin" &ndash; as by other barriers such as those put up by local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in the UK, "for example when they don't understand the costs of treating stroke." The older standard of care, warfarin, can be reversed with vitamin K.</p><p>Boehringer's spokesperson characterized Praxbind as "the icing on the cake, the last bit in the puzzle", which would provide reassurance that "if something awful were to happen", reversal would be possible. They said that over and above the antidote, the company expected real life data on safety and efficacy to help drive an increase in Pradaxa use. "We're not bringing the antidote to market because we think it'll have a huge commercial benefit," they added.</p><p>Praxbind looks set to be the first product in the new generation of oral anti-coagulants to have an accompanying antidote. However, Portola Pharmaceuticals' andexanet alfa is following on its heels, and if approved will provide an antidote to not just one competitor but for the rest of the set. (While Pradaxa acts to inhibit thrombin directly, its rivals <i>Eliquis</i> (apixaban; Bristol-Myers Squibb/Pfizer), <i>Xarelto</i> (rivaroxaban; Bayer/Johnson & Johnson) and <i>Savaysa</i> (edoxaban; Daiichi Sankyo) are all Factor Xa inhibitors susceptible to reversal by Portola's product.)</p><p>BioMedTracker analyst Peter Chang believes that andexanet and other factors will limit the extent to which Praxbind will bolster Pradaxa's commercial outlook.</p><p>"The idarucizumab approval in Europe should give Pradaxa some boost, but in the long term, with the approval of the Factor Xa inhibitor antidote andexanet possibly in 2016 or 2017, we think that will be limited. Depending on the situation, physicians familiar with the novel anticoagulants may still view competitors they are using now as having an advantage. And for those still reluctant to use the novel anticoagulants, there are other still other barriers in some European countries that will take time to overcome, such as reimbursement for monitoring warfarin."</p><p>The <a href="http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2015/09/news_detail_002399.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1" target="_new">CHMP's positive opinion</a> was based on data from healthy volunteers as well as results from an interim analysis of Boehringer Ingelheim's ongoing Phase III global RE-VERSE AD trial, which showed that reversal effects were evident within minutes of administration of 5 g of idarucizumab. RE-VERSE AD was begun in May 2014, and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Portola-and-Boehringer-find-antidotes-to-poor-oral-anticoagulant-uptake-359130" target="_new">interim results</a> were reported in June 2015. </p><p>The CHMP had granted an accelerated assessment of Praxbind "given its potential to respond to an unmet medical need."</p><p>
