<p>The Australian government is to provide an extra Aus$1.3bn (US$1.04bn) over five years to fund the listing of new medicines and vaccines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), as part of a drive to improve patient access to innovative life-saving therapies. </p><p>The funding, which is part of an overall allotment of Aus$1.6bn for new and amended PBS listings over the five-year period, is contained in the federal 2015 budget that was passed on 12 May. </p><p>Health minister Sussan Ley said that access to new medicines was "crucial if we're to help Australians beat life-threatening diseases such as cancer as well as overcome chronic and degenerative conditions that can rob them of their independence".</p><p>However, the money doesn't come without strings, as the budget also calls for savings of Aus$252.2m in the form of price cuts on certain medicines currently listed on the PBS, as part of an overall package of healthcare savings totalling Aus$1.8bn. The government says it is working on a number of measures to support the long-term sustainability of the PBS, which will probably include a wide-ranging review of the cost-effectiveness of medicines that are already subsidized under the scheme.</p><p>The pharmaceutical industry, which has repeatedly complained about delays in patient access to new innovative drugs, gave a lukewarm reception to the funding, saying that it was concerned about the threat posed to the PBS by proposed government actions. </p><p>"All Australians deserve access to the world's best medicines and we must avoid policy measures that will damage the PBS," said Tim James, CEO of the industry body Medicines Australia. </p><h2>New products</h2><p>The new products to be paid for with the new funding include the following:</p><ul><li>GSK's trametinib (Mekinist) for BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma will be listed on the PBS from 1 July at a cost of Aus$437m over four years. The health ministry said the combination of trametinib with GSK's already listed dabrafenib (Tafinlar) had been shown to be more effective than dabrafenib alone, and that the new listing would help "approximately 1,036" melanoma patients. Without government subsidy these medicines would cost patients over Aus$131,300 per treatment, the ministry said.</li><li>Roche's pertuzumab (Perjeta), trastuzumab (Herceptin) and trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla) for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer will be listed on the PBS from 1 July 2015 at a cost of Aus$191m over four years. Around 590 patients per year are expected to benefit from the additional therapy provided by Kadcyla where their disease has progressed despite previous treatment, while the combination of Perjeta and Herceptin will provide a more effective treatment option for this cancer than Herceptin alone, the ministry said. It added that without government subsidy these medicines would cost consumers over Aus$82,700 each per year.</li><li>Novartis's ranibizumab (Lucentis) is currently listed on the PBS for macular degeneration, and from 1 July 2015 this listing will be expanded to include patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and diabetic macular oedema (DME), costing the government another Aus$541m over four years and taking the total taxpayer investment in Lucentis to Aus$1.5bn over the same period. "This new listing will assist approximately 12,000 patients with DME and 6,000 patients with RVO", the ministry noted, adding that without a subsidy the product would cost consumers more than Aus$10,000 per year.</li><li>Merck's herpes zoster vaccine Zostavax will be subsidised at a cost of some Aus$100m over four years. This new listing will help vaccinate up to 240,000 older Australians on an ongoing basis each year, and 1.4m individuals through a five-year catch-up program, according to the ministry.</li></ul><p>The listing of the cancer drugs, worth a combined Aus$624m over four years, will form part of a package of budget measures designed to help improve cancer detection, treatment and prevention, including a new National Cancer Screening Register and the rollout of a new cervical cancer test that will improve survival rates while reducing the number of invasive checks required from every two years to five years, the ministry observed. </p><h2>Price amendments</h2><p>It's not clear yet which medicines currently on the PBS will be affected by the "price amendments" that the government says will save Aus$252.2m over five years. It notes that price amendments implemented since the release of the "Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2014-15" in December 2014 affected the following products: etoposide for cancer, ezetimibe plus simvastatin for dyslipidemia, fluticasone plus salmeterol for asthma and COPD, and hexamine for urinary tract infections.</p><p>Ms Ley said that taxpayers currently invest almost Aus$10bn annually subsidizing drugs on the PBS, and that a further Aus$3bn worth of new drugs are being considered by the government for PBS listing. This figure is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) meeting three times a year and expected to make more than 100 recommendations for new drug listings annually, she observed. </p><p>"With more and more new drugs in the pipeline in coming years, taxpayers are easily looking at spending Aus$50bn on making medicines more affordable for patients over the next five years," she said. "That's why the government is proposing sensible measures across the pharmaceutical supply chain that ensure every dollar taxpayers invest in subsidizing existing drugs is spent as efficiently as possible so we can continue to invest in new innovative medicines as well."</p><p>In its budget statement on "Access to Pharmaceutical Services", the government outlines the estimated costs of the PBS, including present and future listings. It says the scheme is expected to cost Aus$9.77bn in 2015-16, and that some 298m PBS prescriptions will be dispensed in the same period. </p><p>"Since the 2014-15 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December 2014, the government approved 169 new or amended PBS listings, and one listing on the Life Saving Drugs Programme (LSDP), at an overall cost of Aus$1.6bn over five years, to treat a range of illnesses from rare forms of cancer to skin conditions."</p><p>Moreover, at its March meeting the PBAC recommended a further Aus$2.5bn in new listings for 2015-16: as more high-cost medicines are listed and more patients require access to them, "the cost to government will increase". </p><p>Therefore, in 2015-16, the government "will progress several reviews of medicines in use, focusing on the appropriate and quality use of medicines to help improve health outcomes for patients and ensure continued value for money for taxpayers". The review of all PBS authority required medicines commenced in 2014-15, and is expected to be completed in 2015-16. Some 60 recommendations from the first stage of this review were implemented at the beginning of May, saving around Aus$355,700, the government said. </p><p>It also noted the planned <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Australia-to-include-modern-HTAclinical-evaluation-methods-in-updated-PBAC-guidelines-358111" target="_new">review of the PBAC guidelines</a>, which is intended to ensure that the PBAC submission and assessment process remains "consistent and transparent", with the integration of modern health technology assessment and clinical evaluation methods. </p><h2>Other measures</h2><p>Other healthcare measures in the budget include:</p><ul><li>Changes to the remuneration system for pharmacists.</li><li>Establishing a new Medical Research Future Fund, albeit with less funding than initially planned. </li><li>An extra Aus$26.4m over four years to help improve immunization rates across the country, including new incentives for doctors who identify and catch up children who are more than two months overdue for their vaccination.</li><li>The establishment of a national e-health electronic records system for doctors and patients.</li></ul>
