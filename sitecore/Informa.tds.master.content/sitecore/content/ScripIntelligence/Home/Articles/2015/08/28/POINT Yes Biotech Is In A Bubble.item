<p>It may be too early to determine whether biopharma is nearing the end of a summer slowdown or preparing to see an investment and dealmaking bubble burst, but there are a few pins poised to pop the proverbial bubble, leaving "When?" as the biggest unanswered question.</p><p>Another important question: Will the bursting bubble be biopharma-specific or will it apply to all industries? Stock market indices around the world have fallen recently regarding fears of slower growth in China and the prospect that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the US. However, the big runup in share prices has been much greater in biotech than for stocks generally, so the industry has farther to fall if the economy implodes. </p><p>(See Lisa LaMotta's opposing bubble view <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/COUNTERPOINT-No-Biotech-Isnt-In-A-Bubble-360236?REFID=DLYALT" target="_new">here</a>.)</p><p>The number of initial public offerings by drug development firms fell from 41 in the first half of 2014 to 29 in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-A-US-biotech-IPO-surge-Data-are-mixed-359219" target="_new">the first half of 2015</a>, but the collective value of drug developer IPOs increased from $2.6bn to $2.8bn, meaning the average deal value jumped 52.4% from $63.4m to $96.6m. </p><p>Stock market investors clearly are continuing to swarm around biotech opportunities, whether they're investing in IPOs or putting money into already public drug developers. The Nasdaq Biotech Index (NBI) was up 12.65% on Aug. 31 versus the end of 2014 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was down 7.27% during the same period and the Nasdaq was up just 0.85%.</p><p>Biotech IPOs and stock market returns have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-VC-deals-have-best-ever-quarter-2.3bn-359519" target="_new">fueled investments in venture capital</a> for drug development firms in 2015. Both IPOs and acquisitions of private firms by big pharma have returned capital to VC investors, allowing venture capitalists to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-benefits-as-VC-firms-raise-cash-in-Q2-359387" target="_new">raise even more money</a> for new biotech investments.</p><p>Arguably, if the IPO window closes for drug developers &ndash; a possibility considering the slowdown in biotech offerings in July and August &ndash; then mergers and acquisitions could really soar, since pharma won't be competing with public market investors to value biotech companies. </p><p>More M&A would be good news for venture capital investors seeking returns, but lower acquisition prices or deals that defer a greater portion of the transaction total to future milestone payments are bad for VC firms that wind up with less upfront cash to return to investors.</p><p>Biopharma M&A in the first half of 2015 was about as active as the first half of 2014, but <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/INFOGRAPHIC-Biopharma-Not-Scared-Of-High-Price-Tags-360076" target="_new">the total value tripled</a> from $65.1bn to $188bn and per-deal price tags for announced and completed deals also were nearly three times higher during the first six months of this year. </p><p>With asset values skyrocketing, have pharma companies &ndash; which are under pressure to do deals &ndash; absorbed all of the new assets that they can afford for the time being? It's doubtful, since companies need to continually replenish their development pipelines.</p><p>But are certain hyped areas of biopharma reaching a dealmaking peak, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-The-end-of-the-affair-with-gene-therapy-358779" target="_new">such as gene therapies</a>, while the industry waits to see how effective these programs are in clinical trials? Maybe.</p><p>We probably will have to wait until the fourth quarter to see if the mad rush to close deals before the year's end shows a continued M&A boom. But if IPOs continue to slack off &ndash; there were 10 new offerings in June, but only six in July and five in August &ndash; M&A prices could drop too and lower values would show that the bubble has burst.</p><p><p><p><p>
