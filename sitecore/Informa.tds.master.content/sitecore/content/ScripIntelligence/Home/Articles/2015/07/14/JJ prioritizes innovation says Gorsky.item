<p><p>With its hepatitis C drugs taking a major hit from competition and advances in the space, Johnson & Johnson realizes that it has keep innovation top of mind. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and CEO of the multi-national conglomerate, told investors during its second quarter earnings call that the company is actively looking for new value-creating acquisitions and deals.</p><p>"As you well know, everything starts with innovation, and at Johnson & Johnson, we are doing that on multiple fronts and we are committed to working with researchers around the world to ensure that we continue to operate at the leading edge of science, medicine and technology," said Mr Gorsky during a 14 July earnings call. </p><p>J&J's pharmaceutical unit had sales of $7.9bn, but sales in the US were steeply impacted &ndash; dropping 1.5%. The decrease was due to the company's hepatitis C products, particularly Olysio (simeprevir), which dropped dramatically after being faced by clinical cures by Gilead Sciences. When the HCV products are taken out of the equation, growth in the US was up by 9.7%.</p><p>J&J was on the wrong side of innovation in the hepatitis C market, but Mr Gorsky tried to highlight how the company isn't going to let that happen in other spaces. J&J invested about 11.5% of sales, or $8.5bn, last year in R&D. Beyond the R&D investment from the company, Gorsky admits that acquisitions have accounted for just under half of J&J's sales growth over the last decade. </p><p>"You can see the impact [of the R&D investment] reflected in our portfolio and robust development pipeline, which includes 25 active late-stage development programs, 160-plus early stage programs, and over 70 venture investments," the exec said. "And in just two years, there's already 90 start-ups working in our J-labs which creates tremendous access to new ideas and potential downstream partnerships for the future."</p><p>J-Labs is the company's incubator, which helps support biotech start-ups and works closely with its business development arm, J&J Innovation, as well as the venture arm, JJDC. </p><p>"And, by executing with excellence in all that we do, we have introduced a strong cadence of new product launches over the past five years that today account for about 25% of our overall sales," said Mr Gorsky. "And we're taking steps to ensure we are even more effective and efficient across the enterprise by investing in greater uses of technology, and streamlining our back office processes which we expect will help to free up about $1 billion that we can invest back into the business by 2018."</p><p><p>
