<p>Dr Reddy's Laboratories reported a 7% decline in net profit at INR5.7bn ($91m) for the third quarter ended December 2014, dented by impairment charges even as firm's top brass indicated that they were keeping a close eye on currency headwinds in emerging markets like Russia.</p><p>The company recorded an impairment charge of INR534m during the quarter following the decline in the recoverable amounts of certain product / customer contracts-related intangible assets.</p><p>All eyes are also on Dr Reddy's Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) generic launch prospects in the US after a recent FDA inspection of the firm's Indian active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) site for the product had raised certain compliance issues. The company, though, appeared to be working on a plan B to mitigate any potential risk to the opportunity.</p><p>Revenues for the quarter grew 9% to INR38.4bn, but the depreciation of the rouble weighed down the company's performance. Revenues from Russia declined by 9% to INR4bn. In constant currency, Russian growth was around 27% on the back of healthy sales.</p><p>In a post-results investor call, Dr Reddy's president and chief financial officer Saumen Chakraborty said that in view of the company's exposure to oil exporting economies, the management continued to monitor the macroeconomic situation and maintain a ''fine balance between optimizing opportunity and controlled exposure''. </p><p>Plummeting crude prices have fuelled a sell-off in the rouble, with the Russian currency falling to a record low against the dollar in December 2014 and declining by more than 40% last year &ndash; its worst performance since 1998 when Russia defaulted on local debt, agency reports said. Sanctions against Moscow amid the Ukraine crisis have only added to these woes.</p><p><i>T</i>he devaluation of the rouble was already expected to hurt Q3 earnings of a clutch of leading Indian firms including Dr Reddy's Laboratories and Glenmark <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Russian-oil-spill-may-slide-Dr-Reddys-Glenmark-in-Q3-356272%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 21 January 2015)</a>. </p><p>Emerging markets, ex-Russia reported strong growth at INR4.6bn (+51%) primarily driven by a strong performance in Venezuela on the back of continued volume upsides. Dr Reddy's top brass said that it, however, continued to watch the currency and ''funds repatriation situation'' very closely in Venezuela. Jefferies said earlier this month that Venezuela, which depends on oil for more than 90% of its export revenues, risks insolvency.</p><p>Revenues from North America were up 4% to INR16.8bn. Sequential growth in constant currency was 17%, primarily on account of sustained performance of 2013-14 limited competition launches such as decitabine, azacitidine, and divalproex sodium ER and the market share expansion of ziprasidone, amlodipine-atorvastatin and sumatriptan auto injector. The company launched six products during the quarter. It has 68 ANDAs pending for approval with the FDA including 43 Para IV filings and 13 potential FTFs (first-to-file).</p><p>India revenues stood at INR4.3bn (+11%), while the pharmaceutical services and active ingredients business clocked revenues of INR6.1bn (+21%).</p><h2>Nexium opportunity</h2><p>Meanwhile, Dr Reddy's has also indicated that the company was working on a back-up plan for its Nexium generic after an FDA inspection of the firm's API site in Srikakulam raised certain compliance issues.</p><p>At the investor call Dr Reddy's chief operating officer, Abhijit Mukherjee, said that the company had responded to the US FDA 483s [a notice of the agency's inspectional observations that lists deficiencies in the quality system] about a month back in a ''very comprehensive'' manner. </p><p>''We will also be sending periodic updates to the agency giving progress on our committed action points,'' Mr Mukherjee said.</p><p>He, though, added that alternative plans were also being progressed. These essentially revolve around a potential site switch for the API. </p><p>The FDA had recently approved the first generic version of AstraZeneca's Nexium from Teva arm Ivax Pharmaceuticals, confirming Ranbaxy's fears that it had forfeited its 180-day exclusivity for the 20mg and 40mg versions of the product <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ranbaxy-fights-on-as-Tevas-generic-Nexium-hits-US-356393%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 27 January 2015)</a>.Ranbaxy is, however, fighting on.</p>
