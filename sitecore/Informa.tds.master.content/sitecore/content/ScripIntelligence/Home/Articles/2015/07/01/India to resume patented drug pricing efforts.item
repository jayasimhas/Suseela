<p>India appears set to renew its efforts towards finalizing a mechanism for price negotiations for patented drugs &ndash; a thorny issue and one that's been under deliberation for more than six years now.</p><p>Industry sources told <i>Scrip</i> that an inter-ministerial committee, including members from the commerce and health ministries, met recently to discuss the issue and certain stakeholders and industry associations were invited.</p><p>''This is a time bound exercise. As compulsory licences are potentially going to be rare, and most people pay out of pocket, negotiated pricing has become critical. Also, the prices of patented medicines are out of reach [of a bulk of the population],'' a source told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Indications are that an exercise to collate data pertaining to the imports of patented drugs &ndash; probably via the Form 27 route &ndash; was underway. Form 27 of the India's Patent Act is a statement pertaining to the ''working'' of the patented invention on a commercial scale in India. </p><p>Sources also believe that the committee may, in general, consider procurement prices in Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand to arrive at a price for India and use the World Bank's PPP (purchasing power parity) for fixing prices for India. </p><p>Companies that may not be keen to supply under such terms may face the risk of compulsory licensing, some sources suggested. </p><p>Government officials could not immediately be reached for a comment on the issue.</p><p>The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) had in the past emphasised that price negotiations with reference to patented medicines need to be considered with caution since it could potentially dilute one of the grounds for grant of a compulsory licence (CL) &ndash; unaffordable pricing - under Section 84 of the Indian Patent Act. Under Section 84, any time after three years from sealing of a patent, anyone can make an application for a CL if: ''reasonable'' requirements of the public for the product have not been satisfied; or the patented invention is not available at a "reasonably affordable" price; or the patented invention is not "worked" in India.</p><p>It's not clear if the starting point in the new effort would be a previous government panel's suggestion that outlined three specific categories for price negotiations: medicines having no therapeutic equivalence in India; those having a therapeutic equivalent in India; and medicines introduced for the first time in India.</p><p>The former panel, initially constituted by the department of pharmaceuticals [then the department of chemicals and petrochemicals] in February 2007, had recommended a reference pricing approach while keeping in view the gross national income and purchasing power parity.</p><p>This previous panel, which had had three chairmen over the years, had, among other things, similarly suggested that the reference prices of the patented medicines to be used for price negotiations in India will be the procurement prices of those medicines by governments of countries such as the UK, Canada, France, Australia and New Zealand. These countries have a wide coverage of health insurance by their governments and therefore have high bargaining power in deciding the price of such patented medicines through negotiations, the erstwhile panel observed in its report <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Indias-wealth-based-pricing-scheme-leverages-compulsory-licensing-threat-340399%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 28 February 2013)</a>. </p><p>The previous panel's report was, however, in late 2013 reported to have had been "shelved" given that "market dynamics" had changed over the years, though there had been murmurs of hectic lobbying against the recommendations <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Relief-for-foreign-firms-amid-reports-of-new-Indian-pricing-panel-348470" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 3 December 2013)</a>. </p><p>Some experts with foreign firms have previously underscored that the pricing issue needs to be handled holistically considering the interest of all the stakeholders including patients. They said that rather than focusing on costs alone, India should follow a pharmacoeconomics model that focuses not only on cost but also on the cost benefit ratio and the value the new drug adds to the patient. They believe that NICE [the health technology appraisal body for England and Wales] in the UK along with the NHS had done a ''good job'' in containing healthcare costs there benefiting patients enormously and a similar model could be emulated. </p><p>The Organization of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), which represents leading multinational firms, had, in its reaction to the erstwhile panel's report, suggested that price negotiations for patented products should be made only for government purchases and should not be linked with regulatory approvals. <i>Scrip</i> has previously reported how some experts had criticized the per capita income-linked reference pricing model, instead suggesting suitable access models <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Industry-finds-flaws-Indian-per-capita-income-linked-price-approach-for-patented-drugs-334120%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 17 August 2012)</a>. </p>
