<p>Shares of AcelRx Pharmaceuticals plummeted about 30% on 5 May after the FDA reiterated its earlier demand that a new clinical trial was needed before the company resubmits its new drug application (NDA) for Zalviso, a pre-programmed, non-invasive, handheld system that delivers 15mcg per dose as needed of the opioid sufentanil, allowing hospital patients to self-dose in managing their pain.</p><p>So AcelRx said it has put its resubmission plans on hold while it seeks input from regulatory, legal and clinical advisers on possible next steps forward for the drug. </p><p>"We will be considering all options to determine a pathway forward for Zalviso, including the possibility of dispute resolution through one of the FDA prescribed pathways, as well as conducting additional clinical and human factors studies," the company said in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Shares of AcelRx closed at $3.04, down $1.17, or 27.7%.</p><p>The FDA had caught the firm and Wall Street off guard last summer by issuing a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Surprise-snub-by-FDA-of-AcelRxs-Zalviso-353060" target="_new">complete response letter</a> (CRL) for Zalviso.</p><p>While the CRL contained requests for additional information on the Zalviso delivery system to ensure the proper use of the device and data demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of optical system errors, changes to address inadvertent dosing and data to support the product's shelf life, AcelRx said there were no requests for additional clinical studies. </p><p>But the FDA changed its mind &ndash; telling the company in <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/AcelRx-slumps-as-FDA-demands-another-Zalviso-trial-357138" target="_new">March</a> a clinical trial was required after all to assess the risk of inadvertent dispensing and overall risk of dispensing failures. </p><p>AcelRx said it submitted a request on 21 April for a Type B meeting with the FDA's Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Addiction Products.</p><p>But on 1 May, the FDA denied that request, telling the firm it needed to conduct the trial as requested.</p><p>AcelRx said it would provide an update about its next steps once it finalizes its plan for moving forward towards gaining Zalviso approval in the US.</p><p>The firm said the FDA has precleared certain aspects of the company's proposed risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS). Regulators indicated they would continue discussions with AcelRx about its proposed REMS after the Zalviso NDA has been resubmitted, the company said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
