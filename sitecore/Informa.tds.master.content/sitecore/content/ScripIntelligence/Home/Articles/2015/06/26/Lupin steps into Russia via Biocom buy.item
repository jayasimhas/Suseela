<p>Lupin has snapped up the Russian generic firm, ZAO Biocom, sticking to its stated intent of M&A being one of the key drivers of its future as a global generic and specialty company.</p><p>The deal, which marks Lupin's entry into the RUB765bn Russian pharmaceutical market, comes at a time when the Indian firm's sales have been generally jaded by tough conditions in the US, its key market.</p><p>Higher price erosion in the US and a slowdown in product approvals <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/MandA-focus-for-Lupin-as-US-business-drags-358397%5d" target="_new">impacted Lupin's growth</a> in the fourth quarter ended March 2015. </p><p>Lupin said it had acquired 100% equity in Biocom subject to certain closing conditions and that the acquisition will allow it to expand into neighbouring markets as well as other Eastern European markets in the future.</p><p>For over a decade, the Russian pharmaceutical market has reported double digit growth and this is expected to continue placing it as one of the top eight markets in the world by 2018 as per IMS Health data.</p><p>Analysts tracking the development told <i>Scrip</i> that Russia is inherently a "good" market despite the current macroeconomic uncertainty there and that the Lupin deal was perhaps opportunely timed. "I assume it's a value buy," one analyst told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><h2>Biocom</h2><p>Established in 1991, Biocom is focused on therapies in segments such as cardiovasculars and CNS and antimicrobials for systemic use, in addition to contract manufacturing and secondary packaging. </p><p>The firm reported sales of RUB861.2m in the financial year 2014 and comes with 118 employees. </p><p>It also operates a European GMP-compliant plant and was one of the first Russian pharmaceutical firms to receive an approved manufacturer status from the World Health Organization in 2013, Lupin said.</p><p>In May, Lupin, which has made a string of acquisitions over the past few years, bought Medqu&iacute;mica Ind&uacute;stria Farmac&ecirc;utica, marking its entry into the Brazilian market. In March, Lupin consolidated its holding in South Africa's <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-consolidates-position-in-S-African-buy-357303%5d" target="_new">Pharma Dynamics</a>. </p><p>In a recent <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupins-CEO-on-the-specialty-asset-hunt-in-the-US-358438" target="_new">interview</a> with <i>Scrip</i> Lupin's CEO Vinita Gupta suggested that the company would like to step up growth in markets like the US via a buy. The firm then maintained that its "bigger" acquisitions will be in its big geographies: the US, India or Japan or in companies geared towards those markets.</p>
