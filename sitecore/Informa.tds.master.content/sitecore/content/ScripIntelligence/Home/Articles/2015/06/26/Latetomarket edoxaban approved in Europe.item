<p> Daiichi Sankyo's once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor Lixiana (edoxaban) has been approved for use in the EU to prevent stroke and to prevent and treat certain blood clots, without the limitations set by the US regulator. </p> <p> The product was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Daiichi-Sankyos-factor-Xa-Savaysa-OKd-but-with-limitations-356027" target="_blank">approved in the US</a> at the start of the year under the brand name Savaysa. However, the FDA imposed a black box warning on the label telling prescribers that the drug <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-reviewers-advise-limited-use-for-Daiichi-Sankyos-edoxaban-354726" target="_new">should not be used in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation</a> (NVAF) who have a creatinine clearance levels greater than 95 mL/min, because of increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin at the highest dose studied (60 mg). In other words, people whose kidneys work really well should not receive Savaysa because it may not work well to prevent stroke. </p> <p> The marketing authorization for Lixiana is for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with NVAF with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ?75 years, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) as well as for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults. </p> <p> The EMA's CHMP gave edoxaban the green light in April this year. Edoxaban had its first approval in Japan, in April 2011, for the prevention of VTE after major orthopedic surgery such as hip and knee replacement. The <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/First-nod-for-edoxaban-in-major-indications-353932" target="_new">wider approval</a> in that country was secured last year. </p> <p> The drug is rather late to market, and will compete with Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa (dabigatran), a direct thrombin inhibitor; Johnson &amp; Johnson's and Bayer Healthcare's Xarelto (rivaroxaban), another Factor Xa inhibitor; and Pfizer's and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Eliquis (apixaban), also a Factor Xa inhibitor. Daiichi will be hoping to differentiate Lixiana on the basis of dosing, price and the availability of an antidote. </p> <p> Uptake of all the new generation of anticoagulants, for which warfarin is still the biggest competitor, will depend on the availability of antidotes which are currently at the developmental stage. Portola Pharmaceuticals, which has a universal Factor Xa antidote, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Portola-readies-Factor-Xa-antidote-for-approval-357723" target="_new">recently released</a> positive data which makes approval for the 'breakthrough' designated compound likely, and the firm expects to file with the FDA within the year. </p> <p> Lixiana's EC approval is based on two Phase III trials, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and Hokusai-VTE, which compared treatment with once-daily Lixiana to warfarin, a current standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with AF or for the treatment and prevention of VTE. These studies represent the largest single comparative trials of a novel oral anticoagulant in these patient populations, involving 21,105 and 8,292 patients, respectively. </p>
