<p>Lupin has reported a 35% decline in net profits for the second quarter with sales inching up only marginally, hurt by a slowdown in product approvals in the US and a lack of "material" launches there. </p><p>The Indian firm's top brass, though, indicated that things may be on the up on both fronts.</p><p>"We are seeing a faster pace of approvals and definitely more visibility with the FDA with the target action dates. We should start seeing more action from the FDA whether it is in CRL form or approvals," Lupin's CEO Vinita Gupta told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Lupin, in a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupins-CEO-on-the-specialty-asset-hunt-in-the-US-358438" target="_new">presentation to investors</a> in May this year, noted that the median ANDA approval timelines in the US had inched up to 42 months in 2014, from an estimated 32 months in 2013. ANDA approvals of five frontline Indian firms declined to 76 in 2014 from more than 100 in the previous year, data presented by Lupin then showed. </p><p>Net profits declined to INR4.08bn ($62.9m), while net sales stood at INR31.78bn (+2%) in the second quarter ended September.</p><p>US sales declined to $174m during the quarter as against $202m in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. The company launched four new products in the US during the quarter. </p><p>Gupta said that the integration of the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Lupin-takes-more-shots-at-the-goal-with-880m-US-buy-359600" target="_new">Gavis acquisition</a> has been going "pretty well" and hoped to close the deal sometime this quarter. Gavis received three product approvals last quarter.</p><p>Asked about the anticipated FDA approval for generic Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium), Gupta said: "That's one we've been waiting for. We've submitted everything from our perspective that we had to the FDA. And are hoping to get approval."</p><p>She maintained that while the opportunity is certainly smaller than it would have been in view of multiple players in the market, it is still an "attractive product." A clutch of players, including Teva, Mylan and Dr Reddy's Laboratories already have <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Plan-B-takes-Dr-Reddys-Into-Hot-US-Nexium-Market-360726" target="_new">generic versions of Nexium</a> on the US market. </p><p>In a post-results investor call Gupta also mentioned certain portfolio optimization measures in the US that in itself should "start showing" in the fourth quarter, with "material" product approvals such as esomeprazole anticipated. Generic Glumetza (metformin hydrochloride) launch is targeted for February.</p><p>"In the first half of the year we had eight product launches; in the last quarter we had seven product approvals. We are getting better visibility on our applications from the FDA. We have target action dates for 60% of our pre-GDUFA filings."</p><p>The India formulations business grew by 9.4% to INR8.73bn in the second quarter while Lupin's Japanese business (Kyowa + Kyowa CritiCare) recorded net sales of INR3.23bn during the quarter compared with INR3.45bn in the same period of the previous fiscal. </p><p>Gupta told <i>Scrip</i> that there has been a little "lumpiness" in Japan revenues but that Lupin expects to maintain 8-10% growth there as it has seen over the last few years. </p><p>"We also have upcoming launches in Japan in this quarter that we expect will contribute to growth," she added.</p>
