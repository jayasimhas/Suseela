<p>India's AIDS drugs shortage saga appears to be largely a consequence of flawed procurement and forecasting, if a clutch of health policy and industry experts are to be believed.</p><p>These experts say that what may have begun as payment delays to manufacturers for supplies of antiretrovirals (ARVs) under the national program a couple of years ago has since snowballed to a situation where tender-related delays &ndash; delayed award of such tenders, cancellations etc. &ndash; have resulted in certain drugs in a treatment regimen "disappearing", leading to a crisis.</p><p>"As inefficiencies catch up we have seen one or more drug not being available. The issue is at the procurement level," a health policy expert in the know of the situation told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Speculation is rife about a potential shift in responsibility for procurement from the current agency, though this could not immediately be verified.</p><p>Some manufacturers also mentioned finding themselves in a peculiar situation with orders being placed and supplies ready but then the government, in certain instances, requesting a hold back of deliveries claiming that the projected requirements may have been flawed.</p><p>"Some of us are just sitting on stocks and have not been paid. We are not sure whether we should take legal recourse," one key supplier of ARVs told <i>Scrip</i>.</p><p>Last year <i>Scrip</i> reported how India's <a href="http://%5b%20http:/www.scripintelligence.com/home/Alarm-as-Indias-AIDS-drugs-stockout-exposes-tender-problems-353730%5d" target="_new">AIDS drugs stockout</a> brought to the fore shocking ground realities of tender-based supplies of ARVs in the country. Suppliers then said that 30-60 day payment schedules were rarely met, with companies generally having to wait for "more than double" the time to get their dues.</p><h2>Import duty</h2><p>Last month, India decided to exempt from customs duty a range of adult first- and second-line ARV drugs and certain pediatric drugs that may be imported for the National AIDS control Programme funded by the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM). </p><p>The exemption was granted under Section 25 (1) of India's Customs Act &ndash; essentially concerning such action when deemed necessary in public interest.</p><p>Importers, though, would be required to provide, prior to the clearance of goods, a certificate from an officer not below the rank of deputy secretary to the Government of India in the ministry of health and family welfare, to the effect that the goods are required for the national program funded by GFATM.</p><p>Suppliers, meanwhile, claimed they are a bit surprised by the customs exemption since finished formulation imports of ARVs are rare among Indian firms.</p><p>The head of a prominent supplier of AIDS medicines told <i>Scrip</i> that it was ironical that the government was considering imports when India was the primary source of affordable ARVs - every third HIV pill consumed anywhere in the world, as per industry estimates, is said to be made in India.</p><p>"Are these proposed imported products registered in India or are they made by some hole in the wall firm? Do they want us to export from our overseas sites? Why can't the government take Indian firms into confidence?" the official said.</p><p>News agency reports earlier quoted an official from India's National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) as saying that the drugs under the import duty exemption make up "roughly 95%" of the ARVs used by India's AIDS patients under the national program.</p><p>The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS in India was estimated at 2,100,000 in 2011. India has seen an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections (among the adult population) from 2000 to 2011, reflecting the impact of various interventions and scaled-up prevention strategies under NACO, details in the Department of AIDS Control's annual report for 2012-13 said.</p>
