<p><p>Ohr Pharmaceuticals plunged almost 70% in trading on 27 March after the biotech announced disappointing results for its mid-stage eye drug. </p><p>The company's stock dropped to $2.74; it reached a high of almost $15 a share earlier this year on the prospects of its wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) treatment. </p><p>Ohr was scheduled to start Phase III studies of OHR-102 by mid-year, but negative results of the Phase II IMPACT study will delay development by two to three months, the company said in a sameday conference call. </p><p>The IMPACT study compared OHR-102 in combination with Roche's Lucentis (ranibizumab) to Lucentis monotherapy in 142 patients with wet-AMD for nine months. The combination failed to show a statistically significant benefit versus Lucentis alone in the overall study population. </p><p>Yet, a subset of patients with classic containing choroidal neovascularization (CNV) &ndash; a more severe form of the disease, which affects about two-thirds of wet-AMD sufferers &ndash; showed a benefit, with 42% of the CNV subset responding to combination therapy compared with 28% of the Lucentis arm. </p><p>Ohr now intends to conduct a study that only includes patients with classic CNV. Analysts and investors had high hopes for OHR-102 due to its ease of administration &ndash; it's an eye drop that can be self-administered, while Lucentis and other treatments need to be injected by a physician. Cowen analyst Tyler Van Buren had estimated the drug could reach peak sales of $1bn, but the analyst chopped his price target for the company to $15 from his previous target of $25. "Clearly, the miss in the overall patient population is disappointing," he wrote in a 27 March note. </p><p>The trial failure should come as no surprise to investors who saw a similar result when interim results of the study were presented in mid-2014. <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Ohr-sinks-on-missed-AMD-endpoint-in-interim-look-352505" target="_new">At the time</a>, Ohr had touted the benefit seen in secondary endpoints, despite not reaching statistical significance on the primary endpoint. </p><p><p>
