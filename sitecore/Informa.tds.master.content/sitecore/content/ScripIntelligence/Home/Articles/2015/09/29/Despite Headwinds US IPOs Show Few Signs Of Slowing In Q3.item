<p>Fifteen drug development firms raised $1.4bn via initial public offerings in the US during the third quarter, which is equal to the quarterly average during the first half of the year and shows that despite recent biotechnology stock headwinds IPOs have not slowed &ndash; at least, not yet.</p><p>The July-to-September IPO total is on par with the 29 offerings that raised $2.8bn during the first half of 2015 (an average of 15 offerings totaling $1.4bn per quarter). However, nine of the companies that debuted on the US stock market in the third quarter have fallen below their IPO values, reflecting recent concern that investor faith in the biotech industry is waning.</p><p>New pressures to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-Walloped-On-Clinton-Drug-Price-Controls-Threat-360599" target="_new">control prescription drug prices</a> pushed the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (NBI) much lower during the last week and a half of September. The NBI peaked at <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FINANCE-ROUNDUP-Will-VC-Be-Last-Man-Standing-If-Biotech-Bubble-Bursts-360716" target="_new">4165.87 on July 20 and fell</a> to its lowest point of the year on Sept. 29 at 3033.37 &ndash; a 27.2% drop in two months.</p><p>Drug developers that completed IPOs during the third quarter performed a flip-flop by the start of the fourth quarter, considering nine companies launched offerings at share prices within or above proposed price ranges. Then, by Oct. 1, nine therapeutics firms were trading below their IPO price and only six were ahead of their initial share value.</p><p>Even the Patrick Soon-Shiong-backed immuno-oncology company NantKwest, which had the biggest IPO of the quarter with 8.3m shares priced at $25 each to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-UPDATE-Bubble-worries-heighten-after-another-big-Alzheimers-offering-359735" target="_new">gross $207m on July 27</a>, fell to $11.06 by Oct. 1. EyeGate Pharmaceuticals, which launched during the same week as NantKwest and had the quarter's smallest first-time offering, grossed $10m from the sale of 1.2m shares at $8.50 each on July 30.</p><p><b>Third Quarter IPOs Stumble</b></p><p>The following table shows how the 15 drug developers who launched IPOs in the third quarter performed as of Oct. 1 versus their offering

developers waiting in the wings to launch IPOs include:</p><p>*Riviera Beach, Florida-based Sancilio Pharmaceuticals, which registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Aug. 31 to raise up to $86m, but has yet to set terms for an offering;</p><p>*San Diego-based AnaptysBio, which filed registration documents with the SEC on Sept. 9 to raise up to $86m after <a

gene therapy collaboration with Bayer</a> in 2014 and said in a Sept. 14 SEC filing that it intends to raise up to $115m in an IPO;</p><p>*Swedish firm Oasmia Pharmaceutical, which plans to raise up to $23m under its amended IPO registration filed with the SEC on Sept. 15 by selling American depository shares for $5.75 to $7.75 each;</p><p>*Trevose, Pennsylvania-based Strongbridge Biopharma, which said in a Sept. 21 SEC filing that it will raise up to $76m to fund treatments for rare endocrine disorders;</p><p>*Aclaris Therapeutics of Malvern, Pennsylvania, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Venture-capital-outlook-positive-on-biotech-IPO-MandA-activity-354323" target="_new">raised a $21m Series B venture capital round</a> a year ago, but set a $14 to $16 price range for the sale of 5m shares on Sept. 25 for gross proceeds of up to $80m to fund topical skin treatments;</p><p>*South San Francisco-based MyoKardia, which said in a Sept. 28 SEC filing that it plans to raise up to $86m in an IPO to fund treatments for genetic heart diseases on top of funding from a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Sanofi-pays-45m-for-early-look-in-on-genetic-heart-disease-program-354009" target="_new">partnership with Sanofi</a>;</p><p>*CytomX, also located in South San Francisco, which <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/CytomX-advancing-PD-L1-targeting-Probodies-with-70m-in-new-cash-359001" target="_new">raised $70m in Series D venture cash</a> in July, filed for a $100m IPO in August, and set a price range of $14 to $16 for its offering on Sept. 28.</p><p><b>An October IPO And Two Dropouts</b></p><p>St. Helier, New Jersey-based NovoCure just missed inclusion in the list of third quarter IPOs. The company, which is developing a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Brain-cancer-therapies-show-promise-at-SNO-meeting-355186" target="_new">therapeutic device to treat brain cancer</a>, grossed $165m from the sale of 7.5m shares at $22 each &ndash; a dollar below its proposed range of $23 to $24.</p><p>Cerecor is developing a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Five-promising-approaches-to-expand-the-depression-armory-354530" target="_new">potentially promising mid-stage NMDA receptor antagonist</a> to treat depression, but it is having a hard time getting its proposed IPO off the ground. The Baltimore, Maryland-based company set a $6 to $7 range for its 4.2m shares on Sept 8, which would gross up to $29.4m, but Cerecor had to add warrants to the proposed offering on Oct. 1 to sweeten the IPO for investors.</p><p>One drug developer withdrew its IPO plan in the third quarter due to market conditions and another withdrew its offering after it was acquired. Revo Biologics said on Sept. 4 that it no longer intends to raise up to $54m in an IPO that was <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/IPO-TABLES-Third-quarter-update-plus-three-companies-price-offerings-one-sets-terms-one-files-and-two-postpone-354303" target="_new">proposed back in October</a> given recent market turmoil. </p><p>Par Pharmaceutical Holdings officially withdrew its offering on Sept. 28 after <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Par-Endo-8bn-merger-makes-Mylan-look-undervalued-358468" target="_new">Endo International concluded its $8bn acquisition</a> of the branded and generic drug company. The IPO-tracking firm Renaissance Capital estimated that Par could've raised $500m in a public market debut.</p><p>Renaissance is not optimistic about biotech's IPO performance for the rest of 2015, a concern that seems to be supported by recent evidence: the falling NBI, NovoCure's price cut, and Cerecor's warrants.</p><p>In its third quarter US IPO market report, which covers all tech and financial industries, the firm said: "Health care companies again dominated IPO issuance thanks to biotechs, and for the first time in over 15 years the sector made up over half of the quarter's deals, a trend that could be stymied by the sharp biotech correction at quarter-end."</p><p><p><p><p>
