<p> Boehringer Ingelheim's nintedanib appears to have inched closer to a potential launch in India for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), after a key expert panel recommended its approval with a waiver of local clinical trials.</p><p>Nintedanib is available internationally as <i>Ofev</i> for IPF and as <i>Vargatef</i> for advanced lung cancer following chemotherapy.</p><p>Earlier this month a subject expert committee (SEC), which advises the Indian regulator on trial-related permissions as part of a layered approval process, recommended the approval of the import and marketing of nintedanib for IPF without local trials subject to certain conditions. </p><p>The SEC (pulmonary), in its meeting held on Sept. 9, recommended that marketing approval initially be given only for two years and that BI conduct "active surveillance" of all the patients who will be prescribed the drug for a period of two years, and that the protocol and other documentation be submitted for evaluation.</p><p>"The continued marketing of the drug beyond two years shall be based on the favourable risk benefit ratio of the data in the Indian population," the SEC said.</p><p>BI has previously presented data on 20 Indian patients who participated in the global clinical trial of nintedanib and submitted that the safety and efficacy results of the Indian subset are comparable with the global data. </p><p>The German multinational requested a waiver from the requirement for local clinical trials as IPF is an orphan disease and also because there is an unmet need of the drug for the disease, the SEC meeting record said.</p><p>The SEC then observed the "limited" treatment options for IPF patients in India and also the fact that nintedanib had been approved as an orphan drug by the US FDA and also in the EU in 2015. The FDA approved Ofev for the treatment of IPF in October 2014.</p><p>Dr Viraj Suvarna, medical director, BI India, told <i>Scrip</i> that while the company did have Indian patient data in the IPF indication, the SEC felt that since there weren't too many Indian patients in the study, it would like BI to do active surveillance &ndash; post marketing surveillance but in an active way, with a structured protocol, and the aim of capturing information right from baseline and then following through the patients.</p><p>"Within two years of launch of the product, we will submit that data to the SEC, based on which they will extend the approval beyond," Suvarna explained.</p><p>BI is currently in the process of putting together the protocol for submission.</p><p>India currently follows a three-tier review process for clinical trials, under which applications are initially evaluated by specialized SECs. The recommendations of the SECs are then vetted by a technical review committee and finally cleared by an "apex committee." New drug applications, though, do not always necessarily follow the three-tier path unless the SEC believes it is critical to get the technical and apex panels to clear the proposal. </p><h2>NSCLC</h2><p>BI has yet to receive SEC approval for nintedanib in cancer.</p><p>An Indian SEC (oncology) earlier this year opined that BI had not submitted additional data to "justify" safety and reduction in the dose in the Indian population. </p><p>"In view of the safety concerns and significant reduction of dosage required in 31% patients from the Indian sub-set, the committee reiterated its earlier recommendation that the firm should conduct a Phase III study in Indian subjects to assess the safety of the drug nintedanib when given in combination with docetaxel," the SEC (oncology) said in its meeting in June this year.</p><p>BI had previously presented to the SEC its case for nintedanib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has Indian patient data for this indication as well. </p><p> "We had first presented in January and they were ok with it &ndash; the global data and India data as far as efficacy was concerned. But in terms of safety they wanted additional data to satisfy themselves," Suvarna said.</p><p>BI, though, sees little need for an additional phase III Indian study &ndash; it already has data on 114 Indian patients which have since been presented and a meeting with the SEC is expected at the end of September.</p><p>In addition to "enough" Indian data on NSCLC in a second-line setting with docetaxel, BI is now also armed with the SEC approval in IPF. It is also doing an additional study to generate data on another 50 Indian patients in metastatic colorectal cancer. </p><p>"In view of all this we believe there is no need for another Phase III Indian study," Suvarna said. </p><p>Nintedanib is being investigated globally in patients with various solid tumors including Phase III studies in advanced NSCLC, colon cancer (metastatic colorectal cancer) and ovarian cancer, and also in Phase II studies in mesothelioma, kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma) and liver cancer (hepatic cell carcinoma), BI indicated last year.</p><p>NICE, the health technology appraisal institute for England and Wales, earlier this year <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/NICE-says-yes-to-BIs-Vargatef-359572" target="_new">confirmed</a> that Vargatef can be used in combination with docetaxel, and in line with its EU marketing authorization, for patients with non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology. </p><p>BI India's top brass had previously indicated how the firm hoped to make a "big impact" in the lung cancer space first with afatinib and then with nintedanib. Volasertib is another pipeline product for India. </p><p>"Lung health is something that we are very focused on. We want to own the lung cancer therapy space," BI India's managing director Sharad Tyagi told <i>Scrip</i> in an <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BI-wants-to-own-lung-therapy-space-as-India-priced-afatinib-debuts-358851" target="_new">interview</a>. </p>
