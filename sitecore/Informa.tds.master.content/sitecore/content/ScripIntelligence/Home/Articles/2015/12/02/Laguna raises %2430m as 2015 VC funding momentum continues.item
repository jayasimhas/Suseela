<p> Laguna Pharmaceuticals, formerly ChanRx, raised $30m in Series B financing to take a drug candidate for atrial fibrillation (AF) into Phase III clinical trials, contributing to a biotechnology venture capital total for 2015 that could beat 2014's near record-breaking total. </p> <p> Other biotech firms with recently completed venture rounds include San Diego-based antifungal developer Cidara Therapeutics with a $42m Series B; cardiovascular disease-focused Armetheon of Menlo Park, California with a $24m Series B; and a $20m Series B round for a novel vaccination platform from Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Vaxxas. </p> <p> Added to Laguna, that's $116m in new biotech venture capital, bringing the 2015 total so far to more than $1bn invested in drug developers just halfway through the first quarter (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/FUNDING-ROUNDUP-One-startup-six-public-companies-raise-cash-356063" target="_new">10 January</a>, <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BioNotebook-Repligen-Pfizer-part-ways-two-deals-six-financings-356477" target="_new">1 February</a> and <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/G1-Revolution-lead-116m-in-new-VC-funding-356563" target="_new">5 February 2015</a>). </p> <p> Biotech firms raised $5.97bn in 2014, a 29% increase from 2013 and just a few million shy of the $5.99bn total in 2007 &ndash; the biggest year ever for biotech venture capital investment tracked by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) based on data from Thomson Reuters in the quarterly MoneyTree Report (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biotech-raised-6bn-in-2014-venture-capital-most-since-2007-356200" target="_new">17 January 2015</a>). </p> <p> &quot;Given the strong level of investments in this sector and others in recent quarters, we expect continued high investment levels in life sciences in the first half of 2015,&quot; PwC life sciences partner Greg Vlahos said in the firm's year-end 2014 life sciences venture capital report. </p> <p> <b>New capital, fresh start for Laguna</b> </p> <p> With its $30m in Series B financing, Laguna is moving its headquarters from Cleveland, Ohio to San Diego and will take its AF drug into Phase III with a new CEO, biotech veteran Bob Baltera, who was CEO of Amira Pharmaceuticals when the company was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb for up to $475m in 2011 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/BMS-completes-Amira-deal-gaining-a-key-fibrosis-programme-320945" target="_new">9 September 2011</a>). </p> <p> Laguna previously operated virtually with minimal infrastructure, but the company will have a San Diego-based team that's responsible for clinical development, regulatory matters, manufacturing and commercial activities for lead drug candidate vanoxerine, a derivative of the selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor piperazine. </p> <p> Before joining Laguna, Mr Baltera took several board seats at California-based biotech companies &ndash; Xencor in Monrovia, Berkeley-based Adheron Therapeutics, and Organovo and Arcturus Therapeutics in San Diego &ndash; after control of Amira's lung fibrosis drug candidate shifted to BMS. </p> <p> He's also on the board of directors for San Diego-based Panmira Pharmaceuticals, which was spun out of Amira following the BMS transaction and is led by former Amira chief business officer Hari Kumar (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Amira-asset-DP2-blockers-spun-out-not-part-of-BMS-325-million-buyout-321018" target="_new">12 September</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/Hari-Kumar-appointed-CEO-of-Panmira-322790" target="_new">24 October 2011</a>). Laguna is Mr Baltera's first CEO position since Amira. </p> <p> &quot;I was approached by some of the Series B investors and was asked to consider the Laguna opportunity. After seeing the data and meeting the team, it became clear to me that I needed to be part of this company. [With] top notch investors, great clinical data and a world class team, it was an easy decision,&quot; Mr Baltera said. </p> <p> As ChanRx, Laguna was spun out of the diagnostic company ChanTest in 2011 with an undisclosed amount of Series A venture capital (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ChanRx-to-evaluate-atrial-fibrillation-candidate-with-closed-Series-A-funding-324049" target="_new">25 November 2011</a>). The Series B round was led by Versant Ventures and Frazier Healthcare with support from prior investor Sante Ventures. </p> <p> Laguna will use its Series B funding to initiate two Phase III clinical trials in 2015 for vanoxerine in the treatment of AF. The trials will be similar to the Phase IIb study that ChanRx completed in 2013. </p> <p> The company reported its first set of positive results in November 2013 from the mid-stage clinical trial, which showed that vanoxerine-treated patients experienced none of the life-threatening arrhythmias seen with approved AF drugs (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/ChanRx-touts-Phase-IIb-vanoxerine-data-ahead-of-fundraising-partnership-348204" target="_new">19 November 2013</a>). Vanoxerine also provided conversion to normal sinus rhythm that was nearly as good as efficacy that's seen with electrical shock treatment known as direct current cardioversion. </p> <p> &quot;Since preliminary data were released in 2013, ChanRx has been very busy with closing the study and fully analyzing final data [along with] end of Phase II interactions with the FDA, and now putting together the Series B,&quot; Mr Baltera said. </p> <p> He noted that ChanRx's prior CEO RK Khosla, a CEO-in-residence at the biotech startup accelerator BioEnterprise in Cleveland, &quot;very successfully led the virtual team through Phase IIb and closing the Series B, and is now turning over the reigns as the company evolves from spinout to virtual company to Phase III development and commercialization preparation.&quot; </p> <p> <b>Three more Series B rounds</b> </p> <p> PwC's Mr Vlahos said the influx of venture capital to biotech, including three mega-deals in 2014 that gave companies more than $100m in a single VC round, is &quot;a reflection of more money coming back to companies with compounds targeting multiple indications and multiple molecules in the pipeline, to help reduce regulatory and commercialization risk.&quot; </p> <p> Among other companies with recently announced venture funding rounds: </p> <p> *Cidara Therapeutics raised $42m in Series B cash eight months after closing a $32m Series A round and announcing the antifungal startup's hiring of former Trius Therapeutics CEO Jeffrey Stein to lead the new company (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cidara-CEO-Stein-brings-Trius-gang-biotech-vets-together-352587" target="_new">1 July 2014</a>). The money will be used to accelerate development of the long-acting echinocandin antifungal product candidates biafungin and topifungin. Cidara also has an immunotherapy platform known as Cloudbreak for the development of antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral drugs for infectious diseases. </p> <p> *Following a $7m Series A round in August to restart development of the oral anticoagulant (OAC) tecarfarin, Armetheon recently closed a $24.3m Series B round to begin the final Phase III clinical trial for its warfarin alternative and hire the team that will be responsible for shepherding the drug through the regulatory process (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Armetheon-raises-7m-to-revive-ARYxs-Phase-III-anticoagulant-353639" target="_new">30 August 2014</a>). Hercules Bioventure Partners and Capital TEN II led the Series B financing. </p> <p> *Vaxxas, which is developing vaccines based on its needle-free Nanopatch platform, raised $20m in the first closing of a Series B round to fund clinical programs and create new vaccines against influenza, polio, bacterial infections and cancer. The company signed a deal with Merck &amp; Co in 2012 to create a needle-free version of an undisclosed vaccine developed by the big pharma partner (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Merck-to-evaluate-Vaxxas-new-skin-patch-vaccine-delivery-platform-335898" target="_new">9 October 2012</a>). </p> <p><p><p><p>
