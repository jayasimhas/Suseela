<p>Merck disclosed on 12 January it plans to submit applications to the FDA under earlier-than-expected timelines for Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in lung cancer and regimen grazoprevir/elbasvir (MK-5172/MK-8742) in hepatitis C virus (HCV).</p><p>The firm said it plans to submit a supplemental biologics license application by midyear for Keytruda as a treatment for patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-negative and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement-negative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. </p><p>The drug already is approved in the US to treat unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression in patients previously treated with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy (ipilimumab), and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor &ndash; gaining that nod this past September (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Merck-melanoma-drug-Keytruda-OKd-1st-US-PD-1-353714" target="_new">4 September 2014</a>).</p><p>Keytruda holds a place in history as the first human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking antibody approved by the FDA, although regulators granted approval to BMS' PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in December three months before it was expected, tightening up the competition between the two drugs in the melanoma space (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Bristol-Myers-wins-US-Opdivo-approval-three-months-early-355806" target="_new">23 December 2014</a>).</p><p>But now the race is on for Keytruda and Opdivo in NSCLC.</p><p>BMS revealed late on 11 January that its Phase III CheckMate-017 study of Opdivo in previously treated patients with advanced, squamous cell NSCLC was stopped early because the trial met its endpoint, demonstrating superior overall survival versus docetaxel (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BMSs-anti-PD1-Opdivo-takes-lead-in-lung-cancer-356075" target="_new">12 January 2015</a>).</p><p>Shares of BMS rose 6.8% on 12 January, before closing at $62.18, up $18.6, or about 3%.</p><p>Merck's stock, however, closed down 26 cents at $62.30. The firm's shares had risen 94 cents, or 1.5%, earlier in the trading day. </p><p>Meanwhile, Merck also is hoping to squeeze in on the competition in the HCV space sooner than it initially had planned by submitting a new drug application for grazoprevir/elbasvir, an oral, once-daily pill, in the first half of this year &ndash; seeking to take sales away from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie, which currently are in a fierce formulary battle (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AbbVie-gives-Viekira-dependent-2015-guidance-as-Anthem-chooses-Harvoni-356035" target="_new">9 January 2015</a>).</p><p><p><p>
