<p>A US panel of pulmonary disease and other medical and statistical experts on 12 May gave a thumbs up to Vertex's Orkambi, a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of the company's FDA-approved cystic fibrosis medicine Kalydeco (ivacaftor) and new drug, lumacaftor, despite questions about whether the latter agent provides any added benefit.</p><p>Shares of Vertex leaped nearly 10% in after-hours trading on 12 May, gaining $11.85.</p><p>The FDA's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) voted 12-1 the available efficacy and safety data supported approval of twice-daily Orkambi in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene.</p><p>In a unanimous vote, the PADAC said Vertex's data supported Orkambi's safety in CF patients 12 years or older with the F508del mutation.</p><p>The FDA also asked the panel to consider whether the available data demonstrated that lumacaftor contributed positively to the clinical efficacy seen for the combination product in the F508del mutation population. Three said it did, four said it didn't and six said they could not determine one way or the other.</p><p>The FDA is expected to make a decision on Orkambi by 5 July.</p><p>Sagient Research's <i>BioMedTracker</i>, an affiliate of <i>Scrip</i>, assigned a 99% chance Orkambi would make it to the US market &ndash; given the high rate of approvals in the respiratory indication &ndash; which was 2% above the average probability of approval for the same disease group based on the historical performance of medicines in the same development phase.</p><p><b>No component comparison</b></p><p>At issue for the PADAC was the fact the FDA advised Vertex against including an ivacaftor alone arm in its Phase III studies because a trial of the drug as a monotherapy, known as 770-104, was determined by regulators to not be effective in the F508del mutation population &ndash; information the agency even included in the labeling for Kalydeco, which was the first drug approved in the US to treat the underlying cause of CF.</p><p>Typically for combination medicines, US regulators want manufacturers to assess the contribution of each drug monotherapy to the overall effect of the combination product. </p><p>So trials of a two-drug FDC product would usually consist of four treatment groups &ndash; the combination product proposed for marketing, each individual drug component at the same dose as is proposed for the FDC and a placebo in some situations. </p><p>But since Vertex didn&rsquo;t follow that path for its Phase III trials of Orkambi &ndash; at the FDA&rsquo;s advice &ndash; it's unclear how the combination product truly stacks up against Kalydeco in patients with the F508del mutation, which causes the most common form of CF, a rare, life-threatening genetic disease.</p><p>In Vertex's Phase III 809-103 and 809-104 studies, Orkambi had a small, but statistically significant effect in absolute change from baseline in percent predicted forced expiratory capacity in one second (ppFEV1) at 24 weeks, with a difference from placebo of 2.7% to 3.0%. </p><p>Improvement in the secondary endpoint relative percent predicted FEV1 also was statistically significant in both studies. </p><p>The secondary endpoints of change in body mass index and CF questionnaire-revised respiratory domain, however, failed to show substantial evidence of a treatment effect.</p><p>The Orkambi response rate and number of pulmonary exacerbations demonstrated nominal improvements, but were not considered statistically significant, since the prospective statistical testing hierarchy stopped before the comparisons were made. </p><p>Regulators said the similarity of the nominal treatment effects in study 770-104 for 150mg ivacaftor alone and studies 809-103 and 809-104 for Orkambi raised the question of whether the lumacaftor component contributed any added benefit.</p><p>The FDA also wondered if the 770-104 trial were powered similarly to studies 809-103 and 809-104, would the treatment effects for Kalydeco also have been statistically significant &ndash; especially in relation to improvements in lung function and reductions in CF pulmonary exacerbations.</p><p>Regulators conducted their own statistical comparative analyses between Kalydeco and Orkambi at the proposed dose, but they said they "could not exclude with any level of confidence" the combination drug was any different than the monotherapy agent in changes in ppFEV1 and pulmonary exacerbations.</p><p>But Dr Jeffrey Chodakewitz, chief medical officer at Vertex, argued that the question before the PADAC was not whether Orkambi was superior to Kalydeco, but rather if the clinical benefit of the combination drug over standard of care supported making the new medicine available to patients who need it.</p><p><b>Lesson for the future </b></p><p>Panelist Dr Robert Castile, a pediatric pulmonologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus and a professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University, chastised the FDA for recommending Vertex not pursue the ivacaftor alone arm, which he said ultimately penalized the company and patients.</p><p>But Dr Anthony Durmowicz, clinical team leader in the FDA's Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products, insisted the agency "made the best decision" it could based on the science at the time.</p><p>He admitted later, however, the FDA had made a "bit of a hasty decision" on its advice to Vertex.</p><p>"It was unfortunate that we don't have the randomized comparison of the monotherapy versus the combination and we are put in an awkward position," said panelist Dr Erica Brittain, deputy chief of the Biostatistical Research Branch at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "But given the FDA agreed to the study design, I don't think it's fair to the patients to deprive them of the treatment now."</p><p>Even though regulators expressed some doubt it would be feasible to do a comparison study post-approval, Dr Brittain urged the FDA to require one.</p><p>But Dr Brittain said she hoped the FDA would use Orkambi as a "lesson learned for combination products so this situation doesn't happen again."</p><p>Panelist Dr Elaine Morrato, an associate professor of health systems management and policy at the University of Colorado, said the PADAC was essentially left with denying a combination product where there is evidence it benefits some patients or exposing others to a &ldquo;theoretical added benefit that hasn't been demonstrated.&rdquo; </p><p>"I felt given where we are today, I decided to err on giving patients access to the medicine, given the tremendous unmet medical need," she said.</p><p>Dr Morrato, who said her vote in favor of Orkambi was "difficult," also insisted there is a need for "greater prospective clarity" on what is a clinically meaningful benefit.</p><p>"Part of my struggle with this is that you are seeing as this drug is being used in different types of genetic defects, as expected, you're going to see different levels of efficacy," Dr Morrato said. "And so to what degree is enough, enough? Is a 2%-3% increase one time on average in a year good enough in light of a continual 1%-3% decline over a lifetime?"</p><p>She said she also was swayed by the 18 public speakers &ndash; most of them patients or their family members &ndash; whose stories Dr Morrato said she found "very compelling." </p><p>"There's clearly a very strong remaining unmet medical need," she said. "The disease is life-shortening with great suffering and despite advances, there's still a desperate need for new therapies." </p><p>Panelist Dr John Connett, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health in Minneapolis, said he also was "not totally happy" about his vote backing Orkambi's approval.</p><p>"But I think based on what we have in hand, that's where we have to go," he said.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
