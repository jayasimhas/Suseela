<p>Advaxis Inc. fell 25.8% in after-hours trading on Oct. 6 when the company said the US FDA placed a clinical hold on its investigational new drug (IND) application for axalimogene filolisbac (ADXS-HPV) &ndash; a disclosure that was made five days after Advaxis received word from the agency.</p><p>The clinical hold affects four ongoing clinical trials for the Princeton, New Jersey-based company's therapeutic vaccine for cancers caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), but Advaxis expects to get the program back on track "expeditiously" without significant interruption to the trials. Even so, investors were unhappy that the company did not expeditiously report the news to shareholders, pushing Advaxis from $10.31 when the stock market closed to $7.65 after hours.</p><p>The FDA shut down the company's studies in HPV-associated cancers after Advaxis submitted a safety report regarding a cervical cancer patient treated with axalimogene filolisbac in 2013 in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial. The woman's blood tested positive in July for <i>Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)</i> &ndash; the bacteria that the company uses in its vaccine candidates to induce an immune response against cancer &ndash; when she was admitted to the hospital for end-stage cervical cancer symptoms.</p><p>"Subsequent analysis determined that it was the highly attenuated strain of <i>Lm</i> used in axalimogene filolisbac, which was incapable of causing infection and was highly sensitive to antibiotics," Advaxis said in a statement.</p><p>The patient received antibiotics and was discharged, but returned to the hospital in mid-August due to respiratory distress caused by her metastatic disease and died &ndash; a death that the study's investigator determined to be caused by progression of cervical cancer. </p><p>Advaxis agreed with the assessment and said axalimogene filolisbac probably found a place to exist in the patient's body without causing a listeria infection after the woman underwent orthopedic reconstruction and received a bone graft and other medical implants. </p><p>Even so, the FDA requested more information &ndash; which has been submitted to the agency &ndash; to support the company's conclusion that its immunotherapy did not contribute to the woman's death.</p><p>Advaxis recently declared Stage 1 of an ongoing two-stage Phase II clinical trial in advanced cervical cancer a success, because <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Advaxis-Immunotherapy-Boosts-12-Month-Survival-In-Cervical-Cancer-360511" target="_new">38.5% of patients were still alive</a> after 12 months of treatment.</p><p>Four patients treated with axalimogene filolisbac in Stage 1 experienced grade 3 hypotension and cytokine release syndrome, and one patient had a grade 4 lung infection with sepsis. </p><p>Advaxis chief medical officer David Mauro told <i>Scrip</i> at the time that "the grade 4 infection seen in Stage 1 was not caused by listeria and therefore we believe it is unrelated to our therapy."</p><p>However, Advaxis's stock price has been in decline since the Phase II update on Sept. 17, falling from $19.71 to almost half that as of market close on Oct. 6.</p><p><p><p><p>
