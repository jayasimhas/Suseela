<p><p>Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. does not like to be picked on &ndash; by anyone. The multi-national conglomerate is whining that the mean bloggers are saying nasty things and Valeant wants to set the record straight.</p><p>The specialty pharma filed a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 6 to "correct misleading reports." </p><p>The chart-like document lists the source that said mean things and when, the nasty lies and Valeant's "facts." The particularly odd part about the document is the three sources that Valeant feels the need to defend itself against &ndash; a short-selling research firm, a small Canadian research firm and a blog by a nameless writer who claims to have worked in the industry. While virtually anything can sway investors, these sources probably can't be held accountable for the dramatic slide the company has seen to its stock price in the last month. </p><p>Both research firms have released reports over the last two weeks that are calling out Valeant on the price increases it has made to several drugs &ndash; an issue that the specialty pharma has come under fire for in recent weeks, while the blog has made it a mission to reveal all the evils that are Valeant. </p><p>Valeant's <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Valeant-A-company-transformed-by-deals-359578" target="_new">business model</a> has been a topic of conversation for years, but came under particular scrutiny when it was making its bid for Allegan earlier in 2015. The Canadian company has made no qualms about telling the industry that it doesn't believe in spending money on R&D. Instead, Valeant has amassed an empire by acquiring companies and in-licensing drugs that are already on, or near, to market. While many people in the industry don't see this as a sustainable business model &ndash; and it likely wouldn't be if every company subscribed to this bit of wisdom &ndash; it has worked rather well for Valeant. </p><p>What was once a small Canadian dermatology company is now a multi-national specialty pharma with a market capitalization over $50bn. Valeant's stock currently trades at about $165 &ndash; well above the $50 per share it traded at in 2012. Granted, the stock has lost about $100 per share in value in the last month, but that can easily be attributed to a variety of macro-economic factors including a slide in the general stock market, as well as a pullback from healthcare stocks &ndash; and of course, that whole drug pricing issue. </p><p>Valeant, in particular, has <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Valeant-Latest-Congressional-Target-Over-High-Drug-Prices-359973" target="_new">come under fire</a> since those in the political spotlight have chosen to take aim at drug pricing after the New York Times published a story detailing the liberties with pricing Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals has taken. Yet, most analysts are currently rating Valeant's stock a "buy" and consider this a great time to invest in the company (any analyst would point out that the fundamentals backing Valeant's business model have not changed and therefore, the drug pricing issue hasn't affected the investment thesis). </p><p><b>Doth Protest Too Much</b></p><p>Valeant's outcries in the document filed with the SEC defend the company against a number of issues, but in particular are related to price increases. For example, Veritas Investment Research claimed in an Oct. 1 report that absent certain price hikes, Valeant would never be able to meet its earnings expectations. Valeant contends that the acquired products and any price increases were included in said guidance &ndash; not exactly a denial that the price increases are being made. </p><p>Meanwhile, Citron Research published a report on Sept. 27 that included a chart of price increases for Valeant products &ndash; and has since made a website devoted to the topic. Valeant argues that the data is presented in a way that is misleading because it shows increases to wholesale acquisition price (WAC) and does not take into account discounts and rebates, etc. "For example: since January 2015 Valeant has raised the gross price of Jublia 20% but realized 2% net price increase," says Valeant. The company also argues that most of the drugs included in the chart have a generic alternative available. </p><p>Much of the document is spent laying out inaccuracies that Valeant found within the blog posts by AZ Value Investing, a series of posts by an anonymous source that doesn't seem to be associated with any business or research firm. None of the discrepancies have to do with product price increases. </p><p>While Valeant's outspoken CEO Michael Pearson has never seemed the type to suffer fools, the SEC filing seems only to be calling more attention to three little-read naysayers. Begging the question, why did Valeant bother?</p><p><p>
