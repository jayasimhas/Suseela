<p> The latest pharma mega-merger could well be under way as Pfizer Inc. and Allergan PLC have confirmed they are discussing their options. But what is Pfizer likely to have to pay? Analyst estimates indicate the deal could be worth up to $158bn. </p> <p> Any deal would involve a substantial premium on Allergan's market capitalization before news of talks broke on Oct. 29. This was around $113bn, but Allergan's trading price of $287 as the markets closed on Oct. 28 could prove a sticking point. Some analysts believe that the stock was undervalued amid a sell-off of shares in the biotech sector, sparked by fears of punitive action on drug pricing. &quot;Allergan is trading at significant discount to its fair value at the moment,&quot; said Bernstein analyst, Tim Anderson. Pfizer CEO Ian Read may disagree. He recently complained that that although there has been an adjustment in the price of some companies, &quot;<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Pfizer-Still-Looking-To-Buy-A-Tax-Advantage---And-Before-Congress-Flips-361263" target="_new">I'm not so sure that there is an adjustment in their expectations of what they want to sell the company for</a>,&quot; he said. </p> <p> However, Anderson thinks that &quot;most Allergan investors would be okay with something just under $400&quot;. He puts the likely share price somewhere between $375 and $400, which would make the merger worth between $147.6bn and $157.5bn. </p> <p> Meanwhile, Datamonitor Healthcare analyst Ali Al-Bazergan says Pfizer will have to be willing to pay a premium upwards of 30% on the share price in a cash/stock deal &ndash; in line with previous inversion acquisitions in the past. According to <i>Scrip</i>'s calculations, this would mean a deal based on a price of $373.36 or more, which would bring the deal to $147.0bn or more. </p> <p> Al-Bazergan adds that based on a lower tax rate and $1bn+ of operating synergies, Pfizer's offer will hinge on the accretion it could drive from the deal through having the two companies in house. &quot;Given Pfizer's quest to make it more competitive by slashing its tax bill, the possible annual savings behind a cut tax rate at around 15%, estimated in 2018 at $1.5bn, will be a top consideration the deal,&quot; says Al-Bazergan. </p> <p> <preform><script id="infogram_0_allergan_pfizer_market_cap_comparison" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?zsZ" type="text/javascript"></script></preform> </p> <p> Indeed, the requirements for tax inversion could also provide a clue as to what the deal may come to. To successfully complete a tax inversion, Anderson points out that Allergan would have to own at least 40% of the new company for Pfizer to be able to go ahead. This, he says, would mean an all-stock deal to make sure Allergan's current shareholders get enough of the combined group. So, if Pfizer's market cap is currently $211bn, a 60/40 split to enable the tax inversion indicates that Allergan should be worth at least $140bn. </p> <p> Pfizer will also have to consider what other synergies may be worth too. Allergan's North America business, particularly in CNS and cardiovascular disease could drive growth for Pfizer and improve operating synergies across its sales infrastructures. And Pfizer may also value the cash due from Allergan's $40.5bn sale of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Teva's CEO, Erez Vigodman, has assured investors that the <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Theres-No-Out-For-The-Allergan-Deal-Teva-CEO-Says-361297" target="_new">deal will go ahead</a>. </p> <p> <preform><iframe src="//e.infogr.am/pfizergan-3184820?src=embed" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></preform> </p>
