<p>The FDA has OK'd Amgen's Neupogen (filgrastim) as the first medical countermeasure for adults and pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation, causing hematopoietic syndrome of acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS).</p><p>Myelosuppression occurs when radiation damages internal organs, including bone marrow. Suppression of the bone marrow blocks the production of blood cells. Neupogen can help patients with H-ARS by facilitating recovery of bone marrow cells that develop into white blood cells, including neutrophils, that help fight off infections.</p><p>Neupogen, a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which is on the US market for several oncology-related indications and severe chronic neutropenia, was approved for H-ARS under the FDA's animal rule, which was created in 2002 to permit a drug's effectiveness to be demonstrated in animals when it is unethical or not feasible to conduct controlled clinical trials in humans.</p><p>A panel of outside expert advisers to the FDA on <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/FDA-panel-backs-filgrastim-as-nuke-attack-countermeasure-342844" target="_new">3 May 2013</a> voted 17-1 that treatment with Neupogen would reasonably be likely to produce clinical benefits in humans exposed to radiation likely to induce myelosupppression during or following a radiological or nuclear incident.</p><p>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in September 2013 had <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/BARDA-seeks-Amgens-Neupogen-Sanofis-Leukine-for-nuke-attack-countermeasures-346882" target="_new">awarded Amgen a $157.5m</a> contract to purchase Neupogen under Project BioShield for the US Strategic National Stockpile &ndash; a cache of drugs and other medical products intended to address a large-scale natural or manmade disaster &ndash; to support the nation's preparedness against a possible radiological or nuclear emergency. </p><p>BARDA also had awarded a smaller contract of $36.5m to Sanofi to procure doses of Leukine (sargramostin), a recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, developed by the firm's Genzyme unit.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
