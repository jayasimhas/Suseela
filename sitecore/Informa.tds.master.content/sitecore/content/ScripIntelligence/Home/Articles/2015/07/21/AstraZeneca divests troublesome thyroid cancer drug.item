<p>In the latest in a series of divestments of non-core assets by AstraZeneca, it is to sell Caprelsa (vandetanib) &ndash; a rare disease medicine &ndash; to Sanofi's Genzyme for up to $300m.</p><p>The deal includes an upfront payment of $165m and further development and sales milestone payments of up to $135m. </p><p>The product is already available in 28 countries for the treatment of aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid carcinoma including the US where it has orphan drug status. It had global product sales of $48m in 2014. The oral kinase inhibitor is also in Phase III for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, with the study expected to finish in the second half of 2015.</p><p>In Europe, the drug was not assessed as an orphan drug as the company initially planned to pursue it for other indications. It consequently <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/AZ-fails-to-prove-Caprelsas-added-benefit-in-Germany-344394" target="_new">struggled</a> to get positive reimbursement decisions.</p><p>The latest transaction does not include the transfer of any AstraZeneca employees or facilities. As an asset divestment, upfront receipt and any subsequent payments will be reported in other operating income in the company's financial statements.</p><p>Luke Miels, executive vp, global product & portfolio strategy and corporate affairs, AstraZeneca, said: "Caprelsa is a rare disease therapy and the divestment to Genzyme, an expert leader in endocrinology, demonstrates our commitment to ensure patients continue to have access to this medicine while we sharpen our focus on key disease areas."</p><p>Genzyme's president and CEO, David Meeker, added: "The addition of Caprelsa represents a strong strategic fit for our rare endocrinology portfolio."</p><p>The transaction is expected to complete in the second half of 2015 and does not impact AstraZeneca's financial guidance for 2015.</p><p>Earlier this month AstraZeneca <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/AstraZeneca-divests-GI-drug-for-215m-359319" target="_new">sold global rights, outside the US</a>, to Entocort (budesonide) &ndash; a gastroenterology medicine for patients with mild to moderate Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Tillotts Pharma, part of the Zeria Group of Japan, agreed to pay AstraZeneca $215m as part of the deal.</p><p><p>
