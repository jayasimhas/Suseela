<p> The standout story in European financing in 2014 was the UK, raising 31% of the total raised in Europe in terms of innovation capital, according to EY's new report <i>Building the Third Global Cluster: State of the Nation 2015</i>. The report has been released in conjunction with the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA) at its annual Bioscience Forum (Oct. 15). </p><p> The total innovation capital raised in the UK was &pound;1.2bn from 86 financing rounds &ndash; up 143% on 2013 where &pound;498m was raised from 64 rounds, said EY. Indeed, the whole of Europe experienced its best financing year ever with total innovation capital of &pound;3.92bn, up 77% on 2013. </p><p> However, while UK venture financing was close to matching San Diego's levels, there is a near three-fold disparity in total capital raised, all in the public markets, the report noted. </p><p> So, will the UK continue to break records in 2015? </p><p> &quot;The level of activity we have seen in 2013/14 is unlikely to grow indefinitely, however new records have been set this year with Immunocore's raise of &pound;205m becoming the largest European private round in history,&quot; says Ian Oliver, executive director of assurance at EY. </p><p> However, he believes it is still critical that earlier stage companies continue to be nurtured within the overall UK biotech ecosystem to allow promising companies to reach critical mass and continue to garner venture investment at these new levels. &quot;Schemes such as the Biomedical Catalyst and R&amp;D tax incentives are more relevant than ever in ensuring UK sustainability,&quot; he concludes. </p> <p><preform> <!-- Add iFrame code below --> <script id="infogram_0__/83PEKXU8TcewQYtXdAin" src="//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?eg3" type="text/javascript"></script> <!-- Add iFrame code above --> </preform></p>
