<p><p>Astellas is going to have a tough time expanding the market with a new indication for recently approved antifungal Cresemba now that the drug has failed to outperform a comparator in a late-stage trial. </p><p>The Japanese pharma's partner, Switzerland's Basilea Pharmaceutica, announced 30 July that a trial of IV and oral Cresemba (isavuconazonium sulfate) failed to perform better than a regimen of IV caspofungin followed by oral voriconazole in 440 patients with candidemia and other invasive Candida infections. </p><p>The Phase III ACTIVE study did not meet its primary endpoint and overall response rates at two weeks of treatment were comparable between the two arms, missing secondary endpoints for the study as well. </p><p>Cresemba is a novel prodrug of isavuconazole, a triazole antifungal agent. The drug is approved in two forms: a hard capsule for oral administration and a powder for IV infusion after reconstitution.</p><p>The overall response at the end of IV treatment in the modified intent-to-treat population (mITT; N=400) was 60.3% in the Cresemba group and 71.1% in the caspofungin arm. </p><p>The key secondary endpoint of overall treatment response at two weeks after the end of treatment was 54.8% in the Cresemba patients and 57.2% in the caspofungin/voriconazole treatment group.</p><p>Cresemba was <a href="http://#http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Astellas-wins-FDA-nod-for-antifungal-Cresemba-357117" target="_new">approved in March</a> by the FDA for the treatment of two rare but serious infections, invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis. The drug is marketed in the US by Astellas and Basilea elsewhere. </p><p>The trial results were bad news for the companies; the candida market is much larger than either of the other markets the antifungal serves. J. Safra Sarasin analyst Chi-Tran Braendli called the results "rather disappointing" in a note, but maintained her buy rating on the Basilea stock. </p><p><p>
