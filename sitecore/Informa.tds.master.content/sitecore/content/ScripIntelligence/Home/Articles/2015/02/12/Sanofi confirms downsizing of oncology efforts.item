<p>Sanofi has confirmed that on 11 February it informed employees in Massachusetts about a reorganization of its business that will result in the loss of around 100 jobs in the region.</p><p>"The decision was taken to adapt our Oncology activities and priorities to more accurately reflect the current business environment," Sanofi told <i>Scrip</i>. "These changes will allow for greater flexibility and agility both to drive our internal projects and to seize external opportunities."</p><p>Sanofi's oncology R&D division will become an oncology R&D therapeutic strategy unit that will operate within the global R&D organization, which is based in Boston and in Vitry (France). The oncology commercial assets will report into the global marketing organization. </p><p>"Jevtana, and to some extent Zaltrap, will continue to be the foundation of our commercial presence in oncology, which registered &euro;1.4bn in sales in 2014," noted Sanofi.</p><p>As a result of the changes to its oncology setup, Dr Tal Zaks, head of Sanofi's oncology business is leaving the company. Dr Vicky Richon, head of drug discovery and preclinical development, will now head up Sanofi's oncology research activities. </p><p>"Sanofi's commitment to oncology remains strong," stressed the firm. "Our goal is to invest more in projects and emerging fields that will make a real difference in patients' lives."</p><p>Other changes include the refocusing of the Sanofi-Genzyme R&D Center "to better align it with the Genzyme business and focus resources on projects and activities in rare diseases and neuro-immunology, including multiple sclerosis," Sanofi revealed. </p><p>Specifically, Genzyme R&D, is to focus its efforts in the areas of:</p><ul><li>rare diseases and neuro-immunology (including MS, Parkinson's, Huntington's, spinal muscular atrophy) </li><li>priority projects such as Niemann-Pick disease, an oral Fabry treatment, the anti-VLA2 mAb for MS, neo GAA for Pompe disease, and programs in collaboration with Alnylam.</li></ul><p>There were few clues to Sanofi's plans during last week's annual results presentation. Chairman and interim CEO Serge Weinberg said oncology was "still a sizeable business", with $1.4bn in sales which showed "a relative stable business compared to 2013." Underlying that performance was "a mid-single-digit erosion in the US and emerging markets basically on Taxotere, compensated by an interesting double-digit growth in Western Europe (which was driven by Jevtana)."</p><p>Sanofi has yet to appoint a permanent replacement for Chris Viehbacher, who was ousted in a shock move last October. Mr Weinberg said the board was making good progress in the search for his replacement by talking to "a limited number of candidates" and it hoped to "make an announcement in the course of the first quarter."</p><p>
