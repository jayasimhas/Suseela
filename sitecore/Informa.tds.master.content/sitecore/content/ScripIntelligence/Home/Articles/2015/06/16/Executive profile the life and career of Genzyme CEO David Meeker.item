<p> <b>David Meeker, CEO of</b> Genzyme<b>, came to the pharma industry after a 20-year career in medicine. He joined Genzyme as medical director on its cystic fibrosis gene therapy program in 1994, having previously served as Director of the Pulmonary Critical Care Fellowship at the Cleveland Clinic and an assistant professor of medicine at Ohio State University. He was chief operating officer of Genzyme when it was acquired by </b>Sanofi <b>in 2011, and was appointed CEO later that year. In the second of a two-part interview series, he talks to Scrip's editor Eleanor Malone about his formative experiences, his career, and matters that are close to his heart.</b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/BB8F25744ADA4B6687A49B1211A74200.ashx"> </p> <p> <i>David Meeker (centre) leads Genzyme employees on a relay to mark International Rare Disease Day, accompanied by Emma Rooney, a Gaucher disease community advocate, carrying the torch</i> </p> <p> <b>Eleanor Malone: <i>Who were your formative influences?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>David Meeker: </b>My father was a physician and an athlete and there were certain traits that he had which even as a young child I started to emulate. He also had personal qualities which I respect tremendously. He was a very gentle man who was extremely thoughtful, never angry, always found a way forward, and those are the things which had the big impact on me. </p> <p> <p> In school I didn't grow up thinking I wanted to be a doctor, although he was a doctor: in fact I was thinking in other directions until I got totally turned on by a physiology course in my last year of high school. That was the most fun, exciting course that I had taken, and it re-oriented me to thinking seriously about medical school, which from that moment I pursued. </p> <p> <p> In medical school everything's interesting, so the subspecialties you choose are often shaped by people, by the physicians you see practicing. I loved my time in the intensive care unit and had enormous respect for the people who were leading those units, both because of the intensity of the moment, the severity of the illness and the complexity of the problems you're trying to manage, and also the emotional challenges. So in my 20 years in medicine, I learned an enormous amount about people, working with people, understanding what's important to them in the context of the intensive care unit. </p> <p> <p> The person who influenced me the most in a business context was Henri Termeer, the pioneering early CEO of Genzyme, who was a truly visionary leader who had just a wealth of things to teach, from his business acumen and his disciplined approach to building a business to the visionary aspect of what was possible and his willingness to take risks with both specific projects and individuals. I'm a good example of somebody he certainly took a risk with, putting me in positions of responsibility without some of the more formal training. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>Describe the move from medicine to industry.</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM: </b>At age 40 I was ready to do something else. I'd had an extremely rewarding first 20 years, and by chance ended up interviewing for a job at Genzyme. Coming in and working on the research side I truly came to appreciate the power of what industry can bring to a research equation. On the academic side you're constantly writing grants, struggling to get funded at the level of a few hundred thousand dollars, whereas a company in the biopharmaceutical industry can raise millions of dollars to apply against a specific problem. </p> <p> <p> In my case I worked on cystic fibrosis gene therapy, and although we were unsuccessful in developing a therapy I truly came to appreciate the powerful role that this industry can play in solving a problem, and this shaped my thinking as I entered the executive ranks. </p> <p> <p> I switched over to the business side because from the R&amp;D side I saw that many of the decisions were being made from the business side: we're in the business of making medicines. It just seemed a logical step, having a background in R&amp;D, even though I was not formally trained on the business side, that I could create value and bring value to those positions. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What led you to move to the pharmaceutical industry?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> Like many people I work in blocks of time &ndash; we were conditioned that way through school. Four years and you move to something else: medicine offers such a diverse range of experiences. You can move around and continue to be challenged and learn, it is an incredibly rich field. But then I settled into my specialty. Intensive care, where I spent 3-6 months of the year, is an intense experience, and I realised that probably I would not be doing that until 65, so I was open to a change without knowing necessarily that the industry was the outlet. </p> <p> <p> Actually a very good friend had interviewed for the job. He came back and said you should look at this one. I had not been actively interviewing, and in fact this was the only company, believe it or not, that I have interviewed at. But it felt right and it was clear there was an enormous amount to do. Part of the attraction was I could be in early helping to define what that was. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>By what point having made that jump did you realise you were going to make a long career in the pharma industry?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> It was not so conscious &ndash; I'm a little more organic I guess in the decision-making process &ndash; it was a lot about gut, it felt right early. Those early research days were some of the most fun, rewarding moments I have had in my professional career. There was never any looking back, and as Genzyme grew I was able to work on a rapidly growing number of projects, each of which brought their own challenges, so there was never a moment of feeling I had mastered anything or any complacency. There were constantly new fields to take on. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What's the best advice you ever had?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> When I was a pulmonary fellow there was a faculty member who said 'don't give up your stethoscope'. In other words, once you've trained as a doctor you shouldn't ever lose your connectivity with being a doctor. I've modified it my own way. I did give up my stethoscope and I stopped seeing patients but I never gave up thinking like a physician. I will always view myself as a physician first, an executive second...although I think legally that might be a dangerous place to be! </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>How do you step back and get perspective?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> I am a runner. I'm 60 now, a slow runner, but physical exercise has always been a part of my life, and it provides an enormous amount of balance. I'm a very big believer in the healthy mind, healthy body approach to life. The only time of the day I fully control is when I get up, so I exercise from 5.30 to 6.00 or 6.30 depending on the morning, but I'm pretty religious about the 5.30 start and I run for 20 or 30 minutes - warm or cold I'm outside &ndash; and three plus days a week I'll do some weights. I'm a big believer in diversity in your exercise regime &ndash; on weekends I like to ride a bike. I'm not great at any of these things but the diversion and the pleasure of doing them is real. </p> <p> <p> Second of course is family, and having people who can be honest with you. As you move higher the information becomes more filtered, people become more complimentary but not necessarily more honest, so having people around you who see you and know you for who you are and can provide honest input is incredibly important. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>Who is your most honest critic?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> I have more than one right now. One is my partner who I live with, Sandra Poole, and then there are my daughters, who are young women of 23 and 25, strong, independent, with a very clear view of the world and a good willingness to provide input to me. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What are you passionate about?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> I'm passionate about how you create value as a healthcare company; I think we as an industry don't always get it right. I think the real strength of this industry is that unlike many jobs you can make a living by truly helping people and making them better, and when we lose sight of that fact we lose what's special about this industry. From a pure financial standpoint, if we fail to connect employees with the fact that they are making a difference in the lives of the patients, potentially the world, we've lost the real value-creating aspect of this. We can and should be a purpose-driven industry and I am passionate about making sure we do not lose sight of the fact that is our gift, so that's number one. </p> <p> <p> Number two, I'm seeing the next generation develop and of course most immediately as my daughters move into the workforce I look at their early challenges and experiences and it gives me insight into questions of equal opportunity. It's an emerging passion which is evolving beyond just the parental as I try to bring those insights to my larger work context in a lasting way. </p> <p> <p> I see the competitiveness in any industry and how younger employees can be exploited or ignored in a way that has a potentially pretty significant negative impact on their overall development. It's such a formative part of their career so it is important to champion younger individuals; the difference you can make at that age relative to taking somebody like myself and trying to shape them is quite dramatic. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What are you reading at the moment?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> I find that my life is most balanced when I'm reading but often there have been long stretches in my life, depending on the intensity of the moment, where I'm not actively reading. What I religiously read are newspapers. I truly enjoy current events so the Economist is my daily reading staple. And I'm swinging back into books now I'm in hopefully a little more stable period. I just read Quiet by Susan Cain. It's focused on introverts. It's not a riveting read but it's a thought-provoking read and I do think that it's important to consider the psychology of the workplace, the home environment, and so on, and try to understand people's orientation. Not that we have to be categorised black and white, extrovert or introvert, but it's useful to acknowledge that we all sit somewhere on that spectrum and that can influence significantly how we interact, how we think. And that there are values to both ends of the spectrum. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>What books have been important to you and why?</i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> Moby Dick when I read it in high school was one of those first books where I discovered &quot;great literature&quot; in the context of a great class and a really thoughtful professor, and it changed how I look at books in general. It may be a bit of clichéd answer but that was a pivotal moment for me. </p> <p> <p> Jack Welch's first book was in a way a pivotal moment also because I read it at the time I was transitioning from the research side to the business side and I really connected with its very pragmatic approach to leadership; his emphasis on the educational developmental part of it, his intense focus on people. Also it takes a hardnosed approach - that if you are going to be in a business you want to be in a position to succeed, i.e. in the top one or two positions for that category. So I think it was matter of timing and obviously who he was, having a truly successful, iconic career at that point, but I responded to its approach and values. </p> <p> <p> <b>EM: <i>You mentioned Henri Termeer; who else do you admire in the industry? </i></b> </p> <p> <p> <b>DM:</b> There are many truly iconic figures, even just in the Boston area. </p> <p> <p> Look at George Scangos, who came into Biogen and has in a very quiet way turned the company around. Biogen was struggling five or six years ago, facing uncertainty about its future, and with a similar valuation as Genzyme, and he's dramatically reshaped it, so I find that story very powerful. </p> <p> <p> Then at Alnylam (one of our partners) is the CEO John Maraganore, who basically didn't give up on that [RNAi] technology, he just stayed with it and he then found a path and when he unlocked the delivery suddenly that technology came of age. He's going to cure or make many, many people better while obviously creating enormous value for Alnylam. </p> <p> <p> Nick Leschly at Bluebird Bio is a young individual with just enormous, boundless energy, sitting on top of a new technology. We'll see where it goes, but it's what I love about this area and this industry as a whole: there's such a diversity of individuals and skill sets and there's no one prototype that guarantees success. There are many, many different paths to creating value. </p> <p> <p> <i>To read the first part of this interview, in which Dr Meeker discusses his company and the industry, click </i><a target="_new" href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/features/Executive-profile-Genzymes-CEO-on-dark-times-transition-and-the-long-view-358939">here</a>. </p>
