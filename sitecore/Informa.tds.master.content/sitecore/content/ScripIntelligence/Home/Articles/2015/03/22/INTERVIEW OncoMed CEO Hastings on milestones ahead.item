<p>OncoMed Pharmaceuticals has no imminent plans to finance its soon-to-be seven-asset clinical pipeline by selling stock, because the cancer therapy developer's partnerships are structured in a way that "keeps us from having to raise money, which is a corporate goal for the company," chairman and CEO Paul Hastings told <i>Scrip</i>. </p><p>Indeed, OncoMed has not sought cash from stock market investors since its initial public offering in July 2013 that ultimately grossed $93.8m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/OncoMed-prices-IPO-upsized-again-345118" target="_new">18 July 2013</a>). The Redwood City, California-based company, which is developing monoclonal antibodies targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is investigating preclinical immuno-oncology programs, expects to fund its operations through commercialization with milestone payments from partners: Celgene, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>"We promised in our IPO to get to multiple Phase II results by late 2016 or early 2017. It's unclear right now when commercialization could be, but we're focused on getting those randomized Phase II trial results," Mr Hastings said.</p><p><b>Milestones ahead</b></p><p>OncoMed had $232m in cash at the end of 2014 and the company plans to spend $100m to $110m in 2015, bringing its year-end cash balance to $122m without collecting any milestone fees. </p><p>However, OncoMed already received a $5m payment this year from GSK for initiation of a dose expansion cohort in the ongoing Phase Ia clinical trial for brontictuzumab (OMP-52M51), which targets Notch-1 in the treatment of solid tumors, under the partners' more than seven-year-old agreement (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/news/GSK-broadens-pipeline-with-biologics-acquisition-38511" target="_new">14 December 2007</a>).</p><p>OncoMed also expects to earn a $70m milestone fee later this year or early in 2016 from Celgene based on Phase II safety data in lung and pancreatic cancer for demcizumab, which targets the Delta-like ligand 4 (DLL4) involved in Notch signaling, under the companies' late 2013 agreement for CSC-based therapies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Celgene-pays-177-million-for-cancer-stem-cell-pact-with-OncoMed-348494" target="_new">4 December 2013</a>). </p><p>The Celgene payment would be the largest of $150m in milestone fees that OncoMed expects to claim in 2015 and 2016. The company's partnerships are worth up to $4.2bn in upfront, milestone and option fees, including $373m that OncoMed collected through mid-January of 2015.</p><p>In terms of the forthcoming safety-related milestone payment from Celgene, Mr Hastings said, "Patients will pass the safety gate on cardiopulmonary toxicity later this year. We treated 64 patients in Phase Ib, so this will be an informative milestone that we feel pretty good about."</p><p><b>Safety findings key</b></p><p>Safety is top of mind for OncoMed's investors as well as its partners. The company had to put two programs on clinical hold in June due to bone-related side effects for its Wnt-targeting therapies, but clinical trial programs were back on track for vantictumab in August and ipafricept in September (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Bone-events-halt-OncoMed-early-Wnt-studies-shares-drop-352345" target="_new">13 June</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-lifts-vantictumab-partial-hold-OncoMed-rises-353612" target="_new">29 August</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-lifts-partial-hold-on-OncoMeds-ipafricept-353726" target="_new">5 September 2014</a>). </p><p>Bayer can exercise its option to license both Wnt programs through the completion of ongoing Phase Ib clinical trials, which would give OncoMed a $25m option fee for vantictumab and a $15m option fee for ipafricept. The company anticipates submitting opt-in data packages to Bayer during the second half of 2015 or first half of 2016, depending on the pace of trial enrollment.</p><p>"Having gone through the [clinical hold] process before with demcizumab, it emphasizes for us how potent these anti-cancer stem cell therapies are," Mr Hastings said.</p><p>Demcizumab was put on a clinical hold a few years ago due to cardiopulmonary events in Phase I, including hypertension that required treatment with anti-hypertensive drugs and a few cases of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Dosing was adjusted and the demcizumab program was able to restart in early 2013.</p><p>As most Phase I studies go, OncoMed dosed patients with vantictumab and ipafricept until investigators confirmed unfavorable toxicity &ndash; the bone events that landed the clinical trials on partial hold.</p><p>"We're now re-enrolling patients in all six trials. We hope to have data from those Phase Ib trials later this year or early next year," Mr Hastings said. "One of the major lessons learned, given that these agents are so potent, is that [bone-related toxicity] is an on-target activity of that drug. And these are reversible side effects; you just look at how to dial back the dosing. We learned how to do that without cardiotoxicity for demcizumab."</p><p>Vantictumab is being tested in Phase Ib clinical trials to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer and HER2-negative breast cancer. Ipafricept is under evaluation in Phase Ib trials for the treatment of hepatocellular, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.</p><p><b>Three additional milestones</b></p><p>Beyond demcizumab, ipafricept, vantictumab and brontictuzumab, OncoMed also stands to earn milestone payments this year and next related to three more assets: tarextumab, a bi-specific antibody known as OMP-305B83, and the launch of its seventh clinical program.</p><p>OncoMed reported data from its Phase Ib ALPINE clinical trial for tarextumab, which targets Notch 2/3, in January. Previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer patients achieved median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.6 months and overall survival (OS) of 11.6 months when treated with the company's drug, gemcitabine and Celgene's Abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel). </p><p>However, PFS and OS increased to 6.6 months and 14.6 months, respectively, for patients whose tumors expressed high levels of Notch 3. Median PFS for the standard of care in first-line metastatic pancreatic cancer (gemcitabine plus Abraxane) is 11.5 months.</p><p>The Notch 3 biomarker findings in Phase I are being confirmed in the ongoing Phase II ALPINE study from which results are expected in the first half of 2016. GSK has an option to license tarextumab at any point through completion of the Phase II clinical trial, which would give OncoMed a $25m opt-in fee.</p><p>Tarextumab and demcizumab could be the first-ever cancer stem cell-targeting therapies to generate randomized clinical trial results.</p><p><b>Early-stage assets</b></p><p>With partner Celgene, OncoMed recently initiated a Phase Ia clinical trial for OMP-305B83 to investigate the bi-specific antibody's safety and initial efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors. The antibody candidate targets DLL4, like demcizumab, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).</p><p>OncoMed's potential seventh clinical program &ndash; another compound under the company's Celgene partnership &ndash; is a therapy targeting R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), a protein in the CSC pathway. An investigational new drug (IND) application will be submitted to the US FDA for OMP-131R10 during the first half of 2015 to enable Phase I testing.</p><p>OncoMed also is looking at immuno-oncology opportunities, but those programs all are in preclinical testing, including the combination of demcizumab and other anti-CSC therapies with immunotherapeutic agents. In addition to Notch, Wnt and RSPO, the company is working on a fourth pathway with Celgene, but the immuno-oncology target has not been disclosed.</p><p>Mr Hastings said OncoMed likes to "work in stealth mode" on programs that are far from reaching the clinic. The company's goal is to file one new IND application per year.</p><p>"We tend to be very opportunistic [about negotiating new partnerships]. We're more focused on delivering on the three major partnerships we have today. If we had our druthers, we would take our wholly-owned immuno-oncology program and develop it further down the path before we partner it. The possibilities are effectively endless," he said. "But it's nice to have these collaborations and say we don't have to worry about raising capital."</p><p><p><p><p>
