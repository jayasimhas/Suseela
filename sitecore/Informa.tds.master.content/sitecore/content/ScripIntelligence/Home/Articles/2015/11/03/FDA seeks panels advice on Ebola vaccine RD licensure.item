<p>The FDA plans to convene its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on 12 May to provide advice and recommendations about the development and licensure of vaccines against Ebola, which has infected about 24,600 people during the current outbreak, killing over 10,100. </p><p>Ebola is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.</p><p>Ebola, which can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever, is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. </p><p>In Africa, the infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found dead or ill in the rainforest.</p><p>There currently are about <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Ebola---The-industrys-response-in-vaccines-357056" target="_new">20 investigational vaccine candidates</a> in development to prevent Ebola, which is comprised of five distinct strains: Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, Reston, Sudan and Zaire, with the latter the strain responsible for the current outbreak.</p><p>The two lead vaccines &ndash; cAd3-EBOZ and rVSV-ZEBOV &ndash; currently are being <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Much-anticipated-Ebola-vaccine-efficacy-trial-starts-356509" target="_new">tested in Liberia</a> in a Phase II/III study being run by the US National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p>The Phase II/III PREVAIL trial was designed to enroll 27,000 adults 18 years or older &ndash; some healthy subjects and others healthcare workers or those at high risk of contracting Ebola.</p><p>But the NIH is <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Liberias-drop-in-Ebola-may-mean-NIH-trial-move-357294" target="_new">considering moving</a> the next stage of the PREVAIL trial to potentially Guinea or Sierra Leone because the number of Ebola cases in Liberia have subsided in recent weeks.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/CDC-to-soon-launch-NewLinkMerck-Ebola-vaccine-study-357293" target="_new">soon launch</a> a study in Sierra Leone of rVSV-ZEBOV. </p><p>CAd3-EBOZ, which uses a chimpanzee-derived cold virus to deliver Ebola virus genetic material from the Zaire strain, is being co-developed by NIAID and GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>The other candidate, rVSV-ZEBOV, is from NewLink Genetics and its partners Merck and the Canadian government. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine employs vesicular stomatitis virus, an animal virus that primarily affects cattle, to carry an Ebola virus gene segment</p><p>Johnson & Johnson and its partner Bavarian Nordic are not far behind with their <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/Oxford-tests-JnJBavarian-Nordic-prime-boost-Ebola-vaccine-355965" target="_new">prime-boost</a> Ebola vaccine.</p><p>The NIAID first started working on an Ebola vaccine in the late 1990s and published its first paper in 2000. </p><p>The agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the US Department of Defense have provided much of the funding that got most of the current investigational Ebola vaccines off the ground. </p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
