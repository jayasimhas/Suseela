<p>The range of products approved for use in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) market is set to expand. The five anti-TNF products currently approved for the inflammatory rheumatic disease could be joined by four other candidates each with a different mechanism of action currently in Phase III or Phase II development. </p><p>But rheumatologists do not expect to be changing their prescribing habits greatly any time soon, new research from Datamonitor Healthcare finds. Specialists expect the largest proportion of DMARD-treated AS patients to continue treatment with the currently approved traditional and biologic DMARD regimens, even if the pipeline therapies, Pfizer's JAK inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib; at Phase II), Celgene's PDE4 inhibitor Otezla (apremilast; Phase III), and Novartis's anti-IL-17 product Cosentyx (secukinumab; Phase III), are approved and launched. </p><p>Datamonitor Healthcare's survey reveals that the latest anti-TNF biologics to be approved for the treatment of AS, Johnson & Johnson/ Merck & Co / Mitsubishi Tanabe 's Simponi (golimumab;) and UCB's Cimzia (certolizumab), have not successfully penetrated earlier lines of treatment in the US and five major EU markets, reinforcing the notion that rheumatologists are reluctant to adopt newer therapies. Indeed, key opinion leaders have noted that they use Enbrel and Humira in earlier lines of AS treatment as these are the anti-TNFs with which they are most familiar and which have the longest history of use. </p><p>Of the pipeline candidates, Datamonitor Healthcare says Xeljanz is expected to capture the greatest patient share in every market, with the exception of the US. This is in line with the fact that key opinion leaders expect Xeljanz to demonstrate similar efficacy to the currently approved anti-TNF biologics, with the added benefit of its oral formulation.</p><h2>future in refractory patients</h2><p>Although the anti-TNF biologics have demonstrated strong efficacy in AS, a significant proportion of patients do not respond well enough to these treatments. Their only option is to cycle through several of the existing anti-TNF biologics, leaving a clear unmet medical need for novel agents that demonstrate efficacy in non-responders to anti-TNF treatment. Here Novartis's Cosentyx has the most potential to provide a treatment option for this patient subgroup.</p><p>"Interviewed rheumatologists have revealed their positive outlook for Novartis's interleukin-17A receptor antagonist, Cosentyx (secukinumab), highlighting that it has the potential to provide a treatment option for patients refractory to TNF inhibition," says Datamonitor Healthcare.</p><p>However, Cosentyx and the other investigational products, also including Roche's anti&ndash;IL6 agent Actemra (tocilizumab), will also have to muscle into a market being transformed by the arrival of anti-TNF biosimilars. "Even though the prescribing decisions of physicians in the EU have not been driven by cost or reimbursement restrictions so far, cost-effectiveness will play a greater role in the near future with the launch of biosimilars." </p><p>Johnson & Johnson/Merck & Co/Mitsubishi's Remicade (infliximab) was the first anti-TNF to face biosimilar competition was Remicade, while Amgen/Pfizer's Enbrel (etanercept) and AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) are also facing near-term biosimilar threats. In the current environment of cost-containment, these biosimilars are likely to be prescribed preferentially eroding the brands' market shares. </p><p>
