<p>Shares of Lupin had a see-saw ride on Indian bourses on 23 February, after the firm indicated that one of its sites was under the scrutiny of the US FDA for certain good manufacturing practices (GMP) deviations.</p><p>Lupin said that the FDA had audited its bioresearch centre in Pune and its manufacturing facility in Pithampur, near Indore, in November 2014 and January 2015 respectively. While the Pune unit went through with about any observations, the Indore site received six observations in Form 483. </p><p>A Form 483 is a notice of inspectional observations and lists deficiencies in the quality system.</p><p>Lupin gave no details about the nature of observations but some analysts believe that new drug approvals could be hit if matters escalate and the root cause is not addressed effectively.</p><p>Lupin, however, underscored that the Indore site had since received one ANDA approval and two site-transfer clearances to the plant. </p><p>The company said that it had received final FDA approval for bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.03%, a generic version of Allergan's Lumigan ophthalmic solution 0.03% and that its US subsidiary expected to start marketing the product shortly. The Lumigan generic filing, Lupin said, was made from the Indore facility.</p><p>The clarification appeared to calm some investors. Shares of Lupin, which touched a low of INR1604.40 ($25.8) after opening at INR1694.95 on 23 February, recovered to end the day at INR1648.70 (-2.5%) on the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p><p>A clutch of Indian firms including Ipca, Wockhardt, Ranbaxy and Sun Pharma have been under the FDA scanner for GMP deviations at their sites, raising speculation of widespread compliance issues, though officials from the agency have stressed that the sheer number of facilities and volumes in India may be skewing the perception of domestic deficiencies compared with other nations, which also had similar issues.</p><p>''The only reason that it is amplified is because of transparency &#8230;all warning letters that are issued are put on the FDA website. So people probably think India is getting more of a share of its warning letters than other countries,'' Solomon Yimam, Assistant Country Director, US FDA India Office, told <i>Scrip</i> recently <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/BioAsia-2015-FDA-bioresearch-483s-in-India-dip-356565%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 5 February 2015)</a>. </p>
