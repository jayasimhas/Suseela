<p>Shares of Acadia Pharmaceuticals plummeted 30% in after-hours trading on 11 March after the firm revealed it was again delaying its new drug application (NDA) submission for its investigational Parkinson's disease psychosis drug Nuplazid (pimavanserin) &ndash; this time pushing it out until the second half of the year.</p><p>The company also disclosed that its CEO Dr Uli Hacksell was stepping down. </p><p>This past <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/Acadia-Dont-expect-Nuplazid-NDA-until-1Q-2015-354979" target="_new">November</a>, Acadia said it was delaying the NDA filing until the first quarter of 2015 because additional time was needed to complete preparations to support the FDA's review.</p><p>Now, Acadia concluded additional time was needed to complete the readiness of its commercial manufacturing systems, said newly installed interim CEO Steve Davis. </p><p>Acadia reported top-line results from its pivotal Phase III trial in Parkinson's disease psychosis in November 2012, "and we can't recall a situation where a co has taken this long/had this many delays in filing an NDA," said JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov. </p><p>Nuplazid, which received the FDA's <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/FDA-dubs-Acadia-Parkinsons-drug-Nuplazid-breakthrough-353683" target="_new">breakthrough</a> therapy designation this past fall, is a selective serotonin inverse agonist preferentially targeting 5-HT2A receptors believed to play an important role in psychosis. If approved by the FDA, the small molecule drug would be the first in the US OK'd to treat psychosis associated with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
