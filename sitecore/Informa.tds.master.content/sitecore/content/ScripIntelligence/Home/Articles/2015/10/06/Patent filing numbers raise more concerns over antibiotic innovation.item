<p> New figures detailing the number of patent filings in the antibiotic space suggests that the issue of resistance is still not being addressed adequately. The fact that the antibiotic industry is not innovating at the same pace as other areas of the pharmaceutical industry has been highlighted through an analysis of filings over the past ten years by IP lawyers at Marks &amp; Clerk. In its latest report, <i>From rare to routine &ndash; medicines for rare diseases, vaccines and antibiotics</i>, the firm emphasizes why it believes that the antibiotics market is &quot;at risk of losing another decade to inadequate levels of research and innovation.&quot; </p> <p> The total number of patent applications filed in the antibiotic space worldwide each year has seen a drop from 2007 (8,565) to 2012 (5,586). More worryingly, the report found that less than 5% of patents filed for antibiotic research since 2004 are directed towards new classes of antibiotics. </p> <p> Meanwhile, the number of patent families has remained stable at around 1,200 families filed each year. A patent family is set of patent applications made in multiple countries to protect a single invention. Marks &amp; Clerk note that while it may be tempting to assume that as a consequence of financial pressure, applicants are focusing on key territories and filing fewer patents per family, its concern is that it is also likely that that the decline in the total number of filings is owing to a general apathy towards antibiotic innovations. </p> <p> On a positive note, despite the overall decline, the number of granted patents has been increasing year-on-year since 2004, they say. </p> <p> Amgen was identified as the leading filer of patents related to new antibiotics (though it has not filed any of these since 2008), while the top two filers of antibiotics patents overall (both known and new classes) were two Chinese companies: Tianjin Shengji Group and Shandong Xuanzhu Pharmaceutical Technology. Further examination revealed that these companies are adopting relatively restrictive filing strategies, indicating China-centric behavior. </p> <p> Of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, Novartis, Merck &amp; Co, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Janssen Pharmaceuticals (a J&amp;J company) are all present among the 20 top filers. </p> <p> The report also found that Universities are also playing a key role in antibiotic research with the Universities of California and Texas the third and eighth-highest filers. </p> <p> &quot;The list of Top Filers in antibiotics research, which is topped by Chinese companies, shows that this has not been a priority area for big pharma over the last decade. Governments around the world are implementing strategy reviews as they look to confront the problem of antibiotic-resistance. We hope the results of these reviews, together with increasing public pressure and media attention, will result in an increase in research into antibiotics, particularly from big pharma. The US is a clear leader in this area, but the statistics suggest it is less dominant than in rare diseases and vaccines, with China in particular innovating more and more,&quot; says Dr Gareth Williams, European Patent Attorney and Partner at Marks &amp; Clerk. </p> <p> <p> <b>Top filers of patents related to antibiotics</b> </p> <p> <img src="-/media/248AFBE088C24791803917417325B083.ashx"></p> <p> Data for 2013-2015 incomplete due to 18-month publication delay. </p> <p> One data point per patent family. </p> <p> Source: Marks &amp; Clerk, <i>From rare to routine &ndash; medicines for rare diseases, vaccines and antibiotics</i> </p>
