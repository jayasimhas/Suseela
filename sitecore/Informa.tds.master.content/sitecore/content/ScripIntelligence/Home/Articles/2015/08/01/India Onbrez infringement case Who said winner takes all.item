<p>This is probably one of those legal cases where the loser is not standing small, at least for now.</p><p>The Delhi High Court's recent decision restraining Cipla from making and selling indacaterol active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) compound or formulations in the alleged Onbrez Breezhaler patent infringement case brought about by Novartis left it open to the Indian firm to pursue a compulsory licence (CL).</p><p>If this raises the prospects of a keenly contested CL battle, nothing stops Novartis from proving its previous allegations that Cipla submitted an ''unfounded'' request for revocation of the Onbrez patents to India's department of industrial policy and protection (DIPP) under Article 66 of the Indian patent law <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Novartis-blasts-unfounded-Onbrez-patent-challenge-in-India-355494%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 8 December 2014)</a>. It could even, as some industry experts say, explore multiple licensing pacts to douse the fire. </p><p>The restraining order against Cipla is until the ''determination of the pleas raised by the defendant [Cipla] for seeking the compulsory licensing if so filed shall be determined on merit and after hearing of parties in favour of the defendant, otherwise, it would continue during the pendency of the suit'', the court order dated 9 January said.</p><p>Judge Manmohan Singh even set timelines for a potential CL and issued directions to the Patent Controller or to the relevant authority to decide the CL application ''within the period of six months from the date of filing the application within two weeks from the pronouncement of the order''. </p><p>The 143-page order notes that a ''balancing approach'' had been adopted by the court in view of the ''extenuating'' circumstances existing in the present case which is public interest so that it should not be ''disserved'' and the conditional interim order along with time bound directions can allow the parties to arrive at ''some workable solution for future or otherwise, the compulsory licensing tribunal shall form its opinion shortly''. </p><p>Sources told <i>Scrip</i> that Cipla is examining both an appeal against the court order and a potential CL application, but was not inclined ''at this point in time'' to consider a licensing option with the Swiss firm. Novartis collaborates with licensee Lupin to sell Onbrez at an estimated price of INR677 ($11) per 10 capsules in India. Cipla's indacaterol (branded as Unibrez) launched at risk is 80% cheaper than Onbrez. </p><p>The court order had referred to the option of the parties arriving at ''some consensus on the licensing terms''. Prior to the commencement of the hearing in the case, Novartis had indicated that it was ''agreeable'' to license Onbrez to Cipla subject to the latter agreeing to import its product and ''work on profit sharing basis''. Cipla had then ''refused to consider'' the offer as it was interested in manufacturing the product in India as it believes that mere importation would still lead to a ''monopoly situation''. </p><p>Cipla had earlier made a representation to the Indian government alleging ''incorrect exercise of patent monopoly which is prejudicial to public interest and mischief to the state resultant therefrom'' and a ''classic'' case of evergreening by the Swiss multinational <a href="http://%5bhttp:/www.scripintelligence.com/business/Cipla-challenges-Novartiss-evergreened-Onbrez-patents-and-launches-354765%5d" target="_new">(scripintelligence.com 31 October 2014)</a>. It sought a revocation of five patents of Novartis relating to indacaterol in public interest under Section 66 of the Indian Patent Act.</p><p>On whether it was rare for the court to note that ''in practicable terms, it is wise to relegate'' Cipla to approach the compulsory licensing tribunal if the public interest is the sole reason for which it intends to manufacture patented product, Ranjan Narula, managing partner of RNA Intellectual Property Attorneys, told <i>Scrip</i> the court was perhaps influenced by ''no material'' placed by Cipla to show that Novartis's patents were invalid or that there was a ''serious question of invalidity'' to be looked into.</p><p>Mr Narula also noted that the court was of the view that the grounds raised by Cipla to deny Novartis any interim relief were based on Section 83 and 84 of the Patent Act [concerning working of patented inventions and compulsory licences respectively] for which the powers are to be exercised by the Patent Controller and the Central government. ''Thus the court was of the view that as the Patent Act has clearly defined the forum, Cipla should approach the appropriate forum and urge the grounds as set out in Section 83 and 84,'' Mr Narula explained.</p><p>Further, the court also held that the ground of non-working should be urged before the relevant authority which will consider the matter and ''cannot be imported'' as a matter of defence to the suit for infringement as the civil court hearing the suit for infringement ''cannot transgress'' within the domain of the authority/ controller/ central government which are distinct functionaries having their powers and considerations specifically defined under the specific provisions of the Act. </p><p>Novartis said that it welcomed ''the positive outcome'' of the litigation in the Delhi High Court, which granted an interim injunction against Cipla prohibiting the company from ''re-launching'' a generic version of Onbrez Breezhaler under a new brand name. </p><p>The Delhi High Court had earlier held that Cipla&rsquo;s product infringed Novartis&rsquo;s trademark rights pertaining to Onbrez and ordered Cipla to cease manufacturing and selling Unibrez. Cipla had then proposed to adopt the trademark Indaflo in place of Unibrez.</p><p>Novartis, though, clarified that the main court action dealing with the infringement of the Onbrez patent will continue. The active ingredient indacaterol is protected by a compound patent until 2020 and by other patents covering, for example, methods of producing indacaterol.</p><h2>Order details</h2><p>But the order also had some tough words against Cipla and made significant observations on certain key issues.</p><p>Justice Manmohan Singh noted that the main question in the case was whether the court would allow a party to infringe the registered patent which is prima facie held to be valid, with the infringement established and no ''credible'' defence raised by the other side. </p><p>''The answer of this question is 'No'. Under these circumstances, the court would never encourage the infringement in view of the exclusive and statutory rights granted under section 48 of the Act,'' it held. Section 48 of India's patent regulations deals with rights of patentees.</p><p>The court said that the effect of [the] registered patent is defined in the statute and is not capable of being misunderstood. ''The statutory and monopoly rights cannot be reduced to a nullity as by virtue of section 48 of the Act till the term of validity of the suit patents, the plaintiff is entitled to prevent any third party who does not have its permission from the act of making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing for those purposes an infringing product in India.''</p><p>It also noted that in the present case, the compulsory licence had not been granted by the authority to the defendant and nor was an application pending. ''Merely the grounds and conditions stipulated under section 83 and 84 of the Act do not absolve the defendant to infringe the registered patent.''</p><p>Mr Narula also said that the court ruling on Cipla asking to fix up royalty payments to be deposited in the court was ''noteworthy''. Judge Singh said he cannot agree with Cipla's proposal that the court should permit it to manufacture the patented product by observing that the public interests warrants so without ''recompensing the plaintiff [Novartis] realistically at this stage and merely seeking a deposit in the court which would lead to all other generic companies taking the same route without actually rewarding the inventor in practice.&rdquo;</p>
