<p>Last week, second-quarter earnings season degenerated not just into the long tail of loss-making companies reporting, well, their losses, but into a savage sell-off that even took the shine off the good news. Stock market commentators will look to various factors to explain the sell-off, but this time there is no single underlying cause. It was triggered by a set of independent, unconnected and cumulative events.</p><p>The three companies with recently approved oral treatments for obesity have now reported their financial results and the evidence is consistent: obesity is not commercially viable. Vivus, Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. reported second-quarter sales of $14m, $12.1m, and $16m for their drugs <i>Qsymia</i> (phentermine/topiramate), <i>Belviq</i> (lorcaserin) and <i>Contrave</i> (naltrexone/bupropion), respectively. The viability of the companies is particularly questionable in the cases of Orexigen and Arena because their partnerships with Takeda and Eisai meant they only received $3.1m and $4.3m in royalties, respectively. With pitiful sales and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Is-Vivus-worth-saving-359734" target="_new">sales force reductions at Vivus</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/What-do-the-Eisai-cuts-mean-for-Belviq-357840" target="_new">Arena's partner</a> you would have thought that the case for obesity as a viable business model couldn't get much worse. However, last week pharmacy benefit managers CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts Holding Co. announced the exclusion of Qsymia from their formularies with the latter replacing it with generic phentermine. Orexigen however, did have a positive share price reaction to the announcement that Takeda was continuing with their partnership, although Orexigen will have to stump up the $210m to replace the cardiovascular outcomes (LIGHT) study on which the approval of Contrave was contingent. The replacement for the study is needed as the LIGHT study was compromised by un-blinding, data disclosures and a <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Orexigen-feels-the-backlash-of-PR-faux-pas-358378" target="_new">waning of significance in the primary endpoint</a>. </p><p>Although I don't follow technology stocks as an investor, I was trying to rationalize the good quarterly financial results of wearable fitness tracker company Fitbit Inc. last week with the dismal financial performance of the three companies selling drugs for obesity. How can a country with so many people keeping fit fail to offer commercial success in the treatment of the large number of obese patients? The answer, of course, is that these are two discrete sub-populations and indeed the only patients who can be prescribed the anti-obesity drugs have a body mass index that may preclude vigorous exercise and have failed diet and exercise as an intervention to reduce their weight. The only commonality between the companies selling anti-obesity drugs, Fitbit and CVS Health &ndash; which like FitBit reported financial results that the analysts from JP Morgan described as "solid" last week &ndash; was a falling share price.</p><p>Falling share prices for good reasons also seemed to be the feature of loss-making biotech companies last week where good news was punished and bad news punished even more. Disappointing results from maternal diagnostics company Sequenom, Inc., cardiovascular developer BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and renal disease specialist Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. resulted in plummeting share prices for all three companies. In Keryx's case, the sales of its only approved drug, <i>Auryxia</i> (ferric citrate), for patients with chronic kidney disease, totaled $1.8m in the second quarter against a loss of $26m, a performance that the analysts from JP Morgan described as "lackluster". The analysts from Ladenburg Thalmann described <i>Auryxia's</i> sales as "reaching a turning point" but whatever that might imply for subsequent quarters, it did not appear to resonate with investors. </p><p>Last week's carnage in biotech is almost certainly down to the realization by generalist investors that valuations have been significantly stretched and FDA approval does not mean commercial success. The poorlyreceived proposed all-share $34bn <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Shires-Bid-For-Baxalta-A-Fools-Errand-359774" target="_new">acquisition of Baxalta, Inc. by Shire Plc</a> might have been for all the wrong strategic and therapeutic reasons, but with the analysts at Jefferies describing the move as "not the usual M&A play" my suggestion would be that the other usual M&A plays (acquiring biotech companies) are overvalued. As investors started to realize the fragility of biotech valuations, the investment bank analysts who had previously helped stoke the sector by <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Stockwatch-biotech-stock-propagandists-beware-359154" target="_new">describing clinical trial failures as anything other than a failure</a>, have also started to wake up to the pervading mood. The analysts from JP Morgan downgraded Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to a neutral recommendation on the basis of its (over) valuation. On the basis of Fluidigm Corp.'s second successive quarterly sales guidance cut and a sales and earnings miss of consensus estimates, the analysts from Mizuho lowered their share price target, cut their estimates and valuation multiple and reiterated their neutral rating. After a cut to expenses that drove a quarterly beat of consensus earnings estimates, the analysts at JP Morgan rewarded Mallinckrodt Plc. with a downgrade to neutral after having "a tough time articulating a near-term upside path". </p><p>Last week saw a significant sell-off, particularly in biotech stocks where valuations have often been speculated to be in bubble territory. It is probably unrelated that sell-side analysts have started to downgrade their ratings on some of these stocks just as valuations head downwards, in the same way that Fitbit's commercial success is unrelated to the commercial failure of anti-obesity drugs. Just because they are unrelated, doesn't mean that it won't keep happening. </p><p>The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include CVS Health.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
