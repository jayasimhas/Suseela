<p>Still learning lessons from 2013's bribery scandal and subsequent investigations in China, GlaxoSmithKline's CEO Sir Andrew Witty had his annual bonus for the past year slashed in half. </p><p>In 2014 Sir Andrew received a pay-for-performance annual bonus of $1.4m, down 51% from a figure of almost $2.9m awarded in 2013, according to GSK's annual report published on 26 February. GSK's chief did see a minimal fixed salary increase though. </p><p>In a similar pattern company CFO Simon Dingemans' annual bonus also dropped almost 50% last year, compared to 2013. </p><p>GSK was fined a record sum of $486m in September 2014 after it was officially found guilty of bribery by the Changsha Intermediate People's Court in Hunan Province (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Officially-guilty-GSK-fined-486m-for-Chinese-bribery-354041" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 19 September 2014</a>). The verdict found that GSK had "offered money or property to non-government personnel in order to obtain improper commercial gains, and been found guilty of bribing non-government personnel." The ruling marked the end of a saga dating back to June 2013, which included tales of corruption, detained private investigators, blackmail, sex tapes and a country wide probe into pharmaceutical business practices. </p><p>The company has since been focused on rebuilding its reputation in the region. </p><p>In its full year report, GSK outlined further enhancements to its anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) methods. The firm's audit and risk committee said: "We continue to review the lessons learned from recent investigations, particularly those at our Chinese operations in 2013, and ask how we can improve the effectiveness of our ABAC approach."</p><p>Steps taken in 2014 to strengthen its ABAC "capabilities" included:</p><ul><li>a detailed review of operations and ongoing presence in higher risk territories; </li><li>enhanced monitoring of compliance with ABAC related controls in targeted emerging market territories to help identify and implement further enhanced controls where appropriate;</li><li>emerging markets and European general managers are completing reviews of their key controls and documenting adherence to GSK's values, policies and procedures as well as applicable local laws and regulations; </li><li>a specialist ABAC Centre of Excellence to provide training, due diligence and expert guidance for senior management has been created; </li><li>GSK expanded its global ethics and compliance (GEC) organization, designated to higher risk and emerging markets;</li><li>ABAC investigations team were strengthened; </li><li>increased oversight of third party suppliers with the initiation of a new risk assessment and monitoring framework;</li><li>and a review of the progress of the external (Ropes and Gray) and internal China investigations, which have now been ongoing for over a year and a half. "We are committed to implementing Ropes and Gray's conclusions. Many actions have already been implemented by a new management team, including enhanced procedures for monitoring the use of third party suppliers and local financial transactions. The committee will continue to monitor progress in the related investigations closely until they are concluded," GSK's audit committee said.</li></ul><p>As well as the trouble in China GSK struggled in 2014 as pharmaceutical sales were impacted by continued price and contracting pressures across the US market. In particular, the company's US respiratory portfolio has been making losses over the last year, with key product Advair (fluticasone) losing patent exclusivity and other products, such as Anoro (umeclidinium/vilanterol) and Breo (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol), failing to gain the traction it was hoped they would. US sales overall fell 10% last year. Earlier this month GSK appointed a new US president in order to revive its flagging business. Jack Bailey has taken up the post, replacing Deirdre Connelly who was US president for six years (<a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/people/GSK-promotes-new-US-president-to-revive-flagging-business-356793" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 17 February 2015</a>). </p><p><p><p><b>Related stories:</b></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GSK-aftermath-Industry-grapples-with-compliance-issues-354150" target="_new">GSK aftermath: Industry grapples with compliance issues</a>Â </p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GSK-detective-formally-charged-big-pharma-not-mentioned-in-charge-list-353274" target="_new">GSK detective jailed; big pharma not mentioned</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSKs-second-quarter-slump-even-worse-than-expected-352991" target="_new">GSK's second quarter slump even worse than expected</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/PI-detained-in-China-blasts-GSK-for-sitting-on-corruption-evidence-352671" target="_new">PI detained in China blasts GSK for sitting on corruption evidence</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-in-China-sex-tape-adds-to-shameful-bribery-allegations-352588" target="_new">GSK in China: sex tape adds to 'shameful' bribery allegations</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/British-man-masterminded-GSKs-misconduct-in-China-officials-claim-351823" target="_new">British man 'masterminded' GSK's misconduct in China, officials claim</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/No-systemic-issue-insists-GSK-amid-yet-more-corruption-allegations-351350" target="_new">'No systemic issue' insists GSK amid yet more corruption allegations</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/More-GSK-corruption-allegations-emerge-351278" target="_new">More GSK corruption allegations emerge</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-to-scrap-sales-reps-targets-and-payments-to-doctors-348840" target="_new">GSK to scrap sales reps targets and payments to doctors</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/policyregulation/GSK-scandal-ensnares-Shanghai-official-as-China-probe-widens-348779" target="_new">GSK scandal ensnares Shanghai official as China probe widens</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSK-says-China-execs-breached-law-345191" target="_new">GSK says China execs breached law</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/GSKs-Hussain-pledges-to-improve-China-ops-at-ministry-meeting-345170" target="_new">GSK's Hussain pledges to improve China ops at ministry meeting</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/China-allegations-shameful-for-GSK-as-probe-deepens-345017" target="_new">China allegations 'shameful' for GSK as probe deepens</a></p><p><a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Chinese-government-confirms-GSK-bribery-probe-344907" target="_new">Chinese government confirms GSK bribery probe</a></p><p>
