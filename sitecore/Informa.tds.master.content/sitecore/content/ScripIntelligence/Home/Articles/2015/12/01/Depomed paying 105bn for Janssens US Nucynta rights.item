<p>Newark, California-based Depomed will pay Johnson & Johnson's Janssen Pharmaceuticals subsidiary $1.05bn to buy the US rights for all approved formulations of the pain drug Nucynta (tapentadol), which Janssen licensed in 2003 and co-developed with Grunenthal.</p><p>The deal aligns with all of the characteristics for an ideal Depomed acquisition, which company president and CEO Jim Schoeneck outlined in an interview with <i>Scrip</i> during the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on 14 January in San Francisco &ndash; a day before the Nucynta transaction was announced. </p><p>Depomed closed down 2.2% at $17.65 per share on 15 January, but the stock gained 4.9% after the stock market closed to reach $18.51, which tops the company's one-year high of $18.28. </p><p>Depomed has been looking for larger deals than it's closed in the past, especially transactions that could transform the company. Its most recent transaction was the December 2013 acquisition of the migraine headache drug Cambia (diclofenac potassium for oral solution) for up to $52.5m (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/UPDATED-Depomed-reaches-new-high-on-47.5m-Cambia-buy-348903" target="_new">18 December 2013</a>).</p><p>The Nucynta buy is Depomed's largest yet and with $166m in US sales for the 12 months ending 30 September the deal could more than double the company's annual product sales, which are expected to total $113m to $117m for 2014. Total revenue for the year is forecast to be $232m to $242m, including royalties from products marketed by partners, but final 2014 financials won't be reported until late February or early March.</p><p>Depomed had $560m in cash as of 30 September after raising $334m from the sale of convertible senior notes in September and $240.5m from the sale of diabetes product royalties to PDL BioPharma in 2013 (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-takes-240.5m-in-PDL-royalty-deal-to-fund-acquisitions-347505" target="_new">6 September 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Depomed-takes-240.5m-in-PDL-royalty-deal-to-fund-acquisitions-347505" target="_new">22 October 2013</a>). The cash was raised primarily to buy additional products for the company's four-drug pain and neurology portfolio.</p><p><b>Acquisition strategy</b></p><p>"We have not had an issue finding assets," Mr Schoeneck told <i>Scrip</i> during the JP Morgan conference. "We are not afraid to go to companies and say, 'You're not doing enough to promote your assets.'"</p><p>Depomed's acquisition strategy is focused on approved products with annual revenue between $20m and $200m or Phase III drug candidates that are 18 months or less from regulatory approval. The company is looking to buy pain or neurology assets, including products with adjacent indications like drug addiction or arthritis pain, but the intellectual property must include patents with far-off expiration dates. </p><p>All four Depomed drugs have patents that expire between 2022 and 2024, and Nucynta's patents extend through at least 2022. Depomed's partnered assets will generate milestone fees and royalty revenue through 2032.</p><p>Nucynta extended-release (ER) is one of the products generating royalties for the company under a 2012 license agreement with Janssen for Depomed's Acuform gastric retentive drug delivery technology (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Janssen-pays-10m-upfront-to-license-technology-for-Nucynta-ER-from-Depomed-334421" target="_new">29 August 2012</a>). Now, Depomed will take over Janssen's royalty payments to Grunenthal in the US, while Janssen retains its rights to sell Nucynta in Canada, Japan and other ex-US markets. </p><p><b>Sales-boosting plans</b></p><p>Depomed is buying US rights to immediate-release Nucynta, which is approved to ease moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults; Nucynta ER for management of severe pain, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN); and Nucynta oral solution, which is approved, but hasn't been launched.</p><p>Depomed plans to boost Nucynta sales by re-launching the immediate- and extended-release formulations with a focus on the drugs' approvals to treat both chronic pain and DPN. Nucynta's dual mechanism of action provides relief from both neuropathic and nociceptive pain, which may keep patients from switching therapies when a drug stops working. Depomed claims that the DPN indication has not been fully promoted and the market should grow by 5% per year between 2014 and 2018.</p><p>The sales force for the company's four marketed drugs already covers 70% of the doctors addressed by the existing Nucynta commercial team, but Depomed plans to add another 250 representatives to promote the product &ndash; three times the number in Janssen's contracted sales force for the drug. </p><p>Depomed used a similar strategy when it bought Cambia, increasing the migraine drug's sales team from 35 to 160 representatives. The company also recently launched services to help physicians make sure that payers will cover the costs of its drugs.</p><p>Even with the sales force investment that Depomed plans to make for Nucynta, the company expects its purchase to be immediately accretive to earnings after the deal closes in the second quarter of 2015. Nucynta will then contribute to Depomed's revenue, cash flow and earnings in 2015 and beyond.</p><p>To pay for the transaction, Depomed will put $500m into an escrow account that will be released to Janssen when the deal closes. The rest of the acquisition funding costs will come from a combination of debt, equity and equity-linked financing before the transaction closes.</p><p><p><p><p>
