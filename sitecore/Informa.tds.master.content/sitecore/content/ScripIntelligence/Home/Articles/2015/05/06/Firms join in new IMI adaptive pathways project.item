<p> The EU's Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is about to launch a new collaborative public-private project looking at how best to co-ordinate and support activities being conducted in the area of adaptive pathways, with a view to producing a comprehensive plan for developing and using relevant tools and methodologies throughout the product life cycle. </p> <p> Under the heading &quot;Enabling platform for medicines adaptive pathways to patients&quot;, the project will cover initiatives such as NEWDIGS and the FDA's breakthrough program in the US, the UK early access to medicines scheme, and the European Medicines Agency's adaptive pathways project (formerly adaptive licensing). </p> <p> The project, which is part of the fourth call for proposals under the second IMI programme (IMI2 - 2014-2024), is due to begin sometime this month. It is expected to produce a comprehensive scientific research plan for the development and exploitation of tools, methodologies, and infrastructures to inform the whole product life-cycle and provide the science-based evidence to enable early patient access to innovative prevention and treatment options, according to the IMI. </p> <p> It will specifically be looking at: </p> <ul> <li>gap analysis: identifying challenges and opportunities for MAPPs, including lessons already learned from existing IMI projects; </li> <li>informing research activities: enable the inclusion of MAPPs tools and methodologies into new IMI2 actions; and </li> <li>knowledge management: horizon scanning for non-IMI activities relevant to MAPPs to create a repository of knowledge and co-ordination opportunities. </li> </ul> <p> The European industry federation, EFPIA, and its IMI partner, the European Commission, will each make a contribution of &euro;1.13m to the project (under the IMI, EFPIA makes in-kind contributions to the cost of research projects). </p> <p> On the industry side, the project involves a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, led by AstraZeneca and including Bristol-Myers Squibb (co-lead), Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, GSK/GSK vaccines, Ipsen, Janssen, Lundbeck, Merck KGaA, MSD, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi R&amp;D/Sanofi Pasteur, UCB, Lysogene and the EFPIA office, according to an outline of the project published in December 2014. </p> <p> The industry partners are expected to provide expertise in regulatory, health technology assessment, pricing and reimbursement, R&amp;D, clinical trials, benefit-risk assessments, legal and IP, and medical and health affairs. </p> <p> They should also facilitate effective collaboration among key stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, HTA, payers, academia, hospitals, SMEs, patient organizations, etc; contribute to analysing IMI project outputs; liaise with non-IMI initiatives; interact with ongoing and future IMI projects; and disseminate information from the project in the form of scientific publications and research data on an open-access basis. </p> <h2> Other new projects </h2> <p> The platform project was presented at the last meeting of the European HTA Network in March this year, along with other initiatives relevant to health technology assessments, adaptive pathways and patient access to medicines. </p> <p> Among other new projects showcased at the meeting was &quot;Discovery and validation of novel endpoints in dry age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy&quot;, which is now being prepared and will evaluate novel endpoint candidates for dry AMD and DR. </p> <p> Two other projects described, on which proposals have already been requested (deadline 24 March), were a &quot;Knowledge repository to enable patient focused medicines development&quot; and &quot;Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse&quot; (RADAR). </p> <p> The knowledge repository is intended to improve patient input into drug development processes by allowing the sharing of non-competitive information with and by users from patient groups, regulators, health authorities, academia and industry. RADAR is expected to generate patient-centric data so as to allow a shift from &quot;diagnose and treat&quot; to &quot;predict and pre-empt&quot;, using characterization and prediction of changes in disease state in NS disorders; it will focus on unipolar depression, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. </p> <h2> GetReal and other ongoing projects </h2> <p> A number of other adaptive pathways/HTA-related projects are currently being run by the IMI, including: </p> <p> <b>GetReal</b>: a three-year initiative aiming to show how new methods of real-world evidence collection and synthesis could be adopted earlier in the R&amp;D and healthcare decision-making processes so as to improve the value of information available at the point of marketing authorization. A public consultation was held this year on two related documents: current policies and perspectives on real-world data, and a glossary of key terms in the area of relative effectiveness and real-world data. Case study topics have been identified and pilot workshops held. </p> <p> <b>PROTECT</b>: Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics, which is looking at how to strengthen the monitoring of the benefit-risk of medicines, by developing a set of innovative tools and methods to enhance the early detection and assessment of adverse drug reactions and allow the integration and presentation of benefit-risk data. It consists of 34 public and private partners co-ordinated by the EMA. </p> <p> <b>EHR4CR</b>: a five-year project ending this year and described by the IMI as &quot;one of the largest public-private partnerships aiming at providing adaptable, reusable and scalable solutions (tools and services) for reusing data from electronic health record systems for clinical research&quot;; </p> <p> <b>ADVANCE</b>: Accelerated development of vaccine benefit-risk collaboration in Europe. The project aims to develop and test methods and guidelines to pave the way for a framework capable of rapidly delivering reliable data on the benefits and risks of vaccines on the market. It is expected to assist regulators and public health authorities in making decisions on vaccination strategies, and to help maintain public confidence in immunisation as an effective public health tool. </p>
