<p>As the second-quarter earnings season kicked off last week the stock market applauded Greece for continuing to stunt the euro by not Grexiting and China's miraculous government figures on the growth of its economy. It is, after all, growth that remains on everyone's mind because earnings season is supposed to be the appreciation of the growth of sales and earnings. If supporters of the current valuations in biotech are to be believed, it is partly the growth in sales at big biotechnology companies over the last few years that has enabled many much smaller companies to IPO and sell waves of initial and secondary stock offerings to investors.</p><p>If last week's second-quarter earnings from the healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is repeated by other profitable life science companies, then this questionable connection between earnings growth and risky loss-making IPOs is about to break down.</p><p>At many pharmaceutical companies, sales are still declining as a result of their descent down the south face of their respective patent cliffs. J&J kept to this theme with almost a 9% <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/2Q-pharma-earnings-What-to-watch-for-this-season-359475" target="_new">sales decline</a> over the previous year and a patent cliff drop that should echo across the biotech sector. J&J's sales decline had the potential to be glossed over by investment bank analysts as not being as bad as they expected, however, the analysts at JP Morgan and Cowen spared the excessive cosmetic usage by describing J&J's quarter as "essentially in-line" (which it wasn't, having beaten analysts' estimates of both sales and earnings). Commendably, the analysts from Jefferies went one better by describing J&J's results as "low quality" because it was not its operational activities that resulted J&J's consensus-beating second-quarter results.</p><p>To be a quality earnings story, company management must grow sales by increasing sales volume and the average sales price (but not just one of these) as well as taking costs out of the business by becoming more efficient. Doing all these things as the same time leads to a longevity in earnings, whereas either cutting the salesforce, or increasing the sales price in the face of lower sales volumes cannot be maintained for many quarters. The reason why J&J's quarter, and possibly this financial year's earnings, are likely to be of a low quality is due to the recent divestment of pain drug Nucynta (tapentadol) and a large Medicaid rebate that together resulted in a $1.22bn &ndash; classified as other income &ndash; getout-of-jail card that J&J used to offset the continued weak performances at its consumer and medical devices and diagnostics divisions.</p><p>J&J's pharmaceutical division, rather than the one-off other income proceeds, was regarded by most of the investment bank research I read as the highlight of J&J's quarter, although the analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch described the division as "continuing to have a few overhangs". These overhangs will permeate through this earnings season and beyond for many companies. For the first real quarter, J&J is seeing meaningful biosimilar competition in Europe for its anti-inflammatory biologic drug Remicade (infliximab), the sales of which fell by 20% <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/JandJs-Gorsky-stands-by-Remicade-longevity-as-biosimilar-impact-hits-Europe-359437" target="_new">in the second-quarter</a>. Even where its products did perform well, the silver lining was tarnished as half the asset or royalties will end up in the hands of J&J's partners. This was the case for the consensus-beating $154m quarterly sales of cancer drug Imbruvica (ibrutinib) which is now shared with AbbVie, and the better than expected sales of anti-psychotic drug Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) on which Alkermes is paid a royalty. J&J's second-quarter consensus-beating results resulted in a 1% share price drop, but a 0.3% rise in the share price of AbbVie. </p><p>Perhaps more worryingly for its pharmaceutical franchise, competition from Medivation in the area of prostate cancer and from Gilead Sciences and AbbVie in the area of HCV antivirals is likely to put short-term pressure on J&J's pharmaceutical division and perhaps relax that stringent financial discipline towards M&A that so contrasts the <i>laissez faire</i> attitude to the recent transactions by Celgene and Alexion.</p><p>And as if to cap all these pressures, J&J is once more the first reporting company for the second-quarter to remind us of the continued effect on earnings by the continued weakness of the euro. While the effect on J&J's second-quarter earnings dampened sales growth by about 4%, Greece's continued presence in the euro is likely to drag the European currency down further against the more stable reserve currencies in which most pharma and biotech companies report for years to come.</p><p>Behind the curtain of a second-quarter sales and earnings beat, J&J's low-quality results were flattered by one-off gains. Once its one-off divestment gains have been fully recognised and depleted, the healthcare giant will be caught in a pincer movement comprising biosimilar Remicade, declining HCV antiviral sales and like-clockwork poor operational performances from its non-pharmaceutical divisions. With organic growth deserting J&J, and investors and bankers not being offered the spin-off upsides and fees, respectively, that Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Bayer have, and continue to offer, I'm left wondering if a lack of growth &ndash; that most tangible but most tenuous second derivative driver for the IPOs of risky and loss-making early stage biotech companies &ndash; will contribute to the bursting of the biotech bubble. Probably not.</p><p>NB The Magna Biopharma Income fund holdings include Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Celgene and Medivation.</p><p><p><i>Andy Smith is chief investment officer of Mann Bioinvest.
