<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb has returned North American rights to the anticancer Erbitux (cetuximab) to Lilly after a collaboration of 14 years initiated with ImClone, which was acquired by Lilly. BMS cited its "prioritized opportunities" in immuno-oncology. </p><p>The full transition to Lilly of the product, which is indicated for certain advanced head and neck and colorectal cancers, will be completed in the fourth quarter, the partners said; BMS will receive tiered royalties in North America based on net product sales thereafter through September 2018. Datamonitor Healthcare lists the product's patent expiry in the US and EU as 2019. In February, Merck KGaA announced that it would take full responsibility for promotion of Erbitux in Japan from 1 May 2015. In 2014, BMS booked US sales of Erbitux totalling $682m; the figure was the same in 2013. </p><p>BMS's immuno-oncology portfolio includes approved drugs Opdivo (nivolumab) and Yervoy (ipilimumab) and the Phase III biologic elotuzumab. Credit Suisse analysts expect Opdivo to achieve global sales of $2.2bn and Yervoy $1.5bn by 2016. In 2014, the products generated $6m and $1.3bn, respectively.</p>
