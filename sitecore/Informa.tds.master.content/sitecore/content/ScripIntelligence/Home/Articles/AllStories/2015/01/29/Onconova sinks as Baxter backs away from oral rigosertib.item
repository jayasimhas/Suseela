<p>Onconova Therapeutics sank 36.3% to close at $2.55 per share on 3 February after the company revealed deep in a disclosure of its Phase III plans for intravenous rigosertib in higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that its partner Baxter Healthcare will not pursue further development of oral rigosertib in lower-risk MDS.</p><p>Newtown, Pennsylvania-based Onconova's market cap has fallen to $55.3m &ndash; 81.4% below the company's value nearly a year ago before it announced that IV rigosertib failed in the Phase III ONTIME clinical trial in higher-risk MDS (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/business/Onconova-sinks-on-2nd-Phase-III-rigosertib-bust-350146" target="_new">20 February 2014</a>). Onconova noted at the time that ONTIME's results were statistically significant in patients who failed treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and that's the population in which the company will test IV rigosertib in its next Phase III study.</p><p>Onconova plans to begin patient enrollment during the second half of 2015. Jefferies analyst Howard Liang noted that Baxter will be on the hook for $15m in funding for the Phase III higher-risk MDS (HR-MDS) study if the company retains its rights to the drug despite the decision not to advance the oral formulation in lower-risk MDS (LR-MDS).</p><p>"We had been more interested in the LR-MDS opportunity in part due to a more commercially friendly formulation (oral versus continuous infusion) and observation of single-agent activity on an approvable endpoint (transfusion independence)," Dr Liang wrote in a 3 February report. "While we do not know the specific reason for Baxter's decision, the progress of oral rigosertib in LR-MDS has been slower than we expected and now there appears to be low visibility and significant uncertainty in moving forward to Phase III in this setting."</p><p>Onconova had planned for a second half 2014 start for its Phase III oral rigosertib study in lower-risk MDS, but moved the target date to the first half of 2015 last year. The company is evaluating biomarker data in an ongoing Phase II extension study to understand its options for pursuing development of oral rigosertib in LR-MDS without Baxter's support.</p><p>In the interim, Onconova will focus on development of the IV formulation for treatment of HR-MDS patients who've failed HMA therapy based on guidance from the US FDA and European Medicines Agency for the Phase III clinical trial design.</p><p>"There have been no drug approvals in the US since 2005 to address the unmet medical need of these patients," Onconova president and CEO Ramesh Kumar said.</p><p><p><p><p>
