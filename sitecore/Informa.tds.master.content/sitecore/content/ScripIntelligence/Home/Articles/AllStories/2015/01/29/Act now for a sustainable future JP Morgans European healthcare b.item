<p>Is the UK's biopharmaceutical sector in danger of "missing the boat"? That's the warning from Cathrin Petty, co-head of the healthcare group covering the EMEA region at JP Morgan, who believes that the healthcare business community needs to take advantage of the positive investment climate in the UK in the next two to three years, or potentially lose out for decades to come. </p><p>Ms Petty, a private equity industry veteran who was brought into the firm a year ago after a busy 2013 for its EMEA healthcare team, spoke to <i>Scrip</i> during the inaugural Future of Healthcare Investor Forum at the London Stock Exchange.</p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: What are the current trends in healthcare investment?</b></p><p>We are seeing a strong influx of investors into healthcare. We've got a rotation into healthcare and out of some of the other equities. That's been driven by long-term demographics but also because the technology has come of age. We're finally seeing the convergence of the output from the genome sequencing activities back in 2000, with technology that enables us to do something with it, and better understanding of the mechanisms of disease. It's all coming together now.</p><p>Alongside that, you're seeing the regulators, particularly in the US, and now increasingly in Europe and certainly in the UK, becoming far more sophisticated in terms of how they're looking to approve these drugs, both in terms of accelerated submissions but also for those in the orphan indications and hopefully in some of the other therapeutic areas too. </p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Are companies becoming more confident about raising money in Europe?</b></p><p>In the US, lots of companies have gone out and raised substantial amounts of money. Europeans are behind that curve. In 2014, we had 13 IPOs in the UK, three on the main market here, and 10 on AIM. But there are a number of companies coming through which have got great technologies, they are leaders in their field, have very experienced management teams, and are talking to us about whether to go to the US or the UK. My attitude is, "Why wouldn't you go to the UK when you've got great science, your team is there, you're a British company, and you've got one of the best stock markets in the world?" </p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Do you believe the UK has an opportunity to create a viable financing environment?</b></p><p>Absolutely. We've got a critical mass of great quality companies coming through. Let's get these companies to go public in the UK, get them properly financed and create the industry over the next two to three years. And it has to happen now. They won't all succeed but if we have a good portfolio of the right companies coming through that are properly financed then we've got a better chance of supporting them all the way. If we don't do it now, I think we'll miss the boat for the next 10 or 20 years.</p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: How are investment models changing?</b></p><p>We have got investors in the UK for the first time seeing long-term institutional shareholders like the Woodfords and the Invescos of the world making great returns from long holding positions of companies. People can see the success starting to come through. We just need more of them.</p><p>Investment models are changing as different types of investors are coming in. Some of the large institutional funds are coming to Europe now, for instance Fidelity. We've got a different investor base which has a long-term view, that knows it's going to take somewhere in the region of 10-15 years for these companies to get the whole way, and they're prepared to wait that long. Importantly, alongside that, the government is doing a great job in opening up the infrastructure here to make the UK more accessible both in terms of access to data, in terms of clinical trials, and also in terms of the tax environment: the incentives around the patent box, etc, so it's all going in the right direction. </p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: What might the pitfalls be?</b></p><p>One of the pitfalls is that we've got a number of older companies out on the market who haven't really delivered. That old, outdated business model holds us back. We haven't got enough public success stories. Our successful companies got taken out. The only public success stories we have are BTG and Shire, and Shire is virtually a US company now. </p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Are VCs still building companies for trade sales? Does that confuse the issue?</b></p><p>There are some companies that are better for a trade exit. This is the case in specific circumstances, for example a company with one sole asset that it has taken through development and there is nothing behind it. It's relatively inefficient to create a company and infrastructure around that. There may be other circumstances where you've got a company that has either multiple products, like Circassia [the Oxford-based immunotherapies developer that won the 2014 Scrip Financing Deal of the Year Award; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/comment/Scrips-10th-Anniversary-Awards-celebrate-industry-achievements-355406" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 4 December 2014</a>], or a platform capability generating multiple products, like Immunocore [another Oxfordshire company focused on immune-based technology, which won a 2014 Scrip Award for its partnership alliance with MedImmune]. Those companies have got both the management team and the technology, and multiple opportunities to build a sustainable business. </p><p>The challenge is that the VCs that have been in some of those companies have been in there for at least seven or eight years already and their funds are typically 10-year close end funds. So it's incredibly hard for them to then sit on a public company for another three or four years. Therefore the easier route is for them build it to sell, because then you can go and raise the next fund. </p><p>If we can break that middle bit, by creating that crossover pool of capital, and provide the long term support, then VCs will have more confidence in taking companies public.</p><p><b><i>Scrip</i>: Has the UK lost gems along the way?</b></p><p>Oh, undoubtedly. Convergence Pharmaceuticals &ndash; which was just sold [to Biogen Idec; <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Biogen-Idec-buys-analgesic-developer-Convergence-for-200m-356088" target="_new">scripintelligence.com, 12 January 2015</a>] &ndash; broke my heart. That's a great example of fantastic UK science with enormous potential not just in rare diseases but also in other single point mutation genes which cause hideous pain as well as in neuropathic pain, which is currently untreated. So we have got great companies like that which we could take all the way. Maybe if we had a more confident public market in place, then the VCs behind that one might have felt more confident about supporting it, because they had the management, they definitely had the right technology: they could have gone all the way.</p><p>The next two to three years are key. If we don't get a decent cluster of these companies on the market we're not going to change it. We've got to get a decent portfolio in order to get the concentration of institutional investors to come into it. They're not going to invest in one or two companies, they need 10 to 15.</p>
