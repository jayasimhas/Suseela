<p>Merck KGaA is bringing its diabetes and thyroid brands in Russia back 'in house' from its marketing partner Takeda.</p><p>"Repatriation [of these products] is well aligned with our commercial priorities in emerging markets, especially in strategic markets like Russia," said Elcin Ergun, head of global commercial at Merck Serono, Merck's biopharmaceuticals unit. "We will continue to strengthen our business by expanding our commercial footprint, as well as by harnessing manufacturing and supply solutions locally. This was exemplified by our recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with Pharmstandard on local fill and finish production, marketing and distribution of Merck's Rebif for multiple sclerosis treatment in Russia."</p><p>Merck is not planning any changes to the branding of products as a result of the switch, and the same manufacturing and distribution channels will be utilized. </p><p>Merck Serono recently expanded its sales force in Russia in preparation for the move, with promotion and marketing to be handled by a new local business unit, which is now in place. </p><p>The change will affect Glucophage (metformin hydrochloride), and Glucophage XR, Glucovance (metformin and glibenclamide), Euthyrox (levothyroxine sodium), Jodid (potassium iodide; Iodbalance in Russia), and Thyrozol (thiamazole). </p><p>Takeda will continue to market Merck's cardiovascular care products of the Concor family, and other general medicine (GM) products in Russia. In other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Takeda will continue to commercialize all products in Merck's portfolio for the treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and thyroid disorders alongside other GM products. </p><p>
