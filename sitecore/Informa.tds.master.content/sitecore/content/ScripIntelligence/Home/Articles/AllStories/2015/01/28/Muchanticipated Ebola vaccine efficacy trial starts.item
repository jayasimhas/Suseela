<p>A much-anticipated trial taking place in and around Monrovia, Liberia testing the effectiveness of two experimental Ebola vaccines has started in earnest, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said on 2 February &ndash; confirming the news West African government officials had announced.</p><p>The Phase II/III PREVAIL trial was designed to enroll 27,000 adults 18 years or older &ndash; some healthy subjects and others healthcare workers or those at high risk of contracting Ebola.</p><p>But the NIAID acknowledged the study may need to adapted in the future to address the continued reduction in the number of new Ebola cases in Liberia. </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reported last week that for the first time since 29 June 2014, there were fewer than 100 new confirmed cases of Ebola reported in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p><p>The slowdown in Ebola cases was blamed for Chimerix abandoning its participation in all current and future trials of brincidofovir as a treatment for Ebola, including a study in Liberia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/Chimerix-abandons-Ebola-trials-of-brincidofovir-356478" target="_new">1 February 2015</a>).</p><p>WHO, however, reported that Ebola has infected more than 22,000 people and killed nearly 9,000 in the current outbreak.</p><p>The trial being run by the NIAID is evaluating a vaccine being developed by the agency with GlaxoSmithKline, known as cAd3-EBOZ, which uses a chimpanzee-derived cold virus to deliver Ebola virus genetic material from the Zaire strain of virus causing the outbreak in Liberia (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ZMapp-Ebola-vaccines-set-for-testing-in-Liberia-356313" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/researchdevelopment/GSK-NIAID-Ebola-vaccine-arrives-in-Liberia-awaits-trial-356347" target="_new">23 January 2015</a>).</p><p>The other candidate, VSV-ZEBOV, is from NewLink Genetics and its partners Merck and the Canadian government. That vaccine employs vesicular stomatitis virus, an animal virus that primarily affects cattle, to carry an Ebola virus gene segment. </p><p>Phase I results of both vaccines have demonstrated the products are safe and prompted immune responses to the outer coat of Ebola virus, although the results of the NewLink-Merck vaccine have not yet been made public, but were revealed to regulatory bodies reviewing the study, NIAID said (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/GSK-NIH-declare-Ebola-vaccine-safety-test-a-success-355287" target="_new">27 November 2014</a>).</p><p>In the three-arm, randomized double-blind Phase II/III PREVAIL trial, study participants in one group will receive a placebo of saline injection, while the others will receive a single injection of either the cAd3-EBOZ or the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. </p><p>The trial is being led by a recently formed Liberia-US clinical research partnership and is being sponsored by the NIAID.</p><p>Ultimately, the clinical trial will involve 10 vaccination centers within existing health clinics in the Monrovia, Liberia area. </p><p>Depending on the course of the Ebola epidemic, additional sites may be added, NIAID said. </p><p>The initial Phase II portion of the trial will enroll about 600 study participants. </p><p>They will receive a single injection of either one of the vaccines or the placebo. </p><p>In the absence of major safety issues, enrollment will continue and the remaining volunteers will be randomly assigned in three, equal-sized groups to the Phase III portion of the clinical trial. </p><p>The participants will undergo monthly assessments for adverse events and signs and symptoms of Ebola infection. </p><p>All participants in both the Phase II and III portions of the trial will be followed for 8-12 months.</p><p>The study currently is anticipated to be completed in June 2016, NIAID said. </p><p>Another trial being run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planned to take place in Sierra Leone testing one of the two vaccines being studied in the Liberia trial.</p><p>That vaccine for the study has not yet been selected.</p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>
