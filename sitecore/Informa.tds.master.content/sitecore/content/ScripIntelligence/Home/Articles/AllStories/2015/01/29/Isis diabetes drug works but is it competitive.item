<p>Isis Pharmaceuticals said type 2 diabetes patients treated for 26 weeks with ISIS-PTP1BRx showed statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 36 weeks in a Phase II clinical trial &ndash; 10 weeks after treatment ended &ndash; but other therapies may provide better efficacy.</p><p>Carlsbad, California-based Isis closed down 5.8% at $64.70 per share following the 3 February data announcement, because of the lag between the Phase II trial's primary endpoint and the reported results. Isis spokesman Wade Walke told <i>Scrip</i> that the company reported 36-week results, even though the primary efficacy endpoint was to be assessed at 27 weeks, because HbA1c levels continued to drop beyond the end of the study's 26-week treatment period.</p><p>Investors and analysts seemed to doubt the once-weekly injection's efficacy at the 27-week assessment point outlined in the clinical trial protocol.</p><p>"Isis noted steady, persistent decline in HbA1c over 26-week treatment period and continuing decline at 27 and 36 weeks, which seems to indicate unlikely statistically significant HbA1c reduction at 27 weeks," Jefferies analyst Eun Yang said on 3 February as the company's stock fell on what Isis billed as positive Phase II trial results.</p><p><b>Details later this year</b></p><p>The company will continue to monitor HbA1c levels for the study's participants until after the effect of ISIS-PTP1BRx wears off. Detailed results from the 92-patient Phase II clinical trial will be presented later this year, but Isis will not pursue Phase III development without a partner.</p><p>ISIS-PTP1BRx is designed to act as an insulin sensitizer to enhance glycemic control by targeting protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B). The antisense drug inhibits production of PTP-1B, a protein that negatively regulates insulin receptor signaling. </p><p>Patients treated with ISIS-PTP1BRx in the Phase II study had a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.7% from baseline at 36 weeks versus a mean 0.2% reduction for patients in the placebo group (p=0.03). Mean body weight reduction in that timeframe also was significant (p=0.01). </p><p>Sagient Research noted in a 3 February BioMedTracker report that "a placebo subtracted difference of 0.5% is sufficient for US FDA approval. However, if longer dosing does not lead to much better results, it would not be very encouraging from a commercial perspective for an injectable."</p><p>All clinical trial participants had uncontrolled blood sugar levels on metformin with or without sulfonylurea therapy. They remained on background therapy throughout the trial.</p><p>Dr Yang noted that "ISIS-PTP1BRx data seems less favorable compared to that of ISIS-GCGRRx, where [greater than] 2% HbA1c reduction at 13 weeks from baseline was observed with ISIS-GCGRRx in type 2 diabetic patients on stable metformin."</p><p>Isis's ISIS-GCGRRx targets the glucocorticoid receptor and the company is looking at the best dose and regimen to take forward in longer-term studies (scripintelligence.com, <a href="http://www.scripintelligence.com/home/ADA-preview-novel-insulins-take-diabetes-back-to-the-future-352240" target="_new">11 June 2014</a>).</p><p><b>Betting on safety</b></p><p>Isis described ISIS-PTP1BRx as well-tolerated during the Phase II study, with mostly mild and infrequent injection site reactions as the most common side effect. No flu-like symptoms, clinically significant laboratory test results or severe cases of hypoglycemia were observed.</p><p>"The only class of insulin sensitizers currently available is limited in use due to side effects," Isis vice president of clinical development and translational medicine Sanjay Bhanot said in a statement from the company. "The results from this study and our earlier clinical experience with PTP-1B suggest that addressing this novel therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes with ISIS-PTP1BRx may have the potential to offer a safer, more effective approach."</p><p>Isis chief operating officer Lynne Parshalle noted that ISIS-PTP1BRx could be used to delay the need for insulin therapy for type 2 diabetics who fail oral anti-diabetic therapies or GLP-1 agonists, to improve response to insulin therapy for insulin-resistant patients, and to help obese diabetics lose weight.</p><p>"We are in the process of discussing future development plans with potential partners in the diabetes space who could provide the expertise and resources necessary to enhance the value of this drug," Ms Parshalle said.</p><p><p><p><p>
