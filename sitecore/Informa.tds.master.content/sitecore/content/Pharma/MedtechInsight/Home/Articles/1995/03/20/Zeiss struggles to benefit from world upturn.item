<p>While results have improved slightly under the world economic recovery, Carl Zeiss (Germany) is still suffering heavily from losses at its east German operations. Group turnover increased in fiscal 1994 but net income remains well below the pre- recession level and growth is slow so far in fiscal 1995, according to CFO Hans-Kurt Fugert.</p>

<p>While results have improved slightly under the world economic recovery, Carl Zeiss (Germany) is still suffering heavily from losses at its east German operations. Group turnover increased in fiscal 1994 but net income remains well below the pre- recession level and growth is slow so far in fiscal 1995, according to CFO Hans-Kurt Fugert.</p><p>slow start to 1995</p><p>In the first five months of fiscal 1995, Zeiss' turnover was up just 2%, according to Peter Grassmann, spokesman for the board of directors. Orders are faring even worse, up just 1% over the period. East German subsidiary Carl Zeiss Jena remains the problem area, with losses mounting.</p><p>Dr Grassmann stresses that Zeiss' controversial restructuring will continue (see Clinica No 627, p 12). Some 700 of the 16,000 workforce have so far been made redundant and another 1,800 will go over the next two years, although the number of redundancies at Carl Zeiss Jena will be reduced from 650 to 150. Dr Grassmann says that labour costs account for 49% of sales, which is "still far too high".</p><p>Sales at Zeiss were up 5% to DM 2,530 million ($1,800 million) in the year ended September 30th, 1994. Much of this growth was due to foreign sales, which accounted for 66% of total turnover. Carl Zeiss Jena made a loss of DM 194 million even though sales rose 37% to DM 205 million.</p>
