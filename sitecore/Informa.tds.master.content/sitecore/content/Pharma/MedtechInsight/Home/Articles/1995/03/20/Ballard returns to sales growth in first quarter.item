<p>Ballard, a US manufacturer of critical and alternate care disposables, has returned to rising turnover in the first quarter of fiscal 1995 when sales increased 15% compared with the previous year. Ballard had described fiscal 1994 as a "difficult year in some respects". Sales were flat compared with 1993, partly because of the decision in mid-1994 to restructure the company's distribution system shifting from specialty dealers to larger, general line dealers.</p>
