<p>Talks on the third stage of German healthcare reform opened in Bonn this month, as Health Minister Horst Seehofer seeks to show that he is not forcing through measures without proper consultation. However, doctors (meeting on January 10th-11th) and Krankenkassen (January 12th-13th) had notably differing views on how reform should progress.</p><p>Doctors are most dissatisfied with budget-capping of public health expenditure. Although capping was introduced as a temporary measure from 1993 to the end of 1995, the success it has had in turning huge Krankenkassen deficits into surpluses has led doctors to suspect that Mr Seehofer would like to keep the system.</p><p>feeding the fear</p><p>The Minister has fed these fears, stressing before the talks that if there is no <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> for reform then budget-capping will indeed be continued. Moreover, his avowed intention to stabilise health insurance premiums would by definition maintain capping as Krankenkassen income, and therefore spending, would be limited.</p><p>Hans-Jurgen Thomas, chairman of the Hartmannbund, Germany's largest doctors' union, claims that continued budget-capping will reduce the quality of healthcare and lead to a two-tier system. He also stressed that demographic developments, not medical technology as is often claimed, will be the main cost driver for healthcare in the future. He calls for a return to the original principles of individual responsibility, subsidiarity and solidarity to define which services doctors and Krankenkassen should offer.</p><p>bureaucratic rot</p><p>The Krankenkassen, according to Ersatzkassen head Karl Kaula, are primarily concerned with securing a competent, humane, efficient and high-quality healthcare system for insured people. However, this can only be achieved if the increase in bureaucracy within the system is halted, he says.</p><p>The Ersatzkassen want "deregulation through competition" - the freedom to draw up contracts for individual healthcare providers, so tailoring insurance packages to the demands of members and the capabilities of particular hospitals and doctors. Competition has already been improved by the Risk Compensation Act and freedom of movement between Krankenkassen; now the next step must be taken, says Dr Kaula.</p><p>The Ortskrankenkassen also suggested a scheme designed to reduce attendance at specialist doctors' practices. Insurance premiums would be reduced by 20% for people who agreed always to visit their general practitioner in the first instance. Dr Thomas agreed that this was worth looking into, but the major doctor's administrative organisation, the KZBV, rejected it.</p><p>The next talks will be with hospital representatives, on January 31st and February 1st.</p>
