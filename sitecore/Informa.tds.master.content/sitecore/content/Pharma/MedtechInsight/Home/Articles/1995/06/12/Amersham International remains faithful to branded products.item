<p>Despite product setbacks during fiscal 1995, UK nuclear medicine specialist Amersham International continues to base future growth expectations on its higher-margin, branded imaging products. Such growth is reliant on regulatory progress and the successful exploitation of its marketing and distribution formulas, says CEO Bill Castell.</p><p>In fiscal 1995 ended March, Amersham reported 3% higher sales at &pound;333.6 million ($534 million) which is no improvement on a disappointing first half (see Clinica No 630, p 12). The company stressed improved profitability - operating profits were up 10% and net profits were 7% higher at &pound;30.7 million.</p><p>Amersham's sales growth stemmed mainly from its healthcare business, a fact attributed by the company to the inclusion of a full year of sales of Metastron, the pain palliative agent for bone metastases, and the launch of Myoview, the technetium-based cardiac imaging agent, in Japan and Europe. Within healthcare, sales growth was entirely due to the branded products as Amersham's non-branded healthcare sales, consisting mostly of diagnostic commodity products, rose only 1% to &pound;78.8 million.</p><p>Myoview had sales of &pound;5 million in fiscal 1995. The product, which was submitted to the US FDA in mid-1993, is still awaiting approval. This would open a market worth an estimated $200 million, 60% of the worldwide total. Amersham expects Japanese approval for its ready-to-use version of Myoview for mid-1996.</p><p>Ceretec, the brain and white blood cell imaging agent, had sales of &pound;23.6 million, down 11% on the previous year. This is worse than the 6% fall seen in the first half and reflects the launch in Europe, Japan and the US of DuPont Merck's Neurolite, a competitor product in some diagnostic applications. In April, a stabilised version of Ceretec was approved by the FDA as well as its use for leucocyte labelling (see Clinica No 650/51, p 28). Ceretec is in clinical trials to demonstrate its use in epilepsy, Alzheimer's, depression, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and appendicitis, the company says. Imaging R&D is directed at hypoxia for cancer and heart disease, thrombus diagnosis and neuro receptors.</p><pre>Amersham's annual results (&pound; million) Sales Operating profit (loss) 1995 % change 1995 1994 Healthcare 127.9 7% 13.7 9.4 Life Science 148.3 0% 33.4 31.2 Industrial Quality & Safety Assurance 49.5 2% 5.2 6.7 Environmental Assays 3.8 -10% (1.4) (1.8) Clinical Reagents 4.1 -11% 2.9 3.5 Unallocated costs (6.2) (5.7) Total 333.6 3% 47.6 43.3 (ended Mar 31st)</pre><p>Amersham has been busy improving its distribution channels. In Japan, it struck a partnership with Sumitomo when it acquired a 20% stake in Nihon Medi-Physics last December (see Clinica No 625, p 1). In North America, the company established an exclusive distribution network for the Medi-Physics product line, incorporating the radiopharmacies of Mallinckrodt Diagnostic Imaging Service and a number of other independent radiopharmacies.</p><p>Sales of Nihon Medi-Physics in 1994 were &yen;2,900 million ($264 million), up 11% on the previous year, with a net income of Yen2,300 million.</p><p>life sciences acquisitions</p><p>Amersham is looking closely at one of DuPont's business units which is for sale (see Clinica No 656, p 11). New England Nuclear, with $110 million turnover in 1994, is a major competitor in the life sciences field. However, for Amersham a purchase would be "like going back into the past", says finance director Kirk Stephenson.</p><p>In its attempt to expand its life sciences techniques, Amersham has most recently purchased the assets of the reagents business of Biological Detection Systems, a development-stage company in Pittsburgh, US, for &pound;4.1 million. This will add labelling with fluorescence and high-performance dyes to Amersham's arsenal.</p>
