<p>Surgeons at Stanford University have used a revolutionary port-access heart surgery technique to perform a bypass graft. The minimally invasive technique has been developed by Stanford physicians and Redwood City, California-based Heartport. The procedure uses entry ports between the ribs, special instruments and a 3-D imaging system. Although minimally invasive CABG has been attempted in the past, this is the first technique to overcome the challenge of stopping the heart without performing a thoracotomy.</p>

<p>Surgeons at Stanford University have used a revolutionary port-access heart surgery technique to perform a bypass graft. The minimally invasive technique has been developed by Stanford physicians and Redwood City, California-based Heartport. The procedure uses entry ports between the ribs, special instruments and a 3-D imaging system. Although minimally invasive CABG has been attempted in the past, this is the first technique to overcome the challenge of stopping the heart without performing a thoracotomy.</p><p>Port-access CABG offers the possibility of less traumatic bypass surgery, which normally involves sawing the breastbone in half and cracking open the ribs to give access to the heart, which should reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the open technique. Heartport's CEO Dr Wes Sterman says the technique could shorten hospitalisation from an average of five days to two and return to work from one to two weeks instead of the usual six. The average hospital stay for US bypass patients is 12.3 days.</p><p>Heartport plans a second phase, including several hundred patients, at leading US cardiovascular centres, if an initial series of 10 patients treated at Stanford proves successful. The port-access surgery can also be applied to other cardiac procedures, including valve repair and replacement. Around 468,000 CABG procedures were carried out in 1992 in the US, according to the American Heart Foundation.</p><p>Heartport was founded in 1991 by Dr Sterman and former chief resident in cardiothoracic surgery at Stanford, Dr John Stevens. The privately held company has since raised over $20 million in venture capital funding.</p>
