<p>Amanda Maxwell went to Athens to find out how the latest in telematics can help the European devices sector. The organisers could hardly have chosen a better location for the Second EUROMEDIES Workshop held on September 8th and 9th. Meeting in Vouliagmeni, southern Athens, delegates shrugged off their grey suits of Brussels, London and Frankfurt and their bureaucratic reserve, to embrace their colleagues with a southern European warmth. The atmosphere was conducive to open discussion, and many issues were clarified in the pool under the setting sun.</p>

<p>Amanda Maxwell went to Athens to find out how the latest in telematics can help the European devices sector. The organisers could hardly have chosen a better location for the Second EUROMEDIES Workshop held on September 8th and 9th. Meeting in Vouliagmeni, southern Athens, delegates shrugged off their grey suits of Brussels, London and Frankfurt and their bureaucratic reserve, to embrace their colleagues with a southern European warmth. The atmosphere was conducive to open discussion, and many issues were clarified in the pool under the setting sun.</p><p>The urgent and growing need for better communication within the European medical devices sector is linked to the increasing number of companies that are CE-marking their products and are covered by the reporting requirements of the medical devices Directives. By mid-1998, all manufacturers of medical devices (with the exception of IVDs) will need to meet these requirements. This means that thousands of reports will be travelling between 17 EEA countries encompassing some 13 languages. Some sort of standardisation is needed now to ensure efficient communication and to create an effective database.</p><p>Data exchange is required for three purposes under the medical device Directives, Norbert Anselmann, head of the European Commission's medical device sector within DG III, explained: vigilance (post-market surveillance); registration; and information exchange between Notified Bodies.</p><p>Mr Anselmann stressed that a well co-ordinated and structured vigilance communication system is vital to detect emerging problems. Only through a centralised structure can similar incidents be correlated across Europe and similar devices tracked. Decentralisation, or lack of standardisation, would hamper such trend analysis, he emphasised.</p><p>Vigilance reports, however, have to be handled carefully since the information can be sensitive and pose a threat to a company in the wrong hands. One of the tasks of EUROMEDIES (see opposite) has been to identify all the participants in the network and to establish what type of information they should have access to and when. It may be necessary to have data in various databases to cope with the security issues, Inbit, the Greek Institute of Biomedical Technology that is co-ordinating the Euromedies programme, has concluded, with one "trusted centre" holding data on authorised network users and on all medical devices.</p><p>The type of incidents that need reporting under the Directives' vigilance requirements is still a matter of debate. Larry Kessler, director of the Office of Surveillance and Biometrics at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health demonstrated how the CDRH has been so swamped by over-reporting that it has developed an automated screening system to filter reports and detect emerging problems more easily.</p><p>Europe is also aware of the danger of over-reporting. Victoria Dedrick, technical director of industry association EUCOMED, was unable to attend the meeting but sent the message that her association considered "less is more" and "more is less" - in other words that the system will work more efficiently, be more timely, more accurate, more secure and cost-effective if only those data required by the Directive are included in the Community- wide system.</p><p>User reporting to the Competent Authority was generally viewed as complementary to manufacturer reporting, although the lack of means to compel users to report to the manufacturer in many countries was regarded as a weakness in the system.</p><p>With respect to registration under the Medical Devices Directive, manufacturers of Class I and custom-made devices or in clinical investigations are required to notify the EEA Competent Authority where the it (or its authorised representative) has its registered place of business. The company must give its address and a description of the devices. Furthermore, once the IVD Directive comes into force, manufacturers of "new" IVDs will also need to comply with this requirement. The regulatory authorities in other Member States will have access to this information "on request".</p><p>Several Member States, such as Spain, are concerned that these registration conditions will not be adequate for them to trace quickly devices on their markets in the event of incidents, and are therefore developing their own registration databases for devices in Classes II and III. Others, such as the Netherlands, are remaining in line with the Directive, but monitoring whether more extensive registration may become necessary.</p><p>The third area where data transfer is needed is communication between Notified Bodies which need to exchange and request data about certificates granted, refused or withdrawn.</p><p>rights of access</p><p>The extent to which each of the players - Commission, Competent Authorities, Notified Bodies and manufacturers - should have access to each of the three information types was debated at the conference and has been the subject of much research within EUROMEDIES.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of EUCOMED, Philippe Verdonck, group manager of European standards and technical affairs at Baxter World Trade, stated that manufacturers are more co-operative when their information is being treated confidentially. They oppose the distribution of incident information beyond the first Competent Authority involved until there has been an investigation.</p><p>Representatives of the Notified Bodies want to be kept better informed. David Marshall, industry sector specialist for medical devices at BSI, complained that the Notified Body involved in the auditing of a device which is then the subject of an incident report is not kept updated.</p><p>Commission expert Maurice Freeman pointed out that the Commission's vigilance guidelines say the Notified Body may be involved, but only has right of access to the final report. If there is no need for action, then there is no necessity for the Notified Body to become involved. Moreover, restricting initial incident reporting to one Competent Authority would obviate the need for input into a European database until the final report stage, Carl Wallroth, general manager at Dragerwerk, suggested. If the final reports were regarded as non-proprietary, confidentiality and security problems would be solved.</p><p>Fritz de Ranitz, of TNO (the Netherlands), appealed for greater information support for Notified Bodies, who have just three official group meetings a year. He called for a European database to be set up which could be fed with questions and answers from Notified Bodies and reviewed by the Competent Authorities and Commission. His request was shared by Mads Frellsen, medical devices expert at the Danish National Board of Health.</p><p>a world solution</p><p>Improved and standardised communication in Europe will ultimately result in better links with the rest of the world, since the European regulatory system is of increasing interest to the international community. The European Union is on the point of signing a mutual recognition agreement with Australia which will bring it into the EEA's reporting network, while mutual recognition negotiations have started with Canada, New Zealand, the US, Japan and Switzerland, Mr Anselmann told delegates.</p><p>The global harmonisation task force under Dr Larry Kessler, will explore the types of incidents which should be reported worldwide, and establish some rules for balanced judgement of what should be transferrable and reported. An international vigilance network is particularly important to countries such as Australia, Derrick Beech, director of the Therapeutics Devices Branch of the Therapeutics Goods Administration, explained: some 80% of their device needs are imported.</p><p>The opportunity is there to have global communication on medical device vigilance before the end of the decade. The repercussions of a medical device alert will be swift and radical.</p>
