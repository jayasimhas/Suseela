<p>Academic independence and transparency of methods must be guaranteed if outcomes research is to have any credibility, according to the US Task Force on Principles for Economic Analysis of Health Care Technology. But the industry-funded group's findings have been heavily criticised for playing into the hands of the manufacturers</p><p>The task force recommends that the research community polices itself but is adamant about the importance of independence. "We really felt the need to spell this out," says Dr Alan Hillman, leader of the task force and director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics' Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>The lack of <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on methodology is a major handicap and can expose research to accusations of prejudice, says the team. Outcomes studies should publish all the assumptions underlying their calculations to combat any bias that different economic models might introduce. The task force's recommendations are published in a position paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine (Volume 122, p 61-70). The main points are:</p><p>*Protocols should be specified in detail and agreed by both researchers and sponsors before the study begins. *Control of the study's conduct, analysis, and interpretation should pass to the researcher once work begins. *Sponsors should not withdraw support for a study because of unfavourable interim data and researchers should not agree to produce "early looks". *Investigators should not be rewarded beyond the real cost of the project. *All research findings, including assumptions and methods, should be made available to the public.</p><p>the milkman's horse</p><p>"Who is to enforce the rules and how?" asks Dr Robert Evans of the Centre for Health Services and Policy Research at the University of British Columbia, Canada. The task force has found procedural answers to a structural problem, he says in a highly critical accompanying editorial. Researchers know what sponsors want to hear and what will affect the probability of future research money. "The milkman's horse does not need to be told where to stop."</p><p>The task force, which was set up four years ago in response to concern about bias in research, is funded by a coalition of drug companies. Government and other agencies, such as care managers, declined to participate. Did they hold back because they saw no benefit? asks Dr Evans. "Pharmaco-economics is a pseudo science, conjured into existence by the magic of money at a time when the rules of healthcare purchasing are changing. There were no formal guidelines before it emerged and nothing in the task force report suggests that guidelines will help now."</p>
