<p>The US FDA remains unconvinced that silicone gel-filled breast implants are safe. Although there is no hard evidence that the products cause autoimmune diseases or rheumatologic disorders, the agency is strictly limiting use of the implants. They may be given only as part of clinical trials, for reconstructive surgery and a few augmentative procedures. Last Tuesday, Congress wanted to know why. Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller, reports from the August 1st House hearings on Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>The US FDA remains unconvinced that silicone gel-filled breast implants are safe. Although there is no hard evidence that the products cause autoimmune diseases or rheumatologic disorders, the agency is strictly limiting use of the implants. They may be given only as part of clinical trials, for reconstructive surgery and a few augmentative procedures. Last Tuesday, Congress wanted to know why. Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller, reports from the August 1st House hearings on Capitol Hill.</p><p>The human resources & intergovernmental relations subcommittee and national economic growth, natural resources & regulatory affairs subcommittee (both panels of the House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight) held a joint hearing to explore silicone implants in particular and FDA device regulation in general. Members were not sympathetic to the agency's contentions that studies still do not answer all their questions, such as the implant rupture rate or the consequences of such rupture.</p><p>"A number of scientific studies have put to rest many of the outstanding safety issues," claimed Edolphus Towns (D-NY). "It is impossible to expect [a product to be] completely risk- free." But that is what the FDA wants, he continued: "This agency is tremendously risk-averse." Human resources subcommittee chairman Christopher Shays (R-CT) told CDRH director Bruce Burlington: "Your attitude convinces me we'll get nowhere." Most of the 16 witnesses agreed. Two had specific concerns about the FDA's use of advisory committees.</p><p>In late 1991, the agency's General & Plastic Surgery Devices Panel considered silicone-gel applications from four manufacturers. "The purpose of the panel," Commissioner Kessler said last week, "was to advise FDA as to what we could tell the public about the safety and effectiveness of these medical devices."</p><p>Dr Kessler claims that the experts concluded there were insufficient data about the risks and benefits. The panel agreed with the assessment of FDA scientists that the clinical data provided in the applications were not adequate to allay safety concerns. According to Dr Kessler, they recommended that silicone gel-filled breast implants continue to be available under specified conditions and that a patient registry be established while manufacturers collect additional data. They also urged the FDA to hold manufacturers accountable for collecting the additional data without delay.</p><p>Elizabeth Connell, chairman of that panel, remembers things differently. "We did not find the data adequate for approval," she told the subcommittees. "However, it is absolutely critical to point out ... that this in no way was a statement by the panel that these devices were unsafe or that they posed a threat to the women who were wearing them .... As to our second mandate - the public health need - we unanimously agreed that there was [such a need]; we felt that there was ample evidence that silicone breast implants were of significant importance to both augmentation and reconstruction patients."</p><p>Based on this, the FDA requested a voluntary moratorium on use of the implants pending evaluation of "new evidence". That comprised "anecdotal series from physicians ... their views were widely known, and much of it was from plaintiff lawyers", said John Sergent, Vanderbilt University professor & chief of medicine at St Thomas Hospital. These attorneys continue to keep the silicone debate alive, Prof Sergent charged. "From a scientific standpoint, I believe the issue is closed." The FDA's actions on silicone "have had effects that go far beyond the issue of silicone implants".</p><p>The agency did have its defenders at last week's hearing - University of Tennessee pathologist <strong>[C#200200903:Douglas]</strong> Shanklin testified that, after studying human tissues for almost ten years, "my experience tells me that silicone devices are not inert in the human body, that gel-filled ones leak and rupture with profound pathological and immunological consequences, that women can and do die from effects of their implants."</p><p>Sybil Goldrich, co-founder of an advocacy group for women with breast implants, claimed that leaking silicone gel in her body required "a total abdominal hysterectomy, bi-lateral salpingo- oophorectomy and liver biopsy with silicone detected in representative slides of my uterus, ovaries and liver. I have had five tumours removed from my ankle, thigh and wrist."</p><p><strong>[C#198600926:Mentor]</strong> and McGhan Medical - the two remaining US silicone-breast implant producers - must complete long-term FDA-required studies. Mentor currently has 1,400 surgeons participating and 14,000 women enrolled in its study, Dr Kessler told the subcommittees. He was uncertain whether McGhan's study is still running.</p><p>"Once data on the rupture are submitted, I think we can act within months," the Commissioner said, since "some very significant" facts on the rupture rate have appeared in recent published studies. However, it will take several years to generate the other information requested.</p><p>The subcommittees are not finished with silicone breast implants. Mr Shays says they plan a follow-up hearing which Dr Kessler will again be requested to attend.</p>
