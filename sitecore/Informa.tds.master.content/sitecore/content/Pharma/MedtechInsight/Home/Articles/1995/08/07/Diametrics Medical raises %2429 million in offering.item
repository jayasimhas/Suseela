<p>Blood gas diagnostics developer Diametrics Medical sold three million shares in a public offering last week raising $29 million. The shares were priced at $10.50, some 10% below the $11.75 closing price of Diametrics shares on Nasdaq on August 1st, the day before the placing.</p><p>Diametrics' point-of-care blood gas product, Irma, comprises an analyser and disposable cartridges. Several blood tests can be performed simultaneously with results available within two minutes. In April last year, Irma was launched in the US and two months later Diametrics floated at a price of $6 a share. By June 1995, it had placed 273 systems with 153 customers in the US. Also in June, Diametrics expanded Irma's menu with a new electrolyte cartridge measuring sodium, potassium and ionised calcium (see Clinica No 659, p 22).</p><p>The proceeds from the offering will be used to expand sales and marketing; increase manufacturing capacity; and fund additional R&D to expand the menu of tests. In the last quarter of this year, Diametrics plans to add haematocrit to the electrolyte cartridge. Irma will then be able to perform 95% of the stat blood tests routinely performed in the US each year - a market which Diametrics estimates at $1,700 million.</p><p>The company is working to develop test sensors for blood urea nitrogen, glucose and chloride and expects to submit 510(k) applications with respect to each of these tests during 1996.</p><p>Diametrics' main competitor in the US market is I-Stat's portable point-of-care blood analysis system. However, Diametrics believes that Irma has "distinct competitive advantages including ease of use, closed instead of open handling of blood samples and the ability to be easily connected to a hospital's laboratory or information system". Two other competitors cited in Diametrics' prospectus as marketing stand-alone point-of-care blood gas systems are AVL Scientific, the US subsidiary of Austrian company AVL List, and Cirrus Medical, owned by Diagnostic Products.</p>
