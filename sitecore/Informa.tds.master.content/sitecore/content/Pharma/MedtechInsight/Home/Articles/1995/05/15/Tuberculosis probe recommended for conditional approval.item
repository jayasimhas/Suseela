<p>Gen-Probe's amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) Test received a conditional approval recommendation from the US FDA's Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel on May 2nd. Seven panel members recommended that the data be restratified to allow further subgroup analysis prior to approval, while three members advised against approval based on the current data.</p>

<p>Gen-Probe's amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) Test received a conditional approval recommendation from the US FDA's Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel on May 2nd. Seven panel members recommended that the data be restratified to allow further subgroup analysis prior to approval, while three members advised against approval based on the current data.</p><p>The product includes reagents for the amplification of mycobacterial rRNA and a fluorescent probe to detect the polynucleotide. The assay is intended to be used in conjunction with sputum smears and other studies for the earlier diagnosis of tuberculosis.</p><p>Data supporting use of the product included results on 6,079 sputum specimens taken from 2,609 patients at six centres. Patients were categorised according to TB risk based on the American Thoracic Society's classification. The assay had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 97%, positive predictive value of 81% and negative predictive value of 98%.</p><p>Panel discussion focused on determining patient subpopulations and conditions for which the assay was clinically beneficial. Most members thought the assay would be useful for ruling out false positive sputum tests caused by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria in patients who were not taking antituberculosis drugs. Dr Kadree said the test would be useful to her when a smear was negative for TB but she strongly suspected an infection and did not want to wait 4-6 weeks for culture results.</p><p>Dr Gordin, one of three physicians opposing approval based on the current data, said: "I don't think this is going to be aiding physicians in the treatment of tuberculosis ... because of design problems, questions about reliability .... I don't see a (need) in approving this."</p>
