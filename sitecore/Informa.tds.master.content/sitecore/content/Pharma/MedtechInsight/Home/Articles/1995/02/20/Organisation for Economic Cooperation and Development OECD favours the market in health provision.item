<p>A greater reliance on market mechanisms is the most effective way to increase the efficiency of healthcare delivery in developed countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In "Healthcare Reform - Controlling Spending and Increasing Efficiency", the OECD argues that "the key to improving efficiency - at least in the hospital sector - lies in improving incentives through a better market structure and contract relations between payers (insurers) and providers".</p>

<p>A greater reliance on market mechanisms is the most effective way to increase the efficiency of healthcare delivery in developed countries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In "Healthcare Reform - Controlling Spending and Increasing Efficiency", the OECD argues that "the key to improving efficiency - at least in the hospital sector - lies in improving incentives through a better market structure and contract relations between payers (insurers) and providers".</p><p>Drawing in particular on reforms under way in the UK, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, the OECD notes that the main elements of successful reform are:</p><p>* Payers taking on the role of purchasers, acting as the patient's agent in ensuring the availability of high-quality, cost-effective healthcare</p><p>* Competitive markets for healthcare provision with contracts containing incentives for providers to improve efficiency</p><p>* Greater hospital management independence</p><p>* Contract monitoring by purchasers to place ongoing pressure on providers to improve the quality and quantity of care while reducing costs.</p><p>Effective competition would reveal over-supply of hospital beds, as well as permitting more realistic pricing practices to develop. Similar principles could be used in the ambulatory sector to design more appropriate payment arrangements for primary care doctors, the OECD believes.</p><p>The administrative costs of healthcare tend to be lower in countries such as the UK and Canada which finance and provide most of their care within the public sector or through single- payer systems. Costs are highest in insurance-based systems such as the US, Germany and France.</p><p>Highlighting the significant inter-country variations in health expenditure across its 24 member states, the OECD finds only a "very weak association" between overall health spending and indicators of health outcomes.</p><pre>Total spending on healthcare as % of GDP OECD countries 1990 1992 US 12.4 14.0 Japan 6.6 6.9 Germany 8.3 8.7 France 8.9 9.4 Italy 8.1 8.5 UK 6.2 7.1 Canada 9.4 10.2 Australia 8.2 8.8 Austria 8.4 8.8 Belgium 7.6 8.2 Denmark 6.3 6.5 Finland 8.0 9.4 Greece 5.3 5.4 Iceland 8.2 8.5 Ireland 7.0 7.1 Luxembourg 7.2 7.4 Netherlands 8.2 8.6 New Zealand 7.3 7.7 Norway 7.5 8.3 Portugal 5.4 7.0 Spain 6.6 7.0 Sweden 8.6 7.9 Switzerland 8.4 9.3 Turkey 4.0 4.1 Source: OECD</pre><p>new technology</p><p>Much new medical technology has been accepted without appropriate evaluation and greater coherence is needed in this area. Purchasers need to make clear that new technologies will be purchased only where there are obvious therapeutic and/or cost advantages, according to the OECD. Governments must ensure that appropriate cost-benefit tests are carried out, it urges.</p><p>cost-sharing</p><p>It seems plausible that "a significant and across-the-board" increase in cost-sharing could have an important effect on healthcare demand. However, the impact of higher user fees appears to be relatively greater at lower levels of income. In a Canadian study, cost-sharing reduced the probability of seeking care for children of low-income families by 40%.</p><p>In order to minimise the risks associated with this system, the OECD argues that the degree of cost-sharing need not be the same for all areas of health provision. Distinctions may be made between the "care" and "cure" aspects of healthcare and insurers can limit coverage for those medical procedures which "objectively do not appear to have a significant impact on health outcomes", the OECD recommends.</p>
