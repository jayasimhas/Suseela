<p>The US FDA Center for Devices & Radiological Health is considering regulating antibody-based diagnostics as Class II devices to close an apparent loophole in current regulations. This is expected to add as much as $40,000 and two years to development costs for a single reagent. In response, manufacturers are considering discontinuing marginally profitable items, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p>

<p>The US FDA Center for Devices & Radiological Health is considering regulating antibody-based diagnostics as Class II devices to close an apparent loophole in current regulations. This is expected to add as much as $40,000 and two years to development costs for a single reagent. In response, manufacturers are considering discontinuing marginally profitable items, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>At present, antibody-based diagnostics are in Class III, which allows shipment of some unapproved products for research. The FDA is accusing industry of using this loophole to avoid regulation, shipping the diagnostics widely for general use. In trying to tighten up on regulation of the manufacturers, the FDA alarmed pathologists who use immunohistochemical (IHC) reagents with other in vitro tests (eg histopathology or cytopathology) to confirm diagnoses and delineate subgroups of cancerous tissues.</p><p>The specialists petitioned the FDA to designate the diagnostics Class II devices "as a realistic mechanism ... to maintain the availability of IHC reagents for clinical use". An agency advisory group - with many pathologist members - echoed their recommendation last October.</p><p>The physicians' intentions were very "well-meaning", says Peter Takes, clinical trials co-ordinator at Sigma BioSciences and co-chair of the Joint Council of Immunohistochemical Stain Manufacturers (JCIM). But, he charges, the FDA misled doctors at that meeting and elsewhere, telling them Class III devices are never moved to the least-regulated Class I: "that's just false." JCIM wants this latter designation; the FDA could then decide whether to waive all regulation (except good manufacturing practice standards) for the reagents.</p><p>complaints about panel meeting</p><p>Device-law expert Jeffrey Gibbs agrees: "I believe many of these products belong in Class I." As for the advisory committee meeting, Mr Gibbs wrote to the Office of Device Evaluation director Susan Alpert on behalf of several manufacturers complaining that the "panel meeting was both procedurally and substantially flawed .... The flaws are serious enough to require that the panel's recommendations be invalidated." Mr Gibbs' complaints have been "referred", Dr Alpert says, and the agency is "still considering" reclassification of the diagnostics.</p><p>A proposal is expected to be published "in the near to intermediate future" - three to four months, says Steven Gutman, acting director of the division of clinical laboratory devices. "We intend to regulate them as Class II, tier I products" - slightly less burdensome than standard Class II regulations. This constitutes "a little compromise", says JCIM's Mr Takes, but he adds: "I would have to see more details .. I think there needs to be a clear definition of what those tiers are and what's involved with each."</p><p>Sigma is already reviewing its product line "determining what is cost effective for us to keep," according to Mr Takes. Another company, he notes, "has set up an arbitrary cut off - if a product does not generate $10,000 in sales in a year, they will stop selling that product."</p>
