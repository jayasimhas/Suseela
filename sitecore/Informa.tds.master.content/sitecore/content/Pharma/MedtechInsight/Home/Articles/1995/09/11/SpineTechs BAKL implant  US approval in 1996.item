<p>US approval of Spine-Tech's BAK/L lower spinal implant is hoped for next year by CEO David Stassen. A PMA for the implant was submitted in January this year and amended in May.</p><p>Smith & Nephew, which licensed international rights to the BAK/L implant in 1993, has begun limited sales in certain markets. It accounted for 41% of Spine-Tech's 1994 sales, which totalled $4.4 million, and 65% of first-half 1995 sales of $3.3 million. Spine-Tech currently markets the Cervi-Lok, an implantable plate and screw system for cervical spine use, as well as a number of minimally-invasive surgical instruments for spinal conditions, including degenerative disc disease.</p><p>Patient enrolment has begun in US trials with Spine-Tech's BAK/C and BAK/T implants, for use in the upper and middle spine respectively. Spine-Tech licenses a patent covering key aspects of the design of the BAK implants - titanium alloy cylinders threaded to the outside surface of the spine - from Karlin Technology. According to the prospectus for Spine-Tech's initial public offering, Karlin has filed suit against the company, alleging its right to co-license the technology to a third party and also patent ownership. Spine-Tech says that it is not contesting the granting of a co-licence for the technology to a competitor, Sofamor Danek. In June, Spine-Tech received a purported notice of termination of its licence. A trial date has been set for next month.</p><p>The Karlin technology is also the subject of a complaint by Surgical Dynamics against Karlin and Sofamor Danek for declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, unenforceability and non-infringement, the prospectus notes.</p><p>The recent IPO of 3.2 million shares at $9 each raised proceeds of $26 million net, for funding of R&D, sales and marketing activities. By August 31st, Spine-Tech shares had risen 60% to $14.50. In addition to the Smith & Nephew agreement, Minnesota-based Spine-Tech is collaborating with Ethicon Endo-Surgery (Johnson & Johnson) on surgical tool development, laparoscopic fusion R&D and clinical education.</p><pre>Spine-Tech 1995 first-half results Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 1.71 1.10 (0.09) (0.08) 6 months 3.27 2.02 (0.19) (0.16) (ended June 30th)</pre>
