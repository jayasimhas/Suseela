<p>Protocol Systems' (US) new Propaq portable monitor has several new additional features for bedside use and more demanding medical and surgical procedures. The Propaq Encore, which the company plans to begin shipping in June following US FDA clearance, features a new electroluminescent screen which provides more detailed display of waveforms, additional vital signs measurement and simpler operation of the most frequently-used functions.</p>

<p>Protocol Systems' (US) new Propaq portable monitor has several new additional features for bedside use and more demanding medical and surgical procedures. The Propaq Encore, which the company plans to begin shipping in June following US FDA clearance, features a new electroluminescent screen which provides more detailed display of waveforms, additional vital signs measurement and simpler operation of the most frequently-used functions.</p><p>In addition to adult and paediatric monitoring, the new system is capable of monitoring neonates, although approval for this application is likely to come in the autumn. This represents Protocol's entry into a market worth around $100 million worldwide. The system features apnoea impedance respiration monitoring as well as five-lead ECG, non-invasive and invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, capnography and temperature monitoring.</p><p>Like the Propaq 100 monitors, the Encore is designed to be moved easily with the patient as he/she is transferred between hospital departments. The new system also connects with the Flexible Monitoring system which links Propaq monitors to the Acuity central monitoring station. This is achieved using telephone jacks installed next to each bed. Software to connect the Encore system to Acuity will be available in the fourth quarter of 1995, according to the company. Protocol installed the first Acuity system in the UK at the pilot trauma centre of North Staffordshire Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, in December.</p><p>Costs associated with preparing for the introduction of Encore increased R&D expenditure to $1.69 million in the first quarter, up from $1.11 million in the same period last year. First-quarter turnover was up 12% to $10.18 million with net income down 22% to $0.50 million. Domestic sales were up 20%.</p>
