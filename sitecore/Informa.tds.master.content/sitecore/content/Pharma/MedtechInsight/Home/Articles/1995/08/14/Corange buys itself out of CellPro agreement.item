<p>Corange has bought its way out of a 1993 stem cell alliance with CellPro in a $30 million stock and supply rights deal. Corange will pay $30 million for one million shares of CellPro stock and non-exclusive, worldwide rights to the Ceprate system() for gene therapy. Other diagnostic and therapeutic rights that were transferred to Corange under the 1993 deal will be returned to CellPro.</p><p>The original $220 million research agreement drew considerable criticism from Kurt Engelhorn's supporters during his recent boardroom coup and could well be the price paid for his return to the helm of Corange. The deal had been in doubt since April, when Corange told CellPro it was unenforceable and contravened European anti-trust laws (see Clinica No 649, p 14).</p><p>CellPro's Ceprate found not to infringe US patients</p><p>CellPro's Ceprate stem cell and laboratory cell systems do not infringe US patents held by Johns Hopkins University and licensed to Baxter and <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong>. The US District Court of Delaware found in favour of CellPro in the case filed by Johns Hopkins in March last year (see Clinica No 595, p 12). CellPro will now pursue its antitrust and unfair competition claims which had been deferred pending completion of the patent trial.</p>
