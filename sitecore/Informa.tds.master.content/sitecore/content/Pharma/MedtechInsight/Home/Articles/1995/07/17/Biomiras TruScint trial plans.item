<p>Canadian biotechnology company Biomira expects to begin a Phase III trial with its Tru-Scint radioimmunoimaging antibody shortly for the diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer. The trial will involve about 100 patients at up to ten centres in the US.</p><p>A Phase III trial with Tru-Scint in ovarian cancer is also expected to begin this year. Biomira is awaiting results from a Phase II trial in colorectal cancer. The formulation of Tru-Scint will be a photo-activated, lyophilised compound, the firm's annual report notes.</p><p>Biomira Diagnostics, which was formed after the acquisition of ADI Diagnostics, had product sales of Can$3.9 million ($3 million) in 1994, up 9% on the previous year. Its product line includes assays for infectious diseases, viral serology, autoimmune disorders and oncology. The Truquant BR immunoassay blood test kit for detecting recurrent breast cancer is under expedited review by the US FDA, as is a syphilis antibody test kit, which is expected to be launched in the US this year.</p><p>During 1994, Biomira Diagnostics restructured its sales and marketing force and expanded its distribution network through agreements with Organon Teknika (for syphilis testing products) and Kodak (for Truquant in Germany). Biomira reported total sales of Can$6.9 million last year, up 51% on 1993, and a net loss of Can$17 million (Can$21 million in 1993).</p>
