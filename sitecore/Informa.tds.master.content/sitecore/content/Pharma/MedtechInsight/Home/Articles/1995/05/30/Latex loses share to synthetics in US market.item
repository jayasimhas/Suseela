However, the latex share of this market will fall from 90% to 83% over the same period as synthetic alternatives become more popular, says a new report from Frost and Sullivan.</p>

<p>The US market for disposable gloves and condoms is set to grow from $712.8 million in 1994 to over $1,000 million by 2001. However, the latex share of this market will fall from 90% to 83% over the same period as synthetic alternatives become more popular, says a new report from Frost and Sullivan.</p><p>Increased use of gloves in surgical and examination procedures has led to higher incidence of latex allergy and contact dermatitis, creating an emerging market for hypoallergenic, powder-free and synthetic alternatives to latex gloves. The market will experience an increasing shift to powder-free goods as well as the accelerated replacement of latex, says the report. The fastest growth in the disposable medical glove sector has been in doctors' offices and medical centres as the number of outpatient procedures rises.</p><p>Retail condom sales in the US have displayed only nominal growth, in contrast to the rapid acceleration in institutional distribution, caused by programmes offering low-cost or free condoms. The synthetic condom market has the potential to win end-users and gain "switchover customers", says the report, with manufacturers competing aggressively to develop synthetic products.</p><p>The overall glove and condom market will experience a compound annual growth rate of 7.2% to 2001. Revenue growth will fall from 10.6% in 1994 to just 3.7% in 2000, rising slightly after the turn of the century.</p><pre>Total disposable medical glove and condom market Year Revenues Revenue growth ($ millions) (%) 1995 712.8 10.6 1996 782.1 9.7 1997 856.8 9.5 1998 917.4 7.1 1999 969.6 5.7 2000 1,005.5 3.7 2001 1,046.1 4.0</pre><p>The report on the US disposable medical glove and condom markets, reference CBS537, price $1695 (US orders) and $1745 (orders outside the US), is available from Clinica Reports 18/20 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey TW10 6UA.
