<p>Condoms may only be marketed in France if they are subject to batch control by a Notified Body under the Medical Devices Directive, according to French condom standard NF S 97-031. In publishing its decree, the French government is the first to make use of the Medical Devices Directive's Safeguard clause - on the grounds of inadequate standards. The European Commission is currently reviewing the situation.</p>

<p>Condoms may only be marketed in France if they are subject to batch control by a Notified Body under the Medical Devices Directive, according to French condom standard NF S 97-031. In publishing its decree, the French government is the first to make use of the Medical Devices Directive's Safeguard clause - on the grounds of inadequate standards. The European Commission is currently reviewing the situation.</p><p>The French were prompted to introduce these measures, which will apply until March 17th, 1996, by the delay in the publication of prEN 600, the proposed European condom standard. The French authorities had contributed to the delay by voting against an earlier version of the standard, although they support the revised version due to be adopted in autumn.</p><p>The decree allows for batch control to any other foreign standard or regulations offering an equivalent level of safety as the French standard, subject to publication in the Journal officiel. There are no others available at present, but this clause will allow the European standard to be used as soon as it has been adopted and transposed as a national standard.</p><p>Companies must seek recognition of other standards or regulations by making an official request to the French standards organisation, Afnor, which will seek the opinion of the Industry Ministry. Applications must be in French and include the text of the standard or regulation.</p>
