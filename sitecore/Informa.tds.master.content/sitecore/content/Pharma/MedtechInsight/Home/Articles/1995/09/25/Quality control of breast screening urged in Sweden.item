<p>An integrated system of quality control is vital if the value of Sweden's national breast cancer screening programme is to be properly assessed, argue doctors from the University Hospital in Malmo and the National Board of Health and Welfare. "Results achieved by enthusiastic pioneers [of mass breast screening] are not always applicable to everyday clinical practice," they claim in Lakartidningen (Volume 92, No 35, 1995).</p>

<p>An integrated system of quality control is vital if the value of Sweden's national breast cancer screening programme is to be properly assessed, argue doctors from the University Hospital in Malmo and the National Board of Health and Welfare. "Results achieved by enthusiastic pioneers [of mass breast screening] are not always applicable to everyday clinical practice," they claim in Lakartidningen (Volume 92, No 35, 1995).</p><p>Summarising the results of two surveys of the breast cancer screening programme carried out in 1992 and 1994 in southern Sweden, the authors make a series of recommendations. They believe a national council should be set up to oversee the quality of mammography procedures nationwide, with a remit to ensure a high standard of training in all centres. Screening centres should aim for closer collaboration with their regional hospital oncology departments, while better communication between doctors and both radiologists and pathologists is needed, they maintain.</p><p>The surveys produced some significant regional variations. A lower proportion of eligible women came forward for screening in urban than in rural areas - 65% in Malmo city compared with 85% in Blekinge county. The incidence of diagnosed breast cancer also varied from 4.4 up to 11.4 per 1,000 screened women (an average of 7.5%). The unusually low level of 4.4/1,000 may reflect the fact that mammography was carried out more widely in some areas than others prior to the introduction of the national programme, the authors suggest.</p><p>mammography equipment</p><p>The average radiation dose to breast tissue varied among the 11 hospitals surveyed by a factor of 4.3 - "a significant difference, especially since each centre has sought to optimise its X-ray system". Partly to blame for this variation was the unnecessarily high image density used in some centres, in some cases due to excessively powerful light in the viewer, according to the authors. Variations in the film exposure systems used also led to differences in dose exposure.</p><p>Other problems identified included exceeding the recommended limits for the field of radiation on the chest wall and inadequate current in the X-ray tube giving rise to unacceptably long exposure times.</p><p>Some 600,000 women - four out of five of those eligible - are screened for breast cancer in Sweden annually.</p>
