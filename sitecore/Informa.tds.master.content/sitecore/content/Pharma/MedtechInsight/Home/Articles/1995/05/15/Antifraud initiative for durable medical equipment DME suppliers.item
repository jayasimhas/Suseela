<p>Durable medical equipment suppliers are prime targets for a major anti-fraud initiative involving the US Medicaid and Medicare programmes. President Clinton revealed the existence of the programme on May 3rd although the major partnership of federal and state agencies - Operation Restore Trust - has been quietly at work since February. Besides durable medical equipment suppliers, the programme is looking at home health agencies and nursing homes - three of the fastest-growing areas of Medicare.</p>

<p>Durable medical equipment suppliers are prime targets for a major anti-fraud initiative involving the US Medicaid and Medicare programmes. President Clinton revealed the existence of the programme on May 3rd although the major partnership of federal and state agencies - Operation Restore Trust - has been quietly at work since February. Besides durable medical equipment suppliers, the programme is looking at home health agencies and nursing homes - three of the fastest-growing areas of Medicare.</p><p>Recent reports and investigations by the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General and special initiatives by the Medicare and Medicaid funding agency, Health Care Financing Administration, show home healthcare and nursing facilities are particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse. The OIG says: "Suppliers of durable medical equipment are implicated in many of the abuses identified."</p><p>"This is the biggest Inspector General initiative I've seen," HHS IG June Gibbs Brown told reporters after the President's announcement. Some 135 of the OIG's 975 staff will work on "Operation Restore Trust". The Health Care Financing Administration, the Administration on Ageing and state personnel will also be part of an intergovernmental team for the project.</p><p>Durable medical equipment targeted will probably not be the most sophisticated, most expensive machines, but relatively small, simple products whose costs can soar in skilled nursing and home health settings. Successful recent investigations by the OIG involved respiratory therapy equipment, ventilation management products, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulators, orthotic bilateral contracture devices, surgical dressings, diagnostic test materials, decubitus ulcer kits and incontinence materials.</p><p>five states targeted</p><p>"Operation Restore Trust" will focus on five states that account for 40% of Medicare costs: Illinois, New York, Florida, Texas and California. At present, the project is seen as a two-year effort. Financial audits, criminal investigations and referrals to appropriate law enforcement officials, civil and administrative sanction and recovery actions, surveys and inspections of long-term care facilities, studies and recommendations to prevent fraud and reduce waste and abuse are planned.</p><p>The programme will also have three special projects: a fraud and waste report hotline for the public; voluntary disclosure for providers and companies (thereby averting treble damages and exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid participation); and issuance of Special Fraud Alerts to notify the public and healthcare community about the provision of home health services, nursing care and medical equipment and supplies. The first of these Alerts is expected in the next two weeks and the hotline should be operational by late May.</p><p>While many of these activities have been undertaken before, this is the first time a "strike team" of intergovernmental partners has been established, Ms Gibbs Brown said. Another novel aspect of the programme is its plan to use funds collected to continue and expand investigations. This would require congressional approval.</p>
