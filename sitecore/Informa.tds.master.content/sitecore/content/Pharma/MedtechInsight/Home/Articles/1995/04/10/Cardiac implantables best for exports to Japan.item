<p>Heart valves and cardiac pacemakers offer the easiest entry points for companies wishing to export medical equipment to Japan, as the country is almost entirely dependent on foreign products. However, medical tubes and catheters represent a far larger market, according to Koseisho, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (The Japan Medical Review, February 1995).</p><p>Imports of tubes and catheters totalled &yen;2,650 million ($950 million) in 1993, representing 67.3% of the domestic market. This sector is also experiencing strong growth (see Clinica No 626, pp 12-13). At Yen26,065 million, cardiac pacemaker imports accounted for 95.4% of consumption while heart valves, at Yen8,943 million, were wholly supplied by foreign manufacturers. More local competition was prevalent in diagnostic X-ray supplies, where imports accounted for only 13.6% of sales.</p><pre>Top ten Japanese medical device imports 1993 (Yen millions) Tubes and catheters 82,625 Artificial joints & bones 29,907 Cardiac pacemakers 26,065 X-ray apparatus 22,841 Diagnostic X-ray supplies 22,765 Infusion instruments 18,044 Clinical chemistry apparatus 15,397 CT and MRI scanners 14,803 Splints & bone plates 14,055 Heart valves 8,943 Source: Koseisho/Japan Medical Review</pre><p>Total medical device imports were Yen456,700 million (see Clinica Review, p 26).

An even greater share of production was exported in the endoscopy (58.2%) and diagnostic imaging (57.9%) markets.</p><pre>Top ten Japanese medical device exports 1993 (Yen millions) X-ray apparatus 48,665 Ultrasound scanners 48,319 Endoscopes 34,311 Haemodialysis equipment 24,140 Diagnostic X-ray supplies 21,332 Infusion instruments 16,365 Blood purifiers 10,516 Electromanometers 9,695 Injection & puncture devices 9,553 Magnetic induction apparatus 6,183 Source: Koseisho/Japan Medical Review</pre>
