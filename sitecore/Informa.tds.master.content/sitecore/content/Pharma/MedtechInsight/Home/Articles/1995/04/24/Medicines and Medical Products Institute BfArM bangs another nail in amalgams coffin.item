<p>Amalgam dental fillings came a step closer to abolition in Germany at the end of last month when the Medicines and Medical Products Institute (BfArM) introduced new restrictions on their use. Dentists criticised the changes, saying they mark the end for amalgam at a time when no ideal substitute exists.</p><p>Under new guidelines, manufacturers of non-gamma-2 amalgams must include in the packaging detailed information reflecting the latest academic studies on health effects. This primarily means a warning not to use amalgam fillings in pregnant women.</p><p>BfArM has also recommended that alternatives such as ceramics and precious metals must be used, where medically suitable, in any patient who requests them. This particularly applies to women of child-bearing age.</p><p>prudent steps</p><p>BfArM stresses that there is no convincing evidence that amalgams are harmful, but that it is now clear that mercury from the material is transferred to foetuses. Although the impact of this is unknown, protective health measures are considered prudent.</p><p>Dentists, however, point to BfArM's admission that alternative materials can also be harmful - for example by causing allergic reactions - and therefore offer no real substitute to amalgam. The Federal Dentists Association (BZAK) warned against worrying patients unnecessarily.</p>
