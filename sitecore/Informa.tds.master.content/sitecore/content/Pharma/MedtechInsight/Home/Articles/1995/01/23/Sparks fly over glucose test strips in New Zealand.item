<p>A reduction in blood glucose testing and more diabetic complications requiring hospital treatment are feared as the consequence of removing government subsidies on all but two glucose test strips in New Zealand. According to Pharmacy Today, only 5% of New Zealand's 50,000 diabetics currently use the subsidised strips, Medica Pacifica's Exactech and Medisense Companion-2.</p>

<p>A reduction in blood glucose testing and more diabetic complications requiring hospital treatment are feared as the consequence of removing government subsidies on all but two glucose test strips in New Zealand. According to Pharmacy Today, only 5% of New Zealand's 50,000 diabetics currently use the subsidised strips, Medica Pacifica's Exactech and Medisense Companion-2.</p><p>The subsidy cuts implemented by Pharmac, the body responsible for drug reimbursement and the overall drug budget in New Zealand, have been termed "a professional slap in the face for pharmacists". They are "ill-conceived and a major blunder", says Dr Rick Cutfield, president of the New Zealand Society for the Study of Diabetes.</p><p>Diabetics are now faced with a choice between continuing to use the system with which they are familiar and incurring a NZ$1.67 ($1.06) charge on each prescription or paying up to NZ$150 for a new meter to take the subsidised strips. A third possibility is to send prescriptions to Diabetes New Zealand, a centralised agency in Oamaru which charges no premium on any brand and sends out strips by mail. Bernie Croft, managing director of NZ Medical and Scientific, which distributes Glucocard test strips, says Pharmac has a secret agenda to remove retail pharmacists entirely from glucose test strip supply and ensure that Diabetes New Zealand distribution prevails.</p><p>Pharmac, on the other hand, insists it is simply looking for the best long-term value in glucose test strip supply. Pharmac general manager David Moore believes it is the suppliers themselves which have imposed unnecessarily high prices on patients. "Companies marketing test strips have been on a financial roll for several years," he says. The New Zealand market for glucose strips is growing at around 10-15% annually, according to Mr Moore. Medica Pacifica, the supplier of the subsidised strips, says Pharmac forced it to reduce the price of Medisense Companion-2 before the product could be subsidy-listed.</p><p>Betacheck launch</p><p>Betacheck, a new test strip which is read visually and does not require a meter, was launched on January 1st in New Zealand by Upjohn-Delta West. Although Betacheck is fully subsidised, it is criticised by Dr Cutfield as prone to error and involving "a degree of guess-work".</p>
