<p>The world market for cardiac diagnostic and monitoring equipment is set to grow from $509 million in 1995 to $647 million by 2001, says a new report from Frost & Sullivan. Cardiac telemetry systems will increase their share of the market from 33% in 1994 to 40% in 2001 while standard ECGs will slide from 38% to 34% and long-term ECGs from 29% to 25% over the same period. Compound annual growth for the sector will be 3.9% to 2001.</p>

<p>The world market for cardiac diagnostic and monitoring equipment is set to grow from $509 million in 1995 to $647 million by 2001, says a new report from Frost & Sullivan. Cardiac telemetry systems will increase their share of the market from 33% in 1994 to 40% in 2001 while standard ECGs will slide from 38% to 34% and long-term ECGs from 29% to 25% over the same period. Compound annual growth for the sector will be 3.9% to 2001.</p><p>The increasingly elderly population in the West and greater investment in healthcare in Asia and Latin America will keep the world cardiac market buoyant, says the report. Poorer countries are also shifting from second-hand to new equipment.</p><p>Innovative smaller companies will increase their share of the cardiac market. However, they may suffer from the difficulties of adapting products cost-effectively for the less-developed markets. The ECG market will expand due to growth in emerging markets and increased use of stress testing systems. Most long-term ECG growth will come from emerging event recorder systems and non-hospital Holter systems.</p><p>Technologies which offer improved diagnostic capabilities or reduced costs will be the key market drivers. The report predicts strong growth in cardiac rehabilitation telemetry and one-step systems. Use of cardiac telemetry systems will be particularly strong in the US as hospitals aim to provide "one-stop shopping" for their patients.</p><pre>World cardiac diagnostic equipment and telemetry monitoring market 1995-2001 Year Revenues Revenue growth ($ millions) (%) 1995 509.9 3.2 1996 528.0 3.5 1997 548.5 3.9 1998 570.7 4.0 1999 594.4 4.2 2000 620.0 4.3 2001 647.5 4.4 Source: Frost & Sullivan</pre><p>* The report, reference CBS543, price $2,295 (US orders) or $2,345/&pound;1,450/&yen;48,000 (orders outside the US) is available from Clinica Reports 18/20 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey TW10 6UA.
