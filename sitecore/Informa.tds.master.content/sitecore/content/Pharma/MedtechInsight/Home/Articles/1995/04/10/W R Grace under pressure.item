<p>Devoid of leadership, WR Grace is reeling under self-inflicted and external blows - but its share price is rising. A power struggle in March has forced the resignation of the CEO followed by the chairman of the board. Moreover, Grace's healthcare subsidiary, National Medical Care, is faced with increased pressure from the US FDA to improve its overseas dialysis equipment manufacturing operations. Share prices have, however, risen around 20% since the chairman stood down under pressure from institutional investors.</p>

<p>Devoid of leadership, WR Grace is reeling under self-inflicted and external blows - but its share price is rising. A power struggle in March has forced the resignation of the CEO followed by the chairman of the board. Moreover, Grace's healthcare subsidiary, National Medical Care, is faced with increased pressure from the US FDA to improve its overseas dialysis equipment manufacturing operations. Share prices have, however, risen around 20% since the chairman stood down under pressure from institutional investors.</p><p>The power struggle at Grace was sparked off when CEO J P Bolduc clashed with Peter Grace, the chairman of the board, about the latter's company-funded financial package. On March 2nd, Mr Bolduc resigned, officially for "differences of style and philosophy". Later it emerged he had been investigated following accusations of sexual harassment. Institutional investors revolted and forced Mr Grace to resign. Furthermore, the company agreed to cut the number of board members to 22 from 12 and ensure that no one over 70 would serve on the board.</p><p>The 81-year-old Mr Grace reportedly received a large pay-off, $50,000 a month as consultant, and the company paid for his travel, flat in New York, nurse and private chef. His son, Peter Grace III, had received a $1.3 million company loan.</p><p>Mr Bolduc became CEO in 1993 and by the end of that year the diversified company had been pruned to six core businesses including specialty chemicals, construction products, water treatment and healthcare with sales of $5,093 million in 1994.</p><p>The ex-CEO reportedly received a $20 million severance package when he left Grace after five staff accused him of sexual harassment. Judge Harold Tyler advised the Grace board on February 28th that grounds existed to find that Mr Bolduc had sexually harassed certain employees of the company and others affiliated with the company. Mr Bolduc continues to "vehemently deny" these accusations. Although institutional investors seem to want him to return as CEO this appears unlikely. Some analysts believe that a prolonged period without top management could make Grace ripe for either a takeover or a demerger such as the sale of NMC, the biggest US provider of dialysis services and equipment.</p><p>FDA pressure</p><p>The US FDA is still not satisfied with NMC's overseas operations after a recent re-inspection of facilities. Haemodialysers manufactured in the plant in Dublin, Ireland, which have been banned from import into the US for 21 months, continue to be prohibited (see Clinica No 564/5, p 3). NMC is selling the products outside the US. The company says it is working with the FDA to resolve the issues. A second Irish plant, in Limerick, stopped producing haemofilters in January, a Grace spokesman told Clinica.</p><p>To add to the company's problems, the FDA has told NMC that four patients claim they suffered reactions to ethylene oxide residues in haemodialyser tubes made at the Dublin plant.</p><p>By comparison, the company's Rockleigh, New Jersey, facility has improved since FDA inspectors found 30 manufacturing violations in 1993; only three remain. "The company has made some progress domestically," an agency official says, "but [our recent letters concerning the Irish products] underscore that they have further to go in the overseas operations. We are holding their feet to the fire."</p><p>earnings and share price</p><p>NMC contributed 37% to Grace's total sales in 1994, enjoying a 24% rise compared with the previous year (see Clinica No 645, p 16). Grace's earnings per share remained depressed at 88 cents compared with nearly $3 in 1989 though much improved from 1993 and 1992. On April 4th, the company's shares closed at $53.25, up 19% from the level prior to the CEO's resignation. The improvement has mainly occurred since the company gave in to investor pressure and announced that the chairman would not stand for re-election in the forthcoming annual general meeting.</p>
