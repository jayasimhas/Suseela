<p><strong>[C#198600234:Genzyme]</strong> reported a 10% rise in diagnostic product sales to $47 million in 1994, fuelled by a doubling in revenues from sales of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol test, which is marketed in the US by SmithKline Beecham. The increase helped Genzyme's total product sales to reach $239 million in 1994, up 30% over the previous year.</p>

<p><strong>[C#198600234:Genzyme]</strong> reported a 10% rise in diagnostic product sales to $47 million in 1994, fuelled by a doubling in revenues from sales of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol test, which is marketed in the US by SmithKline Beecham. The increase helped Genzyme's total product sales to reach $239 million in 1994, up 30% over the previous year.</p><p>Genzyme's total revenues rose 17% to $311 million, while net income was up from $8.5 million in 1993 to $30.2 million last year. The tissue repair division, which was formed at the end of last year following the acquisition of BioSurface Technologies, had product sales of $324,000 last year (no sales in 1993) and a net loss of $15.8 million, against almost $24 million in the previous year. Genzyme plans to purchase the remaining shares in IG Laboratories, the genetic diagnostics group, in which it holds a 69% stake.</p><p>Products in development by Genzyme's general division include several hyaluronic acid-based products for surgical use: HAL-C coating solution for coating tissue and organ surfaces; HAL-F bioresorbable membrane and HAL-G gel for tissue and organ separation and protection; and HAL-S synovial fluid replacement to maintain joint function during arthroscopic surgery. Approval applications for HAL-F are expected in the US and Europe this year (see this issue, p 18), and a PMA for HAL-C could be submitted to the US FDA depending on the outcome of a trial in progress.</p><p>Genzyme's tissue repair division resumed its Carticel cartilage repair service, after the FDA decided not to regulate it at this time (Clinica No 662, p 23). It is developing a number of products to treat chronic skin ulcers, including Acticel; Transforming Growth Factor Beta; Vianain debraiding product; and tissue plasminogen activator. Acticel and Vianain are also being evaluated for the treatment of burns.</p>
