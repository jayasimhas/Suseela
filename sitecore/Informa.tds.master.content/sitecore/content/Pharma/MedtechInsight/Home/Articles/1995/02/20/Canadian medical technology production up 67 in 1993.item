<p>Canadian medical device companies achieved estimated sales of Can$2,800 million ($2,000 million) in 1993, up 6.7% compared with the year before, according to the first annual survey of the Canadian industry by MEDEC. Compiled on behalf of the industry association by KPMG, the survey includes data from 81 companies which account for 40-50% of total market sales. Domestic consumption is put at around Can$2,500-2,600 million, with exports accounting for 8% of total output.</p><p>The results indicate that manufacturers with sales between Can$5 million and Can$50 million are the most profitable, with an 11.9% return on equity - the highest among all company groups. Half the respondents to the survey report sales under Can$5 million in 1993 and 48% of companies employ fewer than 20 staff.</p><p>Growth of diagnostic product sales outpaced other sectors, with 1993 sales increasing 13.4% to around Can$339 million, accounting for 12.1% of the total market.</p><p>Hospitals represent the largest purchasers of medical devices in Canada, accounting for over 80% of sales to end-users. Sales to this sector increased 9.5% in 1993.</p><p>Almost 50% of companies which participated in the survey have production facilities in Canada and domestic manufacturing is expected to increase, with in-house production predicted to show the highest growth rate of sourcing in 1994. Some Can$224 million of Canadian production is exported - over half going to markets outside the US and Mexico. Shipments to these markets grew by 16% in 1993.</p><p>Global trade trends are considered by 40% of respondents to have contributed to their export sales, while less than 7% report a decrease in exports. Some 24% of companies surveyed believe that global trade has prompted increased R&D activity.</p><p>MEDEC's 1994 Annual Survey of Industry Trends, which identifies major markets, areas of growth, trends in international trade and major public policy concerns, is available from Medical Devices Canada, 401 The West Mall, Suite 510, Etobicoke, Ontario M9C 9J5. Tel: +1 (416) 620 1915. Fax: +1 (416) 620 1595. Price: Can$595 to MEDEC members, Can$795 to non-members, with a Can$200 discount to participants in the survey.</p>
