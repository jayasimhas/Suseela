<p>No increases in payment for orthotics, prosthetics and prosthetic devices under the US Medicare programme will be made for fiscal 1994 and 1995. In subsequent years, increases are expected to be in line with the consumer price index, reports the Health Care Financing Administration in its final rule on medicare payments for durable medical equipment (DME).</p><p>Payment for aspirators, nebulisers and certain ventilators has been limited by deleting them from the group of items requiring frequent and substantial servicing. Medicare patients who have rented these items for an unlimited period will be required to contribute copayment fees up to the allowed purchase price or the capped rental amount of the device.</p><p>Reimbursement for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) devices provided since January 1994 will be reduced by 45% from the payment effective on April 1st, 1990. The copayment proportion will be similarly reduced. Some $5.6 million was spent by Medicare for 34,000 TENS units in 1993.</p><p>While revenue losses for device manufacturers will result from these changes, says HCFA, it cannot calculate the impact on individual companies. The savings for Medicare are estimated at $45 million in 1995, rising to $75 million in fiscal 1996. Total DME sales were $2,400 million in 1993.</p>
