<p>Ciba Corning and Chiron are now one company. The management team unveiled its plan for the next century at the AACC annual meeting in Anaheim last month (July 16th-20th). Chiron's R&D portfolio and Ciba Corning's instrumentation expertise will be focused on developing a class of tests that the two have decided to call Therametrics.</p><p>Linguistically a combination of therapy and metrics, Therametrics refers to an emerging class of sophisticated tests designed to track the progression of disease and manage treatment in individual patients. Examples include quantifying viral load in diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C; or genotyping in infections such as HPV or Helicobacter pylori, where only certain types are pathogenic. The two companies like the word so much that they have sought trademark protection for it.</p><p>Senior managers say their vision of the 21st century is rapid advances in biology and diagnostic technology applied to high-value tests. Chiron chairman William Rutter says: "We foresee tremendous opportunities for growth in the diagnostic sector for companies that capitalise on innovation in instrumentation, data management, chemistry and biology."</p><p>R&D integration</p><p>Ciba Corning and Chiron have started to integrate their diagnostics R&D. The research team is looking at diagnostics and Therametric products in the areas of cytokines, oncology and infectious disease using both immunoassay and nucleic acid technology.</p><p>key technology</p><p>Two Chiron technologies will shape the future: bDNA and RIBA. Chiron's bDNA tests will be used in viral genome quantitation, messenger RNA quantitation and genetic variation identification.</p><p>RIBA, a strip immunoblot assay, is Chiron's key typing technology. It has applications in HPV, Hantavirus, H pylori and herpes I and II - where different strains and types have different medical implications. "A machine to run RIBA strips should be on the market in Europe this year," says Dr Pablo Valenzuela, president of Chiron Diagnostics. Chiron sees RIBA as a research product for specialty and low volume tests in the first instance. The market is likely to be science driven with testing as an adjunct to R&D.</p><p>The new tests will be supported by Ciba Corning instruments. Chiron and Ciba-Geigy (which has a 49% stake in Chiron) are preferred partners for instrument and test technology and Therametrics will be no exception. Two platforms are under development: Quantiplex for bDNA and Q-200 (tests for the detection and quantification of genetic sequences); and Multiplex, a RIBA processor for the simultaneous detection of multiple gene products (antigens and antibodies).</p><p>Shaping a new market with innovative products and strong proprietary positions focused on segments that fit its basic research capability is not enough. Chiron and Ciba Corning need revenue growth in today's market. The new company plans to increase its market share in mature segments such as blood testing and infectious diseases. A third target is products which address critical needs.</p><p>big buyers</p><p>Ken Conway, president of Ciba Corning Diagnostics (US), believes single source deals with healthcare providers are becoming increasingly important. The Ciba Corning-Chiron partnership has won three large, long-term contracts: Columbia's blood gas business to the year 2000; SmithKline Beecham Clinical Labs' immunodiagnostics business to 2001; and TENET's blood-gas and immunodiagnostics to 1998. Ciba Corning and Chiron are currently negotiating three more sole source deals.</p><p>Mr Conway says the large healthcare providers want suppliers who can show them how to do more with less. "Rather than trying to sell as much as possible, Ciba Corning's Laboratory Consultation Services (LCS) programme will show the customer how to use less - then no one will be able to undercut us." The LCS programme offers financial, technical, cost accounting and educational services to immunoassay and blood-gas customers.</p><p>The centralisation of US healthcare</p><p>NME and AMI have joined to form TENET, which owns over 100 hospitals and manages a further 100; Roche and NHL have formed Lab Corp, the largest laboratory group in the world; MetPath and Damon have formed Corning Clinical - a $1,600 million business; and Columbia and HCA have joined to create a group of 321 hospitals and 125 surgicenters which could grow to over 500 hospitals by the end of 1996.</p>
