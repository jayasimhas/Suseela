<p>Complaints by US medical device manufacturers about unnecessary rules, Byzantine procedures and long approval times have been heard by the new Republican Congress, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller. Both House and Senate committees plan to hold oversight hearings on the FDA's Center for Devices & Radiological Health this spring.</p><p>The House Commerce (formerly Energy & Commerce) oversight subcommittee chairman John Barton signalled his interest at a January 12th press conference sponsored by the conservative Citizens for a Sound Economy. Rep Barton presented results of a new CSE survey showing that 68% of Americans believe delays in medical device and drug approvals cost lives.</p><p>"Americans understand that federal bureaucracy has grown out of control," he claimed. "This poll gives members of Congress a clear indication of one critical area on which we must hold hearings." Those could come within the next few months and are likely to focus on the CDRH.</p><p>Mr Barton's staff includes Alan Slobodin, president of the Washington Legal Foundation's Legal Studies Division. According to Mr Slobodin: "The FDA has the most bureaucratic screening process in the world for new drugs and devices ... The uncertainty of FDA approval policy is responsible for much of the unnecessary risk attributed to (manufacturers) by Wall Street. In a recent poll among medical device manufacturers, 46% of those questioned believed that the FDA almost never or never provided sufficient guidance about when a 510(k), PMA or IDE application was required; 57% stated that the FDA applied its guidance instructions retroactively to their submissions."</p><p>He concludes that current FDA regulatory policy "creates enormous risks to firms, shifting domestic labour, capital and development overseas ... Sensible reforms are necessary to maintain the US' status as the leader in medical technology and innovation and to reduce health care costs."</p><p>Senate hearings likely</p><p>Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kans), chairman of the Senate Labour & Human Resources Committee, is also "very interested" in holding oversight hearings on approvals and enforcement at the CDRH and other FDA components, a staffer says. "She's definitely concerned about the length of time it takes to approve devices. The FDA is called upon to do a delicate balancing act between assuring safety and efficacy and access to devices in a timely way. I don't think they're achieving that balance."</p><p>Hearings will probably not be held until late spring, but the committee has already received a number of suggestions and critiques from individuals and organisations. The Health Industry Manufacturers Association is preparing a draft bill, which it plans to offer to the committee next month.</p><p>legislation in the wings</p><p>Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) could send Chairman Kassebaum draft legislation on the CDRH soon; he is reworking a bill he offered last year. "But," the staffer said, "I doubt whether [the committee] will put a bill in before the hearing."</p><p>A Medical Device User-Fee Act is not expected in the near future - at least not from Congressman John Dingell. The Michigan Democrat, former chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, was the prime mover of such legislation last year - but not now. "We've decided that even if we modified the bill, it would be DOA [dead on arrival]," a Dingell aide says. Legislation to charge manufacturers for the privilege of mandatory FDA approval "would have to be at someone else's initiative".</p>
