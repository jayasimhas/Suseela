<p>Echocardiography could replace radiography for detection of traumatic aorta rupture. Transoesophageal echocardiography can be used quickly and safely in critically injured patients and is both specific and sensitive, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (February 9th).</p><p>Rupture of the aorta is a major cause of death in road accidents (18%) and survival depends on early detection. As many as 40% of patients die within 24 hours if left untreated but only two-thirds of patients have external evidence of thoracic trauma. Diagnosis is normally made by aortography after chest X-ray, but CT and MRI are also used.</p><p>Researchers from the University of Kentucky and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Lexington, used ultrasound in 101 trauma patients. They were successful in 93 cases, despite a high level of injury, writes Dr Mikel Smith, the lead researcher. Sensitivity was 100% and specificity 98% - there was one false positive. Cardiac and radiology teams were called simultaneously but echocardiography was carried out first in most cases - on average within 30 minutes.</p><p>first past the post</p><p>The technique has several other advantages over aortography. It can be performed in situ, without moving the patient to a radiology suite, it can be carried out simultaneously with other resuscitative and diagnostic procedures, it avoids the need for potentially nephrotoxic contrast agents, and the aorta is not catheterised. A worrying drawback is that it gives poor visualisation of the ascending aorta and proximal arch - common sites of damage.</p><p>Aortography can cause fatal complications and so it should not be used routinely, despite the risk of undetected rupture, says Dr Smith. At major trauma centres the decision to proceed to aortography is based on severity of injury and chest radiography - these lack specificity - resulting in busy centres performing many hundreds of aortographies each year.</p><p>centre of excellence factor</p><p>An accompanying editorial describes the study as an important step forward. A missed event is potentially deadly while the last thing a trauma patient needs is unnecessary surgery following a false positive. Other studies have been less successful and the Kentucky study highlights the importance of operator skill in ultrasound procedures, say Drs Gus Vlahakes and Ralph Warren of Massachusetts General Hospital. Trauma frequently occurs at night and this may impose a serious limitation on the use of echocardiography. It is essential, they say, that transoesophageal echocardiography be calibrated against the existing gold standard - biplane contrast-enhanced aortography - in each institution that takes it on board.</p>
