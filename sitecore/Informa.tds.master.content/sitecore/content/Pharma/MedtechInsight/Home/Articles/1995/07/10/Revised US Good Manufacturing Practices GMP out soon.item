<p>Component manufacturers will have to comply with GMPs under the final working draft proposal which will be published in mid-July - "at the latest in August", according to Kim Trautman, acting chief of the FDA's Cardiovascular Branch. Originally included in the draft proposal published in November 1993, medical device components had been deleted from the requirements by the FDA in its consideration of comments. However, delegates at the Fifth Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver, Canada, heard on June 28th that a last minute change by lawyers has seen the requirement reinstated.</p>

<p>Component manufacturers will have to comply with GMPs under the final working draft proposal which will be published in mid-July - "at the latest in August", according to Kim Trautman, acting chief of the FDA's Cardiovascular Branch. Originally included in the draft proposal published in November 1993, medical device components had been deleted from the requirements by the FDA in its consideration of comments. However, delegates at the Fifth Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver, Canada, heard on June 28th that a last minute change by lawyers has seen the requirement reinstated.</p><p>Dr Trautman said comments would be sought on this specific issue and companies were advised to provide examples to support arguments against inclusion of component manufacturers. She said that the considerable time taken in completing the final draft was due to the vast number of comments received on the November 1993 proposal. In order to avoid further delay, Dr Trautman advised that comments to the reproposal should be "very specific".</p><p>In addition to the component manufacturing issue, the FDA is seeking views on traceability and servicing/refurbishing. While the critical device list has been eliminated, the FDA is keen to introduce an element of traceability to protect public health. The agency also wants input from industry to address the need to distinguish between servicing and refurbishing.</p><p>Opportunity for oral comments will be provided at an open public meeting on August 23rd in Rockville, Maryland. A GMP advisory meeting is planned for September 13th-14th to which members of the Global Harmonisation Task Force working group 3 have been invited. Provided there is industry support for the redrafted GMP, it will be put on a fast track and a final regulation can be expected in March/April 1996, according to Dr Trautman. Without industry support it is unlikely to be published until 1997/8.</p>
