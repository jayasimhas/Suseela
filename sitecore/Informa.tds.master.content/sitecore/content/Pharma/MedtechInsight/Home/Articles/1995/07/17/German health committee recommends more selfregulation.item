<p>The German Ministry of Health's advisory committee published a comprehensive discussion paper on July 6th which has wide- ranging implications for future healthcare financing arrangements (see Clinica No 661, p 4). The draft document recommends greater self-regulation for both the Krankenkassen and healthcare providers. The present health insurance law needs to be amended to allow more flexibility regarding the type of contracts and legal relationship between the two parties.</p>

<p>The German Ministry of Health's advisory committee published a comprehensive discussion paper on July 6th which has wide- ranging implications for future healthcare financing arrangements (see Clinica No 661, p 4). The draft document recommends greater self-regulation for both the Krankenkassen and healthcare providers. The present health insurance law needs to be amended to allow more flexibility regarding the type of contracts and legal relationship between the two parties.</p><p>The group of experts appointed by the Health Ministry appears to have thrown its weight largely behind Minister Horst Seehofer's plans for healthcare reforms in the 400-page document. It outlines the exact nature of responsibilities and the legal framework required if self-regulation is to work.</p><p>The proposals concentrate on widening the net of contributors financing the Krankenkassen, expanding the choice of insurance services and introducing more competition among insurers and healthcare providers. The key points are:</p><pre>* Hospitals should be financed solely by their patients and their Krankenkassen. The Lander, previously required to fund local hospitals' building programmes, would no longer be responsible. However, the Lander would take on all peripheral tasks not included in the Krankenkassen's new remit. * The report recommends a widening of the insurance premium bands to include higher charges for families without children or dependant relative at home and whose monthly income exceeds DM 5,850. Non-wage income such as interest payments or rent should become liable for pensioners insurance contribution calculations. * The employer's contribution ought to be fixed uniformly at half the average Krankenkassen contribution. In the long run, the Minister would like to see the employer's payment becoming part of an employee's salary. * A uniform compensation scheme, which takes into account an agreed set of insurance risk categories, would be introduced in every Land. This would transfer funds into eastern Germany and reduce the rate of contributions there. * The report suggests providing the structures needed to increase the number of autonomous bodies on both sides in the negotiation of contracts. It also recommends expanding the range of insurance/finance options available to Krankenkassen and hospitals. * Patients prepared to pay a higher rate of insurance should be given a better choice of hospital care. The Krankenkassen would be allowed to offer their customers bonus points in the form of reduced insurance premiums if they, for example, seek a referral from their local GP before visiting a specialist. * The strict laws governing a medical institution's ability to advertise its services should be relaxed, to enable patients to make well-informed decisions.</pre><p>The ultimate aim of most of these changes is for healthcare management decisions to be based on market forces. It is hoped that this will lead to cost-containment structures and a reduction in annual healthcare expenditure.</p><p>Minister Seehofer has stressed that the report's recommendations are still subject to debate. He will continue to hold discussions with representatives from interest groups such as the German Hospital Association (DKG) and Krankenkassen. Many commentators welcome efforts to give more autonomy to the healthcare providers and insurers to regulate their own budgetary affairs. However, any moves to change the employer's contributions will be strongly resisted by the opposition Social Democratic Party.</p>
