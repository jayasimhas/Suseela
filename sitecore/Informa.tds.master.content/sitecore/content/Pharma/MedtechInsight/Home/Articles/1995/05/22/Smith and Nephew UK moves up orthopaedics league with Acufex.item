<p>Smith & Nephew (UK) is to acquire Acufex for &pound;90 million ($144 million) cash, giving it an additional &pound;40 million in annual revenues. The proposed acquisition of the American Home Products subsidiary, announced on May 15th, is subject to regulatory approval which could take up to 90 days.</p><p>Acufex, which produces hand-held surgical instruments, soft tissue fixation devices, drill guide systems and related instruments and accessories used in MIS procedures, recorded operating profits of &pound;4.5 million on sales of &pound;35 million in 1994. It has net assets of &pound;19 million. Leader in the world hand-held instrument and ligament repair markets, Acufex' products complement Smith & Nephew's Dyonics range of arthroscopic instruments and visualisation equipment. There is less than a 5% overlap, John Robinson, S&N's chief executive told Clinica. Dyonics reported sales of &pound;105 million in 1994.</p><p>With headquarters and manufacturing operations in Mansfield, Massachusetts (US), and sales and marketing offices in the UK, France, Germany and Australia, Acufex employs 319 people. Over 40% of sales are outside the US - some 30% are in Europe (primarily the UK, France, Germany and Italy) and around 10% in the Pacific Rim. Mr Robinson believes that with the addition of Smith & Nephew's marketing force, Acufex could achieve higher sales growth rates than the 13% it has seen in the last three years.</p><p>Smith & Nephew plans to merge Acufex with Dyonics, whose US headquarters are nearby in Massachusetts, but keep the two names. While management will be based at the Dyonics site, the Acufex facilities are to be retained.</p><p>Among products provided by the Acufex acquisition is bioabsorbable fixation technology which is at a more advanced stage of development than Smith & Nephew's R&D in this field. US clearance is pending for the Suretac absorbable fixation devices for attaching tissue to bone (see Clinica No 644, p 15).</p><p>no 2 in orthopaedics</p><p>Purchased by American Home Products as part of the Cyanamid take-over last year, Acufex is estimated to rank 15th in the world orthopaedics league table (see Clinica Supplement May 1995). The addition of Acufex' revenues to Smith & Nephew's orthopaedics sales will elevate the UK company from third to second position in the sector, ahead of Howmedica and behind market leader Zimmer.</p>
