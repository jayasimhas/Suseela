Overdue article! Thank you for the analysis. Standards committees tend to be are dominated by large companies and 'non-economic' enterprises such as public bodies, academia etc. There is little input by small firms, simply because they do not have the resources. Apart from saying this is the way things are, I cannot offer suggestions to improve this problem. The other problem is that committee members are not themselves 'at the coal face,' with the need to use the standards every day.
