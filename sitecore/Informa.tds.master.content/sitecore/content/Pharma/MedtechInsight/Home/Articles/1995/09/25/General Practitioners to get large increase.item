<p>Last week's German Concerted Action in Healthcare meeting produced agreement in one area - a federal recommendation for the increase in non-hospital doctors' fees. This hardly addresses the problem of escalating costs, however, as it provides for an increase well above the level of the average national wage rise.</p>

<p>Last week's German Concerted Action in Healthcare meeting produced agreement in one area - a federal recommendation for the increase in non-hospital doctors' fees. This hardly addresses the problem of escalating costs, however, as it provides for an increase well above the level of the average national wage rise.</p><p>Doctors' fees are to be assessed on the basis of the 1995 level plus a further DM 840 million ($567 million) already promised by Health Minister Horst Seehofer but not yet approved by the legislators. This overall sum will then be increased in line with the average national wage and a further supplement of 1% of the fee volume will be granted.</p><p>This extra 1% will consist of 0.45% for improved co-ordination and quality assurance of inpatient and outpatient operations and 0.55% for new procedures to be included in the EBM (points-based reimbursement catalogue). According to Arzte Zeitung, these new procedures will be: speech therapy and paediatric audiology; otoacoustic emissions; stress echocardiography; lithotripsy of urinary calculi; dermatological ultrasound examinations; magnetically evoked potentials; PCR for selected indications; and CW-Doppler examinations of the foeto-maternal vascular system.</p><p>If the legislators reject the additional sum planned for doctors' fees this year, a further two-percentage-point fee increase will be granted next year, which is to include DM 600 million (plus an increase in this sum in line with the average national wage rise) for improved basic rates of pay for GPs.</p><p>Reimbursement point values for the statutory screening programmes are to be contractually agreed from January 1st, 1997. The possibility of ensuring regionally uniform levels of payment for outpatient operations through the use of fixed point values is also to be investigated.</p><p>The EBM rules prescribe limits on the volumes of ultrasound, skeletal X-ray and CT examinations as well as for a series of diagnostic tests in the O-III category.</p>
