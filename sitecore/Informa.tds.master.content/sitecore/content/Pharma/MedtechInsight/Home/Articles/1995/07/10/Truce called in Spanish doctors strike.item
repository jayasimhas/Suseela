<p>Hospitals in Spain have returned to normal, 48 days after the start of the doctors' strike. But while most medical staff have gone back to work, negotiations are still under way between Insalud, the Spanish health agency, and the doctors' union, CESM (see Clinica No 655, p 6) over the terms of any agreement. The strike could restart at any moment if the doctors' demands are not met, says CESM.</p>

<p>Hospitals in Spain have returned to normal, 48 days after the start of the doctors' strike. But while most medical staff have gone back to work, negotiations are still under way between Insalud, the Spanish health agency, and the doctors' union, CESM (see Clinica No 655, p 6) over the terms of any agreement. The strike could restart at any moment if the doctors' demands are not met, says CESM.</p><p>Health Minister Angeles Amador claimed at the latest round of negotiations that in the seven weeks of the strike, 31,619 operations and 641,808 consultations were postponed, while almost 58,000 operations were carried out together with over 2 million consultations.</p><p>Nevertheless, hospitals are in for a busy summer, clearing the backlog of delayed procedures in a traditionally quiet period. In Galicia, which typically experiences a 40% drop in operations over the season, the health authority estimates the number of surgeries performed will increase by 20%.</p>
