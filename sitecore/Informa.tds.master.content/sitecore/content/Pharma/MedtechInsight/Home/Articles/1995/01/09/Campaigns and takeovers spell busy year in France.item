<p>Cutbacks, contamination and condoms made the headlines last year in France. Jon Bryant looks at the main events of 1994.</p><p>French companies have been active in the international mergers and acquisitions market in 1994, though principally as the passive partner. Roche decided to sell its French subsidiary ABX in November after the blood analysis company had spent the last two years in the red. Demand in France dropped from 700 blood analysis systems a year to nearer 100 in 1994.</p><p>Among several US takeovers, Chiron acquired Domilens for $17.8 million in May and Summit World Trade agreed to acquire 40% of Sopha Medical. Sopha Imaging, its MRI subsidiary went into receivership after CEA-Industrie withdrew support: "The prospects for a return on investment were too remote," said Sopha Medical's president Denis Piet in January. Clonatec went into receivership after a patent infringement case with Sanofi and the withdrawal of one of its HIV tests by the Agence du Medicament. Oris opened the year with the launch of a second cyclotron, but profits were down in 1994.</p><p>Lithotripter manufacturer Edap took over troubled Technomed International in March. Synthelabo group sales up 12.2% for the first nine months, with its Porges and Ela Medical subsidiaries sales up 6.6% to Fr 486.5 million ($49 million) in the same period.</p><p>In an active year for Sanofi, the company sold Sterling's imaging business to Hafslund Nycomed after acquiring it from Eastman Kodak. Sanofi is also expanding its workforce in the US where the company's sales have increased by 20% since 1989. In contrast, bioMerieux' North American influence vanished when <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong> sold its 49% holding in the French diagnostics manufacturer to the company's director Alain Merieux and the CGIP.</p><p>G-Med launched</p><p>In the regulatory arena, G-Med was inaugurated on May 1st as the first French Notified Body for medical devices. It brings together expertise from the testing organisation GLEM, the Health Ministry and the Industry Ministry. The year saw a large number of products join the TIPS list of price controls and the way was paved for the two European medical directives (see pages 14-15).</p><p>A report by the Inspector General of Social Affairs severely criticised French anti-cancer policy, suggesting there was no coherent plan for diagnosis or treatment. While Health Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy announced the creation of a national plan, numerous schemes were inaugurated around France, notably a cervical cancer campaign in Lyon and a nationwide breast screening programme for all women between 50 and 69.A medical dossier was also inaugurated in 1994, which will pave the way for a nationwide medical card plan, according to the Health Ministry. GPs will eventually hold medical dossiers for all patients over 15. In 1994, however, only those patients over 70 with more than one chronic disease received medical dossiers.</p><p>political contamination</p><p>The French blood scandal became more vindictive in 1994 as the search for those ultimately culpable moved into the political arena. Following complaints lodged by families of haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV from contaminated blood, charges of complicity in poisoning were brought against former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and Health & Social Affairs Ministers Georgina Dufoix and Edmond Herve. Scientists who had acted as advisors, Francois Gros and Dr Claude Weisselberg, also faced charges.</p><p>France has the highest number of AIDS cases in Europe, an estimated 32,722, according to the WHO. This compares with under 10,000 in the UK, in spite of their similar populations. The illness is a major problem in France and international AIDS day was marked in Paris by a world summit. Some 42 heads of government committed themselves to an action agenda against AIDS at the summit, which guaranteed rights for all those affected.</p><p>1994 saw a novel range of Gallic ideas in the condom market, with campaigns ranging from the one-franc condom and the CD-box condom, to coffee & condoms on the French Riviera. The campaigns were launched in response to a nationwide survey revealing that 61% of the population had never used a condom. After years of poor distribution and usage, sales in France are now at a level similar to its European neighbours. Over 150 million condoms were purchased in France last year compared with 170 million in Germany and 154 million in the UK. To celebrate this and to popularise an apocryphal name, Condom, a small town in southern France, is to construct a museum dedicated to its namesake. Jacques Moizan, the local mayor, hopes to open the museum in 1995.</p>
