<p>Collagen predicts that profits in fiscal 1995 will be at the upper end of analysts' expectations but warns that fiscal 1996 will be no better because of disappointing sales of its Contigen implants. In response, Collagen plans to lay off 20 staff, 6% of the total workforce, reduce production volume and cut other expenses.</p>

<p>Collagen predicts that profits in fiscal 1995 will be at the upper end of analysts' expectations but warns that fiscal 1996 will be no better because of disappointing sales of its Contigen implants. In response, Collagen plans to lay off 20 staff, 6% of the total workforce, reduce production volume and cut other expenses.</p><p>In fiscal 1995, which ended in June, the Californian company expects net income in the range of 70-85% of the previous year. Net income in 1994 fell to $4.9 million from $8.7 million in 1993.</p><p>The company believes revenues and operating income in fiscal 1996 will remain flat but net income will increase because of further gains from sales of stock in Collagen's affiliate Target Therapeutics. Collagen's CEO Howard Palefsky is optimistic about growth in the company's plastic surgery and dermatology products. But on Contigen implants - which contributed $16.7 million or 26% to 1994 sales - Collagen says it currently plans to ship little, if any, products to its marketing partner Bard during fiscal 1996. The Contigen Bard Collagen Implant is a product for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency.</p><p>Although Bard's end-market sales for Contigen implants were $35 million in the first full calendar year after product launch, recent end-market sales have been below expectations, Collagen says. Excessive shipments of the product have led to high inventory levels at Bard.</p><p>new implant in the UK</p><p>Separately, Collagen has begun UK marketing of the Trilucent Mammary Implant manufactured by LipoMatrix (Switzerland). The Trilucent implant is the first vegetable triglyceride-filled mammary implant. It is designed to pose less of an obstruction to mammography images than available silicone gel- or saline-filled implants. Collagen, which owns around 40% of LipoMatrix, plans to launch the product throughout Europe during the next year.</p>
