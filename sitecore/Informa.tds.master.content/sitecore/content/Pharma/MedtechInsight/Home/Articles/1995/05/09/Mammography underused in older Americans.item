<p>Just 36.9% of US women over 65 underwent mammography in the first two years in which Medicare offered reimbursement for biennial screening. A study of 4,110 women in 1991 and 1992 by Dr Jan Blustein of Columbia University, New York, found that the use of mammography was substantially below recommended levels, particularly among women without supplemental insurance.</p>

<p>Just 36.9% of US women over 65 underwent mammography in the first two years in which Medicare offered reimbursement for biennial screening. A study of 4,110 women in 1991 and 1992 by Dr Jan Blustein of Columbia University, New York, found that the use of mammography was substantially below recommended levels, particularly among women without supplemental insurance.</p><p>Publishing the study results in the New England Journal of Medicine (April 27th, 1995), Dr Blustein concludes that copayments for preventive services are an obstacle to effective mass screening of older women for breast cancer - the most common cancer in women and which increases in incidence with age. Only 14.4% of women without supplemental insurance had mammography in either of the two years, compared with 44.7% of women with employer-sponsored supplemental insurance, 40.1% of those with self-purchased supplemental insurance and 23.9% of women with supplemental Medicaid insurance.</p><p>earlier cancer detection</p><p>A study of 103 women who had breast cancer detected on mammography indicated that women aged 65-74 who are regularly screened have their cancers detected at a smaller size with less metastasis than those who are not screened. Dr Helena Gabriel, a radiologist at the University of Michigan (US), told the American Roentgen Ray Society annual meeting in Washington, DC, on May 4th that 32 women who underwent screening at least every 18 months had tumours about half the size (10.7 mm) of those who did not (20 mm).</p><p>Positive lymph nodes were detected in 13% of the screened women compared with 37% in the non-screened group and the latter group had more nodes (4.6 vs 1). Some 88% of the screened women had non-palpable cancers compared with 44% of the non-screened group.</p>
