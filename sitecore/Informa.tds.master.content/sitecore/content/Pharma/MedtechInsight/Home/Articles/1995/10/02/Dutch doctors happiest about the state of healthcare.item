Belgium and the Netherlands were divided, while in the UK, over half of respondents were against increased private coverage.</p><p>A large majority of doctors favour age-restrictions for in vitro fertilisation, with France (87%), Luxembourg (78%) and the Netherlands (71%) predominant. On the question of HIV testing, all countries except Portugal strongly believe that testing should not become obligatory. In Portugal 77% of GPs believe it should and 64% of them consider the right to secrecy should be lifted when an HIV-positive patient refuses to inform his/her relatives.</p><p>Dutch GPs believe they play an important role in the healthcare system. UK, Austrian and Portuguese doctors also believe they feature strongly. This is not the case in Spain, where the vote was split, nor in France or Luxembourg, where just 40% consider they play an important role.</p><pre>Do GPs play an important role in the healthcare system?
