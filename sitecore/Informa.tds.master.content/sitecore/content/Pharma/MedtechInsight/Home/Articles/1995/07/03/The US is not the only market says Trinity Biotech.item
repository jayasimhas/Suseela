<p>A sign of the times? While agreeing that he is eager to sell to the world's largest healthcare consumer, Trinity Biotech CEO Ronan O'Caoimh is also careful to stress that "the US is not the only market". Slow regulatory progress for Trinity's fastest-expanding sector, rapid HIV testing, means that SE Asia and the Third World are the Irish company's target regions for the immediate future.</p><p>In making such comments, Mr O'Caoimh is being disingenuous. Dublin-based Trinity is already heavily involved in the US - it floated on Nasdaq in 1992 and is hoping to raise $3-5 million in a private placement on the same market next month. Its best-known product, a pregnancy test, is produced by Californian subsidiary Female Healthcare and marketed by Warner-Lambert (as ept) and directly (as Uni-Gold hCG). Trinity says the test accounts for 27% of the US pregnancy testing market. The company is building on this with FDA approval last November of its Uni-Gold LH ovulation prediction test.</p><p>However, Trinity's chosen route for immediate expansion is HIV testing, and there can be no doubt that the US poses certain problems. Speaking at an investors meeting in London last week, Mr O'Caoimh said he expects the FDA soon to approve home collection HIV kits, whereby the kit is used at home but sent to a laboratory for analysis - the result, with counselling, is received by telephone.</p><p>The problem is that Trinity is not involved in the home collection market; most of its sales are to doctors' offices but it plans to enter the rapid home-use HIV test market as soon as possible. For Mr O'Caoimh, home collection approval is only "a step in the right direction". While home-use approval is inevitable, he believes, many countries will make the move before the US.</p><p>This is why Trinity is concentrating on other areas. The company has obtained WHO approval for its seven-step SeroCard HIV-1/2 test - essential for sales to the Third World where many purchases are WHO-funded - and the WHO is now evaluating the company's SalivaCard saliva-based HIV test. Trinity also last year bought US company Disease Detection International, developer of the SeroCard technology and a major player in the South American rapid test market. The big target for the future, says Mr O'Caoimh, is SE Asia, where he believes HIV infection is heavily under-reported for cultural reasons.</p><pre>HIV infections (to mid-1994) (000s) North America 1,000 Latin America 2,000 Western Europe 500 E Europe & C Asia 50 N Africa & M East 100 Sub-Saharan Africa 10,000 East Asia & Pacific 50 South & S E Asia 2,500 Australasia 25 Total 16,225 Source: WHO, GPA</pre><p>Trinity's contribution to single-step, rapid HIV kits is Uni-Gold HIV, which can return a result in five minutes. It currently uses blood but Trinity believes it can be adapted for saliva, important because the risk of infection from saliva is far lower than from blood and the test could therefore be popular with healthcare workers. The company is seeking partners to launch the test outside the US in December 1995. An application for US approval is expected to be made in May 1996.</p><p>moving on</p><p>Trinity CFO Jonathan O'Connell predicts HIV test sales and profits will rise fifteen- and thirteen-fold respectively in fiscal 1995, far greater than pregnancy tests. Overall, the company hopes to move into the black in 1996.</p><pre>Trinity Biotech results ($ millions) Projected Actual fiscal 1995 fiscal 1994 % (12 months) (10 months) change Revenue Pregnancy tests 8.52 5.07 + 68 HIV tests 1.33 0.09 +1,153 Total 9.86 5.16 + 91 Operating profit Pregnancy tests 1.41 0.47 + 300 HIV tests 0.83 0.06 +1,319 Total 2.24 0.53 + 421 Operating loss (0.54) (2.83) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>The next step will be to modify the Uni-Gold test to cover infectious diseases - including HIV Western Blot, hepatitis B/C, H pylori, sexually-transmitted diseases, TORCH, malaria and tuberculosis. Trinity also intends to sub-license its testing technology to companies specialising in cardiac markers, drugs-of-abuse, osteoporosis, transplant markers and tumour markers. However, for the moment the focus is very much on HIV. What role the US market plays in this depends very much on the outcome of the FDA's debate on home testing.</p><pre>Infectious disease testing market ($ millions) Disease Conventional Rapid Multi-step Rapid One-Step 1995 2000 1995 2000 1995 2000 HIV 390 570 60 120 0 2,000 Other 1,385 1,880 39 142 0 800 Total 1,875 2,742 99 262 0 2,800 Source: Trinity Biotech</pre>
