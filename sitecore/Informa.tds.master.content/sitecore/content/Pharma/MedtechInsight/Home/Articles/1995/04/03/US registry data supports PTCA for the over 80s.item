<p>Several studies have shown that elderly patients suffer considerably more mortality and morbidity after PTCA than younger patients but three-year survival is comparable with the aged population as a whole, according to the largest US study so far undertaken. Dr James Jollis and a team from Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, used the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file to follow up the 20,006 patients over 80 years old who had PTCA between 1987 and 1990. Five-year survival was 66%, about the same as the general population, but in-hospital and intermediate-term mortality was higher than that in 65-69 year-olds.</p>

<p>Several studies have shown that elderly patients suffer considerably more mortality and morbidity after PTCA than younger patients but three-year survival is comparable with the aged population as a whole, according to the largest US study so far undertaken. Dr James Jollis and a team from Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, used the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file to follow up the 20,006 patients over 80 years old who had PTCA between 1987 and 1990. Five-year survival was 66%, about the same as the general population, but in-hospital and intermediate-term mortality was higher than that in 65-69 year-olds.</p><p>The number of patients over 80 undergoing PTCA more than doubled between 1987 (3,082) and 1990 (7,341) and the number of octogenarians living in the US is expected to triple over the next 50 years. Some 95% of patients in this age group use Medicare to pay for their cardiac care. Over-80 patients receive only one sixth as many angioplasties as 65-69 year-olds, the peak age group for PTCA. Over half the over-80 patients were women, compared with about one-third in the younger group. A fifth of the seven million US octogenarians have ischaemic heart disease.</p><pre>Octogenarian mortality Patient Hospital stay In hospital 1-year 3-year group (days) mortality mortality mortality (%) (%) (%) All >80 4 7 17 29.6 AMI >80 - 15.8 24.6 35 All 65-69 5 1.8 5.2 10.4 US population age 82 - - 7.7 23.6 Source: Duke University Medical Center</pre><p>The Duke group was surprised how fast PTCA had spread in the elderly. "Some people have questioned whether the elderly benefit from these kinds of procedures, but we find that such care is reasonable," said Dr Jollis. "The PTCA patients may do better than those who receive bypass surgery or medication," he added. One-year mortality in the PTCA group was 16.1% compared with 18.4% for CABG. However the CABG patients tended to have more advanced heart disease. The Duke study was funded by the Health Care and Policy Research Agency.</p><p>Dr Thomas Stuckey and a group from the Moses H Cone Memorial hospital, Greensboro, North Carolina, looked at AMI patients over 75 years-old who were eligible for thrombolysis. Successful reperfusion was achieved in over 98% of cases but was, as in the Duke study, associated with considerably more death and adverse events than PTCA in younger patients.</p><pre>PTCA-patient mortality <75>=75 n=706 n=75 Successful PTCA 664 74 Lab death 8 2 Hospital death 36 16 Reinfarction 32 7 Recurrent ischaemia 19 4 Stroke 4 4 Source: Moses H Cone Memorial Hospital</75></pre>
