<p>Two cancer diagnostic tests were unanimously given the go-ahead by the US FDA's Immunology Devices Advisory Panel on September 21st. Panel members voted in favour of recommending approval of Biomira Diagnostics' (Canada) Truquant BR radioimmunoassay for detecting recurrent breast cancer (see Clinica No 673, p 18) and Bard Diagnostic Sciences' (US) latex agglutination test for detection of bladder tumour associated antigen. Both manufacturers intend to market their products for the management of patients previously diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<p>Two cancer diagnostic tests were unanimously given the go-ahead by the US FDA's Immunology Devices Advisory Panel on September 21st. Panel members voted in favour of recommending approval of Biomira Diagnostics' (Canada) Truquant BR radioimmunoassay for detecting recurrent breast cancer (see Clinica No 673, p 18) and Bard Diagnostic Sciences' (US) latex agglutination test for detection of bladder tumour associated antigen. Both manufacturers intend to market their products for the management of patients previously diagnosed with cancer.</p><p>Biomira's Truquant BR detects the presence of the tumour associated antigen, CA 15-3, in serum or plasma and is intended to detect recurrence of disease in patients previously treated for Stage II or III breast cancer. Three specificity studies involving over 2,000 patients without breast cancer showed low reactivity of the assay with blood of these patients.</p><p>A prospective, multicentre, blinded study included 166 patients who had previously been treated for Stage II or III breast cancer. The assay was able to identify correctly 15 of the 26 who had a recurrence of tumour at a mean of 5 months before diagnosis by conventional means. There were 17 false positive results. The assay had a sensitivity of 58%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 47% and negative predictive value of 92% in a study population with a prevalence of recurrence of 10% as determined by conventional means.</p><p>The panel discussion focused on the absence of data to show that the assay would positively affect patient outcome. The recurrences detected were mostly distal episodes that would not respond well to treatment. The high number of false positive results may lead to patients receiving unnecessary chemotherapy or becoming unnecessarily alarmed. While agreeing that there were no data to show improved outcome, Dr Kemeny considered that following patients with metastatic cancer may be beneficial.</p><p>The panel voted unanimously to recommend marketing approval for use in Stage II and III breast cancer patients but also recommended postmarketing studies to determine if the test primarily detects treatable or untreatable recurrences.</p><p>Bard test gives quick results</p><p>Bard's latex agglutination test qualitatively determines bladder tumour associated antigen in the urine of bladder cancer patients. The test is intended to be used in conjunction with cytology and cystoscopy to follow patients previously treated for bladder cancer. It is hoped the assay will become a cost effective replacement for urine cytology. The advantage of Bard's assay is that it can give results quickly in the doctor's office.</p><p>The two screening methods were compared in a prospective, multicentre, blinded clinical trial which analysed 1,014 urine specimens from 499 patients using biopsy as the gold standard. The latex agglutination test had a sensitivity of 40%, compared with 41% for cytology, and specificity of 80% (versus 91%). Bard's test had a positive predictive value of 47% and a negative predictive value of 75.6% in a study population with a prevalence of bladder cancer of 31% as determined by biopsy. The test generated results in significantly less time and, presumably, less cost. Panel members posed few questions and unanimously recommended approval.</p><p>* Bard's bladder cancer test was introduced in Europe earlier this year (see Clinica No 643, p 1).</p>
