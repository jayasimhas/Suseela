<p>The NHS Supplies Authority could see its dominant role in the UK market eroded by private suppliers during the rest of the decade. A new report on Selling to the UK Health Service advises companies to evaluate the growing number of agencies in the private sector. "Although several offer only a limited version of NHS Supplies' services it is clear the intention is to make inroads into NHSSA's backyard."</p>

<p>The NHS Supplies Authority could see its dominant role in the UK market eroded by private suppliers during the rest of the decade. A new report on Selling to the UK Health Service advises companies to evaluate the growing number of agencies in the private sector. "Although several offer only a limited version of NHS Supplies' services it is clear the intention is to make inroads into NHSSA's backyard."</p><p>NHS expenditure in England is estimated at more than &pound;5,100 million ($8,160 million), of which clinical supplies account for 25.5%. The report provides the following breakdown:</p><pre>NHS expenditure on clinical supplies (&pound; million) Med & surgical equipment 702 Patient appliances 162 Lab equip instruments & materials 152 Artificial limbs & hard-core equip 91 Dressings 86 X-ray film 43 X-ray equip & chemicals 27 Medical gases 23 Occupational & industrial therapy equip & materials 14 TOTAL 1,300</pre><p>Proposed changes to the NHS Supplies' pricing policy are likely to have "substantial impact" on companies' sales during 1996/7, warns the report. It points to the Supplies Authority's plans to replace fees with all-inclusive prices. It aims to recover costs through product prices rather than a service fee charged to customers which, says the report, is "bad news for companies selling through the NHS Supplies".</p><p>alternative suppliers</p><p>Alternative supply agencies are gaining momentum in the marketplace and the report identifies some of the major concerns.</p><p>The Buying Agency - also known as Crown Suppliers - is an executive agency of the Department of Environment which has recently added medical and surgical supplies and diagnostic equipment to its product range. It generates annual sales of around &pound;400 million.</p><p>Hospital Management and Supplies, a wholly-owned subsidiary of pharmaceutical wholesaler <strong>[C#200400737:UniChem]</strong>, distributes over 20,000 medical, surgical and consumable items to over 1,000 customers. These include NHS Trusts, the NHSSA regional centres, private hospitals and industry. "This could be the independent supply agency that sets the pace," claims the report.</p><p>Independent National Supplies Service offers group product purchasing through a network of committees and includes medical and surgical supplies among its services.</p><p>AAH Hospital Services specialises in supplying single-use medical devices. The group (which includes AAH Pharmaceuticals) is the subject of a hostile bid from Europe's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler, GEHE of Germany.</p><p>Southern Syringes Services supplies 45,000 stock lines to distribution stores and to wards.</p><p>This review is based on the 256-page report on Selling to the UK Health Services (price: &pound;135) published by Health Care Industry Review, The Business Centre, 21 Piccadilly, London W1V 9PF, UK.</p>
