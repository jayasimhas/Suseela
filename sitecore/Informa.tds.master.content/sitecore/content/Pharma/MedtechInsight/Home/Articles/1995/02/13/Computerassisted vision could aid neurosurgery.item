<p>A computer-based system to guide neurosurgery intra-operatively has entered initial studies in the UK. The VISLAN system, which uses standard video cameras and computer vision techniques, is being used to record data during operations and will guide selected procedures later this year, according to its developers. The project is a collaboration between Roke Manor Research, part of Siemens Plessey Systems (UK), and the United Medical and Dental School at Guy's Hospital, London.</p>

<p>A computer-based system to guide neurosurgery intra-operatively has entered initial studies in the UK. The VISLAN system, which uses standard video cameras and computer vision techniques, is being used to record data during operations and will guide selected procedures later this year, according to its developers. The project is a collaboration between Roke Manor Research, part of Siemens Plessey Systems (UK), and the United Medical and Dental School at Guy's Hospital, London.</p><p>The system can be used for surgical planning: pre-operative images are analysed using software tools to form a surgical plan. During surgery, the system tracks a locator probe in three dimensions, allowing the surgeon to relate visible features to the original surgical plan. The initial investigations are being performed at the Maudsley Hospital and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. A major advantage of the system is that it uses standard video cameras and therefore the probe does not require power. This eliminates trailing wires and allows the probe to be sterilised easily, says Roke Manor.</p><p>The DTI-funded project is entering the final year of its three-year duration and although some procedures will be performed later this year, clinical trials will not begin until a later date. The researchers are liaising with Siemens' Medical Engineering division but there are as yet no plans as to which company will market the final product.</p>
