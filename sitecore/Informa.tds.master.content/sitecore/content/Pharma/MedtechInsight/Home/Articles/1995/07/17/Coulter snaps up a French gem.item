<p>Coulter, one of the top ten diagnostics manufacturers, has strengthened its expertise in monoclonal antibodies with the acquisition of French company Immunotech. Terms were not disclosed. The previous owners of Immunotech were financial institutions and venture capitalists. The company's founders, Antoine Beret and Michel Delaage, will continue to manage Immunotech, a company described as a "gem" and "ideal match" by Coulter.</p><p>"Coulter is the world leader in haematology systems," says Joe Scott, Coulter's director of field support. "Now, with Immunotech, we also have the broadest range of cytometry reagents. ... This purchase assures our position as the world leader in cell analysis." Privately-owned Coulter has estimated sales of around $750 million and a long-term strategic alliance with Instrumentation Laboratory, supplementing Coulter's strength in haematology with coagulation products and clinical chemistry analysers.</p><p>Immunotech launched its first monoclonal antibody in 1984 and had an annual growth rate of more than 30% a year for the last ten years, according to Mike Brochu, Coulter's director of business development. The Marseille-based company now markets nearly 800 monoclonal antibody products in 25 countries, more than any other company in the world, Coulter adds. Immunotech had revenues of Fr 147 million ($27 million) in 1994.</p><p>In operations in France, Germany, the Czech Republic and the US, Immunotech employs 240 people. In addition to its line of flow cytometry antibodies, it also offers immunoassays, antibodies for immunohistochemistry and magnetic beads. The company has developed Affinity Enhancement System (AES), a proprietary technology for targeting tumour cells which is used in immunoscintigraphy of colorectal and lung cancer.</p>
