<p>Bard has launched a three-minute test for bladder cancer. Bard BTA, a latex agglutination and test strip assay, was introduced at the European Urological Winter Forum at Davos, Switzerland. Bard says the kit greatly improves on the noninvasive standard, voided urine cytology (VUC). An unpublished US study is reported to have found BTA to be nine times more sensitive than VUC in detecting Ta (superficial) grade I/II tumours and two and a half times as sensitive in Ta grade III and T1 (invasive) grade II/III tumours. In the case of flat tumours both methods performed equally well. Sensitivity of the new test is 96%.</p>

<p>Bard has launched a three-minute test for bladder cancer. Bard BTA, a latex agglutination and test strip assay, was introduced at the European Urological Winter Forum at Davos, Switzerland. Bard says the kit greatly improves on the noninvasive standard, voided urine cytology (VUC). An unpublished US study is reported to have found BTA to be nine times more sensitive than VUC in detecting Ta (superficial) grade I/II tumours and two and a half times as sensitive in Ta grade III and T1 (invasive) grade II/III tumours. In the case of flat tumours both methods performed equally well. Sensitivity of the new test is 96%.</p><p>The BTA test uses latex bead agglutination to detect basement membrane complexes, unique antigens formed by the action of invasive cells on the bladder membrane. Around 90% of bladder cancers are caused by transitional cell carcinomas which invade and disrupt the basement membrane. Worldwide an estimated 219,000 people develop bladder cancer every year, 52,000 in the US and 10,000 in the UK. Mortality is rising in most countries, with the notable exception of Canada and the US. BTA has been submitted for approval in the US and is initially available only for use by urologists in Europe.</p>
