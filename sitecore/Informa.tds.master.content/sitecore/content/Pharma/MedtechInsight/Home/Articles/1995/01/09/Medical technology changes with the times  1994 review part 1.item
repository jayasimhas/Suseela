<p>Advances in medical technology continued to make the headlines in 1994, but were influenced by an increased focus on cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes. Clinica's technology writer Philip Greenfield reviews developments in three areas - imaging, orthopaedics and surgery.</p><p>Imaging</p><p>1994 was another year of innovation in diagnostic imaging, driven by a need to meet market requirements for cost-effective healthcare. One emerging area is teleradiology, the ability to transmit diagnostic images digitally without loss in image quality. This promises to reduce healthcare costs by allowing consultations and diagnosis from a distance. In November at RSNA, Acuson (US) demonstrated the capability of new telecommunications systems to transmit real-time diagnostic quality ultrasound images. The technology is already being used by the Regional Medical Center-Memphis and Virginia Mason Medical Center in Washington to link up with satellite clinics.</p><p>At the American Heart Association conference in Dallas in November, cardiologists from the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, demonstrated for the first time a digital image network for transmitting moving cardiac images over long distances in real-time. Video images from the cath lab are digitised and transferred to a workstation for review or archived on compact tape which can be loaded using a robotic arm controlled over the network. The system was developed by a consortium including Hewlett-Packard, Martin Marietta and GE Medical Systems. The Mayo team believes the technology can reduce its lab costs by nearly $250,000 a year.</p><p>US companies United Medical Network Group, MCI and PictureTel formed an alliance to create an independent visual communications network for transmission of medical images and data around the world. Using the network, a one-hour US coast-to-coast teleconference costs around $55, compared with up to $3,000 per hour using satellite or microwave links, according to the companies.</p><p>ultrasound</p><p>One of the major developments in 1994 for ultrasound was the US approval of Molecular Biosystems' Albunex ultrasound contrast medium, making it the only ultrasound agent approved in the US. Mallinckrodt Medical has exclusive marketing rights in North and South America and the company estimates that a significant number of the approximately ten million echocardiograms performed each year in the US could be enhanced by Albunex.</p><p>The introduction of ultrasound contrast agents from a number of manufacturers over the next few years is expected to help boost the world contrast media market from $2,928 million in 1993 to $8,100 million in 2000, according to Frost & Sullivan.</p><p>Alliance Pharmaceutical (US) dropped its oral MRI contrast agent, Imagent GI, and development of blood pool and lymph node CT agents to concentrate its contrast media business on ultrasound imaging agents. The company is accelerating development of Imagent US, an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent, which is in preclinical studies for assessing myocardial perfusion, cardiac function, general vascular patency and tumour detection. Alliance hopes to begin Phase I/II clinical trials of the agent in early 1995.</p><p>Advanced Technology Laboratories (US) launched its HDI 3000 ultrasound system, based on all-digital broadband architecture, which operates at higher processing speeds for increased frame rates and improved spatial and contrast <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong>. Initially configured for general imaging applications, it also supports ATL's new Colour Power Angio Doppler mode for detecting small-vessel flow. The digital architecture allows software control of images and digital image management and facilitates imaging with contrast agents and 3-D imaging.</p><p>MRI</p><p>1994 saw the introduction of more MRI equipment geared towards interventional applications - open designs and faster sequences were major components of new MRI systems. Clinical trials of interventional MRI using GE Medical Systems' Magnetic Resonance-guided Therapy (MRT) system began at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston. The MRT system, a 0.5 T superconducting magnet cut open to allow access to the patient, is being used for catheter placement and will also be used to guide focused ultrasound for tissue ablation.</p><p>Researchers at UCLA have used MRI to guide RF ablation of brain tumours, reducing operating time to just three hours and requiring only local anaesthesia and 24 hours observation. Some 15 patients (18 tumours) were treated using a modified RF generator and open MRI system. Small, less-vascular tumours best suited to the technique, say the researchers. German researchers are using MRI to guide laser thermotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Initial results from the Free University of Berlin showed tumour necrosis and a marked reduction in symptoms in three and two of the four patients respectively.</p><p>GE Medical Systems and Picker International revealed their versions of low-field, open MR systems. Picker's Outlook 0.23 T system features Electron Spin Resonance technology to stabilise the magnetic field and reduce ramp-up time. Interventional studies are under way using the system. GE's 0.2 T Signa Profile, which is in clinical trials in the US, is designed for applications such as dynamic joint studies.</p><p>Philips Medical Systems (the Netherlands) added real-time MRI to its Gyroscan NT range of systems. The upgrade, which operates at ten frames-per-second, allows images to be viewed as the patient is scanned. Applications include dynamic orthopaedic studies, trauma screening and vascular/gastrointestinal contrast agent studies. Interventional applications, such as catheter tracking, dynamic cardiac studies and surgical guidance are in development.</p><p>Advanced Mammography Systems (US) unveiled an MR system dedicated to breast imaging. The Aurora system, currently an investigational device, is designed as an adjunct to mammography in detecting lesions missed by the technique. The company hopes to gain US FDA clearance in 1995.</p><p>image-guided surgery</p><p>Philips plans to offer real-time imaging with its EasyGuide Neuro image-guided surgery system when it becomes available. The EasyGuide system, which is at the prototype stage, uses an optical position digitiser to register preoperative CT and/or MR images with actual patient anatomy to provide accurate information on the location of instruments relative to anatomy during surgery. Initially designed for neurosurgery, other applications are expected in the future, according to the company.</p><p>Picker International (US) is about to begin clinical trials of its system for frameless image-guided surgery. Developed with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, ViewPoint uses an ultrasonic digitiser probe to correlate CT and MR images with anatomy and will be used for craniotomy and spinal surgery. The system has already been used in over 300 procedures and recent recommendations for the reclassification of pedicle screw devices by the US FDA (from Class III to Class II) have stimulated interest in image-guided placement of the devices, says Picker.+ virtual reality meets radiology</p><p>Using technology pioneered by video game manufacturers, radiologists are now able to journey through parts of the body with the aid of virtual reality. Researchers headed by Dr David Vining at Wake-Forest University, Winson-Salem, US, have used spiral CT and a virtual reality workstation and software to produce simulated images of the inside of the colon. The technique costs about a quarter the price of colonoscopy, is less invasive and does not require sedation or an overnight stay, says Dr Vining. It has also been used to study the airways and could assist in selection of patients for bronchoscopy and guide transbronchial needle biopsy, according to data from 25 patients.</p>
