<p>Two Italian testing houses are awaiting official designation as Notified Bodies under the Medical Devices Directive. IMQ and Certimedica, both based in Milan, have been approved by the notifying commission within the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) and expect official notification in the Italian Gazzetta Ufficiale and the Official Journal of the European Communities soon. They are already working with manufacturers.</p><p>The appointments are good news for Italian industry since the organisations will introduce a far wider range of third-party testing under the Medical Devices Directive than has been available. Although the ISS was designated as Italy's first Notified Body under the MD Directive in March, its appointment only covered Class III products and orthopaedic implants. (ISS is also Italy's only Notified Body under the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive.)</p><p>Industry is also relieved at the speed of the appointments. It had feared a longer delay due to opposition among Health Ministry officials to designations ahead of the implementation of the Italian devices law - which is still awaited.</p><p>testing scope</p><p>IMQ has been certified to test most electromedical devices against Annexes III and IV of the MD Directive. It is also being designated to audit single-use syringes, catheters, parenteral nutrition bags, contact lenses and solutions and most electromedical equipment against Annexes II, V and VI, Enzo Formisano of the quality assurance department told Clinica.</p><p>Certimedica has been certified to test mainly non-active devices against Annexes II,V and VI, although it will not be testing Class III products against Annex II, states Mr Monti, head of medical device auditing at the company.</p>
