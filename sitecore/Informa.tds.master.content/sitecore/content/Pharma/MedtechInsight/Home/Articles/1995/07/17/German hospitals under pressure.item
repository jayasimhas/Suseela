<p>An effective but acceptable way to limit hospital spending remains the elusive key to the next stage of healthcare reforms in Germany.</p><p>In the crisis talks called by Health Minister Horst Seehofer two weeks ago (see Clinica No 661, p 4), Mr Seehofer succeeded in obtaining from the Federal [non-hospital] Doctors' Association (KBV) a formal commitment to restrict expenditure growth to the level of increase in basic wages, thus ensuring stable health insurance premiums. KBV chairman Winfried Schorre told Handelsblatt that this commitment was, however, made on condition that both Kassen and doctors be given a level playing field for self-regulation of healthcare spending, that statutory provision be made for the <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> of disagreements between the two parties and that the issue of hospital financing be settled satisfactorily.</p><p>The ball is now in the court of the German Hospital Association (DKG) which refused to give the same guarantee of premium stability. Mr Seehofer made clear at the talks that this was one of his two main aims in the third stage of health reform, together with ensuring that the healthcare spending system remains essentially self-administered.</p><p>The Health Minister proposed a new system of hospital financing comparable to that already in place for non-hospital doctors, whose fees are distributed through the regional doctors' unions. Similarly, hospital payments could be distributed to individual hospitals through the Land hospital associations. If hospitals increased the number of procedures carried out, the payment per procedure would automatically decrease, ensuring that the total budget remained in line with the basic wage increase.</p><p>The representatives of the DKG objected to this proposal on legal grounds, claiming that the hospital associations had no legal right to distribute payments to individual hospitals. Mr Seehofer then threatened to introduce a separate insurance premium for the hospital and non-hospital sectors so that disproportionate spending increases by the hospitals would not have to be made good by non-hospital doctors. All parties, however, resolved to try to avoid this last resort by stepping up pressure on hospitals to guarantee limitation of expenditure growth.</p><h2>Krankenkassen deficit</h2><p>Wolfgang Schmeinck, managing director of the Federal Association of Betriebskrankenkassen, speaking at the association's general meeting last month, tried to allay fears of a massive statutory Krankenkassen deficit this year, reports Arzte Zeitung. Difficulties in precisely allocating expenditure to particular accounting periods, together with the fact that a number of important wage agreements are still outstanding, mean that the overall deficit in the state Krankenkassen system at the year end may not be significantly greater than the deficit reported for the first quarter (DM 2,600 million for west Germany), Mr Schmeinck maintained.</p><p>He nonetheless expressed great concern over the continuing rise in hospital expenditure, as did the Federal Minister of Trade and Commerce, Gunther Rexrodt, speaking at the Federal Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry (BPI)'s AGM in Frankfurt. The Minister called for a "market-based cost management from below" in the healthcare system, reports Handelsblatt, and said that fixed budgets, reductions in payments and statutory price cuts were "politico-economically dubious weapons".</p><p>The DKG has announced an extraordinary general meeting on July 19th in Bonn to come up with a response to the joint demands of Ministers, Kassen and doctors.</p><h2>no role for industry?</h2><p>KBV chairman Winfried Schorre noted in an interview with Handelsblatt that suppliers of medical and pharmaceutical products would not be directly involved in the proposed self-regulatory healthcare spending system (there are as yet no organisations entitled to negotiate binding contracts on behalf of the medical industries. Nevertheless the KBV was, of course, open for discussion with medical industry representatives with a view to committing these suppliers to stable insurance premiums.</p><p>It is interesting to note that a recent decision by the Federal Social Court found the setting by doctors and Krankenkassen of fixed reimbursement limits for pharmaceutical products without the involvement of the pharmaceutical industry to be unconstitutional. The case has been referred to the Federal Constitutional Court.</p>
