<p>Italy's largest manufacturer of electromedical devices, Esaote, plans to raise funds through a public offering of 15.72 million shares. This would increase the company's capital from Lit 31,280 million to Lit 47,000 million at a nominal value of Lit 1,000 per share. The proceeds are intended for development of the group in Italy and abroad and to reduce debts - which totalled Lit 60,000 million at the time of the management buyout in July 1994.</p>

<p>Italy's largest manufacturer of electromedical devices, Esaote, plans to raise funds through a public offering of 15.72 million shares. This would increase the company's capital from Lit 31,280 million to Lit 47,000 million at a nominal value of Lit 1,000 per share. The proceeds are intended for development of the group in Italy and abroad and to reduce debts - which totalled Lit 60,000 million at the time of the management buyout in July 1994.</p><p>An extraordinary shareholders meeting has been called for September 26th to discuss flotation on the Milan stock exchange. Current institutional shareholders, which hold a 90% stake in the company, are expected to sell some of their shares at the same time as the offering. Management, which retains the remaining 10%, says it expects to be able to increase its stake. The meeting will also discuss a management incentive programme involving stock options over the next few years.</p><p>international sales up 31%</p><p>Esaote's international sales increased 31% in the first six months of 1995 compared with the 1994 first half, against a 3% rise in Italy. This has meant an overall growth in turnover of 15% since sales abroad accounted for 50% of turnover in the first six months, compared with 43% for the corresponding 1994 period. The breakdown of 1994 sales, totalling Lit 232,000 million, was as follows: US, 30%; western Europe, 32%; rest of the world, 38%.</p>
