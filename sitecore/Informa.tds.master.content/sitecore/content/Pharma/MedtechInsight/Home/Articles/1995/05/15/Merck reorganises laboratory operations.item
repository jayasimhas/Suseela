<p>The Merck group, which includes German-based holding company E Merck, Swiss-based Merck AG and the French Lipha group, split its laboratory business into three divisions at the beginning of September 1994 - laboratory products, laboratory trade and diagnostics. This follows numerous acquisitions during the year including Bender & Hobein, Prolabo, VEL, Poly Labo, a stake in VWR and Kebo Lab, the largest Scandinavian laboratory supplier.</p><p>Laboratory sales rose 2.7% in 1994 to DM 1,382 million ($1,009 million), a development which Merck described as "unsatisfactory" attributing it to "drastic savings by industry, science and state-owned organisations". Last year laboratory sales represented 24.4% of group sales of DM 5,660 million, down from 25.3% a year earlier. Total group sales were up 6.6% in 1994, and after-tax profits jumped 84% to DM 318 million.</p><pre>E Merck's group sales by division (DM millions) 1994 1993 change Laboratory 1,382 1,346 2.7% Pharmaceuticals 2,970 2,736 8.6% Chemicals 1,238 1,127 9.9% Licence payments 70 101 Total 5,660 5,310 6.6% (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Group turnover increased 13% in the 1995 first quarter with most of the growth stemming from acquisitions. No first-quarter figures were given. In the whole of 1995, E Merck expects revenues to rise more than 10% to at least DM 6,500 million and in the medium-term Merck is aiming for sales growth of 6-7% a year.</p><p>Privately-owned E Merck, the holding company of the Merck group, plans to float 25% of its stock in September or October hoping to raise DM 2,000 to DM 2,500 million (see Clinica No 648, p 12). A bookbuilding process in the two weeks prior to the float will determine the pricing of the offering.</p><p>reorganised laboratory business</p><p>Laboratory products is one of the three new subdivisions of Merck's laboratory business. It offers more than 10,000 products including a range of reagents and a wide spectrum of specialties to customers ranging from industry through state agencies to universities.</p><p>The second subdivision is laboratory trade where E Merck says it is market leader in Europe and expects to improve its position further through its acquisitions. The company says that this subdivision would have had turnover of DM 612 million in a full 12-month period and DM 760 million including Swedish-based Kebo Lab, which is not yet included in the 1994 results. Laboratory trade, one of Merck's core areas, is to be further developed in the US, chairman Hans Joachim Langmann said at the presentation of last year's results.</p><p>In 1994, sales the diagnostics business unit were lower than a year earlier. Mr Langmann forecast: "The distance to the worldwide leaders in diagnostics is considerable. For this reason, we are investigating our strategic aims for this business area." Last year, Merck introduced its Mega clinical chemistry analyser and the Magia 7000 immuno analyser which was followed by the 8000 model early this year (see Clinica No 636, p 4).</p><p>share in contrast media</p><p>E Merck, which owns 50% of privately-owned <strong>[C#198900374:Bracco]</strong>, says that Bracco's 1994 sales were DM 928 million. The Italian contrast agent manufacturer's turnover rose 8% in DM terms with exports 21% up compared with 1993. Half of Bracco's sales are consolidated in E Merck's pharmaceutical revenues. E Merck says that the new contrast agent, iomeprol, was registered in the most important European countries during 1994 and that marketing begin in Italy and Japan.</p>
