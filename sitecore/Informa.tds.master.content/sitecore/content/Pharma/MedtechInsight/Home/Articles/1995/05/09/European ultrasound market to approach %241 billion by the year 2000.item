<p>The European market for diagnostic ultrasound equipment was worth $628.7 million in 1993 and is set to approach $1,000 million by 2000, says a new report from Frost & Sullivan. The European ultrasound market experienced rapid growth of up to 25% in the late 1980s, while rates levelled off in the early '90s due to recession and uncertainties about healthcare reform policies. The report predicts faster growth to the end of the century.</p>

<p>The European market for diagnostic ultrasound equipment was worth $628.7 million in 1993 and is set to approach $1,000 million by 2000, says a new report from Frost & Sullivan. The European ultrasound market experienced rapid growth of up to 25% in the late 1980s, while rates levelled off in the early '90s due to recession and uncertainties about healthcare reform policies. The report predicts faster growth to the end of the century.</p><pre>European ultrasound equipment market 1993-2000 Units shipped and revenues forecast Year Units ('000) Revenues Growth (%) ($millions) 1993 10.2 628.7 0.0 1994 10.5 637.8 1.5 1995 11.0 664.1 4.1 1996 11.5 698.6 5.2 1997 12.1 743.8 6.5 1998 12.7 796.5 7.1 1999 13.4 854.2 7.2 2000 14.3 917.1 7.4 Source: Frost & Sullivan</pre><p>The rapid expansion and high acceptance of ultrasound stem from its relatively low cost, ease of operation and improved image quality, says the report. It also cites the increasing number of private practices and insurance schemes as factors leading to an expanding ultrasound market.</p><p>Radiology accounts for some 40% of the total ultrasound equipment market in 1995; this is set to decline gradually by 2000. The market share of other uses will remain relatively unchanged to the end of the century except intraoperative ultrasound, which is set to double from 1% to over 2%, according to the report.</p><p>Breakdown of European ultrasound market 1995</p><pre>TEE 1.4% Ophthalmology 0.8% Intravascular 0.8% Intraoperative 1.0% Urology 2.6% General Practice 2.1% Peripheral Vascular 6.9% Cardiology 21.9% Radiology 39.4% Obs and Gyn 23.1%</pre><p>The market is dominated by only a few players. Smaller producers will have to specialise in particular niches if they are to survive, says the report. It concludes many companies will have to follow ATL and Interspec's example and join forces if they are to provide a more total service and increase competitiveness (see Clinica No 591, p 11).</p><p>The 578-page report on European Medical Diagnostics Ultrasound Imaging Equipment Markets, which includes detailed profiles of 25 companies and trade associations, reference CBS536, price $3,800 (US orders) or &pound;2,450/&yen;88,000/$3,850 (orders outside the US) is available from Clinica Reports 18/20 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey TW10 6UA.
