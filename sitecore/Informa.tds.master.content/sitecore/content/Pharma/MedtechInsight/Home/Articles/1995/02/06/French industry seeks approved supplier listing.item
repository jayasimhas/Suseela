<p>Simone Veil, the French Health and Social Affairs Minister, has recently agreed to industry's request to establish a price listing for non-active implantables. However, she has yet to adopt an accredited system for the manufacturers and distributors of these products.</p><p>In response to concerns from medical device industry association SNITEM, Mrs Veil has agreed to initiate TIPS (Tarifs interministeriels des prestations sanitaires) price listings for non-active implantables, similar to those already established for products such as dressings, orthoses and hearing aids. (Non-active implantable devices are currently reimbursed by the Social Security on presentation of an invoice.)</p><p>Mrs Veil recognises the need to draw on industry's unique technical knowledge to establish a fair classification system which can cope with technical innovation. Given the lengthy nature of interministerial decision-making in this area, she has written to the Economics Ministry suggesting a work schedule which would involve industry at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>accreditation called for</p><p>SNITEM is also calling for the government to use an accredited list of suppliers of non-active implantables. The association is concerned that poor quality, non-active implantables could be freely available on the market without quality-related cost benefits. This would be to the detriment of the whole industry as well as to patients. It believes that "appropriate organisations" should assess companies' quality systems and carry out financial checks before reimbursement licences are granted.</p><p>The matter of accreditation poses "multiple problems", says Mrs Veil,and is being investigated by the Hospital Directorate at the Health Ministry.</p><p>The Minister's letter, addressed to president Jean-Pierre Ravut, was published in SNITEM's January newsletter, but appeared some six months after the Minister told members of the association that a better dialogue was required and six months after SNITEM had sent its original request to the Minister. While Mrs Veil agrees with SNITEM's general recommendations, she is asking for more concrete proposals which should come from the industry association in conjunction with recognised professional bodies.</p><p>The prices of medical devices which appear on the TIPS list are set by the government. Another group of special devices are listed as subject to entente prealable meaning that medical professionals must seek Social Security approval before the products can be reimbursed. This group includes customised hip prostheses, for example, which have no set tariff. The prices of other medical devices - mainly non-active - are currently set according to the supplier's invoice.</p><p>Among non-active medical devices that are already subject to the TIPS are knee implants. These are not subject to homologation (premarket approval) in France. Instead, from June 1996, the TIPS will only reimburse CE-marked knee implants or those which are manufactured or distributed by a company which has met EN 29001, EN 29002 or EN 29003. Companies of non-CE-marked knee implants which follow the EN 29002 or 29003 routes, must also submit a technical dossier to the Health Ministry before January 1st, 1996, to qualify for listing. All such products will have to be CE-marked by June 14th, 1998.</p><p>playing the system?</p><p>Clinica notes that under the standstill Directive, EEC 83/189, EU Member States may not adopt their own technical regulations in areas where European legislation exists or is in preparation. Some may speculate on whether France has found a way round this system by introducing additional technical requirements within its reimbursement system - which is not normally covered by European legislation. While it may be possible to prove that France has introduced unreasonable requirements in the context of the Treaty of Rome, by the time this could be officially proven the Medical Devices Directive will be fully enforced and these requirements will not apply.</p>
