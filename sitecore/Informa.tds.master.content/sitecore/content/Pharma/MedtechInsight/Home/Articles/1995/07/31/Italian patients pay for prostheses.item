<p>Italian patients will have to pay suppliers directly for their prostheses from September 15th. Industry says this will occur unless the government takes action to ensure prompt payment by state purchasers.</p><p>This Draconian threat has been made by industry in a bid to survive - manufacturers are wrestling with a series of externally-imposed financial problems that could lead to bankruptcy. The group of prostheses associations* that is threatening this action cites three main difficulties: the delay and problems surrounding the payment of old debts by the former local health authorities (USLs); the inability of the health service to meet the 90-day deadline for paying suppliers; and the government's delay in revising the reimbursement tariffs for prostheses - which have remained the same for four years despite increased costs of labour and materials.</p><p>worse than Greece</p><p>Suppliers to the Italian national health service have even more cause to complain than the Greeks - one Region, Calabria, takes an average of 650 days to pay its bills. The average payment delays in Italy are 324 days for medical devices (excluding electromedical equipment), compared with eight months in Greece. The Italian state owes between Lit 500,000 and 700,000 million ($310 and $430 million) for prostheses already received.</p><p>The association most severely affected by the decision - ANMIC, representing invalids - is supporting industry and is prepared to demonstrate on its behalf. It called a press conference on July 20th in Rome to denounce the government's lack of action which is "threatening industry's survival and the livelihoods of some 5,000 employees in the sector".</p><p>ANMIC also condemned the intolerable geographic inequalities which will result from industry being forced to take such action. Patients will continue to receive free treatment in regions which pay promptly, but will have to pay - if they can afford to - for their prostheses in other areas. They will then have to seek reimbursement from the local health authorities (USLs).</p><p>* The associations that are threatening this action are: the Italian Federation of Orthopaedic Technicians, FIOTO, the National Association of Audioprosthetists and the Italian Association of Distributors of Devices for Stomatised and Incontinent Patients.</p>
