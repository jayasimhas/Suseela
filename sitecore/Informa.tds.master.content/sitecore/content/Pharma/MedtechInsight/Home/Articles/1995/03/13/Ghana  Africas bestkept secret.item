<p>After suffering years of neglect and inadequate funding, Ghana's healthcare sector is to be the target of a "massive investment programme in hospitals and equipment". The government also aims to provide basic and primary care for 80% of the population by 2000, Ghana's Health Minister, Steve Obimpeh, told a recent UK Department of Trade and Industry seminar.</p><p>Although Ghana is successfully emerging from the economic despair and political disintegration of the 1970s, investment in the country's healthcare infrastructure is sorely needed. Most hospitals were built in the 1950s and are in urgent need of renovation and re-equipment, while some district hospitals date from as far back as the 1920s. In total, the Ministry of Health runs two teaching hospitals, eight regional hospitals, 36 district hospitals, 11 special hospitals, 82 health centres, 592 smaller health centres and posts and 259 clinics. Another 90 health facilities are controlled by religious organisations and by major companies for use by their employees.</p><p>In recognition of the serious crisis which the country's healthcare system was facing by the early 1980s, Ghana's government introduced a three-phase sector resuscitation programme. The first phase involved halting the deterioration of the sector; the second focused on rehabilitating and renovating the existing infrastructure; and the third phase aimed at expanding coverage of basic healthcare to rural areas. Substantial government resources were injected into healthcare, with per capita expenditure rising to $7 in 1993. Over the last decade, an average of 12% of total government expenditure has been devoted to the health sector.</p><p>Since 1993, Ghana's government has been drawing up a more comprehensive medium-term health infrastructure programme. It wants to shift the emphasis away from top-heavy control by the Ministry of Health and increase the level of service outside the capital, Accra. Since an increase in government funding for healthcare is unlikely to be available in the future, the introduction of a national health insurance scheme is now under consideration as a means of financing an improved system. The Ministry of Health has also created a special budget which releases an average of Cedis 70 million ($65,000) annually to each district health administration.</p><p>foreign aid</p><p>Foreign donors provided aid of around $54 million for Ghana's health sector projects during 1994, mainly in the form of laboratory equipment and training support. Both bilateral and multilateral aid via agencies such as the World Bank, the EU, the Overseas Development Administration and the African Development Bank are important sources of funding for healthcare projects in Ghana. Companies were urged by the DTI not to ignore multilateral aid despite the complexity with which it functions. Some $962 million was available through the World Bank for health and nutrition programmes in 1994.</p><p>The Health Sector Rehabilitation Project I, financed by the African Development Fund (ADF) and valued at around $25 million, is currently under way and comprises the following:</p><p>* rehabilitation of Korle-Bu Hospital, Accra; Komfo-Anokye Hospital, Kumasi; and Effia Nkwanta Hospital, Sekondi-Takoradi</p><p>* improvement of hospital maintenance</p><p>* improvement of hospital management</p><p>* strengthening of primary healthcare.</p><p>Project II, worth approximately $23 million and also ADF- funded, is to be carried out over a three-year period. It will include a major renovation programme at the district hospitals at Yendi, Keta and Kibi. Under Phase III of the Rehabilitation Project, ADF funding will be provided for the renewal of another two district hospitals. The district hospital network, which has suffered serious - and in some cases terminal - decline over the last decade, has been identified as the "nerve centre" for the revitalisation of Ghana's health system. In terms of new construction, the government believes 20 new district hospitals and 200 new health centres are needed. In addition, around five regional hospitals need complete re-equipping.</p><p>equipment</p><p>Much of the medical equipment in Ghana's hospitals is of western European origin, particularly from UK, German and Italian manufacturers. Companies seeking to enter the Ghanaian market must be able and willing to provide maintenance and spare parts for installed equipment, the DTI meeting was told. Without this commitment, they will not find long-term success.</p><p>As in other developing markets, the supreme importance of a good local agent was stressed. As healthcare provision expands to rural areas, a distribution network outside Accra is vital. Non-Ghanaian agents - often Indian or Lebanese - can be useful in helping companies avoid payment difficulties, since they can frequently arrange for payment to take place outside Ghana.</p><p>Ghana's future, both economically and politically, is "sufficiently promising to encourage cautious optimism", according to the British High Commission in Accra. As long as the donor community continues to recognise and support the progress already made under the Economic Recovery Programme, and as long as the existing political stability is maintained, "there is reason to believe that the next few years will see continued growth". Industry has tended to regard Africa as hopeless in business terms over the last decade, but Ghana must be considered profitable in the long term.</p><p>David Connolly at the DTI's Ghana Desk can be contacted on +44 171 215 4969.
