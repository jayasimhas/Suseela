<p>The current controversy over silicone breast implants is indicative of a far larger problem, HIMA's senior vice- president Jim Benson told the House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight subcommittees' hearing this month (see Clinica No 666, p 5). The breast implant controversy has raised alarms about the safety of silicone and the FDA's "unwillingness to acknowledge studies of the highest calibre" supporting the material's safety "is having an increasingly negative and harmful impact on patient care", Mr Benson charged. Availability of silicone "is seriously threatened".</p>

<p>The current controversy over silicone breast implants is indicative of a far larger problem, HIMA's senior vice- president Jim Benson told the House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight subcommittees' hearing this month (see Clinica No 666, p 5). The breast implant controversy has raised alarms about the safety of silicone and the FDA's "unwillingness to acknowledge studies of the highest calibre" supporting the material's safety "is having an increasingly negative and harmful impact on patient care", Mr Benson charged. Availability of silicone "is seriously threatened".</p><p>Lawsuits have proliferated, claimed Mr Benson. Some suppliers of silicone and other biomaterials are refusing to sell to medical device companies. Without silicone, hydrocephalus shunts, arthroplasty devices and catheters could not be produced. The availability of IV drip systems, pacemaker leads, implantable infusion pumps, wound drainage sets, wrist joint replacements, ostomy systems and grafts would be jeopardised, warned Mr Benson.</p><p>He urged subcommittee members to help pass the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act currently before Congress. This measure would limit the liability of raw material suppliers to instances of genuine fault. "This change would reduce the likelihood that these companies would be burdened with unwarranted or catastrophic lawsuits where they have met their contractual agreements and strictly adhered to contract specifications."</p><p>The FDA, advised Mr Benson, should change its "absolutist" mentality, characterised by an insistence that data demonstrate the precise or absolute determination of risk of a product or prove with total certainty that a product will or will not have a specific effect. If that certainty is not there, the agency too frequently concludes that the data are inadequate and, therefore, patient access must be delayed or denied.</p><p>Mr Benson told Clinica that comments made by FDA Commissioner David Kessler at the hearing made him hopeful that the biomaterials crisis would ease.</p>
