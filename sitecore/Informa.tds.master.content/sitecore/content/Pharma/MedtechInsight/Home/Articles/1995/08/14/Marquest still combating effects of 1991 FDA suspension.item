<p>Troubled Colorado-based Marquest has turned profitable in the first quarter of fiscal 1996 with the help of a one-off sale of an investment. Management describes the first-quarter results as showing "substantial improvement", but there is a long road to financial health for a company whose troubles stem from the US FDA's decision to suspend production for three months at the end of 1991. This led to a substantial fall in sales, the sacking of 350 employees, soaring losses and default on bonds.</p>

<p>Troubled Colorado-based Marquest has turned profitable in the first quarter of fiscal 1996 with the help of a one-off sale of an investment. Management describes the first-quarter results as showing "substantial improvement", but there is a long road to financial health for a company whose troubles stem from the US FDA's decision to suspend production for three months at the end of 1991. This led to a substantial fall in sales, the sacking of 350 employees, soaring losses and default on bonds.</p><p>For the three months ended July 1st, 1995, Marquest has reported an 8% increase in sales to $5.3 million. Costs fell 8% to $5.3 million, due to staff cuts and increased vertical integration of the manufacturing process. Because of a $200,000 gain, the first quarter turned in a small profit of $22,000. This compares with $1 million net loss in the previous year.</p><p>In fiscal 1995 (ended April 1st) Marquest's loss rose to $3.5 million from $2 million. Its sales suffered from reorganisation of the US distribution network. Fiscal 1995 revenues were $20.6 million, down 8.4% compared with the previous year. To bring the company back to financial health, Marquest has initiated numerous programmes, including the introduction of new products and the opening of a European distribution centre near Rotterdam earlier this year. It plans to install new equipment to automate manufacturing and reduce costs during the second and third quarters.</p><p>In the wake of the FDA suspension, Marquest was saved by a reorganisation in July 1993, financially supported by Scherer Healthcare (US). Scherer now holds a 44% stake in Marquest. Robert Scherer has been chairman and CEO since extensive management and board changes in February.</p><p>Scherer, the world's leading supplier of softgel gelatin capsules, intends to expand into higher-margin drug delivery technologies. Marquest's main product line is blood collection systems for diagnostic testing. It includes disposable blood gas syringes, mainly marketed under the trade names Gas-Lyte and Quik-ABG. It was this product line which Marquest sold to Scherer Healthcare in 1993 and leased back as part of a series of transactions to restructure the company financially.</p><p>Aerosol medication delivery systems, consisting primarily of disposable nebulisers, marketed under the trade names Acorn II and Whisperjet, are Marquest's second-largest line. Other products are heated humidification systems and anaesthesia and respiratory breathing systems including anaesthesia circuits, masks and filters.</p>
