<p>"If we do not see meaningful reform of the FDA during this Congress ... then I fear we may see an even bolder agency in the future," believes HIMA's president, Alan Magazine. Addressing the US industry association's annual meeting in Palm Springs, California, on March 19th, Mr Magazine urged device manufacturers to seize the opportunity to "redraw the regulatory map" by lobbying Congress. "Lack of action by Congress now," he warned, "could be interpreted by some as a silent endorsement of today's FDA."</p>

<p>"If we do not see meaningful reform of the FDA during this Congress ... then I fear we may see an even bolder agency in the future," believes HIMA's president, Alan Magazine. Addressing the US industry association's annual meeting in Palm Springs, California, on March 19th, Mr Magazine urged device manufacturers to seize the opportunity to "redraw the regulatory map" by lobbying Congress. "Lack of action by Congress now," he warned, "could be interpreted by some as a silent endorsement of today's FDA."</p><p>"Top-level" support for some administrative and legislative changes has been gained from liaison between HIMA and the White House. The announcement by President Clinton on March 16th of policy changes in device and drug regulation will be followed by more initiatives later this month.</p><p>first proposals</p><p>The exemption of 140 medical device categories from premarket review - in addition to the 441 categories of low-risk devices already exempt - is expected to reduce the FDA's review workload by around 700 submissions a year. The director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Dr Bruce Burlington, told delegates that the agency is currently drafting a regulation to reclassify 140 Class II low risk device categories to Class I, which will then be exempt from 510(k) notification. This list will include the 16 Class I, tier I products not included in the December 1994 list (see Clinica No 634, p 7).</p><p>Devices which will be exempt include oxygen masks, anaesthetic gas masks, general surgical lasers, piston syringes, immunoglobulin G-test systems, prosthetic heart valve holders, urine flow/volume measuring systems, scented or scented- deodorised menstrual pads, powdered finger exercisers, radiological patient cradles and ophthalmic trial lens sets.</p><p>President Clinton also announced the elimination of the Reference List. "But before you stand up and cheer," said Mr Magazine, "a bit of caution is in order." Just how far this policy change extends is unclear. While the FDA is to eliminate the Reference List, the programme will be restructured "so that pending applications would only be deferred if there were specific GMP violations directly applicable to that device, or if there were systemic violations that would affect the device," according to the FDA. "If the 510(k) were deferred, FDA would reinspect the firm within 60 days after being notified by the company that the GMP problems had been corrected, or would determine that a reinspection was not needed."</p><p>HIMA intends to urge the House Appropriations Committee to axe funding for the Reference List when it appears before the Committee on April 3rd.</p><p>health and safety</p><p>The Clinton proposals also include a health and safety exception which the FDA may use. The government intends to offer small businesses in violation of regulations an opportunity to avoid punitive action by correcting the violations within a timeframe appropriate to the hazard. This will apply to first-time violations where there has been good faith in efforts to comply with regulations and the violation does not involve significant health and safety concerns or criminal wrongdoing. In these circumstances the government will also waive up to 100% of any punitive fine if the same sum is used to correct the violation.</p><p>more reform</p><p>Two further initiatives due to be announced this month include a pilot programme for third-party review for eight to ten groups of products and a request for Congress to waive export approval for unapproved devices requested by foreign countries. While Dr Burlington is not opposed to outside review, he noted that the European notified body system would need to be adapted to meet societal concerns and values in the US. He pointed out there is no basis for a 510(k) notification procedure in Europe and that expectations differ on conflicts of interest and disclosure of information.</p><p>The export approval procedure has already been improved, according to Dr Burlington, with review times for exports down to 16 days from an average 65 days in fiscal 1993. Further changes are feasible, he added.</p><p>Yet more FDA policy reforms can be expected to be announced by the Clinton Administration in the next few weeks. However, regulatory reform will not be easy, warned Mr Magazine, for although the Republicans control Congress "they are not uniform in their views and the actual size of their majorities in both branches is relatively small, especially in the Senate."</p>
