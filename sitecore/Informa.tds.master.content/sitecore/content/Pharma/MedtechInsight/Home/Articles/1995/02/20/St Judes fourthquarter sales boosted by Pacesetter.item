<p>Fourth-quarter sales at St Jude (US) rose 179% to $164 million due to the inclusion of Pacesetter's sales which, according to St Jude, exceeded $105 million. The company describes the market for heart valves as "sluggish" and sales as flat in the fourth quarter compared with the previous year. "Pacesetter's strong results helped offset the weakness in the heart valve market, which illustrates the importance of diversifying our business," says CEO Ronald Matricaria.</p>
