<p><strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>'s automated ligase chain reaction (LCR) test for chlamydia gives 30% better detection than the current gold standard, endocervical culture. Compared with an expanded gold standard - culture positive and culture negative confirmed LCR-positive women - the automated test has a sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 99.9% respectively, according to results published in The Lancet (January 28th). The sensitivity of culture against the expanded gold standard is 65%.</p>

<p><strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>'s automated ligase chain reaction (LCR) test for chlamydia gives 30% better detection than the current gold standard, endocervical culture. Compared with an expanded gold standard - culture positive and culture negative confirmed LCR-positive women - the automated test has a sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 99.9% respectively, according to results published in The Lancet (January 28th). The sensitivity of culture against the expanded gold standard is 65%.</p><p>This increased sensitivity in a urine test is impressive because the urethra is involved in only 50% of cases in women. The test is probably able to detect more infections, say the report's authors, because of the high specificity of LCR itself but also because sufficient material from the vagina may find its way onto the perineum to be washed away in urine. While LCR can detect fewer than five copies of chlamydia plasmid DNA, as many as 35% of endocervical samples are thought to be inadequate, says Abbott scientist and lead author Dr Helen Lee. Dr Lee points out that there are considerable differences between sites conducting culture tests, while the sensitivity of LCR was similar at all four study centres.</p><p>tunnel vision danger?</p><p>However the prospect of LCR-screening raises fears in some quarters. If results are replicated in clinical practice and LCR screening becomes widespread, physicians might lose the chance to diagnose other STDs and reproductive problems during a pelvic examination, says Dr Gordon Scott, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary in a cautionary Lancet editorial. If the amplification test relies on the transfer of chlamydia from the cervix to perineum, activities such as washing and the use of tampons may affect its accuracy, he says. Dr Lee's team, on the other hand, thinks the greater acceptability of a non-invasive procedure and potential savings by reducing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) will be important considerations for screening programmes.</p><p>Treatment of chlamydia is relatively cheap but the infection is silent in most of its victims. The cost of the disease comes mainly from hospitalisation of women for PID. "Cost control relies on accurate diagnosis," says Dr Lee.</p><p>Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the developed world. As many as 70% of infected women are unaware of their status. Some 275,000 women are hospitalised for PID every year in the US and 100,000 undergo some sort of surgical procedure. Around 20% of the treated women will become infertile because of the infection. Over half of babies born vaginally to infected women will develop pneumonia or trachoma. The eye infection, trachoma, affects millions in the developing world.</p><p>The test was filed for 510(k) clearance in late 1993 and submissions are required for France and Japan. Dr Lee says Abbott hopes to launch the test on its LCx system, outside these territories, in the next few months.</p>
