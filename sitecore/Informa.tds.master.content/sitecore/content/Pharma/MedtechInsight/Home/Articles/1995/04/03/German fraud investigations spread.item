<p>Inquiries into heart valve price abuse in Germany are to widen to other implantables, particularly pacemakers, and replacement parts for heart-lung machines.

<p>Inquiries into heart valve price abuse in Germany are to widen to other implantables, particularly pacemakers, and replacement parts for heart-lung machines. Investigators have indicated to Clinica that some 3,000 files confiscated from clinics and manufacturers last year show that price abuse is more widespread than was originally thought.</p><p>evidence of fraud</p><p>The decision to widen the inquiry follows completion of examination of the first 1,000 files, which relate primarily to heart valve sales. These allegedly show evidence of favours from companies to doctors, incorrect financial calculations and, in some cases, fraud. The investigation centres on the German subsidiaries of three heart valve manufacturers: St Jude Medical (US), <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> (US) and Sorin Biomedica (Italy). These supply 80% of the DM 95 million German heart valve market.</p><p>Abuses so far uncovered include a doctor whose office was refurbished for DM 15,000 ($10,700) and physicians sent with their partners on a DM 90,000 group holiday. In return, the doctors are alleged to have allowed companies to inflate the prices of their heart valves, the costs of which were borne by the Krankenkassen (see Clinica No 606/7, pp 4-5).</p><p>A spokesman for the profecutor's office in Wuppertal, North Rhine Westphalia, investigating on behalf of the Krankenkassen, told Clinica that 1,500 doctors and administrators and 250 clinics are implicated. The size of the problem, and its interest to the public who finance the Krankenkassen, means that the indications of more widespread abuses will also be followed up.</p><p>court proceedings due</p><p>The prosecutor's office expects to complete its investigations of the heart valve allegations in about six months. It will then initiate legal proceedings for individual cases.</p>
