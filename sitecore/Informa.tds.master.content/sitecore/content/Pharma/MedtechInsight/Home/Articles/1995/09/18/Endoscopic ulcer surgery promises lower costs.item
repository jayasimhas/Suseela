<p>An endoscopic technique pioneered in Germany could improve venous leg ulcer treatment and may even cut costs. SEPS (subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery) is performed using an angulated scope with offset fibreoptic lighting and a video camera, to locate incompetent veins for clipping or coagulation. It needs only a small incision in the upper third of the lower leg - above the affected site.</p>

<p>An endoscopic technique pioneered in Germany could improve venous leg ulcer treatment and may even cut costs. SEPS (subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery) is performed using an angulated scope with offset fibreoptic lighting and a video camera, to locate incompetent veins for clipping or coagulation. It needs only a small incision in the upper third of the lower leg - above the affected site.</p><p>Ethicon Endo-Surgery has developed a 5 mm vein clipper for the procedure, which was the subject of a satellite session at the XIIth World Congress of the Union Internationale de Phlebologie in London (September 3rd-8th). The disposable clipper is a smaller version of Ethicon's successful cholecystectomy device.</p><p>cost-effectiveness study</p><p>Speakers at the session all agreed that SEPS is superior to open surgery and believe it has a higher cure rate than compression therapy. However they also felt that hard data on cost-effectiveness are lacking. Ethicon is sponsoring an outcomes study comparing SEPS to compression therapy. The trial, co-ordinated by professor Fritz Beske, director of the Institute for Health Systems Research, Kiel, Germany, will attempt to prove that endoscopic treatment results in greater cost savings and better quality of life than compression bandage therapy.</p><p>Hospital stay, out-patient care, GP consultations, prescriptions, dressings, sick leave and recurrence rate will be compared. An indirect cost arm will also take account of the time commitment given by relatives of the patients. Professor Beske, was Secretary of State in the Schleswig-Holstein Ministry of Social Affairs from 1971 to 1981.</p><p>Dr Cees Wittens of St Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, predicts that recurrence with SEPS should be less than 10% in the not-too-distant future. A trial of endoscopy versus the Linton technique in his hospital was terminated because of the unacceptably high wound complication rate for the open technique. Only 30 patients have been followed-up but already the difference is highly significant, he said.</p><p>Open surgery, which was pioneered by Robert Linton in the 1930s, requires a large medial incision. This passes through the ulcer itself, which leads to skin necrosis and wound infection in 50-60% of cases. Recurrence is high and hospitalisation tends to be long. As well as wound healing problems, the open procedure can provoke deep vein thrombosis, because of the long periods of leg elevation. It leaves a large scar which has a high risk of deterioration.</p><p>The non-invasive technique compression bandage therapy has a high recurrence rate - 49% at three months and 22-69% at one year from healing.</p><p>SEPS was pioneered in the mid 1980s by Dr Gerald Hauer, of the department of surgery at the Weilheim Hospital, Germany, who first introduced the angulated scope, lighting and camera. However, only recently have purpose-built scopes, fibres and cameras become widely available. A live procedure, performed by Dr Hauer was transmitted to the satellite session from the Middlesex Hospital.</p><p>As many as 15% of the UK population will suffer from varicose veins and at any one time 100,000 have leg ulcers which require treatment. Treatment with leg bandages is estimated to cost the NHS between &pound;300 and &pound;600 million a year. In the Lothian and Forth Valley study 66% of patients treated with leg bandages had multiple episodes of venous ulceration over a five year follow-up period.</p><p>Dr Olle Nelzen a consultant vascular surgeon at Karnsjukhuset in Skovde, Sweden, has performed 70 procedures since 1993. He believes the technique is easy to learn and perform. He said that 80% of cases can be performed as day surgery. Sick leave is 14 days on average. However, although complications are low, 33% of patients have some sort of complaint. One-sixth of patients reported pain and 10% had haematoma.</p><p>Dr Gerhard Sattler of the Darmstadt clinical hospital, Germany has performed over 1,000 Hauer procedures. He says the technique allows the surgeon to locate perforating veins, diagnose pathological changes and perform treatment at the same time. He says wound infection occurred in only 0.5% of the 1,054 cases he has performed.</p>
