<p>Nine more Class I devices have been added to the list of devices for which US premarket notification is not required. The FDA is also proposing to exempt another 12 Class I device categories from the 510(k) process and reclassify and exempt 112 devices. It has decided not to grant exemptions to seven devices.</p><p>Added to the 148 devices already exempted from the 510(k) process are the following:</p><pre>clinical sample concentrators beta or gamma counters for clinical use clinical electrophoresis apparatus plasma oncometers for clinical use refractometers for clinical use plasma viscometers for clinical use retentive and splinting pins root canal posts anaesthetic warmers</pre><p>The seven devices for which proposed exemption has been withdrawn include: thin-layer chromatography systems for clinical use; culture animal and human cells; lactoferrin immunological test systems; breathing mouthpieces; rebreathing devices; nonpowered oxygen tents; and nonprescription sunglasses. The FDA says in the Federal Register notice (July 28th) that it is still reviewing the numerous comments concerning the proposed limited exemption for sunglasses and is considering appropriate ways in which exemption might be achieved.</p><p>further additions to list</p><p>The FDA is proposing to add another 12 devices to the 510(k) exemption list:</p><pre>chromatographic separation material for clinical use dental floss (including devices made of inert materials) acoustic chambers for audiometric testing ear, nose and throat bur nasopharyngeal catheters otoscopes nonpowered breast pumps unscented menstrual pads cast removal instruments (AC powered) personnel protective shields flotation cushions traction accessories</pre><p>Reclassification of 112 devices from Class II to Class I is also proposed by the agency, effective August 28th.
