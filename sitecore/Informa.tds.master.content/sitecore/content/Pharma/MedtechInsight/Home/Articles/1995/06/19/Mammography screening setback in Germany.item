<p>Germany's first publicly-funded mammography screening programme has been banned by the federal insurance office. The office has ordered the Hamburg-based Technikerkrankenkasse (TK) to stop its free screening of women over 50, a scheme set up in March (see Clinica No 644, p 6), following criticism by medical bodies. The TK will challenge the decision in the Hamburg Social Court.</p>

<p>Germany's first publicly-funded mammography screening programme has been banned by the federal insurance office. The office has ordered the Hamburg-based Technikerkrankenkasse (TK) to stop its free screening of women over 50, a scheme set up in March (see Clinica No 644, p 6), following criticism by medical bodies. The TK will challenge the decision in the Hamburg Social Court.</p><p>The insurance office claims that a mammography screening programme is only allowable if it meets guidelines set by the federal committee of doctors and Krankenkassen. The committee agreed in May to consider setting up screening programmes but insisted that a federal body be established to co-ordinate this (see Clinica No 655, p 5).</p><p>The insurance office also questions the safety of the TK programme, saying that quality standards recommended in the German Mammography Study "could not be assured under the chosen programme procedure".</p><p>more attacks</p><p>Other organisations have added to the criticism. The federal doctors association (KBV) stresses that although it supports mammography screening, it still welcomes the insurance office's ruling. According to Wolfgang Mohr, responsible for outpatient quality assurance within the KBV, the Mainz-based Lander X-ray Committee has already spoken out against the screening programme, saying it infringes radiology safety guidelines. Dr Mohr also suggests that the TK has its eye on 1996, when the Krankenkassen must begin competing for customers. "We completely reject the use of examinations of this type as a marketing tool," he says.</p><p>The TK believes the ban is illegal and has asked the Hamburg Social Court to overturn it immediately. According to managing director Klaus-Uwe Stark, suggestions that the TK is putting an unnecessary radiological burden on its members are contradicted by international studies: "We believe that this procedure can reduce deaths from breast cancer by at least 30%," he says. He acknowledges that the federal committee of doctors and Krankenkassen is looking at screening programmes, but adds: "It could be years until this lifesaving procedure is available. We can spare our members that delay."</p><p>Some 371,000 women have received "mammography cheques" from the TK. These will now have to be informed that breast X-rays not requested by a doctor will not be reimbursed.</p>
