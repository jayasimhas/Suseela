<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb (US) has added a further $750 million to its breast implant settlement provision. The company had already made a charge of $500 million in 1993 and insurance cover is expected to add $1,000 million to settlement and litigation costs. BMS warns that the final bill may rise further but does not expect a settlement to occur before late 1995. The latest rise in provisions has become necessary because a larger-than-expected number of claimants has opted out of the settlement.</p>
