<p>In line with the UK Medical Devices Agency's plans to recover certain costs involved in implementing the medical device Directives, the agency is proposing to charge fees for specific services with effect from April this year. Manufacturers which intend to make medical devices available for clinical investigation will be charged a notification fee based on the risk level of the device. The agency also intends to charge for designating certification organisations as notified bodies.</p>

<p>In line with the UK Medical Devices Agency's plans to recover certain costs involved in implementing the medical device Directives, the agency is proposing to charge fees for specific services with effect from April this year. Manufacturers which intend to make medical devices available for clinical investigation will be charged a notification fee based on the risk level of the device. The agency also intends to charge for designating certification organisations as notified bodies.</p><p>In its consultation letter on the proposed charges, the MDA says the fees have been calculated strictly on the number of man-hours likely to be involved, including overheads. Levels have been kept as low as possible, it adds.</p><pre>Proposed MDA fees for medical devices Clinical investigations Group A Group B Notice &pound;3,000 &pound;900 except where this is a second or subsequent notice for previously prohibited indication &pound;2,100 &pound;650 Notice withdrawn within 5 days of receipt &pound;1,500 &pound;450 Notified Body Designation Application &pound;1,300 Additional application for previously rejected application &pound;400 Material extension to scope of designation &pound;1,300 Application withdrawn within 21 days of receipt &pound;650 Notes: Group A = Class I, IIa or IIb, other than implantable or long-term invasive devices; Group B = Class IIb implantable or long-term invasive, Class III or active implantable devices.</pre><p>Inspection fees for notified bodies' and manufacturers' premises would be in the region of &pound;1,600 to &pound;2,700 (plus out-of-pocket expenses), depending on the type of inspection involved.</p><p>While calculation of compliance cost assessments for notified bodies has been possible, the MDA notes that "the cost to industry of charging for pre-clinical investigation assessment is more problematic". It is therefore seeking details from manufacturers of the number of clinical investigations they intend to carry out over the next three years and for which category of device.* Comments should be sent in writing, by March 17th, 1995, to Larry Keany, Room 618, MDA, 14 Russell Square, London WC1B 5EP. Fax: (0171) 972 8112.</p>
