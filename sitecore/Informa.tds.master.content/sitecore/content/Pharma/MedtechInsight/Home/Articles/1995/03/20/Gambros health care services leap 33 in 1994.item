During the year, REN, the US dialysis clinic chain in which Gambro has a majority stake, established new clinics in the eastern US and in Europe, particularly in Italy and Sweden.

<p>Gambro's health care services division reported the greatest rise in sales of all the Swedish company's business areas during 1994, increasing 33.1% to SKr 1,153 million ($158 million). During the year, REN, the US dialysis clinic chain in which Gambro has a majority stake, established new clinics in the eastern US and in Europe, particularly in Italy and Sweden. Gambro plans to give investment priority to this business sector so that it becomes the company's second largest division as early as this year.</p><p>Strong sales growth - 19.3% to SKr 735 million - was also experienced by the blood component technology business. Growing demand for blood platelets used in cancer therapy ensured increased sales of Gambro's Spectra blood separator and related disposables. The establishment of the company's own sales organisation in Japan "resulted in a strong rise in sales" in that market. R&D activities in this segment included the development of a bioreactor in collaboration with US biosciences company Aastrom. This investment is expected to enable Gambro to offer a completely new technology for stem-cell transplants within the next few years.</p><pre>Sales by business area 1994 SKr millions 1994 1993 % change Renal care 6,389 5,950 +7.4 Cardiovascular surgery 1,219 1,178 +3.5 Intensive care & anaesthesia* 311 436 -28.7 Blood component technology 735 616 +19.3 Health care services 1,153 866 +33.1 TOTAL 9,807 9,046 +8.4 * The intensive care and anaesthesia business was sold to Instrumentarium (Finland) in 1994 (see Clinica No 618/9, p 23) Sales and operating income by sector 1994 SKr millions 1994 1993 % change Sales Medical devices 8,724 8,232 +6.0 Health care services 1,153 866 +33.1 Operating income Medical devices 1,382 1,321 +4.6 Health care services 101 51 +98.0</pre><p>In renal care, sales of dialysis machines and blood lines were "very good" in the US, although economic restraints in Italy resulted in slightly lower growth than in 1993. Gambro launched a number of new peritoneal dialysis products during the year.</p><p>The market launch of the new plate oxygenator by the cardiovascular surgery division "took longer than expected for technical manufacturing reasons". The market responded positively to the introduction in the second half of 1994 of the BRAT 2 autotransfusion system, the company says.</p><p>Group net income rose 15% to SKr 690 million. Earnings per share grew 12.3% to SKr 5.85.</p>
