<p>Controversy has arisen in Germany over the denial of additional compensation to some 7,000 east German women infected with hepatitis C virus by immunoglobin given post partum in the late 1970s. In 1978, serum from infected donors was used in preparations administered to rhesus-negative women, despite the fact that the donor's status was known. Some 2,600 women contracted chronic hepatitis or liver cancer, and an unknown number of babies were infected through breast-feeding, reports The Lancet.</p>

<p>Controversy has arisen in Germany over the denial of additional compensation to some 7,000 east German women infected with hepatitis C virus by immunoglobin given post partum in the late 1970s. In 1978, serum from infected donors was used in preparations administered to rhesus-negative women, despite the fact that the donor's status was known. Some 2,600 women contracted chronic hepatitis or liver cancer, and an unknown number of babies were infected through breast-feeding, reports The Lancet.</p><p>The women were kept in quarantine and separated from their children for several months, but received only a small amount of compensation. Their plight came to the fore again recently when they were invited for follow-up by local health authorities. While they can apply for moderate financial support, they will receive no further compensation (unlike HIV-infected haemophiliacs).</p>
