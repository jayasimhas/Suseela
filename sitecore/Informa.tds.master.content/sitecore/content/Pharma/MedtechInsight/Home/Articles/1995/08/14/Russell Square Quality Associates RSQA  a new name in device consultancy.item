<p>Advice on CE marking for devices from surgical gloves to CT scanners is available from a new consultancy service in the UK. Russell Square Quality Associates has been formed by senior technical staff from the Manufacturer Registration Scheme of the UK Medical Devices Agency to provide training, quality systems auditing and technical advice to the industry.</p><p>Microbiologist Carol MacDonald and engineer Ron Clark will be joined in September by Will Burton, a pharmacist and currently professional head of the MRS. RSQA will incorporate the expertise of associates who are also ex-MDA medical device experts. The group has gained experience from running the MRS, which will become obsolete in June 1998 when the Medical Device Directive becomes mandatory.</p><p>RSQA has already been contracted to provide internal audit training on behalf of the Scottish Biomedical Association, in partnership with another consultancy. The directors see training as a major part of its activities, with courses tailored to suit individual clients' needs.</p><p>From their experience at the MDA, the directors of RSQA believe that companies - large and small - are often uncertain which conformity assessment procedure is appropriate to obtain CE marking for a particular device. "Even self-declaration is less easy than it sounds," says Mr Clark. The consultants will provide advice on which route to follow, how to meet the requirements of the route chosen and which questions need to be asked in choosing a Notified Body.</p><p>Prior to its official launch this month, RSQA has already received interest from companies in far-flung places, such as Taiwan, South Africa and the US. Interest in obtaining CE marking is expected to increase as more companies seek to enter the European market.</p><p>Russell Square Quality Associates is based at Unit 112, the Chandlery, 50 Westminster Bridge Rd, London SE1 7QY, UK. Tel: +44 (171) 721 7680. Fax: +44 (171) 721 7681.</p>
