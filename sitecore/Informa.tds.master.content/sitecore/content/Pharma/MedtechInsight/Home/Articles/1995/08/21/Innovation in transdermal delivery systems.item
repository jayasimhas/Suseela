<p>New <strong>[C#199901331:transdermal]</strong> drug delivery systems received considerable attention at the Controlled Release Society's 22nd international symposium in Seattle, Washington, US, late last month. Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers described their use of ultrasound to transport drugs through the skin (see this page). Medicines passively diffusing - not permeating - at a slow rate are most enhanced by the application of ultrasound, they reported.</p><p>Cygnus Therapeutic Systems scientists discussed a continuously-worn patch for diabetics "that will pull up the glucose using iontophoresis, where you do not have to prick your finger, and you can measure the glucose on a continuous basis".</p><p>At Science University, Tokyo, Japanese researchers have produced a microdevice (through photoetching) that delivers insulin transdermally. "This microdevice electrode can effectively utilise the skin by preventing localisation of current distribution, which minimises the skin damage caused by current burns."</p><p><strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong> representatives from Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, told the conference that iontophoresis may facilitate a more consistent absorption profile. It could also reduce lag times, increase and control flux and expand candidate drugs compared with passive transdermal systems.</p>
