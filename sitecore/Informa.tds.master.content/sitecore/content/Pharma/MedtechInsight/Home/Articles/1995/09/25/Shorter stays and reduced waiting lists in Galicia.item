<p>Hospital stays and waiting lists for surgery in Galicia, Spain, have both been reduced by 20% since December 1993, reveal Sergas health authority figures. In spite of the seven-week strike over the summer, surgical waiting lists fell from 28,286 at the end of 1993 to 22,168 last July. The number of patients waiting over a year fell by almost 80% and by almost half for patients waiting six to 12 months. This can be attributed to an increase in productivity at hospitals and better use of health centres, says Sergas.</p>
