<p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche reported a 26% fall in diagnostics sales to SwFr 602 million ($506 million) in the first half of the year. Much of the decline is due to the strong Swiss franc, but even in local currencies diagnostics revenues fell 16% because only one month's worth of revenues from Roche Biomedical Laboratories was included in the 1995 figure. Roche merged its US clinical laboratory network with National Health Laboratories to form LabCorp, the world's largest clinical laboratory (see Clinica No 653, p 15). Roche's 49.9% share in LabCorp's sales in May and June amounted to SwFr 171 million.</p>

<p>Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche reported a 26% fall in diagnostics sales to SwFr 602 million ($506 million) in the first half of the year. Much of the decline is due to the strong Swiss franc, but even in local currencies diagnostics revenues fell 16% because only one month's worth of revenues from Roche Biomedical Laboratories was included in the 1995 figure. Roche merged its US clinical laboratory network with National Health Laboratories to form LabCorp, the world's largest clinical laboratory (see Clinica No 653, p 15). Roche's 49.9% share in LabCorp's sales in May and June amounted to SwFr 171 million.</p><p>Roche stresses that despite a contracting diagnostics market, sales of diagnostic systems rose significantly, stimulated by the introduction of a new generation of instruments. The Cobas Integra analyser and Cobas Micros, a new haematology instrument, were launched in several markets. Cobas Amplicor, a new-generation automated system for PCR testing, is due to be launched in October (see Clinica No 662, p 18).</p><p>Roche's total revenues in the first half were SwFr 7,495 million, up only 2% compared with the previous year, dampened by the strong Swiss franc. Net income improved 18% to SwFr 1,912 million.</p>
