<p>Ultra-high-energy SPECT was the hot topic at the 2nd International Conference of Nuclear Cardiology held in Cannes, France (April 23rd-26th). David Firn reports on product news.</p><p>Fluorine(18)-PET provides exquisite images of myocardial metabolism but a high quality system costs about $1.5-2.5 million and only a few leading research centres offer the service. It is unlikely that PET will become more widespread, but several companies are developing 18-F SPECT. The images are not as good as PET but they are good enough for clinical use at a fraction of the cost, say the experts.</p><p>Elscint presents 511 keV SPECT data</p><p>Elscint (Israel) has been collaborating with Professors Martin Sandler and James Petton of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, US, on dual isotope imaging for some time (see Clinica No 634, p 20). In the last 18 months the team has been applying the technique to cardiac imaging. By performing 18-FDG (fluoro-deoxyglucose) and 99-Tc MIBI procedures in a single SPECT protocol, the Vanderbilt team has been able to produce maps of both metabolic and perfusion data.</p><p>The researchers use a modified APEX-Helix gamma-camera with a high-energy collimator and a software switch to allow imaging at both 511 and 140 keV. The high-energy collimator weighs 142 kg compared with 40 kg for Helix' low-energy system. "It gives lower <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> and less plane source sensitivity than PET [18-FDG PET is about eight times more sensitive than SPECT] but we feel it is good enough for clinical imaging," said Prof Sandler. Helix' 3/8" crystals are only 13% efficient at 511 keV and the electronics ignore coincidence emission data.</p><p>By combining 18-FDG and MIBI perfusion images, the system can identify and display reversibly ischaemic regions with less imaging time and lower cost than a dual-system study, says Prof Sandler. There is a mismatch of up to 2 mm between FDG and MIBI images, said Prof Petton, but like Prof Sandler, he believes this is good enough for clinical decision-making.</p><p>Professor Petton presented clinical data from a group of 179 patients. Dual-isotope, single-acquisition rest testing is 100% sensitive and has a positive predictive value of 99%, after catheterisation, he said. A rest/stress protocol has 100% sensitivity and a positive predictive value of 88% for cardiac events. He attributed most of the false positives to MIBI image attenuation in the inferior wall of the heart. To overcome this problem the group now images patients in the prone position.</p><p>The Vanderbilt group is performing the 140-minute protocol on 15-20 patients a week.</p>
