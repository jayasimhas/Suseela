<p>Ophthalin, the hyaluronic acid product developed by Skandigen's UK subsidiary, Fermentech Medical, for use in cataract surgery, is expected to take 15% of the $100 million market for visco-elastics in Europe by 1998.</p><p>Fermentech, in which the Swedish biotech venture capital company holds a 97% stake, was certified in the UK earlier this year as a manufacturer of visco-elastic materials for use in ophthalmic surgery. Ophthalin will be marketed worldwide (excluding the US) by Ciba Vision. It has been launched in the UK and Germany this spring and launches in the rest of Europe are expected soon. Approval applications are being prepared in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. The world market for ophthalmic visco-elastics is estimated at more than $300 million.</p><p>Fermentech, which is developing a second HA product, Opthease, for dry eye syndrome, reported sales of SKr 400,000 ($57,000) in 1994, down by 89% on the previous year, mainly because of the discontinuation of protein A sales. An operating loss of SKr 18 million, about the same as in 1993, was incurred.</p><p>Sales by the Swedish company Gramma Diagnostik, in which Skandigen holds a 92% stake, were flat at SKr 60,000 last year, while its operating loss fell slightly to SKr 400,000. Sales of Gramma's whooping cough test are expected to rise this year; two further tests - for mycoplasma and for Helicobacter pylori - are expected to be launched in Europe and Scandinavia later this year by Euro-Diagnostica, which holds marketing rights to all three products.</p><p>US sales of Biostar's Group A streptococcus screening test were $3.8 million last year, representing about 5% of the total US market. The company's rapid diagnostic test for chlamydia is awaiting FDA approval. Skandigen owns 4% of Biostar directly, and a further 12% indirectly. S-100, a biochemical marker for malignant melanoma developed by InRo Biomedtek, a Swedish firm in which Skandigen has a 33% stake, is to be marketed by Sangtec Medical (Sweden) next year. Sangtec also holds an option to market the ELISA version of S-100, which is manufactured by InRo and Medisera (Sweden).</p><p>Skandigen reported revenues of SKr 23.7 million in 1994, most of which came from the sale of Siska Diagnostics to Organon Teknika. In the previous year sales were SKr 4 million. Due to these increased revenues, Skandigen moved into the black with net income of SKr 788,000 compared with a loss of SKr 25 million in 1993.</p>
