<p>Nuclear imaging represents a bright spot in the Western European imaging market with revenues forecast by Frost & Sullivan to grow to $319 million by 2000 from $210 million in 1994. Driven by SPECT, the nuclear imaging market has held its own in a climate which has seen other modalities suffer lost revenues.</p>

<p>Nuclear imaging represents a bright spot in the Western European imaging market with revenues forecast by Frost & Sullivan to grow to $319 million by 2000 from $210 million in 1994. Driven by SPECT, the nuclear imaging market has held its own in a climate which has seen other modalities suffer lost revenues.</p><p>PET imaging systems are predicted to increase market share from 31% to 42% by the year 2000. Frost & Sullivan says that this former "Cinderella modality" will see sales grow to $130 million, driven by lower unit prices and an increased range of applications. Gamma cameras are expected to see their market share eroded from a dominant 53.5% to 47.5% by the end of the decade with revenues of $151.2 million. Gamma camera-based nuclear imaging computers will see market share fall, accounting for the remaining 10% of the sector.</p><pre>European market for nuclear imaging equipment 1994-2000 Revenues ($ millions) Units (No) 1994 210.1 331 1995 239.9 351 1996 267.9 369 1997 284.8 381 1998 296.1 389 1999 307.3 401 2000 318.9 410 Source: Frost & Sullivan</pre><p>Few companies can now afford to offer the full range of CT, MRI, ultrasound and nuclear imaging, notes Frost & Sullivan: declining markets have seen companies retain their specialisations.</p><p>Smaller concerns, which have dominated new nuclear imaging technology, are poised to increase market share as multinationals withdraw.</p><p>Distributors are likely to play a increasingly important role as geographical market expansion moves beyond the big four of France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Not only will relatively untouched countries in western and southern Europe become critical, but eastern Europe will take on greater importance. The Russian and Eastern European market, currently valued at $9.7 million, is forecast to grow to $14 million by the end of the decade.</p><p>Copies of Frost & Sullivan's report on the European nuclear imaging market are available from Clinica Reports - Ref CBS 554. Price: &pound;2,450/$3,800 (US orders)/$3,850 (orders outside US)/ Y588,000.
