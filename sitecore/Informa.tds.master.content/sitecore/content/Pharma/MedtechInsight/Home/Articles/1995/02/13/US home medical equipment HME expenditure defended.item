<p>Although US Medicare expenditures for home care services have grown in recent years, home care has played a significant role in helping to reduce overall costs, according to testimony given at a House committee on February 6th. Representing the National Association for Medical Equipment Services and home medical equipment (HME) providers, Richard Doherty urged the House Ways & Means health subcommittee to consider the industry's role in providing "greater value to the Medicare programme".</p>

<p>Although US Medicare expenditures for home care services have grown in recent years, home care has played a significant role in helping to reduce overall costs, according to testimony given at a House committee on February 6th. Representing the National Association for Medical Equipment Services and home medical equipment (HME) providers, Richard Doherty urged the House Ways & Means health subcommittee to consider the industry's role in providing "greater value to the Medicare programme".</p><p>"It is important to restate that total Medicare outlays for home care are a combination of the cost of the equipment services and rate of utilisation," he said in a presentation prepared in collaboration with HIMA. Furthermore, "the trend in the per unit cost for HME services has been steadily downward for the past decade, even though Medicare expenditures have gone up, which is directly a function of utilisation."</p><p>The number of Americans over 65 who are eligible for Medicare benefits is projected to grow 25% from 30.5 million in 1984 to 37 million this year. Technological advances have enabled an increasing array of new home care services and equipment for post-acute and chronic patients who would otherwise have required hospital treatment, said Mr Doherty.</p>
