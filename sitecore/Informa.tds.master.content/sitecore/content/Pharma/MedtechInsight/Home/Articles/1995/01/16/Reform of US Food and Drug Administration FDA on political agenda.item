<p>The US FDA's slow methods of approving medical technology just might change - or become irrelevant, notes Clinica's Washington correspondent Duffy Miller. The Republicans now in control of Congress are sympathetic to critics' charges against the agency. Influential groups are pressing for reform.</p><p>The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think-tank with close ties to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, held a Washington press conference on January 11th to urge major changes in the FDA. The CEI proposes that it be altered from an agency with veto power into a certification body - along the lines of European device regulation. Safety and efficacy standards would remain the same but - instead of being banned outright - devices and drugs that do not meet agency criteria would be available by prescription, with clear warning of their unapproved status. "A new option would be created for patients who had to go beyond the circle of FDA-approved therapies," CEI says.</p><p>"The choice would not be between FDA-approved therapies on the one hand and 'chaos' on the other. New institutions would arise to evaluate unapproved drugs and devices. For example, certain foreign approvals might become highly significant for American physicians ... certain medical schools and laboratories might develop in rapidly evaluating new therapies in particular medical specialties. Many ... alternative entities already exist. Peer-reviewed medical journals, for example, have long had a major impact on the practice of medicine ... these and other entities could, in a sense, compete with FDA in evaluating new therapies..."</p><p>The CEI press conference was intended to garner public support for the organisation's proposal. Speakers included cancer patients, physicians and AIDS activists who considered themselves victims of FDA delay. A CEI video and radio spots proclaimed: "If the government approves a drug which will start saving lives tomorrow, then how many people died yesterday waiting for the government to act?"</p><p>It is unlikely that the CEI's proposals will be adopted, but they will certainly be considered. The Progress and Freedom Foundation, Mr Gingrich's own brainchild, is also reported to be considering ways to transform the FDA, or - as it puts it - "get ready for the 21st century."</p><p>healthcare system remains intact</p><p>The kind of radical healthcare reform considered last year will not occur. Even President Clinton, who forced the fight for major restructuring of the healthcare system, will reportedly not even include details of a new attempt at reform in his federal budget, to be sent to Congress early next month.</p><p>"The problem's still there," the President told reporters, but it should be tackled "on a step-by-step basis". He has written to congressional leaders suggesting such an approach, starting with insurance reform and coverage of all children.</p><p>Senate leaders of both parties have been introducing healthcare reform bills ever since the 104th Congress convened a week ago. None of the bills urges the sweeping changes sought last year. That could partially be because healthcare costs have not risen as fast as feared. Still-unreleased government projections indicate earlier forecasts for federal spending on medical programmes Medicare and Medicaid were nearly $30,000 million too high.</p><p>A further reason for reduced need for reform is the increasing reliance on outpatient or short-term inpatient surgery: the American Hospital Association says that 55% of the 22.8 million operations in 1993 were outpatient procedures, compared with 24% a decade earlier. Figures published by the Health Care Technology Institute estimate that of 29 million surgeries performed in 1994, 18.9 million (65.2%) were on an outpatient basis. Such market changes will doubtless affect the kinds of medical technology purchased by US facilities.</p>
