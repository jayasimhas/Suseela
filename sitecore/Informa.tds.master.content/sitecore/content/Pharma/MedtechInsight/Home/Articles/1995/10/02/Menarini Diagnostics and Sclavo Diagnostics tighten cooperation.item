<p><strong>[C#198800771:Menarini]</strong> Diagnostics and Sclavo Diagnostics have agreed a distribution and manufacturing deal which could develop into an even closer manufacturing co-operation by next year. The two Italian diagnostics producers are exploiting their geographical proximity, Florence and Siena respectively, to cut costs and to collaborate on R&D.</p><p>In a first step, Menarini will distribute Sclavo's products outside Italy and streamline the two product lines. Sclavo will continue to sell its own products in Italy. Menarini will then gradually begin transferring the manufacture of its clinical chemistry reagents to Sclavo's facility in Siena and close its own plant in Florence. By January 1996, Sclavo will hive off these production activities to a separate company.</p><p>In a third step, Menarini has the option to invest in this new manufacturing company. "If our experiences with steps one and two are positive, we will examine the opportunity to enter into a joint venture with Sclavo," Enzo Della Croce, president of Menarini Diagnostics, says. "But this will not happen before mid-1996." Menarini Diagnostics is part of privately-held pharmaceutical manufacturer Menarini Group which turns over around Lit 1,800,000 million ($1,109 million) a year. Around 10% or Lit 175,000 million is contributed by diagnostics, of which around two-thirds are from sales outside Italy. Sclavo is the smaller partner, with 1994 sales of Lit 34,500 million, down 13% on the previous year (see Clinica No 646, p 12).</p>
