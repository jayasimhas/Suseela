<p>1994 was expected to be the turnaround year for the German electromedical industry, with domestic sales finally picking up after a 15% fall in 1993. Unfortunately, it was not to be - domestic sales by members of the electromedical industry association (ZVEI) dropped once more in 1994 and were only just offset by a rise in exports.</p>

<p>1994 was expected to be the turnaround year for the German electromedical industry, with domestic sales finally picking up after a 15% fall in 1993. Unfortunately, it was not to be - domestic sales by members of the electromedical industry association (ZVEI) dropped once more in 1994 and were only just offset by a rise in exports.</p><p>Total turnover by the ZVEI's 120 members in 1994 reached DM 6,030 million ($4,300 million) - a 1% rise on DM 5,970 million in 1993. Foreign sales were up 5.3% at DM 3,450 million and now account for 57% of the total. Domestic sales were DM 2,580 million, down 4.1%.</p><p>The reliance on exports means that currency fluctuations favouring the DM have caused problems for many companies. Some 55% of foreign sales go to other European countries, where the economic upturn is resulting in higher purchases of electromedical equipment, but sales are faltering in the US, which accounts for 29% of exports. As well as the higher prices caused by the strong DM, ZVEI chairman Helmut Salger attributes the US slowdown to the merging of hospitals. Sales to Asian (14% of exports) and South American countries increased during the year.</p><pre>German electromedical sales Domestic Foreign Total% (DM millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 change Imaging systems 1,270 1,300 2,290 2,200 + 1.7 Nuclear medicine 120 121 55 33 +13.6 Medical electronics 809 839 891 801 + 3.7 Ultrasound 320 333 132 152 - 6.8 Other 61 69 82 83 - 5.9 Total 2,580 2,661 3,450 3,269 + 1.0</pre>
