<p>Blue Shield is conducting a survey of X-ray equipment and radiology procedures used by Pennsylvania healthcare providers. The first in a series of quality reviews of medical procedures planned by Blue Cross under its Quality Based Health Care Management (QBM) programme, the review is being undertaken following reports of serious deficiencies in the quality of X- rays by some providers in the State. Blue Shield reimbursed almost 3,400 providers in Pennsylvania over $163 million in 1994 for X-ray procedures.</p>

<p>Blue Shield is conducting a survey of X-ray equipment and radiology procedures used by Pennsylvania healthcare providers. The first in a series of quality reviews of medical procedures planned by Blue Cross under its Quality Based Health Care Management (QBM) programme, the review is being undertaken following reports of serious deficiencies in the quality of X- rays by some providers in the State. Blue Shield reimbursed almost 3,400 providers in Pennsylvania over $163 million in 1994 for X-ray procedures.</p><p>Dr Andrew Bloschichak, director of QBM for Pennsylvania Blue Shield, says the survey includes a review of the quality of equipment and images produced; training and certification of operators; and the way the procedure is carried out. Blue Shield plans to conduct annual reviews of X-ray equipment and procedures. In conjunction with the non-profit consulting company, ECRI, it intends to study the quality of images produced by echocardiograms, ultrasound and Doppler.</p>
