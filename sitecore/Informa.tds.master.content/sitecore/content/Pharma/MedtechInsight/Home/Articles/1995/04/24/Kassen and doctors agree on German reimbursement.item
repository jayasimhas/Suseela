<p>Germany's non-hospital doctors, Krankenkassen and Health Ministry appear, rather unexpectedly, to have reached a <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on reforming public non-hospital reimbursement policy, according to Arzte Zeitung. Meeting in Bonn this month, the parties provisionally agreed to a four-category model which limits costs while allowing the Kassen to compete on provision of services.</p>

<p>Germany's non-hospital doctors, Krankenkassen and Health Ministry appear, rather unexpectedly, to have reached a <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on reforming public non-hospital reimbursement policy, according to Arzte Zeitung. Meeting in Bonn this month, the parties provisionally agreed to a four-category model which limits costs while allowing the Kassen to compete on provision of services.</p><p>The new model seeks to guarantee a certain level of health coverage by offering a core catalogue of procedures to which all public Kassen members would have access. This is aimed at allaying fears of the development of a two-tier healthcare system.</p><p>However, the Kassen need to differentiate their activities if they are to compete for customers from 1996, as the second- stage health reform law (BPflV) stipulates. Therefore each Kasse will be allowed to offer extra procedures as a marketing tool, provided they conform to cost-efficiency criteria. Further services may be offered as an option to patients prepared to pay for them via higher insurance premiums.</p><p>Proposed German reimbursement system</p><p>Category 1A joint catalogue of reimbursable procedures for all public Krankenkassen, including a list of prescription medical products. To be financed by insurance premiums and subject to the Risk Restructuring Act, whereby procedures provided by Kassen with high-risk members are subsidised by the low-risk Kassen.</p><p>Category 2 Extra procedures provided by individual Kassen. Procedures must fall within a regulatory framework and must be cost-efficient. To be financed by insurance premiums but not subject to the Risk Restructuring Act.</p><p>Category 3 Extra services (overseas insurance, increased sick pay, etc) provided by individual Kassen. To be financed by surcharges levied on members choosing these services.</p><p>Category 4 A trial category covering cost-efficiency investigations. These will be monitored for outcomes data. Such procedures would not normally be covered by the standard Kassen-doctor contract.</p><p>The willingness of doctors and Kassen to work together is highlighted by talks on the fourth category of new procedures. The Kassen are keen to differentiate themselves by offering new technologies and methodologies, but have criticised the slowness with which such procedures are reviewed by the Federal Committee of Doctors and Krankenkassen. Doctors have therefore proposed a new body which will expedite review of procedures in category four.</p><p>Much of the work on implementing the new model will be undertaken by the Kassen and doctors; Health Minister Horst Seehofer is in favour of self-regulation provided costs are restrained. However, the Health Ministry will implement a process for resolving disputes.</p>
