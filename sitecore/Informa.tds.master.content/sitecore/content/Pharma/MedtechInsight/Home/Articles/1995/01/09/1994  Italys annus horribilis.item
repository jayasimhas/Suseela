<p>1994 was the worst year in the recent history of the Italian medical device and diagnostics market. It began badly; yet worse was to come. First the government tried to force price cuts on the industry. Then the integrity of the whole sector came into question as magistrates challenged the diagnostic industry's business practices and arrested some 50 top executives and a handful of laboratory managers for questioning. Amanda Maxwell reviews events that has put Italy in the headlines more often in 1994 than in any other year during the last decade.</p><p>The first evidence that the Italian diagnostics industry was to be subject to the same kind of sensationalism as the pharmaceutical industry in the wake of Professor Duilio Poggiolini's arrest came in early September. Eighteen executives from five diagnostic companies - <strong>[C#198600358:Bayer]</strong>, Beckman, Boehringer Mannheim, Dasit and Reachem - were detained in a Sicilian prison for questioning. The arrests followed an investigation in which over 1,300 items of laboratory equipment were sequestrated because of apparent purchasing irregularities. These involved the way Sicilian laboratories were receiving laboratory instrumentation free of charge and then allegedly paying three or four times the market value for reagents, even after the equipment had in theory been amortised.</p><p>While most manufacturers deny levying such high fees or bribing purchasers to sign contracts locking them into a company's system, the majority admit they use reagent rental plans - mainly out of necessity. The healthcare capital investment budget (which funds high-tech purchases) has been repeatedly slashed from Lit 1,917,000 million ($1,200 million) in 1989 to Lit 300,000 million in 1994, so that laboratory purchasers have had little money to purchase state-of-the-art equipment.</p><p>The industry is adamant that reagent rental plans are not inherently corrupt. They are "normal practice" for Italian diagnostic companies and commonly-used throughout Europe. The sector admits, however, that the unorthodox system itself could have been abused since it was not subject to control and bypassed public sector tender rules. Although "something suspect may have occurred", Boehringer Mannheim spokesman Martin Kunzler said at the time, it is also possible that over-eager prosecutors may have falsely misinterpreted what is "usual practice".</p><p>The first sweep of arrests was followed by the detention in late September of three <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> Diagnostics executives, succeeded by another 23 diagnostic company managers in early October, including Boehringer Mannheim Italia's entire executive board. Most of those arrested were released after a week or two of questioning. Not one had been charged by the year end.</p><p>As the year drew to a close, the Italian magistrates on the trail of what they believed could be massive fraud mainly in the diagnostics but also in the medical devices industry, lost their power just as Silvio Berlusconi's coalition government was losing its battle to retain control. Two coalition deputies, belonging to the Forza Italia and Lega Nord parties, had drawn up a draft law aimed at putting the comodato d'uso, including the reagent rental plans, into a legal framework.</p><p>To the industry, which had repeatedly approached the government for clarification of the issue, this is a long overdue document. The sooner the text becomes law (some had hoped by mid-January) the better as it should absolve most of the industry. Once the legal framework is defined, it will become possible to pinpoint any abuse of the system. Arrests or interrogations following publication of the law should be related to suspicion of abuse of the system, rather than use of it.</p><p>A Health Ministry Commission set up in mid-September was due to conclude its national investigation of the comodato d'uso for the purchase of devices and diagnostics by the end of the year.</p><p>contract law blow</p><p>The reagent rental plan crisis was preceded by a crisis brought about by the government's contract law regulations introduced in Article 6 of the 1994 Finance Law at the beginning of the year. In brief, the contract law regulations allowed companies already supplying the state to renew contracts only if they cut their prices by 10%. For all other contracts a national price monitoring system was to be set up in haste (although it never materialised) to establish and maintain a price index - which would represent the maximum the state would pay for a product or service. This index was to be under constant scrutiny and subject to downward pressure.</p><p>Since it depends on state contracts for 80% of its business, the medical device and diagnostics industry - already contending with a national market starved of funds - was near crisis point. It reacted swiftly. The two main trade associations representing the industry - ANIE and Assobiomedica - argued that the measures were against the Italian constitution and EU public tender laws. Backed by EUCOMED, the associations appealed to the European Commission and Silvio Berlusconi's government was forced to suspend the contract law until the end of the year.</p><p>The prospects for 1995 look brighter. The contract law accompanying the 1995 Finanziaria law was not intended to force immediate and indiscriminate price cuts as was the case with 1994's Article 6. Instead, the new system makes the public administration accountable for the prices it pays. This will be done by publishing every six months a list of market prices drawn up by the National Statistics Institute, alongside a list of prices paid by the public administration according to factors such as type, quality, quantity, method of payment and place of purchase. The lists should also highlight any purchasing irregularities.</p><p>Health Ministry upheavals</p><p>To add to the industry's problems, manufacturers had no tangible contact point during a significant part of 1994 at the Health Ministry to help them comply with the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive and with the preparation for the imminent implementation of the Medical Devices Directive. While other Member States' Health Ministry departments responsible for medical devices have been issuing guidance notes and holding meetings to help prepare their industries, the Italian Ministry's pharmaceutical department - which houses the medical devices unit - was being torn apart. Following the pharmaceutical scandal, all staff who had worked under Professor Poggiolini were transferred in early autumn to other Health Ministry departments.</p><p>Dr Francesco-Maria Satriani was appointed head of the medical devices division in late September. Dr Satriani has swiftly established contact with the industry but as a newcomer to the sector and given the lack of continuity, has a hard task ahead of him.</p><p>medical devices law</p><p>The upheaval at the Health Ministry has also affected the course of the forthcoming medical devices law, based on the EU's Medical Devices Directive. The Italian legislation will not come into effect on January 1st as was originally expected. It was before the President's Council as the year drew to a close; publication was not imminent. The decree introducing modifications to Italy's active implantable medical device directive Law has also been delayed.</p><p>The decree appointing the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) as the designating authority for Notified Bodies for products covered by the MD Directive was published at the end of November. However, the Health Ministry is now disputing whether this will allow Notified Bodies to be appointed ahead of the medical devices law implementation as industry had hoped. Organisations which are likely to be designated are: the ISS; IMQ; and Certimedica, Milan. (For further details see pages 14-15.</p><p>DRGs</p><p>One of the most immediate changes that will affect the industry in 1995 is the introduction from the start of the year of a system akin to the US diagnosis-related groups, whereby hospitals are paid according to set tariffs per service. Once they have fixed budgets to treat patients, it will be in the hospitals' interests to drive costs down. The regions were instructed during 1994 to draw up their own lists of standard costs based on figures from the more efficient service providers in their area. These were to take into account costs related to personnel and materials, while equipment costs were to include maintenance and amortisation and be based on predetermined regional rates of use. Regions which have not drawn up standard prices must adopt the government's list published in mid-December.</p><p>Public sector purchasers have also been instructed to set up centralised purchasing systems and to ensure suppliers are paid within 90 days of receipt of goods. This will be welcomed by the industry, which commonly has to wait up to three years for payment. However, many will remember that a 1991 ministerial decree imposing the same time limits failed to have any effect on the old-style USLs. It remains to be seen whether the new decentralised healthcare administration can enforce it.</p><p>The government's healthcare management decentralisation plans have largely been fulfilled this year as planned. Local healthcare units, USLs, have merged into healthcare businesses, and along with the new hospital businesses, now have significant financial autonomy. To avoid the corruption scandals of the recent past, a number of commissions are being set up at the Health Ministry and within the Regions to monitor management. The constant debate over the level of state healthcare funding remains, but the Regions are now responsible for any overspending.</p><p>"healthier, steadier footing" for 1995?</p><p>With the imminent publication of the decree placing reagent rental plans into a legal framework, it seems that the prediction of Dasit's general manager, Angelo Fracassi, may be fulfilled. He said in March 1994 that "...the establishment of clear competitive rules will in due course allow professional diagnostic and laboratory supply companies to achieve profits at an acceptable level on a global market of lesser magnitude, but based on a healthier, steadier footing". One unknown factor remains, however: the attitude of the next government.</p>
