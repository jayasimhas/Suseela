<p>Congress wants to make major changes in device approval and regulation. Three major Capitol Hill players told the Medical Device Manufacturers Association about their plans on May 12th. Duffy Miller reports from Washington.</p><p>John Barton, chairman of the House Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, plans to introduce "a series of proposals" that could radically change device approval in the US. The initials "FDA" stand for "Foot Dragging & Alibis", Mr Barton said. "We're going to change the culture out there .... We're going to bring the FDA into the 20th century before the 21st."</p><p>This may mean removing the efficacy requirement, with the FDA becoming a certifying agency, an information clearing-house assessing only safety. It may even entail moving the Center for Devices & Radiological Health out of the FDA and into an organisation such as the National Research Council, where the focus will be on technology.</p><p>Mr Barton hopes to have his ideas crafted into a series of proposals - "probably by the end of the summer". In addition, he intends to look at already enacted laws. House speaker Newt Gingrich "has asked us to do some economic analyses, and we've already decided to look at the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990," Mr Barton said.</p><p>Senate Judiciary Committee staffer Trisha Knight announced that chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is working with Senator Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire) and Congressman Fred Upton (R-Michigan) to pass a bill easing export rules - "as quickly as possible". Mr Hatch also intends to offer a revised version of his 1994 FDA reform bill, she said. Furthermore, he is "looking at legislative language to clarify" the Medicare rules, permitting reimbursement for use of investigational devices. Judging by comments of MDMA members, the current Medicare rules are of major concern.</p><p>new Senate caucus</p><p>The Senate Medical Technology Caucus will work with its House counterpart "to focus on problems facing the medical technology sector through information briefings for Members of Congress and their staff," Senator Rod Grams (R-Minnesota), chairman of the Senate group, told the MDMA meeting. Reform of the FDA's approval process is his top priority. The Minnesota Republican doubtless already knows a great deal about FDA approval. The state is home to more than 568 medical device companies, employing more than 16,000 voters.</p><p>"As chair of the caucus," Mr Grams told MDMA members, "I hope to have a full and open debate on the issues you have raised over the last few years .... The Senate Medical Technology Caucus will focus on your concerns, including regulatory burdens, FDA's adversarial environment, Medicare reimbursement for investigational devices and prohibitions against exporting devices which have been approved in foreign markets."</p>
