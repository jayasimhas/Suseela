<p>US multinational General Electric has reported that its Medical Systems business achieved record earnings on flat revenues in 1994. Writing in the annual report, Medical Systems' CEO John Trani describes the US market as the "most brutal market environment for diagnostic imaging equipment in a decade".</p><p>Despite flat revenues, GE maintained global market leadership, which Mr Trani attributes to restructuring efforts begun in anticipation of the US downturn and investment in growth areas outside North America. He adds that Asia has become the largest market for MR scanners and Japan has surpassed western Europe as the second largest consumer of diagnostic imaging technology.</p><p>As reported in January (see Clinica No 639, p 12), GE's group turnover from continuing operations rose 8% to $60,109 million. The annual report provides a segment breakdown, showing sales of $4,285 million for Technical Products and Services in 1994, up 3% from 1993, and a significant improvement on 1993 when revenues fell 11%. Medical Systems is the main part of this segment but failed to generate increased sales in 1994.</p><p>geographical spread</p><p>GE says its joint venture in India has become number two in market share and is playing "a key role in global ultrasound development". In Japan, the 1993 acquisition of a Japanese X-ray manufacturer allows it to address a $300 million market segment that it had not served before. Although the Chinese market was weak last year, GE says it is "poised for profitable growth during the anticipated business rebound in 1995".</p><p>In the US, GE says it is responding to managed care with hardware that saves money and enhances provider productivity as well as with service support and training. The company established GE Health-Care Services to develop and market single source equipment service and management offerings to multivendor departments and hospital systems in the US.</p><p>During 1994, GE introduced Sytec SRi and ProSpeed slip-ring CT systems, the Signa Horizon MR scanner, the Prestige VH remote-controlled radiography and fluoroscopy system, the Silhouette 20S and HF radiographic systems and the Trauma U system for emergency room applications. The company adds that its Logiq 700 and 500 digital ultrasound systems have enjoyed "excellent reception" with several hundred ordered.</p>
