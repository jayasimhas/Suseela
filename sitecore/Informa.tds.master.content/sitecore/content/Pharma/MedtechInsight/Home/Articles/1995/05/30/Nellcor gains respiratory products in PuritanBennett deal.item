<p>Nellcor will take over Puritan-Bennett in a stock-for-stock transaction worth about $475 million. The deal will combine worldwide leaders in two complementary areas - patient monitoring and respiratory therapy - Nellcor says. The new company, Nellcor/Puritan-Bennett, will provide a line of products to diagnose, monitor and treat patients with respiratory difficulties in the hospital, alternative care sites and the home.</p><p>Puritan shareholders will receive 0.88 Nellcor stock for each outstanding Puritan share. Based on the pre-bid share prices, the offer entails a 40% premium on Puritan stock. On May 22nd, when the boards of both companies gave their approval, Puritan's shares rose 27% on the Nasdaq, closing at $33.25. Nellcor's shares, on the other hand, eased 4% to $39.75.</p><p>white knight</p><p>The deal prices Puritan shares close to their trading level in late 1992 before the company ran into trouble with the FDA about GMP compliance and into the red in fiscal 1994 (ended January). The price is considerably higher than that offered by Thermo Electron in a protracted hostile bid for Puritan last year. Thermo's last offer was $24.50 per Puritan share and was fought by management as being "grossly inadequate".</p><p>To integrate the two companies, Nellcor's CEO Raymond Larkin will establish an executive management committee. The headquarters of the new company will be in Pleasanton, California, Nellcor's current headquarters. Puritan is the larger company in terms of sales - $336 million compared with Nellcor's $235 million - but only made a meagre $8 million profit in fiscal 1995 after a $35 million net loss a year earlier. In March, Puritan outlined cost cutting measures which include a 6% staff cut (see Clinica No 645, p 16).</p>
