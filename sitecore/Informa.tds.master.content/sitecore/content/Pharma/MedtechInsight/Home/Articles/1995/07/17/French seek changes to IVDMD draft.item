<p>Some fundamental changes need to be made to the European Commission's draft IVD-MD Directive, claims the French Medicines Agency, the Health Ministry division responsible for authorising the sale of reagents in France. If there are not more safety assurances in the Directive, free trade will be jeopardised since national barriers may be erected for health and safety reasons, the agency warns.</p>

<p>Some fundamental changes need to be made to the European Commission's draft IVD-MD Directive, claims the French Medicines Agency, the Health Ministry division responsible for authorising the sale of reagents in France. If there are not more safety assurances in the Directive, free trade will be jeopardised since national barriers may be erected for health and safety reasons, the agency warns.</p><p>The French Agency is particularly concerned that it will be unaware of and unable to track the vast majority of products on its market. Article 10 states that manufacturers (or their authorised representative) are only required to notify the competent authorities of the Member State in which they have their registered place of business of the categories of IVD-MDs they market. This also applies to manufacturers of "new" technology products and to the few products covered by Annex II.</p><p>The Agency also believes that there should be three classes of products, rather than two, so that products with a moderate risk are regulated separately from those of low risk. The proposed text, it claims, does not take into account the rapid evolution in diagnostic technology over the last 20 years. Some products, for which there is a paucity of standards, lack stability and vary greatly from batch to batch. Biologically active reagents, for example, which contain antibodies, antigens or oligonucleotides, should be in a higher category, the Agency believes, than other biologically inert reagents.</p><p>The European Commission is aware of the French position; representatives of the Agency have been attending the Commission's expert working meetings on the IVD-MD text.</p><p>French industry reaction</p><p>SFRL, the French association of laboratory reagents, believes that the Medicines Agency is attempting to treat reagents like pharmaceuticals. Although the association views the draft IVD- MD Directive as "demanding" for industry, its requirements are less onerous than the current French system.</p><p>At present the French government requires all reagent manufacturers to submit a file on each product to the Agency, for checking by a reagents expert group. According to SFRL the procedure takes two to three months for simple reagents and three to six months for higher risk products, such as tests for HIV, hepatitis and blood grouping, where the expert group performs a premarket approval analysis similar to that required by the US FDA.</p><p>The Association hopes that the European Parliament will add a lighter touch to the draft.</p>
