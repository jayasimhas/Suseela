<p>Baxter International has met its target for earnings growth in 1994 on a sales rise that remained somewhat below expectations of a year ago. The Illinois-based company's operational cash flow goal was exceeded, CEO Vernon Loucks says, adding: "In 1995 we expect to grow sales and earnings and generate strong operational cash flow of more than half a billion dollars."</p><p>Baxter reduced its net debt by $742 million during the year to $2,401 million at the end of 1994 which lowered the net debt-to-capital ratio to 39% from 50% a year earlier. Net income rose 10% to $596 million from $540 million in 1993 which excludes after-tax restructuring and litigation charges. Including the latter, Baxter had a $198 million net loss in 1993.</p><p>Turnover was 5% higher than in 1993, a growth "somewhat lower than expected at the beginning of the year," says the company. US sales grew 4% and international sales rose 8% to $2,600 million. Mr Loucks says that Baxter will "continue to emphasise the growth and profitability of the medical specialties segment in 1995," the segment which far outperformed lab products & distribution last year. Investment in medical specialties was increased during the year with new initiatives in many emerging medical markets, including Argentina, Brazil, Hungary and Turkey.</p><p>Concerning breast implant litigation, Baxter says that it has strongly urged women who have opted out of the global settlement to return to it and adds: "Almost 1,600 women asserting claims against Baxter have opted back into the settlement in the past month."</p><pre>$ millions Three change Year months from 1993 Sales Medical specialties 971 10% 3,557 9% Medical/laboratory prod. & distribution 1,529 1% 5,767 2% Total turnover 2,500 4% 9,324 5% Net income 172 596 (ended Dec 31st)</pre>
