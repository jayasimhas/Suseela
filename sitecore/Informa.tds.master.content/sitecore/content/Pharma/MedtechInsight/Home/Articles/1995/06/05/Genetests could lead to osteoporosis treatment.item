<p>Genetic testing should lead to new approaches to osteoporosis prevention and treatment, according to researchers from St Thomas's Hospital, the United Medical and Dental School, London, and Garvan Institute, Sydney, Australia. Writing in the BMJ (May 27th), they say that bone density in post-menopausal British women - particularly the the hip and spine - is genetically linked and specifically associated with vitamin D receptor genotypes.</p>

<p>Genetic testing should lead to new approaches to osteoporosis prevention and treatment, according to researchers from St Thomas's Hospital, the United Medical and Dental School, London, and Garvan Institute, Sydney, Australia. Writing in the BMJ (May 27th), they say that bone density in post-menopausal British women - particularly the the hip and spine - is genetically linked and specifically associated with vitamin D receptor genotypes.</p><p>The researchers measured bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, forearm and whole body by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry from dizygotic and monozygotic twins and compared the results with vitamin D receptor genotype. About 50,000 hip and 40,000 vertebral fractures occur every year in England and Wales. Bone densitometry is currently seen as the gold standard for predicting future fracture, but lacks the sensitivity and specificity to justify widespread screening.</p><p>The BMJ study backs up a 250-twin study published last year. Writing in Nature (January 20th 1994), researchers from St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, said that the vitamin D receptor gene accounts for up to 75% of the genetic effect on bone difference in healthy individuals.</p>
