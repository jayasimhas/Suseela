<p>Automation has been a buzz-word for years. David Firn witnessed saw the introduction of a bumper crop of robotic lab systems at the AACC in Anaheim.</p><p>Manufacturers claim they have cut reagent costs as far as they can. They can only go so low still make a profit - especially if the client has a reagent rental plan. Consumables account for only a modest share of the cost of a test. Labour accounts for up to 60%, so manufacturers are increasingly turning to streamlined and integrated systems.</p><p>Boehringer Mannheim shows its CLAS</p><p>Boehringer Mannheim's clinical laboratory automation system, CLAS, handles specimen sorting, centrifugation, processing and aliquoting for chemistry and haematology. Up to 500 chemistry, coagulation, serology and haematology tubes per hour can be sorted and 250 tubes can be centrifuged at 2,000 G. Configured with the Boehringer Mannheim/Hitachi 747 and 911 and a Sysmex or Coulter haematology system, CLAS can report results in less than 60 minutes and handle up to 2,500 specimens in an eight-hour shift. The system can also integrate with the new BM/H 917 clinical chemistry system.</p><p>Ciba Corning announces robotics-ready upgrade</p><p>Ciba Corning Diagnostics launched a robotics-ready software upgrade for its ACS:180 automated chemiluminescence immunoassay system. The version 2.5 software expands the external automation capabilities of the system, allowing it to interface with computer controllers and laboratory robots for continuous loading and unloading of samples. It also expands the analyser's dilution capabilities, allowing for on-board preparation of pretreatment assays. Dilutions can be scheduled from a host information system, bypassing the need to program the test on the instrument's keyboard.</p><p>The ACS:180 has a menu of 24 acridinium ester chemiluminescent assays including thyroid, anaemia, fertility, cancer and STAT cardiac analysis and can run up to 180 tests per hour.</p><p>Sysmex automates staining</p><p>Sysmex' latest automated haematology system includes slide staining. The SP-100 is the world's first fully-automated reflexive blood film preparation unit with staining capabilities. The system was an obvious follow up to the wedge-film smearing SP-1 launched at AACC three years ago. The first unit was delivered to Sysmex, Toa's US subsidiary, the week before this year's meeting. The SP-100 uses HCT values from a haematology analyser to adjust wedge films individually.</p><p>Sysmex also introduced its latest integrated closed-tube haematology system, the HAT series S-9000. The HAT can be configured with Sysmex' transport system to run CBC, discrete automated differential, automated reticulocyte analysis, blood film preparation and staining.</p><p>integration through standardisation at J&JCD Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics plans to launch an automation-ready system by the end of 1996. The company claims that the Ektachem 950AT will be the first system that can interface with major lab automation systems without the need for additional, expensive robotics.</p><p>The 950AT will be suitable for use as a stand-alone or integrated system with no extra hardware, which the company hopes will encourage laboratories to embark on automation step-by-step, as and when resources are available. "Automating a lab requires significant capital investment," says J&JCD market planning specialist Marie Castore, "so we have looked for ways to minimise their start-up costs. Labs can buy the 950AT as a stand-alone model with automatic tip loading. Later they can add other components in a modular fashion, to spread out costs."</p><p>Integration with other industry-standard equipment is achieved by opening up the loading arm to allow it to collect samples from a delivery system. The 950AT will accept manually-loaded samples and automatically revert to automatic operation when they have been processed. It will also be able to handle non-standard tubes without operator intervention.</p><p>An automated Ektachem 250 system is scheduled for introduction shortly after the 950AT and engineering models of the two analysers were on display, linked by a Coulter work track, at the company's exhibition booth. J&J also plans to build a robotic version of its new immunodiagnostics system.</p><p>Beckman's concept robot draws the crowds.</p><p>One AACC exhibitor was giving away disposable cameras as an inducement to visit its stand. Beckman staff were not amused - photography was strictly prohibited at their concept robot demonstration. The Cx Delta automated workstation centres on a robotic arm that transfers tubes between delivery tracks, centrifuges and analysers.</p><p>CCRI introduces robot transporter</p><p>California Computer Research (CCRI) says 25-35% of a laboratory technician's time is spent moving material around. Their answer is a robotic butler. The specimen transporter is controlled by a 486 computer, can be hailed by radio and follows 3M Scotchbrite tape trails.</p><p>The overall dimensions - 18" X 26" - give it a similar, if more rectangular, girth to a human, so it should be able to reach most places the technician would go. It moves at about the speed of a technician too, 1.9 feet per second. However, unlike its human counterparts, it avoids collisions by sonar and recharging can be performed during loading and unloading points, to allow round-the-clock operation.</p>
