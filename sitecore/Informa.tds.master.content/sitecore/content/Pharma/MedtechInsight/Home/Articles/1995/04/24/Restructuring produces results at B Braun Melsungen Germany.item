<p>Cost-containment combined with a 7% rise in turnover led profits at B Braun Melsungen (Germany) almost to treble in fiscal 1994. Sales in the period ended September 30th, 1994, totalled DM 2,914 million ($2,160 million), while net income reached DM 115 million compared with DM 39 million in fiscal 1993.</p><p>Braun reorganised its divisions during the year, resulting in growth in production costs of just 2.4% and distribution and R&D expenses of some 6%, both well under turnover growth. Operating profits were up 37% at DM 314.8 million. The company also benefited by DM 10 million from the sale of property in Berlin and by DM 28 million from reduced interest payments.</p><pre>B Braun results (DM millions) % 1994 1993 change By division Medical products 1,001.8 951.6 + 5.3 Medical technology 231.5 223.9 + 3.4 Surgery 783.8 750.0 + 4.5 Outpatient materials 289.6 252.3 + 14.8 Pharmaceuticals 564.2 521.7 + 8.1 By geographic area Germany 1,061.1 1,049.2 + 1.1 Other European 1,012.5 953.1 + 6.2 Asia/Australia 282.3 239.2 + 18.0 North & South America 510.6 446.6 + 14.3 Africa 47.5 39.4 + 20.5 Total sales 2,914.0 2,727.5 + 6.8 Profits 115.0 39.2 +193.8 (ended September 30th)</pre><p>attempted acquisition</p><p>The surgical division was at the centre of Braun's most publicised activity in 1994 - the attempted purchase of Davis & Geck's US surgical suture business (see Clinica No 612, p 1). The move faltered after Davis & Geck's parent, American Cyanamid, was sold to American Home Products, but Braun says co-operation with Davis & Geck will continue.</p><p>The outpatient products division, which manufactures homecare supplies ranging from infusion therapies to stoma care products, was the fastest-growing sector with sales up 15%. Braun says the expansion of the sector in western Europe is now complete and the company will in future concentrate on the US and Asia-Pacific countries.</p><p>The lowest growth was registered by the medical technology division, largely because it transferred its infusion apparatus products to the medical products division. The sector will now concentrate more on extracorporeal blood products. Much of fiscal 1994 was devoted to improving the distribution network in Europe, particularly in Italy and Spain. New facilities were also established in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p><p>The medical products division remained the largest sector, contributing over a third of sales, but saw turnover rise a below-average 5.3%. In restructuring measures, divisional marketing and product development operations were merged and labour-intensive production was moved to low-cost countries.</p><p>no overpricing</p><p>Overall, sales growth was concentrated outside Europe, and especially outside Germany. However, Braun expects the European market to strengthen in fiscal 1995 as the world economy picks up and hospitals come to terms with healthcare reforms. The company criticises the common perception in Germany that medical products are overpriced, saying that this cannot apply to low-tech essential goods.</p>
