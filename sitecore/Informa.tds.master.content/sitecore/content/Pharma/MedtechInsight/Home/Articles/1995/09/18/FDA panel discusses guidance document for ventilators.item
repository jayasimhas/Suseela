<p>The classification of ventilators into critical care (MNT) and noncritical care (MNS) devices was a major topic for discussion by the US FDA's Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices Advisory Panel on September 8th. The panel reviewed a draft guidance document designed to help manufacturers to prepare 510(k) submissions for common conventional positive pressure ventilators. Topics covered include testing, electromagnetic compatibility, reusable parts, disinfection, biocompatibility and labelling.</p>

<p>The classification of ventilators into critical care (MNT) and noncritical care (MNS) devices was a major topic for discussion by the US FDA's Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices Advisory Panel on September 8th. The panel reviewed a draft guidance document designed to help manufacturers to prepare 510(k) submissions for common conventional positive pressure ventilators. Topics covered include testing, electromagnetic compatibility, reusable parts, disinfection, biocompatibility and labelling.</p><p>Under the proposal to classify continuous ventilators which use a fixed or passively operated exhaust port, a noncritical care device would be required to have only a few of the functions and safety features of a critical care device. Several panel members opposed this classification on the grounds that it would potentially allow simple devices to be approved for less severe conditions and physicians may use these for treating patients who need more sophisticated devices. There was also a concern that if standards were too rigid insurers would stop paying for ventilators unless the devices were used for the indication for which they were approved.</p><p>Dr Robert Kacmarek thought it was not in the patient's interest to categorise ventilators into two types. Some members said they were concerned that if all ventilators had to meet too high a standard it would unnecessarily raise medical costs.</p><p>On the subject of industrial standards, a representative from HIMA said the industry organisation recommended that the FDA revise the guidance document to harmonise with international standards and to use only standards that had been accepted by international groups. Specific reference was made to electromagnetic compatibility. An FDA employee responded that revisions to the document would be made as international standards became defined and accepted.</p>
