<p>The US FDA is close to establishing a performance standard preventing hazardous electrical connections between medical devices and patients and banning unprotected electrode lead wires. A summary of the proposed regulations was published in the Federal Register on June 21st and written comments are requested by September 5th.</p><p>The draft standard proposes that devices should be designed to eliminate the risk of electrode leads being brought into contact with the live parts of a power outlet or separable power cord. After publication of a final rule, manufacturers would have one year to meet the standard for devices which have been or could be the subject of adverse incidents, and three years for other devices. The FDA has published a list of products in each category. Stockpiling of non-conforming devices will not be allowed.</p><p>This latest move follows an advance notice of proposed rulemaking published by the FDA on May 19th, 1994. In this, the agency expressed concern about exposed male connector electrode pins being plugged into AC power cords or wall outlets rather than into the cable connecting the patient to the monitor. The agency said that "despite efforts to eliminate the risk, unprotected electrode lead wires and patient cabling systems are still distributed by some manufacturers as replacements for existing equipment, and may also be interchangeable among various medical devices". Between 1985 and 1994, 24 infants in the US received large electrical shocks from medical equipment - five of these died.</p><p>Comments on the proposals and requests for changes in the classification of devices should be submitted to Dockets Management Branch, FDA, rm 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20857, US.</p>
