<p>Nucleic acid amplification is without doubt the most elegant scientific advance in diagnostics in the last ten years. Diagnostics companies were quick to realise the potential it offered and most techniques were snapped up in an often litigious rush to corner the market. But as the technology matured, many observers found themselves asking whether amplification would repeat the clinical revolution that followed the introduction of monoclonal antibodies.</p><p>The manufacturers' answer has been to focus on difficult-to- diagnose conditions. Almost without exception they have chosen to prove themselves in the infectious disease market. Their hope is that by demonstrating clinical relevance and cost- benefit and building up a trusting market they can move on to the potentially vast fields of cancer and genetic testing.</p><p>Around $300 million a year is currently finding its way into amplification technology and problems like sample preparation and detection in the clinical setting have largely been addressed. The initial push into the market place is focused on AIDS, chlamydia, viral hepatitis and TB. The largest potential market, however, is genetic testing, including congenital diseases and cancer.</p><p>The DNA Diagnostics Market</p><p>The DNA probe-based diagnostics market has been growing rapidly in the past few years but is still a very small part of the total diagnostics market. Estimates of its size range from under 1% to 10% of the $15,000 million diagnostics market in 1993. The large variation in the estimates is indicative of a fairly young technology with a wide range of uses yet to be developed.</p><p>Market researchers' and brokers' estimates of the current size and the growth rate for DNA probe-based diagnostics vary. Figures for 1994 range from a conservative $100 million (US analysts Volpe, Welty & Co) to $1,600 million in a forthcoming Clinica report. Similarly, projections for the year 2000 and growth rates differ. Volpe, Welty & Co estimates the market at $600 million by 2000, which implies an average annual growth rate of around 35%. The Clinica estimate starts at a higher current level but sees lower annual growth of around 10% and estimates the market size at more than $2,800 million by 2000.</p><p>Even with growth rates as high as 35% the market for DNA-based diagnostics will remain a small part of the total diagnostics market - accounting for between around 2.5% and 12%, assuming an annual growth rate of around 7% for the total diagnostics market.</p><p>Market opportunities for DNA amplification testing</p><pre>Genetic disorders Affected population Huntington's disease 30,000 families * Charcot-Marie Tooth disease 100,000 families * Fragile X syndrome 1/1,250 male children 1/2,000 female children Myotonic dystrophy 1/7,500 Alzheimer's disease 3-5 million cases * 1-6% of those over 65 years old!

In press (except !Clinica and +WHO).</pre><p>The Main Players</p><p><strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> Laboratories</p><p>Abbott is the leading diagnostics manufacturer with 1993 turnover of more than $2,100 million, or about 53% of its overall medtech sales. The company remains the largest diagnostics player even after Johnson & Johnson's purchase of Eastman Kodak's clinical diagnostics in September 1994. In the field of DNA probes, it has developed the LCR (ligase chain reaction) and RCR (repair chain reaction). Abbott says it is putting its R&D emphasis on infectious disease testing as the market with the greatest growth potential. In February, Abbott reported favourable results for its LCR test for chlamydia in women compared with endocervical culture (see Clinica No 640, p 18). A similar urine-based test for men is reported to be troubled by false-negatives, highlighting the problems eliminating inhibitory substances during sample preparation.</p><p>In April 1994, Abbott and Perkin-Elmer agreed to exchange their DNA amplification patent and instrument system rights. Abbott gained access to Perkin-Elmer's oligonucleotide ligation assay and in exchange Perkin-Elmer was able to use RCR.</p><p>Abbott's LCR Portfolio</p><p>Abbott submitted its chlamydia test for US approval in late 1993 and hopes to launch the test outside the US, France and Japan in the next few months.</p><p><strong>[C#198601110:Hoffmann-La Roche]</strong></p><p>In 1993, Roche was the third-largest diagnostics producer, but has since been overtaken by J&J. Roche has the dominant technology in DNA probes - the PCR polymerase chain reaction - which it bought from Cetus. The latter was subsequently merged with Chiron and a long-running dispute about the ownership of the PCR technology was eventually settled in 1993. Roche was acknowledged as sole owner of patents covering the PCR process while Kodak was granted a royalty-bearing licence.</p><p>Abbott and Roche agreed in April 1994 to share their technologies (see Clinica No 599, p 1). A worldwide royalty- bearing cross-licence allows Abbott to operate under Roche's gene amplification patents, including PCR, and permits Roche to operate under Abbott's patent rights, including LCR and RCR technology. Roche's Dr Dragon says she sees no need to make use of the licence; however, the deal has obvious implications for the development of hybrid tests like P/LCR or LCR mutation detection kits which use PCR as the first amplification step.</p><p>Worldwide Roche has some 260-300 licences, mostly clinical. Only five, including the Abbott and Kodak/Johnson & Johnson agreements, cover the use and sale of clinical PCR kits.</p><pre>Roche's PCR portfolio US FDA approved / pending / research /world Chlamydia trachomatis y y MTB y y M avium M intracellulare HIV DNA y HCV qualitative y HCV-monitor (quantitative) y y HIV qualitative y HIV-monitor (quantitative) y y HTLV-I & -II y Chlamydia Chlamydia/gonorrhoea panel - Europe Japan MTB M avium y M intracellulare y HCV qualitative y HIV DNA y HIV qualitative y Chlamydia y MecA resistance (OEM) y</pre><p>An HLA-DR-beta test and enterovirus kits were launched in Europe in late 1994. An upgraded qualitative HIV test - with widened specificity to emerging subtypes - should be ready late in the year or early next year, as should a 15-mutation, research use cystic fibrosis gene test. Other tests in the pipeline include cytomegalovirus and M avium and intracellulare for the blood and AIDS market. Dr Dragon has also highlighted rifampicin resistance in TB, which is clustered in a 100 bp region of a highly conserved gene, as a future target. Enterovirus is another ideal candidate because meningitis treatment must be started before current diagnostic techniques can give a result. This is where the policy of proving PCR in a niche is vital, says Dr Dragon, because physicians must be confident they will not make an incorrect diagnosis.</p><p>Cobas Amplicor</p><p>The bench-top analyser contains enough on-board reagents for 210 detections. It can run 24 amplifications at a time and run six tests on each amplified sample. Samples that have already been amplified can be detected at the same time giving a capacity of 50 detections per hour. Washing is by magnetic particle separation and analysis is carried out on-board by colorimetric detection. DNA must be pre-prepared using a lysis and extraction kit prior to amplification.</p><p>Johnson & Johnson and Kodak's Clinical Diagnostics Division</p><p>The purchase of Kodak's clinical diagnostics business in September 1994 has nearly doubled Johnson & Johnson's diagnostics turnover and catapulted it to number three in the league table. It has also added Kodak's PCR in-the-pouch project to J&J's pipeline. The sealed system avoids carry-over contamination by isolating the reaction in a self-contained pouch.</p><p>Kodak's PCR Portfolio Kodak Clinical Diagnostics is the only manufacturer that has chosen to ignore the infectious disease market completely and is concentrating instead on genetic testing. A cystic fibrosis gene test based on ARMS technology was launched last year and PCR development manager Mike Snow says two more genetic tests will be released in 1995. ARMS is an allele specific, multiplex technique that uses mutant and wild type primers, in separate reactions, to detect mutations. Kodak's automated PCR in-the-pouch system suffered from under investment but the company's new owner J&J has committed time and personnel to the project, which Kodak now expects will be completed within two years.</p><p>Chiron</p><p>Since Chiron obtained Ciba-Geigy's diagnostics business in part-exchange for 49.9% of shares in Chiron, it has moved into the top ten diagnostics players.</p><p>Chiron's bDNA portfolio.</p><p>Chiron's bDNA tests are marketed under the name Quantiplex. A hepatitis C kit is sold for clinical use in Japan and HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, HIV-RNA and cytomegalovirus test are available for research use only in the US. A cytokine mRNA test is in development and the company says it is now looking at the oncology market.</p><p>Organon Teknika</p><p>Akzo Nobel's subsidiary Organon Teknika, which does not disclose its diagnostics sales, is estimated to be among the top 20 diagnostics manufacturers. Organon launched its research-use RNA amplification-based HIV test in North America last September.</p><p>Organon Teknika's NASBA Portfolio</p><p>Organon Teknika sells two kits, which are available both the US and Europe: HIV-1 RNA QL qualitative; HIV-1 RNA QT quantitative. Organon, which licenses NASBA from <strong>[C#198600453:Cangene]</strong>, also owns the similar 3SR system which it acquired by purchasing Siska Diagnostics.</p><p>The clinical NASBA kits use Igen's (US) electrochemical luminescence detection technology. Organon does yet not produce a completely automated system. The tests themselves run in minitubes, for which a calibrated heater block is available. The company also sells an automated system for quantitative read out.</p><p>In development are kits for CML translocation, factor V point mutation, hepatitis, CMV, chlamydia and MTB. The factor V test is due to enter trials in prototype format in May.</p><p>Gen-Probe Gen-Probe is Chugai Pharmaceuticals' US subsidiary. Chugai acquired it in 1989 and has restructured its diagnostics business since 1992, concentrating on EIA and DNA-probe products. Gen-Probe obtained Japanese approval for its Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test in February 1994. US FDA approval for its group A strep direct test followed in April 1994 and for Pace 2C, its DNA assay for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea, in January 1995. In May last year, the company said it was moving into antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.</p><p>Gene-Trak</p><p>Gene-Trak is developing Qbeta kits for TB and a range of STDs as well as a fully automated test system.</p><p>PNA Diagnostics</p><p>Boehringer Mannheim, the second-largest diagnostics producer, bought the Danish company PNA Diagnostics in September 1994. PNA holds worldwide patent rights to peptide nucleic acid technology. Boehringer itself produces a wide range of research-use PCR products under licence from Roche.</p><p>There are at least ten amplification technologies including target amplification systems, which make many copies of the DNA or RNA sequence being looked for, and signal amplification techniques amplify a target detection molecule. PCR, LCR and NASBA are currently the front runners in the clinical field although some analysts have highlighted ID Biomedical's CPR as a strong contender in the TB market.</p><pre>Target amplification systems Technique Inventor/owner/licensee PCR Cetus/Roche/Kodak Clinical Diagnostics(J&J) LCR Omnigene/Abbott 3SR Cangene/Organon Siska/Baxter <strong>[C#198601261:Life Technologies]</strong> NASBA Cangene/Organon Teknika CPR IBD SIR Enzo Biochem SDA Becton Dickinson Qbeta-replicase US PHRI/ Gene-Trak bDNA Chiron</pre><p>DNA Amplification PCR</p><p>Cetus developed PCR in the mid 1980s and it has since become a standard tool for molecular biology research. Roche purchased the technology for $300 million in 1992. PCR uses Taq a thermophilic DNA polymerase to copy target sequences identified by pairs of primers. The reaction is driven by using an excess of primers, which anneal at 60-65degreesC. Taq works at 72degreesC. The target DNA sequence and amplicon - the PCR copy - are denatured by heating the reaction to around 94degreesC, hence the need for thermocycling equipment. Each cycle takes less than three minutes. Amplicons serve as targets for subsequent rounds of amplification so the process is exponential. Taq is not the only polymerase suitable for PCR. Vent and Pfu have higher thermostability and proofreading activity. However, proofreading polymerases tend to attack the primers, reducing their specificity. Roche's position is reinforced by European patent protection for all thermostable DNA polymerases.</p><p>PCR has spawned many variations. Nested PCR uses two sets of primers, one of which matches a section within the domain of the first. By first amplifying a large fragment and then a smaller, more specific one, non-specific binding is reduced. A version of PCR based on Haemophilus reverse transcriptase allows RNA targets to be amplified in a single buffering system. Co-amplification of known DNA dilutions generates quantitative results. Multiplex PCR - using several primer pairs - allows several tests to be done in one tube and can be used, for example, to detect several mutations at once in cystic fibrosis testing or for typing of mycobacteria from a single sample. As many as 13 amplicons can be produced at the same time but optimising the reaction to amplify each in equal numbers becomes more as the number increases.</p><p>contamination</p><p>Roche has overcome one of the biggest problems facing clinical use of PCR - carryover of contaminating DNA - by using uracil N-glycosylase to remove any contaminating amplicons before the first round of amplification. The so called AmpErase technology is licensed from Life Technologies. AmpErase relies on the fact that TTP in normal DNA is replaced with UTP during PCR. Uracil N-glycosylase inactivates only uracil-containing DNA, leaving sample DNA unharmed. The enzyme is subsequently inactivated during the first round of heating.</p><p>LCR</p><p>PCR is undoubtedly established as the foremost amplification technique and is used in around 70% of molecular biology laboratories, but LCR has unique characteristics that make it attractive for diagnostic use.</p><p>LCR uses two pairs of complementary probes about 50-60 base pairs-long and a thermophilic ligase enzyme. The probe pairs are designed to anneal to a target sequence with a one base- pair gap between them. Only probes bound in this way are ligated. After ligation and denaturation the joined fragments serve as templates for further rounds of amplification - which like PCR proceeds exponentially. In a research setting ligated and non-ligated probes can be separated by electrophoresis and detected using radiological methods. In clinical tests, capture and detection ligands are attached to the opposite ends of probe fragments, biotin at the 5' end of one probe and a non-isotopic detection label at the 3' end of the other - so that only ligated products are both captured and detected. This strategy has allowed Abbott to use current automated detection equipment. The company's LCX system, which comprises a set of three instruments, is based on its IMX immunoassay system, which the company hopes will encourage laboratories to use their system.</p><p>mutation detection</p><p>Mismatches at the bases on either side of the ligation site effectively prevent the LCR reaction form taking place. This means LCR, which can be performed after PCR, is particularly good at identifying multiple point mutations (single base-pair changes).</p><p>The Polymerase/Ligase Chain Reaction</p><p>Because LCR uses relatively long probes the chances of non- specific binding are low. However blunt-end ligation can cause background amplification. A cunning combination of the PCR and LCR reactions developed by Imclone and Abbott overcomes background caused by mispriming (a problem in PCR) and blunt- end ligation. The increase in sensitivity makes the P/LCR reaction especially suited to diagnostic applications.</p><p>Like LCR, the P/LCR reaction uses four primer probes. But unlike LCR they are designed to leave a gap a few nucleotides long between their ends. The gap is carefully chosen to need only three of the four usual dNTPs (2'-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates) and only these are added to the reaction mixture. DNA ligase joins the gaps but non-specific primer extension is prevented by the absence of a full set of dNTPs. The ligation products function as targets for the next round of P/LCR. Competition between the ligation and extension reactions can be prevented by designing the reactions to take place at different temperatures.</p><p>CPR, the Cycling Probe Reaction</p><p>ID Biomedical's Cycling Probe Reaction falls between signal and target amplification. The probe - a DNA-RNA-DNA molecule - anneals to the target sequence and is cleaved by RNaseH to form two DNA fragments. The fragments do not act as templates. Like NASBA, the process is isothermal.</p><p>RNA amplificationRNA target amplification systems are often faster than their DNA counterparts but have the problem that they need highly purified clinical samples and extra precautions to exclude RNase contamination.</p><p>NASBA</p><p>NASBA uses three enzymes to directly amplify single stranded RNA or double stranded DNA. Like 3SR it uses AMV reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase and RNAse H in an isothermic reaction. NASBA was originally developed as a virus detection technique but now extended applications including the direct detection of RNA viruses and retroviruses, detection of live pathogens and cancer cell proliferation monitoring. NASBA has been shown to be as good as PCR for detecting HIV-1 viral load the fact that no thermocycler is needed could give it a commercial advantage.</p><p>The DNA & RNA Analysis System DARAS</p><p>Tepnel (UK) has tested a generic automated nucleic acid amplification system, DARAS, which uses a patented, solid support contained in a sterile, disposable microcolumn to capture target nucleic acid. In its present format the system uses the Klenow fragment to extent bound DNA but according to Tepnel it is compatible with both Taq and reverse transcriptase systems.</p><p>Signal Amplification</p><p>bDNA</p><p>Chiron's bDNA (branched DNA) system uses a two-step hybridisation to capture and amplify DNA. The first step involves hybridisation of the target sequence to probes linked to the wall of a tube or microwell plate. A second probe links the target sequence to the amplifier - a highly branched synthetic DNA molecule around 1,000 base pairs long, hence the name of the technique. The branches can be labelled with thousands of chemiluminescent tags, which in Chiron's clinical kits are visualised using digoxetane chemiluminescence. bDNA testing uses a relatively crude sample by comparison with PCR. Vice president of diagnostics Dr Mickey Urdea says bDNA probes in development can detect as few as 62 target molecules/ml, compared with 5,000/ml in the first generation.</p><p>Qbeta replicase</p><p>The Qbeta system is named after the bacteriophage source of RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Like PCR and LCR amplicons serve as templates so the reaction is exponential until the number of RNA and polymerase molecules reach equilibrium. The reaction is both rapid - billion-fold amplification in 30 minutes - and quantitative but because non specifically hybridised probes are amplified it has low specificity.</p><p>Products Targets for amplification-based diagnostics include STDs which tend to be diagnosed by labour intensive culture and identification. Differential diagnosis of gonorrhoea and chlamydia by traditional means is difficult and makes an ideal target for a genetic panel test. Direct detection of HIV and hepatitis C have a role in drug development and the monitoring of expensive therapies. The mycobacteria are another popular target for amplification. Here it is the advantage of same-day identification and typing over culture tests that take several weeks.</p><p>Coming soon from Clinica Reports, DNA Diagnostics: Current Status and Future Trends.
