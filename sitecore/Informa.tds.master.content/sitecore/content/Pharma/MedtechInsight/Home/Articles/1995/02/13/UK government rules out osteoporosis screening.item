<p>The UK government has accepted a report which recommends that bone scans should be available for women at high risk of osteoporosis. However, parliamentary health secretary Baroness Cumberlege rules out a comprehensive screening programme, saying she "does not ... want the NHS to offer screening to all women over 50 years old. In the light of existing knowledge about the disease, this would be quite wrong." She says that the NHS should decide at local level what priority to give to bone scans.</p>

<p>The UK government has accepted a report which recommends that bone scans should be available for women at high risk of osteoporosis. However, parliamentary health secretary Baroness Cumberlege rules out a comprehensive screening programme, saying she "does not ... want the NHS to offer screening to all women over 50 years old. In the light of existing knowledge about the disease, this would be quite wrong." She says that the NHS should decide at local level what priority to give to bone scans.</p><p>insufficient DXA</p><p>The report, published by the government-sponsored Advisory Group on Osteoporosis, agrees that widespread population screening does not appear to be cost-effective. However, it stresses that screening should not be confused with the use of densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as a clinical tool for diagnosing patients at risk of osteoporosis.</p><p>However, the UK has relatively few DXA devices (see chart). Only 90 are in use in the country, of which just 30 are funded by the NHS. The report claims that NHS patients are being refused DXA assessment on the grounds of a lack of services or funds, despite the fact that compliance with treatment is greatly improved if DXA indicates that the patient is at risk of osteoporosis.</p><p>There are 60,000 hip, 50,000 wrist and 40,000 vertebral fractures each year in the UK as a result of osteoporosis. About 80% of these occur in women. Almost half of all women will have experienced a fracture by the time they reach 70. The disease costs the UK NHS an estimated &pound;750 million ($1,125 million) per year.</p>
