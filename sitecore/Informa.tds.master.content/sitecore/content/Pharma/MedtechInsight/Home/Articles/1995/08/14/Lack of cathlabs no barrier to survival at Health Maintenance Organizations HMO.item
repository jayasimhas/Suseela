<p>Despite a lack of catheterisation facilities, HMO hospitals treat heart attacks as successfully as fee-for-service facilities. Researchers led by Dr Nathan Every at the University of Seattle retrospectively compared 998 patients admitted to two HMO hospitals with 7,036 patients treated at 13 fee-for-service hospitals between January 1988 and December 1992.</p>

<p>Despite a lack of catheterisation facilities, HMO hospitals treat heart attacks as successfully as fee-for-service facilities. Researchers led by Dr Nathan Every at the University of Seattle retrospectively compared 998 patients admitted to two HMO hospitals with 7,036 patients treated at 13 fee-for-service hospitals between January 1988 and December 1992.</p><p>Patients in the fee-for-service group were more likely to undergo angiography and angioplasty. Bypass rates were the same. Fee-for-service patients left hospital sooner and mortality was not significantly different.</p><pre>Coronary treatment at HMO and fee-for-service hospitals HMO fee-for-service Coronary Angiography (%) 41 59 Coronary Angioplasty (%) 6 26 Bypass Surgery (%) 11 11 Hospital Stay (days, average) 8 7.3 Mortality (%) 7.8 9.3 (p = 0.13) Source: JACC</pre><p>HMOs have been shown to provide care at a lower cost but savings have often been attributed to lower rates of admission as well as shorter stays. The Seattle group chose to look at heart attack treatment because nearly all patients require hospitalisation.</p>
