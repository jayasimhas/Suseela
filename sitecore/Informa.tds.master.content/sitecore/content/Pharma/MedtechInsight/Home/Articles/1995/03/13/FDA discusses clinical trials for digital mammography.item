<p>The US FDA Radiological Devices Advisory Panel met on March 6th to discuss clinical trial designs for the approval of digital mammography devices. No application regarding these devices is pending before the FDA but the regulatory body wished to discuss potential testing questions, including basic trial designs, suitable patient populations and endpoints.</p>

<p>The US FDA Radiological Devices Advisory Panel met on March 6th to discuss clinical trial designs for the approval of digital mammography devices. No application regarding these devices is pending before the FDA but the regulatory body wished to discuss potential testing questions, including basic trial designs, suitable patient populations and endpoints.</p><p>Representing the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), Dr Roger Schneider addressed the panel, saying that a manufacturer's responsibility is to generate data for labelling. Sufficient data could be generated "without extensive clinical testing", he argued, adding that it is the manufacturer's obligation to make sure the <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> of the device is at least equivalent to conventional, analogue mammography devices on the market. It is the physician's responsibility to ensure the correct interpretation of the device's output.</p><p>Dr Matthew Freedman, a non-panel member who was invited to talk, said: "We don't do a full outcome study every time a new [X-ray] film enters the market." He added: "I don't know if we need outcome studies.. but I think we definitely need clinical trials." Dr Freedman went on to say that standard tests were not sufficient to evaluate equivalency. He recommended performing both digital and analogue mammography on a group of patients having breast cancers less than 1 cm in diameter and comparing the results.</p><p>No formal vote was taken but panel members reached a <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> that at least two types of study should be performed before the FDA grants marketing approval. The first study should determine if digital mammography can detect abnormalities in approximately 100-200 patients who have been scheduled for breast biopsy following analogue mammogram but who lack palpable lumps. The biopsy results would be used to determine whether the digital mammography device allows physicians correctly to detect cancers in the patients.</p><p>The second trial should be performed on about 800 patients not scheduled for biopsy. There are two objectives to this trial. The first will be to determine if digital mammograms agree with analogue mammograms such that a positive or negative finding on the latter will also be found on the former. The second part of the study will ensure that two radiologists agree on the findings in a digital mammogram to at least the extent they do with analogue mammograms.</p><p>Some panel members, including Dr Larry Kessler of the US National Cancer Institute, stated that an additional study should be required to determine the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the digital system. The study would require the enrolment of thousands of patients who are having routine screening mammograms. Dr Martin Yaffe said: "Yes, I think the study on sensitivity and specificity must be done, but [it can be done] after marketing." Other panel members in favour of this study agreed with Dr Yaffe that it could be performed as a post-marketing study.</p>
