<p>ICDs are more cost-effective for sudden death survivors. The cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of ICD treatment for post-infarct sudden death survivors is $63 per day alive compared with $94 for those who receive class-1 antiarrhythmic drugs, according to data from a study conducted by the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam. The figures are based on median cost per patient, said Dr E Wever. The net cost effectiveness per year of life saved by ICDs was $11,300. ICDs are not reimbursed by Dutch insurers.</p>

<p>ICDs are more cost-effective for sudden death survivors. The cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of ICD treatment for post-infarct sudden death survivors is $63 per day alive compared with $94 for those who receive class-1 antiarrhythmic drugs, according to data from a study conducted by the Universities of Utrecht and Amsterdam. The figures are based on median cost per patient, said Dr E Wever. The net cost effectiveness per year of life saved by ICDs was $11,300. ICDs are not reimbursed by Dutch insurers.</p><p>Total ICD-group costs were higher during the first three months. However the drug-treatment patients needed more frequent hospitalisation and surgery and often changed over to ICD therapy. Patients treated solely with antiarrhythmic drugs had the lowest costs but extremely high mortality, which resulted in a CER of $196 per day.</p><p>Early ICD treatment was even more cost-effective if quality of life was taken into account since recurrent cardiac arrest and transplantation occurred only in the drug group, said Dr Wever. Exercise tolerance, total hospitalisation, number of invasive procedures and antiarrhythmic therapy changes were all statistically better in the ICD group.</p><p>The Utrecht/Amsterdam group presented survival data from a randomised trial of ICD and drug therapy at the joint world and European Cardiology meeting in Berlin last year. At 22 months mortality in the ICD group was half that for class-one antiarrhythmic drugs (see Clinica No 623, p 17-20).</p>
