<p>Rapidly expanding and easily accessible, the Israeli medical device market offers far more to foreign manufacturers than the size of the country would imply.</p><p>Although it has a population of just 5.3 million, Israel is ranked as the world's 28th-largest medical device market at $265 million. As a producer, it performs even better; medtech production is estimated at $410 million in a report by MDIS Publications. However, while this suggests that local manufacturers should have the domestic market well covered, Israel actually exports the bulk of its production, leaving a $195 million import market in 1993.</p><pre>Israeli balance of trade in medical devices 1993 ($ millions) Selected products Imports Exports Balance ECGs & electrodiagnostic 8.0 7.2 (0.8) X-ray devices & related 30.9 127.7 96.8 Dental devices 10.0 3.2 (6.8) Syringes, needles & catheters 16.3 4.2 (12.1) Ophthalmic instruments 4.7 0 (4.6) Other medical instruments 61.7 74.3 12.5 Orthopaedic implants 4.0 0 (3.9) Dental prostheses 3.4 0.1 (3.3) Other prostheses 8.6 0.2 (8.4) Pacemakers 3.8 0.1 (3.7) Bandages & dressings 6.9 2.4 (4.4) Total medical devices 195.1 234.8 39.6</pre><p>Medical device imports in Israel rose 21% in 1992, 17% in 1993 and look set to continue growing, according to MDIS. Most market segments have joined in the rise but electrodiagnostic apparatus, X-ray equipment (also Israel's fastest-growing export market), orthopaedic equipment and medical and surgical instruments are performing most strongly.</p><p>The leading suppliers are US companies, with 36% of the market in both 1992 and 1993. The EU accounts for half of imports with 70% of these coming from Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.</p><p>easy access</p><p>Israel has a liberal import policy, says MDIS, having free- trade agreements with the EU (since 1975), the US (1985) and EFTA (1992). These countries enjoy reciprocal trade advantages, although other nations have also benefited from a trade liberalisation programme implemented in Israel in 1991. Under this programme, import tariffs for certain countries will be lowered from the current 15% to 8-12% over a seven-year period.</p><p>public healthcare</p><p>In 1995, Israel started reforming its healthcare system with the introduction of a National Health Insurance Law aimed at resolving the financial difficulties besetting the country's largest sick fund, Kupat Holim Clalit. The organisation, run by the General Federation of Labour (Histradut), covers 76% of the population and operates some 15% of hospital beds in the country. Under the new law, a greater proportion of health insurance revenues will be payable to Kupat Holim Clalit rather than to newer, smaller funds.</p><p>However, further reforms are clearly needed. High birth and immigration rates have led to a rapidly-growing population, while immigrants from eastern Europe have brought a high incidence of psychological problems, cancer (160,000 have come from the Chernobyl region) and drinking- and smoking-related diseases, says MDIS. The government has prepared a reform plan to tackle this burden on the healthcare system but most of its elements have yet to be agreed.</p><pre>Israeli medical statistics Population (1993) 5.32 million Live births (1992) 110,062 Deaths (1992) 33,311 Health expenditure (1992) $4,400 million Health expenditure as % of GDP 7.7% Medical market (1994) $265 million Deaths per 100,000 population (1990) Male Female Malignant cancers 128.4 122.8 Acute myocardial infarction 78.7 63.4 Other ischaemic heart diseases 57.3 41.2 Cerebrovascular diseases 50.8 58.0 Respiratory diseases 37.7 41.1</pre><p>This 36-page profile of Israel is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications.
