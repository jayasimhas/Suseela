<p>Laser medicine is flourishing in Europe - a fact not fully expressed by a low-key meeting in Munich. Philip Greenfield reports.</p><p>For the second time, organisers ambitiously attempted to bring together the International Congress of Laser Medicine and the German Society for Laser Medicine under one roof at LaserMED 95 in Munich last month. What resulted was a meeting with little international interest, demonstrating that the growing number of applications and systems are far too numerous to be covered adequately by one meeting. Philip Greenfield reports.</p><p>Study backs low-power laser treatment</p><p>Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is still not fully accepted in German speaking countries which have focused on higher power systems, says Dr S Gotte of the Laser Institute at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Unterhaching. However, the technique has potential as a conservative, non-invasive treatment for a variety of orthopaedic and wound healing applications, he believes. Results of a randomised, double-blind study of 40 patients with gonarthritis, an arthritic condition affecting the knee, show the technique promotes more rapid reduction of pain and increased function.</p><p>Dr Gotte and colleagues treated 20 patients with LLLT and 20 with a placebo (red light), monitoring their response at three, five and seven weeks. After three weeks, 80% of patients experienced a moderate or good response to treatment, after five weeks 90% and seven weeks 95%. The results compare with various studies performed by the World Association for Laser Therapy, an international consortium investigating the efficacy of the technique, according to Dr Gotte.</p><p>laser therapy systems</p><p>The study was performed using a combination HeNe red and infrared diode laser manufactured by German company Felas. The HN 12 Combi Laser can be used in HeNe mode for surface applications or with infrared for deeper penetration. The company has added a scanning device which allows treatment of larger areas at various speeds and has introduced a higher power system for large-area skin diseases, wound healing and scar treatment.</p><p>Swiss manufacturer Lasotronic has introduced a scanner with an 830 nm (infrared) wavelength with power of up to 200mW and a new probe for physiotherapy which works at 830 nm and 110 mW. The company has developed a prototype system that works with green (532 nm) light which will be used for surface applications such as dermatology, gynaecology and cosmetic surgery. According to Lasotronic, which aims to be the first on the market with such a system, it will allow lower powers to be used as cells are 50 times more sensitive to green light than red.</p><p>lasers from Poland</p><p>Poland's largest medical laser manufacturer Laser Instruments hopes to break into the German market with a new miniature laser therapy system. The device, which works from 10-400 mW, is designed to treat a variety of conditions including prostate hypertrophy (using a rectal probe) and other urological conditions, dermatology, physiotherapy and stomatology. The device will be sold through Austrian distributor Medizin-Technische Gerate which is about to apply for TUV certification. Warsaw-based Laser Instruments also plans to market its range of systems, which include an erbium-YAG dental laser, low level laser therapy systems and scanner, hand-held CO(2) dental laser, surgical CO(2) laser and laser diode photocoagulator for ophthalmology.</p><p>ITT offers hope for cancer recurrence</p><p>Interstitial laser thermotherapy (ITT), whereby a laser fibre is introduced into a tumour or mass, is entering clinical use in a range of applications in Europe. According to research presented at LaserMED, the technique is promising as a palliative for inoperable cancers.</p><p>A team from the Grosshadern ear, nose and throat clinic in Munich used the technique on patients with recurring sinus tumours after unsuccessful primary operation and radiotherapy. Using an Nd:YAG laser and quartz glass fibre (Dornier Medizintechnik) introduced through a trocar, they were able to treat palliatively all four patients. Six weeks after treatment, tumour volume had decreased by between 60% and 100%. The technique allows minimally-invasive treatment and in combination with photodynamic therapy, in which photosensitive drugs are excited at the tumour site, offers more possibilities, say the researchers.</p><p>In a pilot study, a team from Heidelberg University women's clinic have applied ITT to gynaecology. The researchers treated patients with recurring gynaecological tumours using Dornier's MediLas 4060 Nd:YAG system and concluded that although ITT is a suitable palliative procedure, there is a need for multi-fibre systems and improved therapy planning through computer simulation.</p><p>Dornier's new ITT devices</p><p>Dornier Medizintechnik displayed a new range of laser probes for interstitial thermotherapy with its Nd:YAG lasers. The probes are introduced through a cannula and tracked using ultrasound or MRI. Three application tips are available for treating various volumes and applications such as inoperable tumours and BPH.</p><p>diode laser trials for BPH</p><p>In terms of procedure volumes, ITT offers the greatest potential in BPH treatment. Around 50% of men over 50 suffer from the condition. The technique offers an advantage over other methods in that it leaves the urethra intact. In the US, where ITT has not yet been accepted, six clinical sites will conduct Phase II clinical trials of a diode laser system for BPH treatment.</p><p>The trials will compare Indigo Medical's portable diode laser for interstitial thermotherapy with the conventional surgical treatment, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Interstitial thermotherapy, which is performed under local anaesthetic and takes 20-30 minutes, uses a cystoscope to introduce a laser fibre directly into the prostate, allowing lower laser energies to be used.</p><p>The six sites involved in the study are: The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; the University of Miami Hospitals and Clinics; California Pacific Medical Center, San Francisco; Stanford University Medical School's Division of Urology at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose; Vanderbilt University in Nashville; and Rhode Island Hospital in Providence.</p><p>Indigo will face competition from UK-based Diomed, whose Diomed 15 system was launched last year for ITT of the prostate but is not yet available in the US. The company is also investigating the use of ITT for metastatic liver cancer, a difficult-to-treat condition with a poor prognosis, in collaboration with the Middlesex Hospital.</p><p>the CO(2) laser becomes easier to use</p><p>Reducing the bulkiness and expense associated with CO(2) laser systems, Israeli manufacturer Optomedic Medical Technologies has introduced a new compact, lower cost CO(2) system for surgery. The Kaplan PenduLaser, which was shown for the first time in Germany at LaserMED, was developed by Professor Isaac Kaplan, professor of surgery and plastic surgery at Tel Aviv University and pioneer of laser surgery.</p><p>The system's main innovation is its delivery system - the laser energy is delivered through a suspended telescopic arm rather than a conventional articulated arm, which can be difficult to work with. This has also allowed the cost to be reduced. "We are offering the system at 60% of the price of an equivalent performance system, such as Sharplan's 1020," Alex Harel, Optomedic's managing director told Clinica. The PenduLaser will cost up to $20,000, depending on the number of features offered.</p><p>The laser works both in continuous wave mode, with power adjustable up to 15 W, and pulse mode at ten pulses per second. Although the 15 W power is lower than many existing surgical CO(2) systems, it is sufficient for most uses, according to Prof Kaplan, as the beam's very short focal length and small spot size give the laser a much higher energy density than similar power systems. Applications include neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, ENT, gynaecology, urology, dermatology and dental surgery.</p><p>Other features include an autoclavable handpiece, a disposable optical probe, suitable for uvulaplasty, a disposable optical wave guide for char-free surface applications and a side firing probe which can be used in rectal surgery. When moving between clinics, the 15 kg laser can be wheeled along in a suitcase-sized container.</p><p>Optomedics has launched the system in Israel, parts of Europe and the Far East. The company is currently signing up a German distributor. The US offers the largest market for the system, however, at 500-1,000 systems per year and Optomedics plans to commence sales of the device in the next few weeks through distributor Spectrum Medical.</p>
