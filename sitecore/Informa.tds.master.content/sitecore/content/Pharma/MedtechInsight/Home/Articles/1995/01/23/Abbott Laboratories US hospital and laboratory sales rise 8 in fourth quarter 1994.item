<p>Fourth-quarter sales of hospital & laboratory products at <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> Laboratories (US) increased 8% compared with the previous year. Revenue growth of pharmaceutical & nutritional products was again higher at 14.4%, continuing a trend seen earlier in the year.</p><pre>Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 2,482 2,228 423 391 Year 9,156 8,408 1,517 1,399 Annual turnover by segment ($ millions) Total Change (of which) US sales ($ millions) from 1993 ($ millions) Hospital & laboratory products 4,205 4.6% 2,304 Pharmaceutical & nutritional products 4,951 12.8% 3,366 (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>In in vitro diagnostics, the "continued success of the IMx automated immunoassay system and the worldwide launch of AxSYM strengthened our worldwide leadership position," says Abbott. In the first year on the market the company shipped 1,600 AxSYM instruments, its immunoassay diagnostic systems for medium- to high-volume laboratories. The instrument was launched outside the US in January 1994 and in the US in June. More than 20 tests are approved for use with the system in the US and more than 30 worldwide. "Additional assays will be continuously developed," Abbott adds.</p><p>In late 1995, the Illinois-based company plans to launch its first products using gene amplification technologies. This is based on an agreement with <strong>[C#198601110:Hoffmann-La Roche]</strong>, struck in April 1994, cross-licensing Abbott's ligase chain reaction and Roche's PCR technologies.</p>
