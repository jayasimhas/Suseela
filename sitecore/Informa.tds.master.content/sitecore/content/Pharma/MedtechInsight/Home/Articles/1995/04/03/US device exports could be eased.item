<p>Legislation that would greatly ease the rules on export of medical devices and pharmaceuticals from the US was introduced in both the US House of Representatives and Senate on March 22nd. For the first time, unapproved Class III devices, Class II devices that fail to adhere to performance standards and investigational products could be marketed in any country belonging to the World Trade Organisation, provided the devices have not been banned in the US.</p><p>Current legislation imposes various time-consuming and costly requirements on devices depending on their perceived risk and exports of unapproved products are restricted accordingly - even if the importing country has already approved the device.</p><p>The newly introduced bills, however, would allow export of medical devices and other FDA-regulated products according to one simple rule: World Trade Organisation members could import a product subject to FDA regulation, without regard to approval status in the US, if the product meets four criteria:</p><p>1. It complies with the specifications of the foreign purchaser.</p><p>2. It is not in conflict with laws of the country to which it is intended for export.</p><p>3. The product packaging clearly states that the contents are intended for export.</p><p>4. The product is not sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce.</p><p>At present, devices that are not commercially distributed in the US are subject to FDA receipt of the receiving country's approval and agency determination that the export would not be contrary to the public health and safety of the importing country. FDA review is required for banned devices, those subject to an Investigation Device Exemption, devices never marketed in the US that lack acceptable premarket notification, and, as noted above, Class II devices that fail to adhere to performance standards and unapproved Class III devices.</p><p>Permits are required for unapproved Class II devices and those requiring premarket approval (PMA). Many countries also request a certificate of free sale from the US for FDA-approved products, indicating that the device is available in the US.</p><p>Manufacturers may export any approved 510(k) or PMA product without prior FDA approval. They may also ship unapproved 510(k) devices.</p><p>strong sponsorship</p><p>Sponsors of the legislation, the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1995, are many and influential. Thirteen of the 29 House sponsors are on the Committee on Commerce, which must consider the bill. Senate sponsors include chairmen of both Judiciary (Orrin Hatch, R-Utah) and Labor & Human Resources (Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kans) committees.</p><p>Senator Hatch told colleagues on March 21st that the legislation "has a simple premise: the FDA cannot continue to be the traffic cop for world trade in medical goods. It is clear that the law must be revised, and that is our goal .... President Clinton has signalled that he will be proposing a number of changes at the FDA, including changes in the laws governing the export of medical products" (see Clinica No 647, p 9).</p><p>The FDA says its average processing time for export permits was only 16 days last year and just 10 days for certificates. Critics contend that these average figures are misleading - some permits required 150 days.</p><p>"Besides," one congressional source says, "I think we have to ask ourselves if this is how we want to be spending government resources in this day and age. If other nations wish to receive the benefits of our technology, why must we insist on approving that technology first?"</p>
