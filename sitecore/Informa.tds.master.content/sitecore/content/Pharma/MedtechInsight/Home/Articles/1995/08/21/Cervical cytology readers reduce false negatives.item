<p>The false negative rate for Pap tests should be reduced with the cervical cytology readers reviewed by the US FDA advisory panel this month. Unanimously recommending approval for Neuromedical Systems' Papnet and Neopath's AutoPap analysers on August 7th and 8th (see Clinica No 667, p 1), the Haematology and Pathology Devices Advisory Panel noted that cervical cancer responds favourably to treatment if detected early by Pap test. However false negative rates for Pap tests are on average 25%.</p>

<p>The false negative rate for Pap tests should be reduced with the cervical cytology readers reviewed by the US FDA advisory panel this month. Unanimously recommending approval for Neuromedical Systems' Papnet and Neopath's AutoPap analysers on August 7th and 8th (see Clinica No 667, p 1), the Haematology and Pathology Devices Advisory Panel noted that cervical cancer responds favourably to treatment if detected early by Pap test. However false negative rates for Pap tests are on average 25%.</p><p>The two devices differ in several ways. Papnet scans cytology slides using algorithms and neural networks to locate the 128 most abnormal cells on a slide. The device displays computerised images of the cells on a monitor. Matrix co- ordinates allow the technician to find the abnormal cells on the glass slide.</p><p>AutoPap, on the other hand, does not locate or display computerised images of cells: instead slides are mechanically screened and algorithms are used to pick the 10% of slides that are most likely to be abnormal. AutoPap slide scanners will be placed in the cytology laboratory while the Papnet slide scanners will be located in a central laboratory to which cytology laboratories will send slides for analysis.</p><p>While both devices screen Pap smears that have been classified as normal by traditional examination, their intended uses are different. AutoPap will screen all negative slides to find the 10% of slides most likely to be abnormal. The logic is that one is more likely to find false negatives in an enriched sample versus randomly screening 10% of all slides as required in the US. Papnet, by contrast, is to be used as an adjunctive test and not to replace routine rescreening.</p><p>Papnet data</p><p>The Papnet PMA contained data from approximately 12,000 slides. Previously reported normal Pap smears in women later diagnosed as having cervical cancer by biopsy were reviewed. The index group contained 573 slides from 487 smears of 228 patients. There were 20 matched controls for each index, thus the control group contained 11,354 slides from 9,666 smears from as many women.</p><p>The results showed that Papnet was effective in detecting abnormal cells in cytology specimens of 31% of those women whose Pap smear was initially diagnosed as normal but who later had a tumour diagnosed by biopsy. Approximately 50% of the results were changed to mild/early abnormalities and the remainder were more advanced abnormalities. The data indicated that overall sensitivity was increased 30%. Neuromedical Systems claims 40% of patients would have been diagnosed 24 months earlier if the device had been used at the time the original Pap test was incorrectly read as negative.</p><p>Panel member Dr Diane Norback said: "I am concerned Papnet will not pick up extracervical lesions like ovarian carcinoma, that will be picked up by the Pap smear." Another panel member expressed concern that Papnet may not increase sensitivity since it is used as an adjunctive test, not as a primary screening tool, and that people may use it off-label for primary screening.</p><p>AutoPap results</p><p>The AutoPap PMA contained data from six different studies. In the major clinical study from six sites, approximately 3,500 slides diagnosed as normal were rescreened manually and with AutoPap. The manual screen detected 106 false negatives; approximately 50% of these were detected by AutoPap. This represents a five-fold improvement in detection of false negatives since normal rescreening of 10% of slides would be expected to pick up 10% of all false negatives.</p><p>The panel members expressed some concern regarding the AutoPap. Dr Bentley noted that all the slides from one of the trial centres were discarded because the staining of the smears was incompatible with the system. Dr Norback was concerned with quality control, recommending external controls. She pointed out that there were no control slides to be read by the machine to ensure it is functioning properly.</p>
