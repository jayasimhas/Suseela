You undertake to comply with the permitted use terms and restrictions applicable to the type of licence you have purchased and to procure that all Users and/or members of your Personnel do likewise. </p> <p> 3.3 The licence granted to you is granted on these Terms and on any Additional Conditions applicable to particular Materials and/or Products as set out on the Order Form. </p> <p> 3.4 The Order Form will indicate the particular Materials and/or Products purchased by you or to which you have subscribed and which type of licence you have purchased, the different licence options being classified as follows: <br> a) Single User Licence (please see Part 5 for permitted use terms and restrictions); or <br> (b) Multi-User Licence (please see Part 5 for permitted use terms and restrictions); or <br> (c) Site Licence (please see Part 5 for permitted use terms and restrictions); or <br> (d) Multi-Site Licence (please see Part 5 for permitted use terms and restrictions). </p> <p> 3.5 We have used our reasonable endeavours to ensure that all Materials, Products and Online Services comply with English laws. However, we make no representations that the Materials, Products and/or Online Services are appropriate or available for use in locations outside England. Those who visit our website from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws. You accept that if you are resident outside England, you must satisfy yourself that you are lawfully able to use and purchase or subscribe to the Materials, Products and/or Online Services and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Informa Healthcare accepts no liability for any costs, losses or damages in this regard. </p> <p> 3.6 The contents of the Online Services and of the Materials and of Products are protected by international copyright laws, database rights and other intellectual property rights. The owner of these rights is Informa Healthcare, our affiliates or other third party licensors. All product and company names and logos contained within our website or the Online Services or the Materials or Products are the trade marks, service marks or trading names of their respective owners, including us. All of our rights which are not specifically granted to you by these Terms are reserved to us. </p> <p> 3.7 Except as set out in sub-clause 3.1, we exclude all express or implied terms, conditions, warranties, representations or endorsements whatsoever with regard to the Materials, the Online Services, Products, our website or any information or service provided through our website.

In circumstances where you suffer loss or damage arising out of or in connection with the viewing, use or performance of Online Services, Materials or any Product, we accept no liability for this loss or damage whether due to inaccuracy, error, omission or any other cause and whether on the part of Informa Healthcare or our servants, agents or any other person or entity. </p> <p> 3.9 If we are liable to you for any reason, our liability will be limited to the amount paid by you for the Online Services or the Materials or any Product in the year in which such liability arose. This limit does not apply to any liability we may have for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence or from our fraudulent misrepresentation. </p> <p> 3.10 You are responsible for ensuring that your computer system meets all relevant technical specifications necessary to use Online Services or to use or receive Materials or any Product. You also understand that although we try to guard against viruses, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that any material available for downloading from Online Services or that Materials or Products will be free from infections, viruses and/or other code that has contaminating or destructive properties. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and virus checks (including anti-virus and other security checks) to satisfy your particular requirements for the accuracy of data input and output. </p> <p> 3.11 The limitations and exclusions in this clause 3 do not affect your non-excludable statutory rights and only apply to the extent permitted by applicable law. </p> <p> 3.12 You may not assign, transfer or sub-licence any of your rights under these Terms and/or the Order Form. </p> <p> 3.13 These Terms together with the Additional Conditions, the Order Form and payment method instructions, (if any), are the whole agreement between you and Informa Healthcare. You acknowledge that you have not entered into this agreement in reliance upon any statement, warranty or representation made by Informa Healthcare or any other person and you irrevocably and unconditionally waive any rights to claim damages and/or to rescind this agreement by reason of any misrepresentation (other than a fraudulent misrepresentation) that is not contained in these Terms, the Additional Conditions, the Order Form and payment method instructions (if any). </p> <p> 3.14 These Terms and your use of our websites are governed by English law and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts. </p> <p> 3.15 Except in respect of a payment obligation, neither you nor Informa Healthcare will be held liable for any failure to perform any obligation to the other due to causes beyond your or Informa Healthcare&rsquo;s respective reasonable control. </p> <p> 3.16 Failure or delay by either party in enforcing an obligation or exercising a right under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy. </p> <p> 3.17 These Terms do not confer any rights on any person or party (other than you and/or us) pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. </p> <p> 3.18 The following applies to any information you provide to us, for example, during any registration or subscription process: </p> <p> (a) You authorise us to use, store or otherwise process any personal information which relates to and/or identifies you and/or Users, (including, but not limited to, names and addresses), to the extent reasonably necessary for us, our partners, successors (including the purchaser of the whole or part of our business), associates, sub-contractors or other third parties (together our &quot;Partner Companies&quot;) to make available and/or to provide the Materials and/or any Products to you and/or to Users. These Partner Companies may be located in countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have laws to protect your information. </p> <p> (b) If you obtain or choose to buy Materials and/or Products through our website then we may collect information about your buying behaviour and if you send us personal correspondence such as e-mails or letters then we may collect this information into a file specific to you (together, the various purposes set out in this clause 3.18 shall be known as the &quot;Purposes&quot;). All such information collected by us shall be referred to in these Terms as &quot;Personal Information&quot;. </p> <p> (c) By accepting these Terms, you agree to the processing and disclosure of the Personal Information for the Purposes. </p> <p> 3.19 We have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor use of the Online Service and/or access to Materials in order to verify compliance with these Terms and any Additional Conditions and/or any operating rules established by us and/or to satisfy any law, regulation or authorised government request. </p> <p> 3.20 We are entitled (in our absolute discretion and without any requirement for explanation) to refuse any subscription or purchase request for any of the Materials. If you wish to purchase and/or to subscribe for Materials online through our website, you will need to follow the subscription procedures set out on our website. </p> <p> 3.21 Details of our prices for Materials and for subscription licences to Materials together with the procedures for payment are displayed on our website but we may change these prices before your order is accepted. We try to ensure that our prices displayed on our website are accurate but the price on your order will need to be validated by us as part of the acceptance procedure (see clause 3.20 above and clause 3.22 below). We will inform you if a purchase price or a subscription&rsquo;s correct price is higher than that stated in your purchase/subscription request and you may then cancel the order and decide whether or not to purchase/subscribe to the Materials at the correct price. The prices are exclusive of applicable taxes. </p> <p> 3.22 As mentioned above, Informa Healthcare is entitled to refuse any subscription request placed by you. If your purchase and/or subscription request is accepted, we will confirm acceptance to you by online electronic means (&quot;Confirmation&quot;) to the e-mail address you have given us on registration or on ordering. In respect of the Online Service, our making the Online Service available to you constitutes performance of our services and you will have no right to cancel the contract once we have done so. </p> <p> 3.23 You undertake that all details you provide to us for the purpose of purchasing and/or subscribing to Materials will be correct, that the credit or debit card which you use is your own and that there are sufficient funds or credit facilities to cover the cost of any purchase/subscription. We reserve the right to obtain validation of your credit or debit card details before supplying or allowing you access to the Materials. </p> <p> 3.24 For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be bound to supply or permit access to any of the Materials unless and until EITHER:- </p> <p> (a) we receive a properly completed and signed Order Form from the prospective Client AND we sign the Order Form and confirm our acceptance to you; OR </p> <p> (b) in the case of online purchase/subscription requests, we have issued a Confirmation to you; AND </p> <p> (c) we have received payment in full for the Materials. If (in our absolute discretion) we agree to accept payment after the start of the Subscription Period, you will pay us the amount due within 30 days after the date of our invoice to you for the Materials (unless otherwise agreed). </p> <p> 3.25 If you cancel any Subscription before the end of the Subscription Period or if you return any Products or Materials, you will not be entitled to a refund. </p> <p> <a href="#top" class="emailLink">Back to top</a> </p> <p> <b><a name="online">4.
