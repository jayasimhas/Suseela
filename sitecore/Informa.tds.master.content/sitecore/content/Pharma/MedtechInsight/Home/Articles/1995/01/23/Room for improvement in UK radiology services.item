<p>The UK NHS could save over &pound;20 million ($30 million) a year by eliminating unnecessary X-ray examinations, according to a UK health services watchdog. A report from the Audit Commission quotes 1990 figures which indicate up to 20% of X-rays contribute almost nothing to the clinical care of patients and may be merely a "technological placebo" offered by referring hospital doctors and GPs. The report, which calls for a reorganisation of UK diagnostic imaging departments, also highlights inequities in the availability of high-tech equipment and deficient monitoring by radiology departments into how their assets are used.</p>

<p>The UK NHS could save over &pound;20 million ($30 million) a year by eliminating unnecessary X-ray examinations, according to a UK health services watchdog. A report from the Audit Commission quotes 1990 figures which indicate up to 20% of X-rays contribute almost nothing to the clinical care of patients and may be merely a "technological placebo" offered by referring hospital doctors and GPs. The report, which calls for a reorganisation of UK diagnostic imaging departments, also highlights inequities in the availability of high-tech equipment and deficient monitoring by radiology departments into how their assets are used.</p><p>The auditors believe that reviewing physicians' requests for X-rays and other imaging procedures can provide breathing space to cope with the 5% pa increase in demand for radiology procedures. The Royal College of Radiologists has published guidelines for referring physicians on the use of radiology which have helped to reduce referrals by 30% in some hospitals. In addition, wider use of cross-charging in NHS trusts, whereby referring departments will be charged on a cost-per-item basis for radiological services, could reduce unnecessary requests, the Audit Commission report adds.</p><p>uneven spread of resources</p><p>The UK spends &pound;600 million a year on radiology services - the average hospital radiology department has around &pound;2 million worth of equipment. However, few departments carry out comprehensive surveys of how equipment is used and identify areas for development and cost savings, the report says. There is a wide variation in the availability of expensive equipment such as MRI systems: some regional health authorities have four times as many MRI scanners per million population as others. In addition, unit costs of radiology in terms of equipment, radiologists and radiographers are twice as high in some departments compared with others.</p><p>NHS trusts should be making more use of their control over local NHS funds for capital equipment and private sector investment to buy equipment which meets the needs of the local population, say the auditors. The report also suggests that consideration be given to buying expensive specialist services, such as MRI and interventional radiology, from outside the trust.</p><p>the future</p><p>The pace at which imaging technology is moving could pose additional problems to radiology departments if it is not managed strategically. The auditors recommend that full evaluation of costs and benefits of new, expensive equipment such as picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) be carried out. Two studies have been commissioned by the NHS Executive: evaluation of PACS by the Health Economics Research Group at Brunel University, Middlesex; and MRI in the district general hospital and the use of imaging in back pain management within the Health Technology Assessment Programme.</p><p>The availability of basic X-ray and ultrasound services in primary care settings is likely to play a greater role in future radiology services as GP fundholders show growing interest. In addition, patient-centred care, comprising a small multidisciplinary hospital team, offers opportunities for radiology services, although the high capital cost of radiology equipment alone could be inhibitory for such small workloads. In both settings, the costs and benefits of this service must be fully reviewed, the report warns.</p><p>The Audit Commission is an independent body responsible for auditing NHS trusts and other health service bodies in England and Wales. Its study into radiology in the NHS - Improving Your Image: How to Manage Radiology Services More Effectively - is available from HMSO publications priced &pound;11.00.
