<p>Under a $336,000 agreement funded primarily by the US Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities will use patient- specific data from Diatech to develop a software package to reduce uncertainty in cancer treatment plans involving radionuclide therapy.</p><p>Using biokinetic and anatomical data from Diatech's clinical trials of a tin isotope, ORAU's Radiation Internal Dose Information Center will develop software to help nuclear medicine physicians to determine the effect of radiotherapy on specific organs. It is expected to reduce considerably the time taken to make these calculations which currently have to be performed by specialists in internal dosimetry. Diatech's data are considered valuable by RIDIC because the isotope being studied travels primarily to the skeleton, providing a simple example in developing biokinetic models.</p><p>ORAU, based in Tennessee, is a private, non-profit consortium of 88 colleges and universities and a management and operating contractor for the US Department of Energy.</p>
