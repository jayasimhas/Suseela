<p>Hemagen Diagnostics (US) has agreed to buy Reagents Applications (RAI), a $7 million diagnostics company, from Finnish-owned Kone Holdings. Terms were not disclosed.</p><p>San Diego-based RAI produces a wide range of reagents for automated chemistry analysers used in hospitals and private laboratories. Hemagen president Dr Carl Franzblau says he wants RAI's management and 55-strong workforce to remain with the company, whose leased 1,800 m(2) facility is to be retained and probably expanded.</p><p>The deal was announced within a week of Hemagen purchasing another diagnostic business, Schiapparelli Biosystems' immunofluorescence line (see Clinica No 662, p 14). Together, the two acquisitions "will contribute greatly to Hemagen's goal of becoming a broad-based producer of specialty diagnostics", says Dr Franzblau. "Both acquisitions are profitable and were made possible because of restructuring by their parent organisations in Europe."</p>
