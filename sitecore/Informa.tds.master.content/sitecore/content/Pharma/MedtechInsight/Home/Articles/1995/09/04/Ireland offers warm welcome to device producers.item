<p>Favourable tax and investment policies are rapidly turning Ireland into an important medical device production centre, asserts Medistat in its latest report on the country. Although the market, worth some $160 million, is one of the most modest in Europe, the government has done much to attract foreign investment. Most output is destined for the European market.</p>

<p>Favourable tax and investment policies are rapidly turning Ireland into an important medical device production centre, asserts Medistat in its latest report on the country. Although the market, worth some $160 million, is one of the most modest in Europe, the government has done much to attract foreign investment. Most output is destined for the European market.</p><p>The list of companies manufacturing in Ireland is dominated by foreign multinationals attracted by the lowest corporate tax rate on manufacturing profits in Europe. Companies are also lured by capital, employment and training grants from the Irish Development Agency, a large and well-trained employment pool and a low inflation rate.</p><p>Some 300 companies are manufacturing healthcare products in Ireland, including 50 US multinationals, being joined by two more this year. Merit Medical Systems, the US manufacturer of angiography and angioplasty products, began production in early 1995 in Castlerea, County Roscommon, with assistance from the Irish Development Agency. Utah Medical Products is to start assembly operations for blood pressure monitoring components and electrosurgery products in Athlone in early 1996.</p><p>Indigenous medical device manufacturers are mainly small-scale producers of disposables.</p><p>Irish medical device exports totalled IR&pound;504.4 million ($310 million) in 1993, compared with IR&pound;459.1 million in 1992. Medical and surgical instruments and supplies represented 66% of the 1993 total, with syringes, needles, catheters and cannulae accounting for 18% of total exports. Over 65% of exports go to EU countries.</p><p>signs of market growth</p><p>Although small and having suffered cutbacks during a decade of economic difficulty, the Irish market is now showing signs of growth, says Medistat. Improvements in economic performance and a shift in emphasis towards greater private funding have precipitated a modest growth in health spending. The orthopaedic and prosthetic sector should continue to grow with the ageing population. The replacement of old equipment and purchase of new technology should also add impetus to the market.</p><p>Geographically the east coast of Ireland, and Dublin in particular, has been the focus of healthcare development. The movement of the population to this area has necessitated upgrading facilities. Government policy is to restructure hospital services by replacing small hospitals with larger modern units offering a full range of services.</p><p>market access</p><p>Medical equipment tendering is handled by the area health boards (of which there are eight). The key decision maker is the supplies/purchasing officer (although tenders for medical equipment must first be approved by the Department of Health). Disposable and supplies purchasing is handled by individual hospitals on an annual basis with tenders usually issued in November or December.</p><p>Agents and distributors are the main channels of distribution in the Irish medical market. There are some 100 distributors, although a handful of large companies dominate. Several of the larger multinational manufacturers have also begun to sell their products direct to end users.</p><pre>Irish Medical Statistics Health expenditure (1993) $3,200 billion Health expenditure as % of GDP 7.3% Medical device market (1993) $160 million Medical device expenditure per capita $46 World medical device market ranking 38 Leading foreign supplier US 1993 medical device imports (1992) IR&pound;153.8m (IR&pound;162.8m) 1993 medical device exports (1992) IR&pound;504.4m (IR&pound;459.1m) Main cause of death (1993) Circulatory problems (44.9%)</pre><p>This 24-page profile of Ireland is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications.
