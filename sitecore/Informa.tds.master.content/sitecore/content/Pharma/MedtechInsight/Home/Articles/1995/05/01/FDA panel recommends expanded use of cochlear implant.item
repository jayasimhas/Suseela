<p>Additional indications have been recommended for Cochlear's Nucleus 22-channel cochlear implant provided certain changes are made to the pack insert. The FDA Ear, Nose and Throat Advisory Panel unanimously voted on April 20th to recommend use of the implant in patients over 18 years old with less severe deafness as defined by postlingual, severe to profound sensorineural deafness not adequately assisted by hearing aids. The device received US marketing approval in 1985 for use in adult patients with postlingual, profound sensorineural deafness who are unable to obtain significant benefit from a hearing aid.</p>

<p>Additional indications have been recommended for Cochlear's Nucleus 22-channel cochlear implant provided certain changes are made to the pack insert. The FDA Ear, Nose and Throat Advisory Panel unanimously voted on April 20th to recommend use of the implant in patients over 18 years old with less severe deafness as defined by postlingual, severe to profound sensorineural deafness not adequately assisted by hearing aids. The device received US marketing approval in 1985 for use in adult patients with postlingual, profound sensorineural deafness who are unable to obtain significant benefit from a hearing aid.</p><p>Cochlear submitted data from a multicentre trial involving 63 patients who received unilateral cochlear implants. The study outcome was determined by comparing hearing in patients before and after implantation. The majority of implanted patients developed noticeable hearing improvement based on a variety of speech recognition tests. Adverse events secondary to surgery included loss of residual hearing in the implanted ear and vestibular damage. Panel members unanimously agreed the data showed a favourable benefit to risk ratio.</p><p>The panel was reluctant to define specifically the target patient population using definitive results from particular tests because it was considered this would be too restrictive to clinicians and would prevent many patients from receiving reimbursement from health insurance organisations. However, members did agree to include a hearing loss of 90 dB as a threshold for considering implantation.</p>
