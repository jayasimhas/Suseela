<p>EMEDCA looks set to grant membership status to three new testing and certification organisations at its September 26th meeting. This will bring the total to 18. SEV, the Swiss electrotechnical group, Sira (UK), and the Austrian electrotechnical group, OV, have all received positive assessments, although there are some outstanding questions.</p><p>EMEDCA is the European Active Medical Device Certification Agreement set up in spring 1991 to help manufacturers gain competitive edge. Its members offer manufacturers certification to standards over and above those required to meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive (see Clinica No 601, p 7). Certification by one EMEDCA member is generally accepted by others, although additional testing may be necessary. Not all EMEDCA organisations are Notified Bodies under the Medical Devices Directive.</p><p>To demonstrate that they have met EMEDCA's additional requirements, manufacturers receive an EMEDCA-stamped covering page with their test report. To use other members' logos, manufacturers must present the report to these relevant testing organisations. A small group has been set up to develop an EMEDCA logo.</p><p>EMEDCA is collecting data to assess how many manufacturers have applied for certification to date. Information on applications and certificates granted is stored on a database which also houses information on whether member organisations have recognised each other's certification and whether additional tests have been required.</p>
