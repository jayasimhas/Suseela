<p>Heart valves will need premarket approval in France - probably by early 1996 - unless they meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and are CE-marked. The Health Ministry is in the process of notifying the European Commission of its proposed homologation requirements under Directive 83/189/EEC, known as the Standstill Directive.</p>

<p>Heart valves will need premarket approval in France - probably by early 1996 - unless they meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and are CE-marked. The Health Ministry is in the process of notifying the European Commission of its proposed homologation requirements under Directive 83/189/EEC, known as the Standstill Directive.</p><p>Once officially informed, the Commission and Member States will have three months to object. Any company that opposes the proposal should react swiftly by contacting the Commission or its Competent Authority.</p><p>Heart valves are covered by the Medical Devices Directive which came into effect on January 1st and will be fully enforced from June 14th, 1998. During the current transitional period, manufacturers may choose to comply with either national regulations or the Directive as transposed into national law.</p><p>Although heart valves have been absent from the list of devices requiring premarket approval, they have been monitored through the French clinical investigation process, a Health Ministry spokesman said.</p><p>opposition?</p><p>The Commission suggested that proposals of this kind could be opposed on the grounds that they violate Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome and represent a barrier to trade. They may also breach the requirement for Member States to maintain unchanged national regulations during the transition period of a Directive. If a "detailed opinion" is given by the Commission as to why the regulations are a barrier to trade, France will have to wait another three months before introducing them.</p><p>The French Health Ministry is optimistic that this will not happen. It argues that it is not introducing new regulations - since homologation existed prior to the transposition period - but only updating its list. Furthermore, a precedent has been set by the addition of breast implants to the list in September 1994 which was relatively straightforward, the spokesman noted.</p><p>The new premarketing approval requirements for heart valves would become redundant from June 14th, 1998, when the Medical Devices Directive becomes mandatory.</p><p>Directive 83/189/EEC ensures that Member States notify the Commission of any proposed technical regulations. It is known as the Standstill Directive because the originating country must refrain from introducing the regulations for three months while the Commission consults other Member States. Although it does not normally prevent the introduction of new national legislation, it does slow down the process.</p>
