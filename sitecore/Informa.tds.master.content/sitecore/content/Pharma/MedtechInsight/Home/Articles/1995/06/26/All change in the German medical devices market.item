<p>As the largest medical devices market in Europe - at some DM 11,000 million ($7,900 million) - and the third-largest in the world, Germany is a major target for medical manufacturers. Now the procedures for getting products onto the market are undergoing radical change.</p><p>If one country had anything to lose from the EU medical device Directives, it would be Germany, where quality and safety standards are among the highest in Europe and medical companies already dominate the European market. Manufacturers and consumers alike have expressed fears that standards harmonisation will lead to a flood of relatively low-cost, low-quality products from other countries.</p><p>Whether this happens remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: any company planning to market medical products in Germany is going to have to come to terms with a completely new set of rules which, in many ways, turns the old approval procedure on its head.</p><p>The legislative change</p><p>Germany's old approvals procedure is contained in the Medical Technical Regulations (MedGV), although certain products are also covered by the Pharmaceuticals Law. Compliance with these gives the manufacturer the right to affix the GS-mark (geprufte Sicherheit - tested for safety) to the product; very few products may be sold without one. MedGV applies to complete medical devices, covering some 10,000 products.</p><p>Both the EU Active Implantable Medical Device (AIMD) Directive and the Medical Devices Directive (MDD), which allow manufacturers to affix the CE marking to their products, have been incorporated in Germany into a single law - the Medizinproduktegesetz (MPG). This came into effect on January 1st, 1995, although related ordinances have been delayed. It covers individual components of medical devices - some 400,000 items.</p><p>All AIMDs in Germany must conform to the MPG, as the EU AIMD Directive has ended a transition period and is now fully in force. However, other medical devices can be marketed with either MPG or MedGV certification until June 13th, 1998. After that date all devices must conform to the MPG and MedGV will be revoked.</p><pre>Classification of medical equipment under MedGV Category Description Requirements under MedGV Group 1 Active medical Must be type-tested and equipment. 25 listed government-licensed as items - all high risk. meeting the requirements of MedGV (which includes relevant safety/technical standards). Group 2 Active medical implants. As for group 1 but can also be subject to the Pharmaceuticals Law. Group 3 Active medical equipment No type-testing but MedGV not in groups 1 or 2. must be complied with. Group 4 Non-active medical As for group 3. equipment. Classification of medical equipment under the MPG Category Description/Requirements under MPG Class I Low risk (eg medical swabs) Manufacturer can self-certify and affix the CE marking but must keep all relevant technical documentation for at least five years after the last product has been manufactured. An exception is sterile or measuring devices, which act as if they are in Class IIa. Class IIa Low-medium risk (eg ECGs) Manufacturer can self-certify device design and must certify production by: (a) EC verification; or (b) production quality assurance; or (c) product quality assurance; or (d) full quality system assurance. Class IIb Medium-high risk (eg X-ray devices) (a) full quality system assurance; or (b) type examination plus: (i) EC verification; or (ii) production quality assurance; or (iii) product quality assurance. Class III High risk (eg artificial heart valves) (a) full quality system assurance; or (b) type examination plus: (i) EC verification; or (ii) production quality assurance.</pre><p>Under either set of rules, for all except lowest-risk category products, a testing centre is an essential partner in the approvals process. Although a number of centres are designated under MedGV, the advent of the EU Directives means that Notified Bodies (NBs) are taking over the medical device testing market.</p><p>There are currently seven German NBs under the AIMD directive and ten under the MDD (see list on page *). However, companies can get products certified by a NB in any EU country and this will still (in theory) allow the product to be marketed in Germany.</p><p>The following guide to getting marketing approval in Germany is based on an interview with Hartmut Junker, head of the medical devices section of the Notified Body TUV Rheinland. The procedure at other NBs will be similar but not identical.</p><p>How to get marketing approval</p><p>1. Decide which approval procedure to follow</p><p>The company must determine the risk category of its product, which law to use (MedGV or MPG) and which approval procedure to follow. Not surprisingly, "90% of customers find this decision difficult," says Mr Junker. "They need information ... which we can give them but we must not decide on their behalf." TUV asks the company to complete a form describing itself, its European distributors, the product to be approved and the approval procedure required. It then estimates the time and cost to test the product or to run the quality system assurance procedure.</p><p>2. Test the product</p><p>Products for type-testing are normally submitted to an NB; for complex, high-tech products a single item should suffice while for mass-production items a random selection is necessary. The NB examines the product, evaluates clinical trials (repeating if necessary) and visits the company's production facility.</p><p>3. Award the certification</p><p>The NB certifies or fails the product. Under the MPG it can award a certificate and the manufacturer can affix the CE marking but under MedGV (group 1 and 2 products) it can only certify that the product conforms - the licence must be applied for at the Land Health Ministry. Tested devices are returned but may not be sold unless they are very expensive. In the latter case, the NB makes extensive photographic documentation.</p><p>The length of the approval process depends on the complexity of the product and the approval procedure chosen. However, a CE marking should be achievable within three months of the NB receiving the product, according to Mr Junker. TUV Rheinland also has an expedited service if a company needs to act quickly (for example to win an export contract).</p><p>4. Pay the NB</p><p>Prices vary. At a flat rate of DM 2,000 per day, TUV Rheinland says a new product approval should start at a few thousand marks. A full quality system test could cost up to DM 50,000 but can cover a range of products. The company must decide what is cost-effective, says Mr Junker.</p><p>Although radically altered, the new procedure for medical device approval in Germany is in many ways simplified. Under the EU Directives there is no longer any need to involve the Health Ministries of the Lander, which often slowed the process (although they do maintain a role in post-marketing surveillance/vigilance). Medical devices do not have to be approved in Germany at all, as long as approval has been granted in another EU country. The indirect costs may also be lower - MedGV required a high degree of supervision by public organisations while under the Directives much of the responsibility for product quality has been transferred to manufacturers.</p><p>Whatever the implications, approval is still only the first step in getting medical products onto the German market. With reimbursement and distribution to consider, companies with approved products are still a long way from success.</p>
