<p>How are UK companies and regulators responding to the EU's draft IVD-MD Directive? Amanda Maxwell attends meeting.</p><p>The UK Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has a reputation for being a leader in the correct implementation of EU devices legislation and in the support it gives industry. Regulators and industry are already co-operating and the MDA has drawn up a UK negotiating position on the IVD-MD draft. The recent British In Vitro Diagnostics Association meeting on the draft brought the various parties together to inform BIVDA members of the latest developments and to discuss the key issues surrounding the Directive.</p><p>Richard Gutowski, European group manager at the Medical Devices Agency, reminded delegates that the IVD-MD Directive must be seen in the context of the two earlier medical device Directives. Just as these have shaped the content of the latest draft, once adopted the new Directive could have implications for its predecessors. The desire to change inadequate wording in the IVD draft has to be weighed against the pressure to avoid making changes to the other two Directives.</p><p>Issues which seem likely to be raised and which have to be considered carefully in the light of the AIMD and MD Directives include:</p><p>* authorised representatives.</p><p>* in-house activities.</p><p>* manufacturer registration.</p><p>There is still considerable uncertainty over the word "manufacturer" it emerged at the meeting. According to the medical device Directives:</p><p>"manufacturer means the natural or legal person with responsibility for the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it is placed on the market under his own name, regardless of whether these operations are carried out by that person himself or on his behalf by a third party".</p><p>The manufacturer is therefore the person who is responsible for placing the product on the market under his own name, and who must meet all legal obligations, Mr Gutowski explained. It might not be the person who is responsible for the production line. If an entity imports a product and sells it on, that entity does not become the manufacturer unless it sticks its own label on the product, thereby taking responsibility for it. That entity would also become the manufacturer if it changed the product in some way.</p><p>This brought the discussion round to refurbishment of instrumentation. It emerged that if a CE-marked product is fully refurbished, in other words rebuilt so that it becomes a new product, then the refurbisher becomes the manufacturer but the Directive will only apply if the refurbished device is then placed on the market or, it seems, put into service. If a person repairs a product, he or she is not the manufacturer, nor is a person who refurbishes according to the original manufacturer's instructions. If, however, the person ignores the manufacturers' instructions in refurbishing, that person becomes liable.</p><p>Further confusion arises if a non-CE-marked product that was on the market prior to the full implementation of the Directive is refurbished once the Directive applies. There was considerable disagreement over the circumstances in which the product would need CE-marking. Guidance may be needed.</p><p>reminders</p><p>The BIVDA meeting gave speakers the opportunity to explain, with the benefit of experience of the other medical devices Directives, the implications of the draft text. They reminded the IVD industry of the following:</p><p>* Most Commission guidelines for the AIMD/MD Directive will apply to IVDs.</p><p>* Most MDA guidance documents also apply.</p><p>* Further guidance will be forthcoming, specifically for the IVD industry.</p><p>* The regulatory authorities do not have enough resources to police industry; companies must work together to ensure strict observance of the regulations and tackle problems through their trade associations.</p><p>* Industry must alert its Competent Authorities, the Commission, and its trade associations to any deviations in national laws or any restrictive practices.</p><p>* Notified Bodies are on a learning curve. Their opinions are not always correct.</p><p>* Companies are encouraged to become involved in standards-writing.</p><p>* European mandated standards are useful to indicate that a company has met the Essential Requirements of a directive, but not mandatory; not every product will be covered by such a standard - especially those incorporating new technologies. In-house standards are also important.</p><p>* Laboratory instruments may be covered by other EU Directives before the IVD Directive becomes effective. Check where your products stand against the:</p><p>- Low Voltage Directive;</p><p>- Machinery Directive; - Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive.</p><p>* IVD manufacturers should monitor their situation against the Dangerous Substances Directive.</p><p>* In cases where Member States request their own language(s) on labels and instructions for use, it may be possible to negotiate exemptions for professional-use devices.</p><p>* Vigilance applies to all products covered by the IVD-MD Directive.</p><p>The IVD-MD draft's journey to implementation</p><p>The draft Directive is currently being studied by the European Parliament's committee for the protection of the environment, public health and consumer affairs. It has already held one study group meeting of the text, with the next scheduled for July 24th. Following a section meeting to develop a draft opinion on September 19th, there should be a plenary session to finalise the ECOSOC's opinion on October 18th and 19th.</p><p>According to Gordon Tuck, vice-president of the European Diagnostic Manufacturers Association (EDMA), the European Council and Parliament may jointly adopt the Directive in mid- 1996. If so, the timetable cited in the draft (national implementation by July 1st, 1998 and transitional period to mid-2000), would be possible. Mr Gutowski was less optimistic. He believes that adoption could be held up by a couple of "key issues", such as the incorporation of the clauses on human and animal tissues for amendment of the Medical Devices Directive.</p><p>Clinica has published two articles focusing on the content of the draft IVD-MD Directive - see Nos 654, p 5 and 660, p 6.</p>
