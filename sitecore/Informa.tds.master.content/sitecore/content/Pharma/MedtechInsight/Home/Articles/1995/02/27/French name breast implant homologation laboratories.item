<p>Two French testing laboratories have been authorised by the French government to conduct premarket approval testing on breast implants. In addition to G-Med, which is responsible for the homologation of all medical devices until European legislation becomes mandatory, the Regional Centre for Innovation and Technology Transfer (CRITT) has been named. The decree appointing the two laboratories appeared in the Journal officiel of February 9th.</p><p>The government ruled that breast implants should be subject to premarket approval last October (see Clinica No 630, p 4). Companies which meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive will not have to obtain premarket approval to sell their products in France. It is questionable, however, whether they would be reimbursed by the Social Security if they do not.</p><p>CRITT is based in the north east of France, near the borders with Belgium and Luxembourg. G-Med is France's only Notified Body under the European medical device directives.</p>
