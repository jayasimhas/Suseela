<p>A pilot programme for third party review of selected 510(k) notifications is expected by the US FDA to get under way early in fiscal 1996. Part of the agency's policy reform package announced in April (see Clinica No 649, p 6), the pilot project will be restricted to third party review - but not clearance - of low-risk medical devices.</p>

<p>A pilot programme for third party review of selected 510(k) notifications is expected by the US FDA to get under way early in fiscal 1996. Part of the agency's policy reform package announced in April (see Clinica No 649, p 6), the pilot project will be restricted to third party review - but not clearance - of low-risk medical devices.</p><p>A June 19th workshop to discuss the two-year programme hopes to identify eligible products for inclusion in the project. Other issues to be resolved include the criteria for selecting private review organisations; safeguards to ensure impartial reviews; and funding. During the second year of the pilot, the FDA will evaluate its performance.</p><p>The FDA envisages that the pilot programme will be limited to Class I and II devices which involve low-to-moderate risk and will exclude 510(k)s which require clinical data for a clearance decision. The agency has drawn up a preliminary list of over 40 devices for consideration at the workshop.</p><p>Third party organisations, designated by the agency, will make recommendations on selected devices to the FDA which will give a final decision. Industry participation will be voluntary and the FDA review route will continue to be available as an alternative. In order to safeguard against impartiality, the agency is considering FDA examination, acceptance and oversight of third party review organisations. It may also provide training and standard operating procedures for third parties as well as FDA advisors on site. Database checks to track ongoing review are also under consideration. Fees for third party review would be negotiated with applicants and paid directly to the organisation, without FDA involvement.</p><p>The workshop, chaired by Joseph Levitt, deputy director for regulations and policy at the CDRH, will be held at the Doubletree Hotel Rockville, MD. Registration details are available from Sociometrics, 8300 Colesville Rd, Suite 550, Silver Spring, MD 20910. Tel: +1 (301) 608 2151. Fax: +1 (301) 608 3542.</p>
