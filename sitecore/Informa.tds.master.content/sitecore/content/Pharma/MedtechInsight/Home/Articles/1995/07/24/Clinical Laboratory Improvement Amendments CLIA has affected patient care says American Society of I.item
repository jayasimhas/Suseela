<p>Requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) that have restricted physician labs have indeed affected patients, the American Society of Internal Medicine (ASIM) protests. This is contrary to assertions of a recent Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) study (see Clinica No 657, p 5).</p>

<p>Requirements of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) that have restricted physician labs have indeed affected patients, the American Society of Internal Medicine (ASIM) protests. This is contrary to assertions of a recent Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) study (see Clinica No 657, p 5).</p><p>The OIG study did not consider quality issues that are of primary importance to patients, such as convenience and speed, the ASIM says. "Had the OIG looked at these issues, it likely would have reached a very different conclusion," ASIM executive president Alan Nelson contends. The society believes that many physicians have discontinued all tests except those exempt from CLIA regulation in order to avoid the costs associated with CLIA compliance.</p><p>The law's "regulatory overkill", ASIM asserts, has hurt patients. The association calls for passage of legislation to exempt physician labs from CLIA, "so that physicians can once again provide their patients with the convenience, speed and quality of tests done in their own offices".</p>
