<p>Malaysia's medical products market has trebled in value over the last five years to reach around $125 million. This growth is the result of a substantial rise in spending on healthcare development under the Sixth Five-Year Plan (to 1995) and the rapid expansion of the private sector, says a recent MDIS profile of Malaysia.</p><p>Particular emphasis has been placed on hospital construction under the Sixth Plan. A total of RM 1,352 million ($530 million) has been allocated to new construction projects and the purchase of equipment, while RM 594 million has been set aside for the upgrading and renovation of existing facilities. The Plan provides for the completion of 32 new district hospitals by the end of 1995, increasing public sector capacity by an extra 1,000 beds.</p><p>Although private healthcare facilities in the more lucrative urban areas are approaching saturation point, further rapid expansion of this sector is expected over the next five years, with the number of private beds rising to more than 8,000, MDIS says.</p><pre>Malaysia - Medical Product Imports 1992 ($ million) ECGs 2.3 Other electrodiagnostic apparatus 14.4 X-ray apparatus* 9.8 X-ray tubes, parts & accessories 5.0 Syringes, needles & catheters 11.4 Ophthalmic instruments 6.0 Other medical instruments 15.2 Mechanotherapy apparatus 1.9 Respiratory apparatus 2.7 Orthopaedic implants/appliances 1.6 Pacemakers 0.2 Bandages & dressings 7.0 * includes non-medical Source: MDIS</pre><pre>Malaysia - Medical Product Imports by Country of Origin 1992 Country % of total US 20.0 Japan 18.4 Germany 14.1 UK 13.8 Other EU 11.3 Singapore 11.2 Other 11.2 Source: MDIS</pre><p>Given the level of development under way in both the public and private sectors, the prospects for Malaysia's medical market are attractive. Demand for both capital equipment and consumables is likely to show further significant growth, with imports forecast to increase at least 10-20% in the medium term.</p><p>This 31-page profile is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications.
