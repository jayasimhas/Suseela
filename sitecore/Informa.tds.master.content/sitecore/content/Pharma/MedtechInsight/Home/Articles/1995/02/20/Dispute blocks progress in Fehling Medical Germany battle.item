<p>Internal wrangling has blocked progress in the dispute at Fehling Medical (Germany). An extraordinary general meeting was called this month to discuss a report by accountants Arthur Andersen which apparently says assets supplied by founder Guido Fehling are worth just DM 5 million ($3 million), compared with an earlier valuation by KPMG of DM 15 million. However, the report was not produced at the meeting as Andersen and Fehling are in dispute about payment. Mr Fehling rejects the lower valuation.</p>

<p>Internal wrangling has blocked progress in the dispute at Fehling Medical (Germany). An extraordinary general meeting was called this month to discuss a report by accountants Arthur Andersen which apparently says assets supplied by founder Guido Fehling are worth just DM 5 million ($3 million), compared with an earlier valuation by KPMG of DM 15 million. However, the report was not produced at the meeting as Andersen and Fehling are in dispute about payment. Mr Fehling rejects the lower valuation.</p><p>Shareholders also decided to reappoint the supervisory board via the courts rather than by election. This was because Mr Fehling, in whom they have passed a vote of no confidence, could have heavily influenced the result with his 45% share of the vote. The board resigned last month following revelations that the company had lost a third of its cash reserves through the sale of its medical instruments business (see Clinica No 637, p 13).</p>
