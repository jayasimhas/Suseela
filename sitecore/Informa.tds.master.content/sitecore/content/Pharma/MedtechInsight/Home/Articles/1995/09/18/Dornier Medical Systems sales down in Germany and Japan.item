<p>Lower sales in Germany and Japan were partly offset by growth in previously marginal markets, such as South East Asia, Dornier Medical Systems reported for 1994. The German company had revenues of DM 199 million ($134 million), down 2% on the previous year. The proportion of sales outside Germany increased to 88% from 86% a year earlier.</p><p>During the year, Dornier strengthened its ultrasound equipment co-operation with Kontron which is intended to improve European market coverage. The company plans to present its new colour Doppler imaging system at Medica in November.</p><p>Dornier received US clearance for Compact, a transportable lithotripter for lower patient volumes. It also began development of a cheaper lithotripter for the Far East market, mainly aimed at China. Dornier's urological workstation MFL 5000 saw "substantially improved" sales during 1994.</p><p>Dornier is a small subsidiary of Dasa (Daimler-Benz Aerospace) which reported DM 17,394 million turnover, down 7% on the previous year. Dasa's loss was 37% lower at DM 438 million.</p>
