<p>Restrictions on healthcare expenditure implemented by the Dutch government as part of a major health reform programme are beginning to bite, limiting medical market growth. The dynamic expansion of medical product imports since the late 1980s is a reflection of the increase in assembly and re-export by multinationals, rather than an indication of growth in the domestic healthcare market, says a recent MDIS profile of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Restrictions on healthcare expenditure implemented by the Dutch government as part of a major health reform programme are beginning to bite, limiting medical market growth. The dynamic expansion of medical product imports since the late 1980s is a reflection of the increase in assembly and re-export by multinationals, rather than an indication of growth in the domestic healthcare market, says a recent MDIS profile of the Netherlands.</p><p>The emphasis of the country's health reform programme is to increase efficiency by promoting competition between sick funds and forcing them to negotiate fees with hospitals and general practitioners (see Clinica's October 1994 Feature Supplement, pp 13-14). The current system of compulsory national health insurance for those on low salaries and civil servants, and private insurance for the remainder of the population, will be replaced by a basic insurance scheme covering around 85% of all healthcare costs. The effect of the new scheme will be to remove the distinction between national health, statutory and private health insurance providers. Direct government cost-containment policies will continue until market forces are seen to be regulating the healthcare system effectively, MDIS says.</p><p>Despite the climate of cost-cutting, Dutch hospitals have been making substantial capital investments in new technology such as CT, MRI and PET scanners. Further investment in these areas is considered likely by MDIS. The most important end-users of equipment are the university hospitals in Amsterdam, Groningen, Leiden, Maastricht, Rotterdam, Utrecht and Nijmegen, as well as other acute hospitals. The Rijksinkoopbureau, a government agency, makes major purchases of equipment on behalf of the university and other hospitals.</p><p>The Dutch government exercises a degree of control over the use of expensive medical technology via article 18 of the Health Insurance Act. The article empowers the government to limit the number of facilities permitted to use certain technologies. For instance, in 1993 CABG and PTCA were only performed in 13 centres, antenatal screening and genetic counselling in seven centres and radiation therapy in 21 centres.</p><p>market structure</p><p>Imports account for 60-70% of the Dutch medical products market, with the US providing 25.6% of the market in 1993. Germany also maintains a strong presence, contributing 25.5% of the market. The strength of Dutch electromedical and X-ray equipment exports is principally due to Philips Medical Systems.</p><pre>Dutch Medical Equipment Imports ($ millions) 1992 1993 Electromedical equipment 149.2 139.7 X-ray equipment 289.3 319.7 Dental instruments 28.9 26.3 Syringes, needles, catheters 123.6 156.9 Ophthalmic instruments 24.7 23.1 Other medical instruments 344.6 307.2 Mechano-therapy apparatus 13.9 18.2 Orthopaedic implants/appliances 39.3 36.8 Pacemakers 81.5 45.1 Bandages & dressings 52.2 59.1 Source: MDIS</pre><p>This 36-page country profile is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications.
