<p>Switzerland's medical device laws are to fall into line with those in the rest of the European Economic Area (the European Union, Norway and Iceland) on October 1st. That is the target date for an ordinance to take effect which transposes the EU's Active Implantable and Medical Devices Directives. A draft has been circulated to all interested parties for comment.</p>

<p>Switzerland's medical device laws are to fall into line with those in the rest of the European Economic Area (the European Union, Norway and Iceland) on October 1st. That is the target date for an ordinance to take effect which transposes the EU's Active Implantable and Medical Devices Directives. A draft has been circulated to all interested parties for comment.</p><p>Switzerland is acting independently of the EEA. It is not compelled to introduce the Directives' requirements, since it is not a member. If it does not, however, it could become a dumping ground for products not accepted in other European countries and its industry, which relies heavily on exports, could suffer if it does not meet the same requirements as EU manufacturers. The country is therefore seeking mutual recognition of its system with that of the EU.</p><p>deadlines</p><p>Once introduced in Switzerland, the ordinance will be mandatory for active implantable medical devices, as in the Union, while manufacturers of products covered by the Medical Devices Directive may choose to comply with former Swiss laws until June 13th, 1998. This does not put the Swiss AIMD industry under pressure - the Swiss office of the International Association of Medical Prosthesis Manufacturers has informed the Health Ministry that its half a dozen active implantable manufacturer members already comply with the Directive. Switzerland also intends to transpose the EU's IVD-MD Directive, once it has been adopted.</p><p>Swiss approach</p><p>In areas where there are national differences between the regulations, the approach adopted by the Swiss ordinance is as follows:</p><p>Vigilance</p><p>The Federal Office of Public Healthcare, Switzerland's Competent Authority for medical devices, will have overall responsibility for vigilance (post-marketing surveillance). The cantons will have a role to play in monitoring the performance of new products and informing the Federal Office of local incidents, but can only take action independently in extreme cases.</p><p>Labelling and language</p><p>Switzerland is using its prerogative to demand that its three national languages - French, German and Italian - appear on labels and instructions for use. Exceptions will be permitted when resulting costs are excessive, or for technical reasons, as long as patient and user safety is guaranteed.</p><p>Fees</p><p>The Federal Office anticipates charging for registration, applications for clinical investigations and for following up adverse incidents. It will draw up a fee structure in the near future.</p><p>Standards</p><p>The titles of European standards which help medical device manufacturers fulfil the Directives' essential requirements will be published in the Swiss Federal Gazette, along with a note indicating where to obtain copies.</p><p>Notified Bodies</p><p>Since Notified Bodies are an EU concept (and permissible in EEA countries through agreement), Switzerland is not entitled to appoint them. It has several accredited organisations which are interested in auditing medical devices according to the new Swiss device requirements, most of which are currently subcontractors to EU Notified Bodies. It does not, however, have sufficient accrediting organisations for assessing its industry against the requirements of the Directives.</p><p>Negotiations are currently taking place at the European Commission concerning mutual recognition possibilities, which are likely to result in certification by Swiss auditing organisations being accepted in the rest of the EEA. Switzerland is keeping open the option to pursue additional mutual recognition discussions with Canada and the US.</p><p>Although there seem to be no technical problems, the outcome of these talks is linked to broader political discussions between the different trading groups.</p><p>CE marking</p><p>No mention is made in the Swiss text of the use of the CE marking since this too is an EU concept to denote certification by EEA Notified Bodies. Instead, companies audited by a Swiss organisation must display the ID number of that body in a box following the initials "MD". (For Class I products where there is no third-party involvement, the identification number will be MD-99999 which corresponds to a CE marking without the Notified Body number.)</p><p>Depending on the outcome of talks with the European Commission, the Federal Office is likely to recognise testing by EEA Notified Bodies and plans to publish a list of accepted symbols in its Bulletin. Switzerland will ensure that its numbering system for accredited testing organisations is compatible with the EU's.</p>
