<p>Where is the medtech industry heading? Brigitte Ascher talked to Wall Street analysts to find out what the financial community thinks.</p><p>American medical device shares are likely to continue their rise in the medium term but investors should be careful. Some analysts monitoring the sector caution that the strong nine-month run of shares and the current upbeat feeling is masking longer-term problems and a trend to continued consolidation.</p><p>The last nine months have seen an extraordinary recovery in medtech share prices which have risen from a severely undervalued 20% premium compared with the Standard & Poor 500 index to a 45% premium on projected price/earnings ratios. This compares with a 50-60% premium on the S&P which has not been uncommon in the past. "We are somewhere at mid-cycle, the growth from here to the top will be at a slower pace," said Sam Navarro of UBS Securities.</p><p>Since medtech share prices bottomed in mid-1994, they had what Bear Stearns' Anne Malone calls an "incredible run". The trend is illustrated in Lehman Brothers' medical technology index (see graph). The total market capitalisation of the 58 companies included has grown to more than $41,000 million by the end of April 1995 from $26,000 million in May 1994.</p><p>So far this year, average prices of Lehman Brothers' listed shares have risen 20% in the first four months, while the S&P 500 rose 12%. But the development in the last nine months may once again be a case of the stockmarket anticipating events and then disappointing investors once reality catches up.</p><p>By early 1992, share prices had begun discounting for the anticipated risk of the Clinton healthcare reform. A year later the medtech industry itself took this into account and growth was arrested by a combination of fewer procedures, cost containment, pricing pressures, inventory adjustments and declining production. Some industry segments contracted. Since mid-1994 the looming demise of the Clinton reforms has been discounted by the market and by the end of last year, sales and profits began to grow again, looking quite strong in comparison with the depressed results a year earlier.</p><p>Evidence of regained industry growth is provided by US companies' first-quarter results which have shown very clear improvement supported by several factors - the weak US dollar is helping exports and domestic demand has stabilised. First-quarter sales growth will have averaged in the region of 7-10% with net profits in many cases doubling compared with the previous year or outperforming stated targets as in Baxter's case which showed an 11% increase in net income.</p><p>Another shift which contributed to the share price increases of the past months is the perceived regulatory improvement. Faced with criticism from many quarters, the FDA has embarked on a policy of self-reform, pre-empting moves from politicians to speed up its processes, if not to reorganise considerably, following the Republicans' dominance of Congress. Among analysts the supposition is that faster product approvals (see box) will lead to stronger industry growth.</p><p>However, many analysts Clinica spoke to in New York were cautious - even pessimistic - about longer-term prospects. "Pricing pressure is the one critical issue that will last until the end of the decade. It was felt last year, has eased off somewhat but is expected to return," Morgan Stanley's Glenn Reicin said. The reason for caution is spelled out: "Managed care is in front of us not behind us."</p><p>UBS' Mr Navarro echoes this sentiment: "Trends towards cost containment should continue, with the market making the adjustment, not politics. However, companies are now willing to raise prices a little as the market is less resistant to price changes than it was six or nine months ago." In the longer term he believes another round of cost containment is inevitable.</p><p>Analysts favour such companies as <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong>, <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>, St Jude, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson and Guidant. The sector they find most appealing is cardiology. "As long as outcomes and cost savings are superior there is a lot of room for innovation". His opposite number at UBS, Mr Navarro, is looking closely at implantable defibrillators, pacemakers, angioplasty, heart valves as well as MIS, urology, even orthopaedics - spinal fusion and less-invasive procedures rather than hips and knees.</p><p>Sally Yanchus of Lehman Brothers said orthopaedics is on the way to becoming a "commodity market with the primary difference being the price". This is exacerbated by a concomitant decline in demand. Another sector viewed pessimistically is diagnostics. "It has fallen on rough times," said Mr Reicin, who expects much horizontal and vertical integration in future. In 1995, companies with sales between $200 million and $500 million will have to make hard decisions: "Get bigger or get out," he said unequivocally.</p><p>FDA:</p><p>UBS' analysts note the "emergence of a more benevolent FDA" and point to a surge in approvals and rapid clearances: Ventritex' use of its Cadence ICD with Guidant/CPI's Endotak lead system last year; Medtronic's Atakr catheter ablation system, Thera pacemaker family and Jewel ICD family EP Technologies' catheter ablation system; Thermo Cardiosystems' HeartMate left ventricular assist device; Summit Technology's excimer laser for phototherapeutic keratectomy; and the proposed exemption from 510(k) requirements for some 140 low-risk devices.</p><p>Both Medtronic and Guidant received approval for their implantable defibrillators without a panel meeting. Most recently, Cordis was removed from the FDA's Reference List and</p><p>Guidant's PRxIII implantable cardioverter defibrillator was approved only seven months after submission. This leaves the third competitor in the implantable defibrillator field, Ventritex, out in the cold although Cadet - to be submitted in June - may be approved sooner than the generally-expected first quarter of 1996.</p>
