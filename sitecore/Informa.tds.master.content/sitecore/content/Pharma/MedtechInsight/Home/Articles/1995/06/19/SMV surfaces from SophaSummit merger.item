<p>Nuclear medicine companies Summit Nuclear (US) and Sopha Medical (France) have merged to form SMV. The merger follows the decision late last year by Sopha's majority shareholder, the Atomic Energy Commission of France (CEA-Industrie), to lower its stake in the loss-making French company. This brought in a new investor in the shape of Summit World Trade, the parent company of Summit Nuclear (see Clinica No 635, p 1). SMV is 40%-owned by Summit World Trade, 34% by CEA-Industrie and 26% by a group of French investment banks.</p>

<p>Nuclear medicine companies Summit Nuclear (US) and Sopha Medical (France) have merged to form SMV. The merger follows the decision late last year by Sopha's majority shareholder, the Atomic Energy Commission of France (CEA-Industrie), to lower its stake in the loss-making French company. This brought in a new investor in the shape of Summit World Trade, the parent company of Summit Nuclear (see Clinica No 635, p 1). SMV is 40%-owned by Summit World Trade, 34% by CEA-Industrie and 26% by a group of French investment banks.</p><p>The new company has two units. SMV America, with headquarters in Twinsburg, Ohio, is responsible for operations in North and South America, while SMV International in Buc, France, is responsible for Europe and the rest of the world. Andre Debionne, formerly general manager of venture capital company Innolion, has been named chairman and CEO of the holding company. Colin McNaught, previously Sopha's CEO, will be chairman and CEO of SMV America while Summit Nuclear's president, Randy Sommerdyke, will be president of SMV America. Jean Plazenet who used to be general manager of Rockwell International and Amada, has been named chairman and CEO of SMV International.</p><p>"Summit gains worldwide distribution while Sopha gains US-based manufacturing. The product lines complement one another exquisitely and together offer SMV customers the most diverse product line in nuclear medicine," Mr Debionne says. He adds that SMV will be the largest dedicated nuclear medicine company in the world with more than 3,500 cameras and computers installed in over 50 countries. Its market share is nearly 20% in the major world markets and revenues are approaching $100 million.</p><p>Manufacturing and R&D will continue at both the US and the French locations. The company says that clinical software development continues for both the XT (Sopha) and Vision (Summit) computer platforms with new releases for both scheduled for late summer.</p>
