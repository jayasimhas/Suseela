<p>Disetronic, the Swiss manufacturer of portable drug delivery systems, saw sales of its largest business unit, infusion systems, grow 45% in fiscal 1995. The increase was based on the success of the H-Tron infusion pump for diabetics, a market in which the company claims to be the leading supplier.</p><p>Disetronic's other core medical systems business, injection systems, was less successful last year, with sales stagnating at 1993 levels. Disetronic blames this on product transitions at two important OEM pharmaceutical customers. Total medical systems turnover increased 29% to SwFr 62.2 million ($51 million).</p><p>In fiscal 1996 Disetronic expects an increase of more than 10% for both sales and income. In order to take advantage of "the strongly growing market for portable systems", the company intends to float by the end of next year.</p><p>The H-Tron infusion pump offers 24 individually programmable base rates, continuous delivery of insulin. It contains two microprocessors and an alarm system. At the EASD congress in Stockholm (September 12-16th), Disetronic introduced a new- generation system, the H-Tron Plus, with added features such as temporary changes of the base rate; memory for information on boluses and warnings; and a warning function that tells the patient when to empty the cartridge.</p><p>A third medical business unit is sensor systems. Disetronic says this unit has fundamentally redesigned a portable, continuous blood pressure monitor which has been manufactured for Roche but is also sold under Disetronic's name.</p><p>Sensor systems is involved in two glucose metering development projects. A disposable osmium-based sensor has reached an advanced stage of development and an implanted meter has completed early clinical trials. Disetronic aims to enclose an electrochemical biosensor into a fine needle or a catheter to be implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal area for continuous glucose metering.</p><pre>Disetronic's fiscal 1995 results (SwFr millions) 1995 % change Infusion systems 41.9 45% Injection systems 19.2 _0.2% Sensor systems 1.1 _8% Medical systems total 62.2 29% Precision metal turning 10.5 - Total sales 72.7 48% Net income 8.8 73% (ended Mar 31st)</pre>
