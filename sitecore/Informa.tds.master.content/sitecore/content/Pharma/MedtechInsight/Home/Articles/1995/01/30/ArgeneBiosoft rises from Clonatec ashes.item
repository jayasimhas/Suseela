<p>Argene (France) has joined forces with a former division of Clonatec to form Argene Biosoft. In a brief but tangled history, Clonatec Diagnostic's Biosoft was acquired in August 1994 by holding company Ab-Services. The same company founded a biotechnology subsidiary, Argene, in November 1993. Ab-Services is headed by Mrs Pascale Rouchon, former financial director of Clonatec.</p><p>Argene-Biosoft which now has a staff of 13, including Biosoft employees and nine external researchers, hopes to double its turnover within two years, says Jean Larroque, the company's president. Sales from September to December 1994 totalled Fr 0.8 million ($150,000) and are forecast to reach Fr 2.8 million in 1995 and Fr 3.6 million in 1996.</p><p>Argene-Biosoft plans to invest more than Fr 3 million in building a new laboratory at its Delta-Sud site in Varilhes, France. Clonatec product lines which are not part of the new company's strategy will be sold to other companies, says Mr Larroque. Argene-Biosoft will concentrate on diagnostic kits for viral antigen detection, monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotides. The company already has distributors in the US, Finland and the Netherlands with representatives in most of Europe, Japan and Asia.</p>
