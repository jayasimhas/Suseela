<p>Healthcare costs in Switzerland increased from SwFr 12,400 million in 1980 to SwFr 24,500 million in 1990 and are expected to rise 5.9% per annum by the year 2005, according to a study entitled The Swiss Healthcare System in the Year 2005. The report recommends cutting costs through: a reduction in hospital beds; a shift from inpatient to outpatient treatment; a limit on the number of doctors permitted to practise; the development of new types of health insurance; and a higher level of direct patient contributions. Many medical procedures may only be available through supplementary insurance by the year 2005 and only 60% of the population is likely to be comprehensively insured.</p>
