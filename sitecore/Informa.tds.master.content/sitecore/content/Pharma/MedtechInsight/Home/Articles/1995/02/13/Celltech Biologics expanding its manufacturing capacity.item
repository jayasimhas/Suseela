<p>Celltech Biologics, the revenue-earning arm of UK pharmaceutical development company, Celltech Group, is expanding its manufacturing capacity both in the UK and the US. In mid-1995 additional capacity in Slough, UK, will become available, and in the first half of 1996 a new facility in New Hampshire, US, will come on stream. Celltech Biologics hopes to gain business from other companies' contracting out their biopharmaceutical manufacturing.</p><p>Celltech Biologics already supplies monoclonal antibodies for use as blood grouping reagents to Ortho Diagnostics Systems. It also produces Cytogen's OncoScint OV/OR, an in vivo diagnostic agent for colorectal and ovarian cancer. Celltech writes in its annual report that its "range of proprietary assays is anticipated to become a significant source of future licensing revenues".</p><p>In fiscal 1994 (ended September), Celltech Biologics reported turnover of &pound;14.2 million ($22 million), unchanged from the previous year. The after-tax loss was &pound;6.9 million, up from &pound;5.9 million in 1993. Within Celltech Therapeutics, the group's R&D arm was established as an operating subsidiary in October 1994. The group floated in London in December 1993 raising some &pound;27 million in new funds.</p>
