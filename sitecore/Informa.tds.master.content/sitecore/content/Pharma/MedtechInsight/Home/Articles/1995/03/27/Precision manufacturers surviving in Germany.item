<p>German manufacturers of precision and optical medical equipment have come through the recession virtually unscathed, according to their manufacturing association, the VFO. Manfred Schinkmann, head of the VFO's medical division, says hospital purchases have not declined, as was feared, although non-hospital doctors have reduced their spending.</p><p>Sales by member companies of the VFO's medical sector rose 3.2% to DM 6,905 million ($4,950 million) in 1994. Domestic concerns accounted for the bulk of this at DM 5,124 million, up 3.6% on 1993, while foreign subsidiaries contributed DM 1,782 million, a rise of 2.1%.</p><p>exports and imports</p><p>Exports by German companies increased 2.5% to DM 2,208 million in the first six months of 1994. However, imports rose even faster, by 8.5% to DM 1,595 million, which shows how lucrative the German market is for foreign companies, says Dr Schinkmann. Western Europe remains the most important import/export market but imports from Asia and the US are rising rapidly. Imports from Japan rose 15% to DM 188 million during the year, while US imports were up 16% at DM 433 million.</p><pre>German imports/exports of precision & optical medical products 1994 first six months % change % change Surplus/ (DM millions) Imports vs 1993 Exports vs 1993 (deficit) West Europe 484 + 3 803 + 4 319 East Europe - - 218 +29 218 US 433 +16 322 - (111) Asia (incl Japan)265 +11 225 + 2 (40) Other 413 640 227 Total 1,595 + 8.5 2,208 + 2.5 613</pre><p>The VFO represents all sectors of the precision and optical manufacturing industry. The medical division is the largest sector, with 36% of the association's turnover, and its members represent some 50-60% of the industry in Germany.</p>
