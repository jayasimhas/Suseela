<p>E Merck, the German pharmaceuticals and laboratory products manufacturer, is to float on the international stock market in the biggest-ever share issue by a private German concern. The company will offer 25% of its stock at DM 60-80 ($43-57) in September and hopes to raise up to DM 2,600 million.</p><p>A large part of the cash raised will be used to expand Merck's international laboratory products business. The company has been taking an interest in the sector recently - it purchased 15% of US-based VWR last month (see Clinica No 644, p 13) and 100% of Poly Labo International (France) in December (see Clinica No 634, p 16). E Merck has also expanded in the prosthetics market with the purchase of ProthAid (France) this year (see Clinica 643, p 11). However, the high cost of bank loans is forcing Merck, and other German family-owned companies, to find cheaper means of raising the funds for such expansion.</p><p>more transparency</p><p>The move also means that Merck will have to introduce more transparency into its accounts. The UK Financial Times quotes non-transparency as one reason why the company's Swiss subsidiary (see box) has performed poorly on the Zurich stock exchange. The Merck Group increased its turnover by 16.5% in 1994 to reach DM 5,780 million, while profits were up 40% at DM 560 million. No breakdown of the figures has yet been given, but laboratory products accounted for 26% of turnover in 1993.</p><p>E Merck, the holding company for the Merck Group, controls all German interests and is owned by the descendants of Jacob Merck who founded the company in 1668. Non-German interests are controlled by a 53% stake in Merck AG of Zug, Switzerland, which is stock market-listed. Other than pharmaceuticals and laboratory products, the group also manufactures contrast agents (it owns 50% of Italian company <strong>[C#198900374:Bracco]</strong>); in vitro diagnostics; prostheses; and biomaterials.</p>
