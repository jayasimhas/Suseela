<p>A system for evaluating major advances in surgery is under discussion between the UK Department of Health and the Royal Colleges. A spokesman for the Royal Colleges told Clinica the intention is to set up a mechanism to identify innovative techniques and monitor their introduction in practice. Minimally invasive surgery is a priority area for consideration.</p><p>Under the proposed system, major advances would be evaluated by a group of experts, under the auspices of the Royal Colleges, before being made available for use in the health service. A central register, providing information on approved procedures, would be available for consultation by purchasing health authorities.</p><p>The proposed evaluation programme was recommended by the government Advisory Council on Science and Technology in its report on medical research and health published in February 1993 (see Clinica No 540, pp 8-9). Produced by a committee chaired by Dr Peter Doyle, director of R&D at ICI's former pharmaceutical division, the report advocated the adoption of formal assessment procedures of all new surgical devices or applications. ACOST recommended the establishment of a central committee on the safety and efficacy of procedures for registering and evaluating new surgical techniques.</p><p>This recommendation was taken up by NHS director of R&D Prof Michael Peckham and a discussion document was produced by the Standing Group on Health Technology chaired by Sir Miles Irving, professor of surgery at the University of Manchester. Under discussion is the mechanism for introducing a system for evaluating new surgical procedures and interventions (such as radiology), Sir Miles told Clinica.</p><p>part of wider developments</p><p>The evaluation system under discussion is one of a number of related developments which have taken place over the last two years in the UK. Last year, Sir Miles' group (which was set up in February 1993) identified 26 assessment priorities (see Clinica No 625, p 7). The group will review priorities each year.</p><p>Following publication in September 1994 of the Culyer report on supporting R&D in the NHS, a series of initiatives has been taken. These include the decision to set up a National Forum, chaired by Prof Peckham, to facilitate closer working links between the NHS and industry and academia (see Clinica No 635, p 3).</p><p>As part of the UK effort to provide training for surgeons using minimally invasive techniques, three keyhole surgery training centres are being set up in the UK with &pound;4 million ($6 million) funding over two years from the government and the Wolfson Foundation (see Clinica No 642, p 4).</p>
