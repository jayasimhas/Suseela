<p>In the first half of this year, US cardiology company E for M turned in an operational profit of $2.3 million after two years in the red. E for M's business is straddling two continents since it bought 100-year-old Hellige (Germany) in autumn 1994. E for M has consolidated the businesses and improved cost control.</p><p>Some of the aims behind this latest acquisition, however, are yet to be realised. The integration of US and European products has been put on hold for the time being. Eventually, E for M wants to expand its marketing outside the Americas using the Hellige sales organisation and, at the same time, to extend the marketing of its European-designed products through existing channels in the US, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and the Far East.</p><p>The company's name, E for M, was adopted in July 1994. It came with the purchase of Hellige and the biomedical systems division from PPG Industries and is a well-established name in the US cardiology market, which originally stood for "Electronics for Medicine".</p><p>Behind its string of acquisitions during the 1990s has been E for M's aim to become a comprehensive worldwide supplier of cardiac catheterisation and electrophysiology products as well as a leading player in the European patient monitoring and cardiology products markets.</p><p>Nine months after completing the Hellige acquisition, E for M gained a discount on the purchase price. PPG Industries agreed to cut the price for the total purchase by $5.7 million from the previously reported $55 million (see Clinica No 625, p 14).</p><p>After consolidating the business, E for M has ended up with three divisions. The cardiology products division (CPD) with headquarters in Kansas, US, produces haemodynamic/physiology monitoring instruments for the cath lab market.</p><p>The imaging systems division (ISD) manufactures all imaging products, some of which are sold through CPD and Hellige. It also produces imaging systems for digitising and storing images produced from a variety of sources such as X-ray and ultrasound. These systems are sold to OEM customers such as GE, Siemens or Toshiba.</p><p>The third division, Hellige, manufactures non-invasive diagnostic ECG recording devices, stress test equipment, cardiac defibrillation products and patient monitoring systems.</p><pre>E for M's results ($ millions) Full year 1st half 1994 1993 1995 1994 Medical revenues 141.8 41.8 - - Optical displays 4.7 5.4 - - Total sales 146.4 47.2 96.6 52.8 Net income (loss) (1.6) (1.8) 1.6 (1.6) (Year ended Dec 31st; 1st half ended June 30th)</pre>
