<p>Molecular biology in fracture repair is now coming of age, according to orthopaedic surgeons at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting in Orlando this month. Around two million fractures occur in the US every year and 500,000 of these experience problems with repair, according to Dr Thomas Einhorn, director of orthopaedic research at Mount Sinai Medical Centre, New York, and the new president of the US Orthopaedic Research Society. In these cases, repair may be inhibited by age or disease and when there is substantial bone loss, current methods such as autografts, allografts and electrical stimulation vary in efficacy and side-effects.</p>

<p>Molecular biology in fracture repair is now coming of age, according to orthopaedic surgeons at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting in Orlando this month. Around two million fractures occur in the US every year and 500,000 of these experience problems with repair, according to Dr Thomas Einhorn, director of orthopaedic research at Mount Sinai Medical Centre, New York, and the new president of the US Orthopaedic Research Society. In these cases, repair may be inhibited by age or disease and when there is substantial bone loss, current methods such as autografts, allografts and electrical stimulation vary in efficacy and side-effects.</p><p>More recently, a number of hydroxyapatite- or collagen-based porous bone graft substitutes, such as Zimmer's Collagraft and Interpore Orthopaedics' ProOsteon, have been developed, but none has been found actually to stimulate bone growth which is important when there is large bone loss, added Dr Einhorn. These osteoconductive products provide a scaffold for bone ingrowth and do not contain active agents.</p><p>recombinant technology</p><p>Current research in non-union fracture repair and bone reconstruction is focusing on recombinant DNA technology to generate osteoinductive agents which can actually induce bone growth, says Dr Einhorn. These genetically-engineered bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which can be manufactured in large quantities, are under development at two US companies, Creative BioMolecules and Genetics Institute. They seem to work by inducing undifferentiated cells at the fracture site to form into osteoblasts.</p><p>A study presented at the AAOS by researchers from <strong>[C#199000545:Tulane University]</strong> School of Medicine, New Orleans, compared Creative BioMolecules' BMP-7 (OP-1) with the osteoconductive agents Collagraft and ProOsteon in animal models and found that BMP-7 healed large bone defects to almost the same mechanical properties of intact limbs. In addition, the induced bone appeared to have a normal internal architecture under radiographic and histologic analysis.</p><p>Creative BioMolecules, in collaboration with Stryker (US), has entered clinical trials with BMP-7 delivered via bovine type-1 collagen and saline for treating non-union fractures (see Clinica No 586, p 21). Phase III multi-centre prospective studies have begun for use in tibial non-union fractures, said Dr Einhorn. Stryker is also initiating clinical trials in the US and Europe for additional orthopaedic applications.</p><p>Genetics Institute announced at the AAOS last week that it has entered a strategic alliance in North America with Sofamor Danek to develop biological products for spinal reconstruction using Genetics Institute's recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein, BMP-2, which is in clinical trials for a number of indications around the world (see page 10). A preclinical study by researchers at Emory University School of Medicine using BMP-2 for spinal fusion was presented at the AAOS meeting. They concluded that osteoinductive proteins, when properly delivered, may result in a more reliable and biomechanically sound spinal fusion than the gold standard autograft, and may reduce the need for internal fixation.</p><p>Dr Einhorn is obviously excited about the work being done with BMPs and believes that fracture management has entered a "new wave of biology". BMP products can work, he says, and now their safety must be demonstrated.</p>
