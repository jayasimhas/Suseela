<p>Arthroscopy is a useful tool in the management of hip disorders but the equipment available is unsuitable in many cases, according to surgeons at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting. While established as a tool in the management of knee and shoulder disorders, arthroscopy of the hip is proving a successful method of diagnosis and treatment, says Dr Jeffery Warman, clinical assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center. Technology has failed to catch up with advances in techniques of hip arthroscopy and there is a need for specialised instruments for this procedure, he adds.</p>

<p>Arthroscopy is a useful tool in the management of hip disorders but the equipment available is unsuitable in many cases, according to surgeons at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting. While established as a tool in the management of knee and shoulder disorders, arthroscopy of the hip is proving a successful method of diagnosis and treatment, says Dr Jeffery Warman, clinical assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center. Technology has failed to catch up with advances in techniques of hip arthroscopy and there is a need for specialised instruments for this procedure, he adds.</p><p>The hip poses a number of problems for arthroscopy. It is less accessible than other joints and traction is required to see the femoral head. However, according to Dr James Glick, a San Francisco-based surgeon who pioneered the technique, hip arthroscopy is relatively simple to learn and with the right equipment can bring some of the benefits achieved with knee arthroscopy such as reduced recovery time, hospital stay and cost.</p><p>outcomes studies</p><p>A major potential application for the technique is the treatment of acetabular labral tears, says Dr Glick. The first outcomes studies of the technique were presented at the AAOS meeting, signalling, what Dr Glick hopes, is the beginning of a wider acceptance of hip arthroscopy. In a study of 94 patients, reviewed over five years following hip arthroscopy, researchers at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston concluded that hip arthroscopy can be used to diagnose accurately labral injury.</p><p>The technique can also be used to carry out certain treatments such as removal of debris, resection of torn labra or for taking a biopsy of the synovium, they add. In addition, in a small group of patients studied, the cost of hip arthroscopy was half that of the open procedure and rehabilitation was shorter.</p><p>longer equipment</p><p>The main requirement of hip arthroscopy equipment is that it must be longer and the shaver curved to access the joint. In addition, a distractor may be required to open up, but not dislocate, the joint. A handful of companies, namely Stryker, S&N Dionics and Arthrex, have produced some specialised equipment, says Dr Glick.</p><p>The potential market for hip arthroscopes and equipment is still small - around 200 surgeons in the US are currently using the technique, according to Dr Glick, with a few outside the US, but he is optimistic that more will adopt it. Manufacturers are less optimistic about the future of hip arthroscopy. Jim Good, director of marketing for arthroscopy and visualisation at Stryker, believes demand will not be high but he is continuing to watch developments in the market.</p>
