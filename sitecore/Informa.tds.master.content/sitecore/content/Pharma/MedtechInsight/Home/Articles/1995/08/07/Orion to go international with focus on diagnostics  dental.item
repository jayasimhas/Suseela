<p>Finnish healthcare, cosmetics and engineering group Orion has adopted a strategy of internationalisation in narrow, selected product ranges because the domestic market offers too little potential for growth. Possible product areas include Orion's diagnostics business - where exports already contribute 80% - and its dental care sector. These plans were discussed in the prospectus accompanying Orion's full listing on the Helsinki stock exchange in April.</p>

<p>Finnish healthcare, cosmetics and engineering group Orion has adopted a strategy of internationalisation in narrow, selected product ranges because the domestic market offers too little potential for growth. Possible product areas include Orion's diagnostics business - where exports already contribute 80% - and its dental care sector. These plans were discussed in the prospectus accompanying Orion's full listing on the Helsinki stock exchange in April.</p><p>Diagnostics sales contributed 5% of the group's total revenues of FMk 3,856 million ($920 million) last year. Orion Diagnostica focuses on infectious disease tests, specific protein , hormone and bone metabolism assays. Tests launched during 1994 include the following Spectria products: FT4 for analysing thyroid function; Cortisol for adrenal function; and LH for analysing problems associated with fertility, puberty and the pituitary gland.</p><p>Orion's dental business, included in its Oriola subsidiary, embraces wholesale operations and the manufacturing of X-ray equipment by Soredex-Finndent. Production includes panoramic X-ray units for dental and dento-maxillofacial imaging and a digital intra-oral imaging system . Exports account for 90% of Soredex-Finndent's operations. In 1994, the Quint 7000 dentist's care unit and the Digora imaging system were introduced.</p><pre>Orion Group's annual results (in FMk million) Net sales Operating profit 1994 1993 % change 1994 1993 % change Orion Diagnostica 203 178 14% 22 11 93% Oriola 1,117 1,039 8% 104 115 -9% of which dental care 211 205 3% - - - Healthcare 3,298 3,051 8% 545 503 8% Group 3,856 3,600 7% 584 554 5% (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Orion Diagnostica had a good year in 1994 but sales were down 3% in the first four months of 1995 to FMk 66 million.
