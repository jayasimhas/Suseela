<p>The exclusive club of the contrast media industry is in turmoil as the first non-ionic contrast media patent, iopamidol, is set to expire. The patent-holder, Italian company <strong>[C#198900374:Bracco]</strong>, is fighting potential competition from generics producers, and has made patent infringement claims against two Italian rivals, <strong>[C#198800493:Zambon]</strong> and <strong>[C#198601005:Recordati]</strong>. These two companies, plus Portuguese <strong>[C#200400511:Hovione]</strong>, are gearing up to get into bulk iopamidol.</p>

<p>The exclusive club of the contrast media industry is in turmoil as the first non-ionic contrast media patent, iopamidol, is set to expire. The patent-holder, Italian company <strong>[C#198900374:Bracco]</strong>, is fighting potential competition from generics producers, and has made patent infringement claims against two Italian rivals, <strong>[C#198800493:Zambon]</strong> and <strong>[C#198601005:Recordati]</strong>. These two companies, plus Portuguese <strong>[C#200400511:Hovione]</strong>, are gearing up to get into bulk iopamidol.</p><p>The worldwide contrast media market is worth around $3,200 million. The top four companies - Schering (Germany), Hafslund Nycomed (Norway), Bracco and Mallinckrodt (US) - have around 90% of sales (for a list of contrast media manufacturers see Clinica No 654, p 12). Iopamidol sales are about $700 million, a fifth of the total market.</p><p>With healthcare cost containment efforts mounting, cheaper generic producers are likely to put considerable pressure on the margins of Bracco and its licensees. Two companies - Hovione and Zambon - are ready to supply the US market once the patent expires, having filed Drug Master Files with the US FDA, says Guy Villax, Hovione's director of sales and marketing.</p><p>Bracco's iopamidol patent has already expired in countries such as Portugal and Germany and will expire later this year in the UK and Japan, maintains Mr Villax. In the US, the WTO treaty has resulted in uncertainty about the expiry date of Bracco's patent. The earliest date is January 1996, the latest November 1997. Bracco refused to confirm this information or comment in any other way.</p><p>Bracco has taken Zambon and Recordati to court claiming patent infringement. In Zambon's case, this is a counter-claim following an action of invalidation of Bracco's Italian patent. Stefano Panossian of Zambon's patent and trademark department explains that his company's claim for invalidation is based on the lack of novelty concerning Italian patent no 1,140,989, adding that the patent application was filed in Italy without any claim of priority, several years after the publication or grant of corresponding foreign patents on the same invention.</p><p>Zambon's invalidation case has been referred to the Constitutional Court in Rome. Bracco requested the referral arguing that the absence of certain transitory rules in Italian patent law is unconstitutional. Mr Panossian adds: "In Zambon's opinion the objection is unfounded, as already ruled by the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) in a similar case." A ruling is expected to take a year or more.</p>
