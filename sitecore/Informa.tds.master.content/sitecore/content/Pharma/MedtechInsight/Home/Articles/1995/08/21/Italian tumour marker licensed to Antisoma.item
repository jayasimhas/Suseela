<p>A monoclonal antibody against angiogenesis developed by the National Institute of Cancer Research in Genoa, Italy, has been licensed to UK biotechnology company <strong>[C#199000373:Antisoma]</strong>. In return for exclusive worldwide rights, Antisoma has made an undisclosed payment and will pay royalties on resulting commercial products.</p><p>Developed by Dr Luciano Zardi at the Italian institute, the antibody has the ability to target a marker expressed uniquely on the blood vessels of tumours, says Dr Nigel Courtenay-Luck, Antisoma's managing director. The antigen does not appear to vary between different tumours: in a patient with a rare tumour - Ewings sarcoma - biopsy proved negative except in the blood vessels as has been found in tumours of brain, breast and colon origin. It has "huge potential" as an early detector of metastases, believes Dr Courtenay-Luck, and also as a target for immunotherapy. The antigen-antibody binding site has been cloned and Antisoma is looking for a commercial partner to develop it further.</p><p>product development</p><p>Pilot clinical trials have been carried out in Greece with a cardiovascular imaging agent which has shown promise in localising melanoma which expresses a similar antigen to activated platelets. Antisoma plans to extend clinical trials with this agent. A peptide for imaging gastrointestinal cancer, licensed to Nihon Med-Physics (Japan), has been investigated in a number of assays and trials are due to begin shortly in Japan. Antisoma plans to carry out UK trials with the peptide.</p><p>Other imaging agents in development include a breast cancer project with Antisoma's Canadian partner BioChem Pharma which has a 21% stake in the UK concern.</p>
