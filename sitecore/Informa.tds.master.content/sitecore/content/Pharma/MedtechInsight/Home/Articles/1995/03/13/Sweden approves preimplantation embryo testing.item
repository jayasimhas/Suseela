<p>Diagnostic tests may be carried out on fertilised embryos prior to implantation in the uterus under proposed guidelines on embryo testing published recently by the Swedish government. Pre-implantation testing should, however, only be used under very restricted conditions - for "the diagnosis of serious, progressive, hereditary diseases which would lead to premature death and for which there is no cure or treatment". Gender determination should only be carried out for the purposes of diagnosing a gender-related hereditary disease, the guidelines state.</p>

<p>Diagnostic tests may be carried out on fertilised embryos prior to implantation in the uterus under proposed guidelines on embryo testing published recently by the Swedish government. Pre-implantation testing should, however, only be used under very restricted conditions - for "the diagnosis of serious, progressive, hereditary diseases which would lead to premature death and for which there is no cure or treatment". Gender determination should only be carried out for the purposes of diagnosing a gender-related hereditary disease, the guidelines state.</p><p>When the consultation process which formed the basis of the new guidelines began several years ago in Sweden, preimplantation embryo testing was still at the research stage. The technique is now in clinical use at the Sahlgrenska Hospital in Gothenburg. As part of the guidelines, the government has stipulated that the National Board of Health and Welfare must report regularly on the manner and extent of use of the technique.</p><p>A number of other changes to antenatal screening practice in Sweden have also been proposed. All women over 35 years of age should be given detailed information on screening tests and access to amniocentesis if they want it, while more information on screening should be available for women aged under 35. Ultrasound scanning should not necessarily be carried out routinely on all women, but patient consent should be sought first. The "medical value" of antenatal ultrasound scanning should also be assessed, the government believes.</p><p>The proposals are due for discussion by parliament at the beginning of May. Their implementation does not require the passing of a new law, but only parliamentary approval, according to Lakartidningen.</p>
