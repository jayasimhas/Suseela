<p>The Belgian authorities are reviewing reimbursement rates for pacemakers, heart valves, ocular lenses and vascular grafts. New rates could be introduced in early autumn unless the May elections result in a change in government and policies. These will be the first tariffs to be set by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs in the context of its revised reimbursement system.</p>

<p>The Belgian authorities are reviewing reimbursement rates for pacemakers, heart valves, ocular lenses and vascular grafts. New rates could be introduced in early autumn unless the May elections result in a change in government and policies. These will be the first tariffs to be set by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs in the context of its revised reimbursement system.</p><p>At first sight the new system is familiar - it introduces five categories of implants along the lines of the EU's Medical Devices Directive. However, applicants that are not acquainted with the Belgian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economics, especially foreign companies, may find the number of departments involved, their names and connections and the text of the regulations bewildering.</p><p>Under the new system, products are classified according to risk. Individual reimbursement levels are set for all Class I products (active implantables). Companies may charge more for their products as long as the cost falls within a narrow price band: in such cases the patient has to pay a supplement.</p><p>For Class II products, high-risk implants, there will be a single reimbursement rate per product type. As with Class I products, price variations within the specified range are permitted where the patient pays towards the difference. If the price of the products exceeds the range, then the company must apply to have its product placed on the limited list. The permitted price variation range has still to be set; local experts suggest it may be 20-25% above set levels.</p><p>Manufacturers of Class I and Class II products that exceed the permitted price variations must apply to have their products placed on the "limited list" of reimbursable products.</p><p>Formal application must be made in the format established by the Healthcare Insurance Committee of the National Institute of Sickness/Invalidity Insurance at the Social Affairs Ministry. It must also contain a Health Ministry declaration and details of clinical experience with the product in Belgium. The government had intended that the Economic Affairs Ministry should approve the price; however this may only apply to Class I and II products, at least initially.</p><p>The forms will be reviewed by the Technical Council for Implants at the Institute which will send its opinion to the Implant Suppliers/Insurance Organisations Agreement Commission. This Commission will then decide if the application should be forwarded to the National Institute of Sickness/Invalidity's Healthcare Insurance Committee with a view to placing the implant on the limited list.</p><p>Any changes to applications must be notified to the Secretariat of the Technical Council for Implants at the National Institute of Sickness/Invalidity's Healthcare Insurance Committee. For implants of this kind already on the market which do not meet the new requirements, the Technical Implants Council may propose to the Agreement Commission that they should no longer be reimbursed or that their terms be revised. If this is necessary, the Agreement Commission will notify the Healthcare Insurance Committee at the National Institute of Sickness/Invalidity Insurance.</p><p>For custom-made implants, the College of Leading Doctors is responsible for fixing the reimbursement level and for checking that the application requirements are fully met. Implants manufactured by non-Belgian companies may be considered for reimbursement if the price charged by the Belgian importer is less than 150% of the price charged (value-added tax and customs duties included).</p><p>One reason for the change, a local expert explained, is the government's fear that local distributors are artificially inflating the prices of imported products.</p><p>The College of Leading Doctors will also be responsible for setting the reimbursement prices for implants for limited clinical applications. This is a quick method to obtain provisional reimbursement for alternative uses or modifications of existing products. Such products are compared with implants on the limited list. (The cost of implants used in clinical trials is not reimbursed in Belgium.)</p><p>Electrodes and other implantable accessories will be reimbursed separately from the main product, so as to give more price transparency.</p><p>how the system works</p><p>All implants are classified as having a "U" value in the new system. Each individual product is then given a second numerical value which is multiplied by the value of U to obtain the reimbursement level. The letter value, in this case U, is reviewed once a year by the government and can be increased to reflect inflation. It can also be frozen or lowered for budgetary reasons. The numerical value changes less frequently - normally to reflect an increase or decrease in the cost of the materials or equipment needed to perform the procedure.</p><p>political hot potato</p><p>Medical insurance is high on the political agenda during the run-up to the elections. The Dutch-speaking liberal party wishes to see state responsibility limited, with private insurers becoming more involved. The Catholic and Socialist party has also voiced its intention to reform state insurance policy. Local experts suggest that the three regions may become more involved in social insurance in future.</p>
