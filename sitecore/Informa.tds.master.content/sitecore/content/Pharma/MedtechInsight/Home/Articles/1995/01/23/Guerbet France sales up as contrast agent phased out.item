<p><strong>[C#198700114:Guerbet]</strong> (France) has decided to drop its Telebrix 38 contrast agent and recall stocks in France and abroad over the next few months. The product withdrawal follows several reports to the Agence du Medicament of product crystallisation. The agency asked for some batches to be removed, but Guerbet has withdrawn the product as "a cautious move", Philippe Barthelet, Guerbet's financial director, told Clinica. He says no instances of clinical problems have been reported.</p>

<p><strong>[C#198700114:Guerbet]</strong> (France) has decided to drop its Telebrix 38 contrast agent and recall stocks in France and abroad over the next few months. The product withdrawal follows several reports to the Agence du Medicament of product crystallisation. The agency asked for some batches to be removed, but Guerbet has withdrawn the product as "a cautious move", Philippe Barthelet, Guerbet's financial director, told Clinica. He says no instances of clinical problems have been reported.</p><p>Telebrix 38 was one of Guerbet's older products and had been on the market for some 20 years. It will be substantially replaced by other agents in the same range, Telebrix 35 and Telebrix 30 M. The impact on sales of the removal of Telebrix 38 has already been accounted for in Guerbet's 1994 figures, says Mr Barthelet. Credit notes issued for the agent figure in results for 1994. The withdrawal should have no significant impact on 1995 sales, says Guerbet. The Telebrix range accounts for 23% of the company's sales; Telebrix 38 alone represented 12% of sales.</p><p>Consolidated turnover for the year was Fr 937 million ($177 million), a rise of 3% over the previous year. Net income for the year was similar to 1993 (Fr 51.3 million), representing 5.6% of the annual turnover. Exports accounted for 57% of Guerbet's sales.</p>
