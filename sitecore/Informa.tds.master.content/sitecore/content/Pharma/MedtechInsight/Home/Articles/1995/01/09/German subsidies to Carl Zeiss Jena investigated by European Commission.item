<p>The European Commission has given the German government three months to provide complete information on subsidies worth DM 587 million ($367 million) paid to east German manufacturer Carl Zeiss Jena. The Commission approved the subsidies in February 1993 but later received allegations that the money had not been used for the intended purpose. The Commission began investigating the company and the German authorities in March 1994 but has so far been unable to prove or refute the charges.</p>

<p>The European Commission has given the German government three months to provide complete information on subsidies worth DM 587 million ($367 million) paid to east German manufacturer Carl Zeiss Jena. The Commission approved the subsidies in February 1993 but later received allegations that the money had not been used for the intended purpose. The Commission began investigating the company and the German authorities in March 1994 but has so far been unable to prove or refute the charges.</p><p>The subsidies probably ensured the early survival of Carl Zeiss Jena, which made losses of DM 460 million from its privatisation in October 1991 to the year ended September 30th, 1994. The company is currently undergoing restructuring, due to be completed by February 1995, which will reduce its workforce by a third to 2,000. Even so, according to Peter Grassmann of parent company Carl Zeiss Oberkochen, current turnover can only secure 1,000 jobs. However, Mr Grassmann stresses that the Jena operation will continue and new business is being developed which could increase the company's turnover by DM 80 million.</p>
