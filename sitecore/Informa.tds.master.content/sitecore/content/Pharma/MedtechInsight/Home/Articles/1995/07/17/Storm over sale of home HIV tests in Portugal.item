<p>Home HIV tests are set to go on sale to the public in Portugal this week, despite strong opposition from many quarters. As Clinica went to press, Portuguese distributor Martinho e Calado Produtos Farmaceuticos was awaiting a meeting with Portuguese health products agency INFARMED to clarify the situation. However, while the agency may advise pharmacies not to stock the tests, there is no legislation in place to approve or ban the tests in Portugal.</p><p>The OTC nine-step spot test, called Teste VIH 1 e 2 in Portugal, will be launched this week and cost between Esc 3-4,000 ($21-27), Vitor Calado, director of Martinho e Calado, told Clinica. Stocks have already been delivered to his company from Singapore-based manufacturer Masters Biotech.</p><p>The Portuguese national anti-AIDS commission (CNLCS) has sent a letter to INFARMED and the national pharmacies association (ANF) voicing its concerns over the sale of the OTC HIV tests. The commission condemns the sale of the tests claiming the absence of pre- and post-test counselling could be very dangerous. The CNLCS also believes people may misread the results or mishandle the test - considered complex for an OTC kit - because of the stress involved in carrying it out. The risk of false positives or negatives is very high, says the commission.</p><p>Nevertheless, Mr Calado believes the home tests have many advantages, especially for those people who are too afraid to go to a doctor or do not want other people to find out they have the virus. He also claims that if the test is not carried out properly, no result is shown.</p><p>Paulus Tan, production manager at Masters Biotech told Clinica the tests were developed for ease of use. "The simple kit is designed for public use, particularly drug users or promiscuous people who have, for example, wife and girlfriend problems," says Mr Tan. The tests have been on sale in Singapore for over a year and Masters Biotech hopes to begin penetrating other markets in the future, starting in Europe with Portugal and Germany, he says.</p>
