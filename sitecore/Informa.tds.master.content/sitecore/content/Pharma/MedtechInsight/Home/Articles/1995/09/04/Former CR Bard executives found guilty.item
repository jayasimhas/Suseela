<p>Three former CR Bard executives were found guilty on August 24th of conspiring to defraud the US FDA in connection with faulty catheters. Acting US Attorney Jonathan Chiel said that evidence presented during the eight-week trial demonstrated that from 1987 to early 1990, Bard - at the direction of the three defendants - unlawfully sold and distributed heart catheters which had not been approved by the FDA for human use. Sentencing is scheduled for November 1st: each defendant faces up to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.</p>

<p>Three former CR Bard executives were found guilty on August 24th of conspiring to defraud the US FDA in connection with faulty catheters. Acting US Attorney Jonathan Chiel said that evidence presented during the eight-week trial demonstrated that from 1987 to early 1990, Bard - at the direction of the three defendants - unlawfully sold and distributed heart catheters which had not been approved by the FDA for human use. Sentencing is scheduled for November 1st: each defendant faces up to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.</p><p>Former group executive vice-president of Bard David Prigmore, former president of USCI John Cvinar and former vice-president for regulatory affairs and quality assurance at USCI Lee Leichter were all found guilty in the Boston District Court of conspiracy to defraud. They were found to have engaged in illegal human experimentation with unapproved catheters, altering catheter design without FDA approval, concealing malfunctions from the FDA and lying to the FDA about catheter design.</p><p>As a result of their conduct, numerous tip breakages occurred in patients, necessitating emergency surgery to remove the tips, and catheters failed to deflate during interventional cardiology. Some 22,000 patients received the catheters in question before they were recalled.</p><p>Two other defendants - former Bard CEO George Maloney and Kenneth Thurston, former director of regulatory affairs at USCI - were acquitted by the jury. A sixth Bard employee - former supervisor in USCI's regulatory affairs division Janice Piasecki - had been acquitted earlier.</p><p>Bard has already paid $61 million to the government - half as a criminal fine, half as a civil settlement - the largest fine ever imposed in an FDA prosecution. Earlier this year, the FDA lifted its Applications Integrity Policy imposed on Bard's USCI division in January 1994 (see Clinica No 663, p 12).</p>
