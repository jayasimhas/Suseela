<p>The Irish Department of Health's national register for manufacturers of Class I and custom-made devices is now in operation. Although there had been speculation about a registration fee, a spokeswoman for the Secondary Care Division of the Competent Authority confirmed there is no charge at present. The situation will be reviewed in nine months in the light of the volume of applications.</p><p>Registration details will be fed into the computerised medical device record system being developed at the Department of Health.</p><p>no more NBs?</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the only Notified Body in the country. Although there have been several enquiries from other organisations, no further applications have been received.</p><p>no transition for CIs</p><p>Just as with the Active Implantable Medical in Ireland Devices Directive, the transitional period does not apply to clinical investigations. Ireland has taken the same approach as the UK in insisting that companies notify the Competent Authority and obtain Ethics Committee approval before beginning clinical investigations.</p>
