<p>The only way to succeed in the Italian electromedical sector is with innovative products that open new markets, believes Professor Carlo Castellano, president and managing director of Italy's leading electromedical company, the Esaote Group. In a recent interview with Clinica's Amanda Maxwell, Prof Castellano, also vice-president of the Italian electromedical industry association, ANIE, remarked that although Italian companies enjoyed a "good year" in 1994, this was mainly due to export success; the Italian market was static.</p><p>The Italian electromedical equipment market is generally hostile to newcomers, Prof Castellano said. Current players are fighting to maintain market share. There is "no room for growth" since the value of the market dropped 3.5% in 1994 to Lit 760,000 million ($470 million) and is likely to remain stagnant this year at best, he said.</p><p>Despite the unfavourable conditions, domestic companies' sales increased 12% on average with exports up 23%, while the percentage of the electromedical market accounted for by imports dropped from 85% in 1993 to 60% in 1994. However, while Italian exporters are generally doing well, Prof Castellano said, companies that rely solely on the domestic market are finding it difficult to cope.</p><p>"impossible to survive"</p><p>In Prof Castellano's view, it would be "absolutely impossible to survive solely in the Italian market". With a "dramatic reduction" in the public healthcare capital investment budget from Lit 1,800,000 million in 1992 to Lit 300,000 million in 1995 and the possibility of a further decrease next year, there is little money for investment in medical equipment. Furthermore, the effects of the budget reductions have yet to be fully felt, he said; some regions delay using their budgets so there is a possible time-lag in the funding crisis. The best that can be hoped for is a static market this year; although Prof Castellano fears a further drop of over 10% in public sector investment in equipment in the imminent future.</p><p>If there is any growth in the Italian electromedical market this year, he predicts, it will be in the private sector which seems to grow in proportion to the rate the public sector is shrinking. Esaote has seen a gradual shift in its Italian sales from 45% to the private sector in 1991 to 55% last year. It forecasts that the shift will increase to around 60% over the next few years.</p><p>Given the domestic stagnation, and Esaote's global market strategy, the company is intensifying its efforts outside Italy. While 48% of the Lit 233,000 million group sales were accounted for abroad in 1994, the target is for 55% of the anticipated Lit 270,000 million this year to be achieved overseas. Prof Castellano predicts a compound annual growth rate of some 8-10% over the next five years solely due to increases in sales abroad which should represent approximately 70% of the total by the end of the decade. (This year's projected sales increase of 15-20%, follows a rise in turnover of 21% last year.)</p><p>At present over 70% of non-Italian sales are accounted for by the US, western Europe, China and Japan, which is becoming an increasingly significant market for the company. Latin America, Africa, Asia and eastern Europe account for the remainder.</p><p>The French, German and US subsidiaries form part of the group's Italian business, Esaote SpA, which accounted for Lit 204,000 million of total turnover last year, up 15% on 1993. Its exports were up 50% in 1994 and comprised 59% of the sales total.</p><p>opportunities in Italy</p><p>Despite its export growth strategy, Esaote still sees opportunities in the Italian market. Artoscan, the first dedicated MRI system for limbs and joints, has been well received and has highlighted the opportunities that exist for innovative, cost-effective products in the Italian market. According to vice-president of Esaote and manager of international sales Fabrizio Landi, the system has captured 13-14% of the static Italian MRI market.</p><p>Mr Landi remarked that Italy, Germany and the US seem particularly receptive to products which reduce costs and that some 45 of the 60 units sold in 1994 were bought by these countries (20 in Italy). France, on the other hand, seems to "discourage new techniques" and "like other companies", Esaote has found it a "difficult market" to penetrate.</p><p>The small neuroradiology market in Italy has been equally receptive to Esaote's development over the last two years of a renewed range of full digital EEG. In the more established, generally static markets, such as traditional MRI, Esaote - like its competitors - is consolidating its position and fighting to retain market share, Mr Landi said.</p><p>Esaote dedicates some 10% of turnover to R&D, a policy to which the new management is committed. Esaote invest not only in Italian research but, as part of its strategy to strengthen its position as a European leader in electromedical technology, collaborates with industrial research centres and universities throughout Europe, Mr Landi said.</p><p>With the Italian market becoming increasingly aware of products which offer cost savings and healthcare reforms aimed at making the service more efficient by giving managers more responsibility for their budgets, there will be better opportunities in future for keenly priced products which enable managers to cut costs.</p><p>Esaote Biomedica was set up in 1983 and focused almost exclusively on the Italian market until 1989/90. Its sales reached Lit 75,000 million in 1988. The company was bought out by its management last year (see Clinica No 589, pp 14-15), when the name for the Italian part of the business changed to Esaote SpA. The Esaote group, which includes Esaote SpA and international sales not covered by Esaote SpA's subsidiaries, had sales of Lit 233,000 million last year. The company is based in Genoa, with offices in Florence, and has 650 employees worldwide. It hopes to be traded on the stock market by the end of 1996.</p>
