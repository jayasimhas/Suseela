<p>MediSense and Novamedix have won the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for innovative products in the medical field. The UK awards, announced on April 21st, went to MediSense for its blood glucose sensor for diabetics and to Novamedix for its A-V Impulse System to enhance blood circulation.</p><p>Launched in 1987, MediSense's blood glucose monitor was developed using technology from the University of Oxford and Cranfield Institute. The biosensor enables blood glucose levels to be read on a pen-sized meter within 30 seconds. Some 94% of MediSense's &pound;130 million sales are exported to over 50 countries.</p><p>The Novamedix system comprises a foot pump which stimulates blood circulation by intermittently compressing the plexus of veins in the foot. Designed for immobilised patients, the A-V Impulse System reduces risk of thrombosis.</p><p>export awards</p><p>The Queen's Award for Export Achievement went to the following companies for medical technology:</p><p>* Bio-Rad Microscience for confocal laser scanning equipment</p><p>* COBE Labs for medical disposables</p><p>* Ethicon for surgical sutures and wound repair products</p><p>* RSR for medical diagnostics</p><p>* Shield Diagnostics for IVD products</p><p>* Smith & Nephew Medical for casting and bandaging products.</p><p>Based in Hertfordshire, Bio-Rad Microscience has a 45% share of the world confocal microscopy market. The Microscopy Division produces confocal laser scanning equipment for medical use. Exports account for 90% of the division's sales, which reached &pound;13 million in 1994. The division's general manager, Brad Crutchfield, highlights the company's success in the North American and Japanese markets.</p><p>Shield Diagnostics says exports from its Dundee facility grew fourfold between 1991 and 1994. Of the 4.8 million IVD tests manufactured by Shield for autoimmune, infectious, microbiological and cardiovascular diseases and neonatal screening, some 4.5 million are exported. North America accounts for 40% of exports, other main destinations being Europe, the Middle East and Australasia. Shield is forecasting total turnover of around &pound;5 million in fiscal 1995 (ended March 31st).</p><p>Over the last four years Smith & Nephew Medical's exports have grown 63% to &pound;43 million, accounting for 70% of the division's sales.
