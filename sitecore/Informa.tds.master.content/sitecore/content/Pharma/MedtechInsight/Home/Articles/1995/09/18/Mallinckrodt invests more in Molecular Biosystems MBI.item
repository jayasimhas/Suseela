<p>Mallinckrodt is extending its 1988 agreement with Molecular Biosystems with an additional equity investment and further funding for MBI's ultrasound contrast agent, FS069. Under the agreement, which has to be reviewed by the US Federal Trade Commission for antitrust issues, Mallinckrodt will acquire a 10% stake in MBI through the purchase of $13 million of MBI common stock at $11.62 a share. MBI will also receive a further $20 million over four years for development of FS069 and an additional $14.5 million may be paid by Mallinckrodt for clinical funding and milestone achievements.</p>

<p>Mallinckrodt is extending its 1988 agreement with Molecular Biosystems with an additional equity investment and further funding for MBI's ultrasound contrast agent, FS069. Under the agreement, which has to be reviewed by the US Federal Trade Commission for antitrust issues, Mallinckrodt will acquire a 10% stake in MBI through the purchase of $13 million of MBI common stock at $11.62 a share. MBI will also receive a further $20 million over four years for development of FS069 and an additional $14.5 million may be paid by Mallinckrodt for clinical funding and milestone achievements.</p><p>The agreement extends Mallinckrodt's sales and marketing exclusivity on MBI's ultrasound contrast agents, which include Albunex, from October 1999 to either July 2003 or three years after US FDA approval of FS069 for myocardial perfusion - whichever is the later. Mallinckrodt's marketing rights have also been expanded to countries not already covered by agreements with <strong>[C#198700350:Shionogi]</strong> (Japan and North-East Asia) and Nycomed (Europe). MBI may reacquire co-exclusive rights to the contrast agents after the year 2000. Albunex was the first ultrasound contrast agent to receive regulatory marketing approval - in Japan in 1993 (see Clinica No 574, p 12).</p><p>expedited development of FS069</p><p>Considerable emphasis is being placed on the development of FS069, which completed Phase I trials in the US in May (see Clinica No 654, p 16). Intravenously administered doses starting at 0.5 cc resulted in visually apparent and significant myocardial perfusion. Clearance to begin Phase III trials was received from the FDA last week.</p>
