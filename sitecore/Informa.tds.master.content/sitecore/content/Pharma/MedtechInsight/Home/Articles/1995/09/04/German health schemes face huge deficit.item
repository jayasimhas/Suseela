<p>Germany's statutory health insurance system faces the prospect of a DM 3,000 million ($2,143 million) deficit this year following drastic increases in reimbursement during the first six months. Payments made by the federal assocation of company health insurance funds (Betriebskrankenkassen) rose by 6% per capita in the western Lander and 16.5% in eastern Germany. Over the same period basic wage levels, which determine the BKK's income, grew by just 2% and 5.5%, respectively.</p>

<p>Germany's statutory health insurance system faces the prospect of a DM 3,000 million ($2,143 million) deficit this year following drastic increases in reimbursement during the first six months. Payments made by the federal assocation of company health insurance funds (Betriebskrankenkassen) rose by 6% per capita in the western Lander and 16.5% in eastern Germany. Over the same period basic wage levels, which determine the BKK's income, grew by just 2% and 5.5%, respectively.</p><p>Two days after publication of the BKK results, the largely white-collar Ersatzkrankenkassen announced deficits of DM 749 million and DM 209 million in the western and eastern Lander. These were blamed primarily on the hospitals, with payments for in-patient treatment up by 6.3% and 14.9% on first-half 1994 levels.</p><p>Rejecting the accusation, hospital representatives claimed that the Kassen were presenting a distorted picture in order to improve their position in the forthcoming third stage of the health reforms. According to the the German hospital association (DKG), the drop in Kassen income is the main reason behind the deficits.</p><p>Health Ministry Parliamentary Secretary Sabine Bergmann-Pohl described the interim results as worrying, urging the Kassen and their partners to work together towards "strict observation" of their budgets in order to avert the need to raise contributions.</p><p>global payment ceiling proposed</p><p>Opposition Social Democrat health experts have responded to the impending deficit by proposing a global ceiling on Kassen reimbursement with effect from January 1996, thereby creating a direct linkage between payments and economic growth. The Kassen and their partners would then have a free hand to allocate the global budget to specific healthcare branches as necessary, they say.</p>
