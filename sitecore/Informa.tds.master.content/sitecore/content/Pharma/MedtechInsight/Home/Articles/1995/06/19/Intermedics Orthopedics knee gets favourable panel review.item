<p>Intermedics Orthopedics' (US) Natural Knee prosthesis received a unanimous recommendation for conditional US marketing approval by the FDA's Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel on June 12th. The recommendation was for cementless use of the implant in skeletally mature individuals. The panel recommended that Intermedics be required to perform additional ex vivo studies to measure the ability of the prosthesis to withstand shear forces and to perform post- marketing follow-up studies in patients.</p>

<p>Intermedics Orthopedics' (US) Natural Knee prosthesis received a unanimous recommendation for conditional US marketing approval by the FDA's Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel on June 12th. The recommendation was for cementless use of the implant in skeletally mature individuals. The panel recommended that Intermedics be required to perform additional ex vivo studies to measure the ability of the prosthesis to withstand shear forces and to perform post- marketing follow-up studies in patients.</p><p>Intermedics' data consisted of an uncontrolled study involving the implantation of approximately 350 devices in 278 patients with knee injury secondary to trauma or osteoarthritis and 22 patients with knee injury secondary to inflammatory disease. The results were compared with published, historical controls. Outcome measurements included clinical assessment of knee function, bone loosening around the device as detected by X-rays and the rate of complications requiring surgery. The results indicated the device was neither better nor worse than devices already on the market.</p><p>This trial design was approved by the FDA in the mid 1980s prior to the agency's current policy of requiring randomised controlled studies to evaluate similar devices. While panel members agreed with the FDA that the trial design was not ideal to evaluate fully the product, they accepted that the device was similar to products on the market.</p><p>Panel members and the FDA expressed some concern that the articular surface of the device was made from titanium, a compound that has not fared well in other designs. The sponsor had agreed to change the design subsequent to marketing to alleviate this potential problem. In a special motion the panel voted five to one that the device should be approved for use in patients with inflammatory disease and that there was no reason to test the device in special subpopulations unless future data suggest otherwise.</p>
