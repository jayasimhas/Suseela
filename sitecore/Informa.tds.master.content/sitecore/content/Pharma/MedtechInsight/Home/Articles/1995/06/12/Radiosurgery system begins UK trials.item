<p>Trials of a new system for delivering low-energy radiation therapy directly to tumours have begun in the UK following successful Phase I trials in the US. The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS), developed by US company Photoelectron, comprises a 3 mm-diameter, 100 mm-long needle which is inserted into the tumour, delivering X-rays from a battery-powered source. Initially configured for treating brain tumours, the system works with a stereotactic frame and the needle is passed through the track left by a biopsy cannula.</p>

<p>Trials of a new system for delivering low-energy radiation therapy directly to tumours have begun in the UK following successful Phase I trials in the US. The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS), developed by US company Photoelectron, comprises a 3 mm-diameter, 100 mm-long needle which is inserted into the tumour, delivering X-rays from a battery-powered source. Initially configured for treating brain tumours, the system works with a stereotactic frame and the needle is passed through the track left by a biopsy cannula.</p><p>The UK trials at the Royal Free Hospital in London are part of a Phase II multi-centre study of the system for treating brain metastases which is already under way at five US sites. Other studies are planned in Japan and Australia. The Phase II trials aim to show control of tumour growth and longer patient survival times compared with whole-brain radiotherapy.</p><p>According to the Waltham, Massachusetts-based company, the PRS allows the surgeon to match the radiation field to the shape of the tumour, overcoming the problems associated with external radiation treatment which passes high-energy beams through the body. Photoelectron believes the PRS's 10 to 40 minute treatment time combined with minimal-exposure to healthy tissue means the patient generally requires only one day in hospital. At a cost of around $500,000, the PRS is claimed to be five to ten times less expensive than a linear accelerator or gamma knife.</p><p>The system will be sold with a treatment planning system featuring Radionics' Stereo Plan software which is used to display CT and MRI scans and convert them into three-dimensional images.</p><p>Photoelectron will also <strong>[C#198700592:alter]</strong> the needle dimensions for use in other applications such as bladder, prostate, breast, cervix and liver cancers. Trials are due to begin within the next 12 months.</p>
