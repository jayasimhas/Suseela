<p>In spite of hiccups in Germany <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> (US) managed to increase sales and profits by over 25% in fiscal 1995 (ended April 30th). Total revenues were $1,740 million, compared with $1,390 million last year, and net earnings were up 26.5% at $294 million.</p><p>The results were boosted by a strong fourth quarter in which turnover and profits each rose by some 32%. Sales reached $516.7 million compared with $393 million in 1994; net profits were $87.8 million compared with $66.7 million a year earlier.</p><p>the good news ...</p><p>The company's largest division, Bradycardia Pacing, which accounts for over half of total sales, saw double-digit growth, according to Medtronic. Sales were led by the Thera family of pacemakers; these were launched in Europe in March 1994 and in the US in January 1995.</p><p>Tachyarrythmia products (some 10% of turnover) were boosted by the Jewel implantable defibrillator which Medtronic says has won market leadership outside the US. The Interventional Vascular division launched its Falcon rapid-exchange catheter late in the year while revenue growth was led by the Panther and Evergreen over-the-wire catheters and the Ascent guiding catheter.</p><p>In the Neurological division (10% of turnover), sales of the SynchroMed implantable drug infusion system rose following Medicare reimbursement approval for treatment of chronic pain and spasticity associated with spinal cord injury.</p><p>and the bad</p><p>However, the news was not all good. Medtronic continues to be investigated in Germany for alleged abuse of the reimbursement system in the heart valve scandal. Although no specific charges have been made, the company, along with St Jude Medical (US) and Sorin Biomedica (Italy), is under suspicion of having paid bribes to cardiac surgeons to persuade them to pay inflated prices for heart valves. The investigations will take another four-to-five months (see Clinica No 648, p 1). Medtronic denies any wrongdoing.</p>
