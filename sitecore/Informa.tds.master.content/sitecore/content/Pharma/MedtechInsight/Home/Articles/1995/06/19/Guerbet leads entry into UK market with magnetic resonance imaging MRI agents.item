<p>French contrast agent manufacturer <strong>[C#198700114:Guerbet]</strong> has formed a UK subsidiary through which it will sell products directly to the market. The London-based operation, which will be headed by Francois Gary, will start up in the autumn and will initially sell MRI agents, Gullan Agerbak, director of the company's international subsidiaries division, told Clinica at the Rontgen Centenary congress in Birmingham last week.</p><p>The move signals the continuation of a corporate strategy to establish a direct presence in major international markets. Guerbet is essentially starting from scratch in the UK - unlike other major markets, such as Germany, where it has taken on an existing distributorship.</p><p>Ms Agerbak sees opportunities for innovative MRI agents in a market which is generally well served by the larger manufacturers. The UK market for MRI agents is thought to be worth around &pound;3.5 million ($5.6 million) - this figure is likely to double over the next five years, the company believes. Guerbet will lead off with the gastrointestinal agent, Lumirem, which is licensed in the UK; Endorem, a liver-specific agent; and Dotarem, a general MRI agent - the latter two are awaiting UK licences.</p><p>The new, non-ionic X-ray agent, Xenetix, will also enter the UK market following licensing, which Guerbet hopes will come early next year. Meanwhile, Mallinckrodt will continue to sell Guerbet's Hexabrix and Lipiodol X-ray agents in the UK, says Ms Agerbak. The UK market for injectable iodinated agents is worth &pound;26 million which Guerbet estimates will grow 30% growth over the next five years, boosted by an increase in the number of CT and vascular studies.</p><p>Other agents under development at Guerbet are a non-ionic CT medium and an MRI agent for lymph node imaging. The company also has an agreement with <strong>[C#199300077:Sonus Pharmaceuticals]</strong> for the clinical development, registration and marketing of the ultrasound contrast agent EchoGen in Europe (see Clinica No 633, p 10).</p>
