<p>Advanced Cardiovascular Systems (ACS), a subsidiary of Guidant, has agreed a deal with Cardiovascular Dynamics (CVD) to develop selected proprietary cardiology device technologies. ACS has been granted an option to license CVD's Mechanical Angioplasty Catheter (MAC) technology for use in developing new perfusion angioplasty catheters. In exchange, CVD, a subsidiary of Endosonics, has received the right to market ACS' SmartNeedle products. This technology uses patented Doppler ultrasound needle technology to locate and access arteries more accurately than conventional vascular access devices.</p>

<p>Advanced Cardiovascular Systems (ACS), a subsidiary of Guidant, has agreed a deal with Cardiovascular Dynamics (CVD) to develop selected proprietary cardiology device technologies. ACS has been granted an option to license CVD's Mechanical Angioplasty Catheter (MAC) technology for use in developing new perfusion angioplasty catheters. In exchange, CVD, a subsidiary of Endosonics, has received the right to market ACS' SmartNeedle products. This technology uses patented Doppler ultrasound needle technology to locate and access arteries more accurately than conventional vascular access devices.</p><p>Under the terms of the agreement, ACS will further develop the MAC technology during the option period with materials and engineering support from CVD. During that period, ACS will have the option to license the technology on an exclusive worldwide basis. Should ACS exercise its option, it will make milestone and royalty payments to CVD.</p><p>analysts on ACS</p><p>Analysts at brokerage house Morgan Stanley believe that ACS is "well positioned to gain share in the coronary angioplasty market", as it is the only competitor worldwide to offer both rapid exchange and perfusion catheters. "ACS is the worldwide leader in angioplasty accessories used with balloon catheters," analyst Glenn Reicin writes in a recent analysis of Guidant. He estimates that accessories (including guidewires) make up about one third of the $1,100 million worldwide angioplasty market.</p><p>float proceeds</p><p>The underwriters exercised their overallotment option in the Guidant float. <strong>[C#198600152:Eli Lilly]</strong> has sold 19.8% of Guidant for $14.50 a share (see Clinica No 634, p 14). This has netted $192.5 million, which will be used to repay Guidant debt.</p>
