<p>A team of Icelandic molecular biologists has discovered a family with male breast cancer linked to the BRCA2 gene but very few cases of female breast cancer. The group from the University of Reykjavik says that three brothers and a male cousin with breast cancer share the same BRCA2 haplotype. Only three female relatives were affected in an expanded pedigree of 252 men and 229 women and they did not show the characteristic early onset usually associated with BRCA2 families. Four of the patients are first degree relatives: three brothers and their sister.</p>

<p>A team of Icelandic molecular biologists has discovered a family with male breast cancer linked to the BRCA2 gene but very few cases of female breast cancer. The group from the University of Reykjavik says that three brothers and a male cousin with breast cancer share the same BRCA2 haplotype. Only three female relatives were affected in an expanded pedigree of 252 men and 229 women and they did not show the characteristic early onset usually associated with BRCA2 families. Four of the patients are first degree relatives: three brothers and their sister.</p><p>Breast cancer is a hundred times less common in men than women. It can be caused by endocrine abnormalities including androgen receptor gene mutations and accounts for about 1% of male cancers but is rare in families with the BRCA1 gene. An increased risk of male breast cancer has been seen in other BRCA2 families but this is the first in which there is no increase among the women.</p><p>Dr Jorunn Eyfjord, who works at the cancer society's molecular research laboratory told Clinica, "Why breast cancer is not elevated among women in the family we describe, we don't know. There might be other genes in that region or, other genes might interact with the proposed BRCA2 gene. So far we have no clues. We are now looking at other cancers in the family as well." The group is studying all male breast cancers in Iceland since 1955 as well as looking for BRCA2 linkage in families with high incidence of breast cancer. Work since the Lancet paper was accepted has strengthened the linkage to the BRCA2 region, says Dr Eyfjord.</p>
