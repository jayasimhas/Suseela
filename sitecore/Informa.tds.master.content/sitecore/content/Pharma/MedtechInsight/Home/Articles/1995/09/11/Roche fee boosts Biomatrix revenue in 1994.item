<p>Biomatrix has received a $5 million fee from Roche-Syntex for expanded European marketing rights to Biomatrix' hylan polymer, Synvisc, for osteoarthritis.</p><p>The expanded agreement now means that Roche-Syntex markets Synvisc in all EU countries - except Italy where <strong>[C#198601005:Recordati]</strong> is the licensee, and Greece - Switzerland and South Africa. Synvisc, which is under review by the US FDA, has been approved in Canada (where it is marketed by Biomatrix) and Sweden. Biomatrix is negotiating with potential licensees in Latin America and Japan.</p><p>Biomatrix is evaluating a number of other products for the worldwide visco-elastic market, which is thought to be worth up to $350 million a year. These include the Hylashield range of ophthalmic viscoprotection products. Hylashield is marketed in Canada for dry eye syndrome in collaboration with I-Med Pharma and negotiations with partners for other markets are in progress. Other ophthalmic visco-elastic products in development include HSS for surgical viscoprotection (with I-Med Pharma) and Hylasol for viscosurgery (with Pharmacia).</p><p>In addition, several Hylagel matrix engineering products are in preclinical or pilot studies for postsurgical prevention of adhesion with viscosupplementation, urinary incontinence and percutaneous embolisation of arteriovenous malformation. Artelan, a viscosurgical product for arthroscopic surgery, is also being evaluated for possible introduction in the US and Canada.</p><p>Biomatrix' sales of medical and skin care products totalled $2.5 million in 1994, up 39% on the previous year. Total revenues were $8.9 million against $3.5 million in 1993, and the company reported a net loss of $4.4 million ($8.9 million in 1993).</p><p>In the first half of 1995, product sales rose 20% to $1.7 million, but total revenue was down 63% to $2.6 million as a licensing payment in the first half of 1994 fell out of the equation. Consequently, Biomatrix' net loss increased to $3.7 million compared with $620,000 the previous year.</p>
