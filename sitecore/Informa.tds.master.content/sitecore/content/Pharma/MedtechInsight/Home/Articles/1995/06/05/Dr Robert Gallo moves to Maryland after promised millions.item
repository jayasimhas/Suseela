<p>Dr Robert Gallo, the eminent virologist, is to leave the US National Institutes of Health to set up an institute devoted to HIV research in Baltimore, Maryland. After being wooed by several states, Dr Gallo says he decided to create the new institute at the University of Maryland after the state governor, Parris Glendening, promised $9 million in state aid for the next three years. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke has promised an additional $3 million in city funds. However, the total cost to Maryland is estimated to be some $60 million.</p>

<p>Dr Robert Gallo, the eminent virologist, is to leave the US National Institutes of Health to set up an institute devoted to HIV research in Baltimore, Maryland. After being wooed by several states, Dr Gallo says he decided to create the new institute at the University of Maryland after the state governor, Parris Glendening, promised $9 million in state aid for the next three years. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke has promised an additional $3 million in city funds. However, the total cost to Maryland is estimated to be some $60 million.</p><p>Dr Gallo says he selected Maryland because of other scientific work taking place nearby, the quality and availability of space and the large pool of potential patients. His departure from the <strong>[C#198600351:NIH]</strong> follows several other celebrated scientists, including the previous director of the cancer institute, Samuel Broder. Dr Gallo plans to take many of his laboratory's 55 staff with him. He hopes the institute will eventually employ more than 250 people and operate on a budget of $25-30 million, he told reporters at a press conference.</p><p>Dr Gallo and his NIH colleagues identified the HIV virus in 1984 at the same time as Dr Luc Montaigner of the French Institut Pasteur (see Clinica No 613, p 21). However, the French researchers asserted that Dr Gallo had claimed their virus as his own. While cleared of any misconduct, he eventually conceded that the French virus had accidentally contaminated the virus in his own laboratory.</p>
