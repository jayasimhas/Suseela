<p>Nomenclature, or a standard language, is one of the issues that remains to be solved before the major players in the medical devices industry can communicate effectively with each other through telematics or other means, delegates in Athens learnt.

<p>Nomenclature, or a standard language, is one of the issues that remains to be solved before the major players in the medical devices industry can communicate effectively with each other through telematics or other means, delegates in Athens learnt. The EEA is still some years away from developing a system to satisfy the needs of the Directive.</p><p>Given the urgency for standard communication, CEN's Technical Committee 257, symbols and labelling for medical devices, subcommittee 1, has recommended using the ECRI nomenclature as an interim measure while an EEA nomenclature is developed.</p><p>The nomenclature used by ECRI, a US-based non-profit, non- governmental organisation which has investigated medical device- related injuries and deaths for 27 years, has developed a nomenclature of 7,706 terms and 3,174 cross-references. Jonathan Gaev, director of the health device group of ECRI, explained that the nomenclature is freely available for non-commercial purposes and has been widely distributed around the world to countries including Australia, Russia, Cuba and Colombia.</p><p>John Worroll, manager of the adverse incident centre at the Medical Devices Agency and chairman of CEN/TC 257 SC1 (nomenclature and coding), explained that there are three potential problems with the use of ECRI by the European authorities, although none seem insurmountable. The first concerns the long-term use of ECRI, since the European authorities would need to become involved in its maintenance. The second is the short-comings of the ECRI nomenclature since it does not include all product categories covered by the Directives, and the third concerns the non-commercial situation. This could be problematic since CEN and other European standards bodies sell the information that would contain the nomenclature. In addition, the ECRI nomenclature does not include all product categories covered by the Directives.</p><p>The only interim alternative to ECRI proposed at the meeting was the use of a European database divided into some 20 device categories. This was dismissed by Maurice Freeman, Commission expert on medical devices, as too basic since although there have been only a small number of proven incident vigilance reports to date - around 10 - it appears the number of overall reports is much higher.</p><p>new European nomenclature</p><p>CEN/TC 257's ultimate goal, while using ECRI in the interim, would be to develop a new language-independent system based on and compatible with the FDA's and ECRI's nomenclature and with the telematics structure proposed by EUROMEDIES. Subcommittee 1 proposes that the structure would have fewer than 20 broad categories (such as AIMDs, dental, IVDs etc). These would then be listed according to generic device group, so databases could be scanned for similar devices, and then further differentiated by type (make and model). Once this project has been clearly defined, the Commission will consider its financing, Norbert Anselmann promised. In the meantime, the ECRI proposal will be discussed at a meeting between the Commission and CEN BTS 3 (Healthcare) on September 19th at which CEN/TC 257 and CEN/TC 251 (medical informatics) will be present.</p>
