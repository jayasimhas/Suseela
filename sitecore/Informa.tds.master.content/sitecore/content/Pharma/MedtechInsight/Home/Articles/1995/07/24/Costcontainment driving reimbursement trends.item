<p>The need to gain familiarity with national healthcare systems has never been greater. Jeanette Marchant reports from Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>Healthcare reform and reimbursement issues are as important influences on the medical device industry as regulatory developments. Cost-containment continues to dominate healthcare policies with resulting changes in the marketplace taking the form of managed care, managed competition and capitation. In order to achieve reimbursement for medical technology, companies must demonstrate cost-effectiveness; outcomes data are becoming an essential ingredient of product development programmes. The impact of these developments on the industry was explored at the Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver, Canada, last month.</p><p>While the "healthcare revolution is over" in the US, Pieter Halter, president of Medical Data International, claimed that "it has put in place a number of lasting paradigm changes that will reinvent healthcare during the remainder of this decade". There was a significant increase in managed care in 1994, although the trend varies among states. With the changes taking place in healthcare delivery, the market benchmarks are altering so that medtech companies need to keep abreast of the market share held by each delivery system.</p><p>In the managed care environment, the unaligned hospital and specialist is an endangered species. As integration of providers increases, Mr Halter forecast that by the year 2000, 200 integrated hospital systems will provide 80% of US healthcare, with annual revenues of $4-5,000 million each.</p><p>Capitation is a main driving force of market changes. With the elimination of fee-for-service payments and the focus on global budgets, there is no incentive to fill beds. Cost-effective use of resources and shorter hospital stays are already setting the trend. In order to spread risk, providers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for capitated contracting.</p><p>In a capitation system, disease management is a key ingredient to retaining patients and profitability, believes Mr Halter. Providers which can manage segmented patient populations at low cost are more likely to succeed, the emphasis being not on management of product cost but on broader disease costs.</p><p>Reiterating the view that the fee-for-service mentality will be replaced by capitation, Connie Woodburn, executive vice-president of Premier Health Alliance, underlined the impact this would have on medical technology. Purchasing decisions will be based on need, not want; product standardisation will increase. A Premier study shows that the majority of physicians will be using the same item in three years' time as they are now; for example, some 90% of physicians said they will require standard angioplasty catheters in 1998 compared with 35% now.</p><p>Device manufacturers were advised to make subtle incremental changes to products. They should also provide cost-effectiveness and outcomes data. Results of assessments and outcomes can be used to emphasise value. Outcomes measures drive choices in Canada, said Dr Jane Fulton who is leaving academia (University of Ottawa where she lectures on health policy and management) to enter politics. She noted an increase in private delivery of healthcare and the entry of US HMOs into Canada.</p><p>Europe tries to keep costs down</p><p>Changes taking place in Germany are considered to have some parallels with the US system (see Clinica Supplement to issue No 660). Insurers have a strong influence on hospital and doctors' purchasing decisions. As in the US, the fee-for-service reimbursement system is moving toward capitation, noted Martin Jordan of consultants MTC Europe.</p><p>This year an optional system was introduced for hospitals to be reimbursed on a procedure basis rather than a per diem rate. Reimbursement rates for 64 DRGs, covering 29 illnesses and 140 operations have been published (see Clinica No 660, p 3). The new system provides greater transparency, said Werner Sipp, head of the general health policy division at the Federal Ministry of Health. Key features are cost-effectiveness, shorter hospital stays and profits for hospitals.</p><p>Germany is not alone in reducing healthcare budgets - European countries are all attempting to contain costs and Mr Jordan noted that products designed around reimbursement systems are more likely to succeed. This implies an understanding of the peculiarities of each healthcare system - not a straightforward task as exemplified by a summary of reimbursement systems in Europe provided by Victoria Dedrick, technical director of EUCOMED.</p><p>Compulsory contribution health insurance systems operate in countries such as Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Luxembourg, Norway and Austria. Private insurance schemes run in parallel with the government system - in France, for example, over 80% of the population has private health insurance. Universal coverage is provided in Iceland, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, the UK and Ireland, primarily funded by taxation.</p><p>Germany has a complex system whereby universal coverage is provided through a mix of public and private healthcare. Switzerland and the Netherlands also have mixed funding. The latter is undergoing a shift toward global budgets with incentives for efficiency, basic benefits and reliance on managed competition.</p><p>Japan & Australia</p><p>Population demographics pose specific problems for certain countries, but can provide opportunities for medtech companies which adapt their product portfolio to match market needs. In Japan, for example, the elderly and home healthcare markets are growth areas. The country's rapidly ageing population will put a financial strain on the National Medical Care Expenditure (NME), warned Kenichi Matsumoto, chairman of the Japan Federation of Medical Device Associations. The index for elderly care expenditure is projected to escalate to 973 by 2025 (1993=100), accounting for 40% of the total NME budget of $1,100,000 million.</p><p>In Australia, the government has set a target of achieving 60% of surgical procedures on an outpatient basis within five years. Australia's healthcare expenditure of Aus$40,000 million is almost 9% of GDP, according to Sheriff Valance of the Medical Industry Association of Australia. The government contributes 68%, with the private sector funding the remainder. Hospitals account for 41.5% of expenditures.</p>
