		<p>The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.</p>

		<p>"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz," he said, shaking his head in perplexity.  "He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant."</p>

		<p>"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the Scarecrow; "it is important.  And we have been told that Oz is a good Wizard."</p>

		<p>"So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well.  But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face.  I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must take you to his Palace.  But first you must put on the spectacles."</p>

		<p>"Why?" asked Dorothy.</p>

		<p>"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you.  Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day.  They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them."</p>

		<p>He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape.  All of them had green glasses in them.  The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes.  There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck.  When they were on, Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.</p>

		<p>Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.</p>

		<p>Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace.  Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.</p>

		<p>Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds.  They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun.  The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.</p>
