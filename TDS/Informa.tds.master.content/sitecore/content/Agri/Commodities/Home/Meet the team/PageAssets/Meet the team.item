            <p>Alexandra has more than 20 years' experience covering pharmaceutical and biotech R&amp;D. An early interest in medicine, and a dawning realization that being a doctor was not for her, led to a degree in Biochemistry and Microbiology at the University of Leeds, and a move to London to pursue a career in medical journalism. Now Scrip's Managing Editor, Alex has held a variety of roles on the publication since starting as a science reporter in 1998. She instigated some of Scrip's signature features, such as the Pipeline Watch and New Active Substance lists, and also casts an editorial eye over the annual Scrip Awards. Alex's main work interests lie in novel drugs and pharmaceutical and biotech R&amp;D, and she also enjoys medical history and current affairs.</p>
