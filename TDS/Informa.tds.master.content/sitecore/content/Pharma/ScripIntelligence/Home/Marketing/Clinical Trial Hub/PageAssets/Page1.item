"Pharma is throwing the term precision medicine around but it still doesn't really understand what it will take to achieve it," according to the world's first chief precision medicine officer, BERG Health's Michael Kiebish. BERG is combining artificial intelligence and systems biology to analyze stacks of biological data.

Having clinical trial endpoints that are pragmatic and doable and a clear understanding of what the goalposts are for winning the FDA's approval to get a drug on the market will help decrease the uncertainty and drive investment, said Rakesh Marwah of Palo Alto Investors LLC, a Silicon Valley health care investment firm.

Authorities in England are viewing life-extending medicines as "simple commodities like groceries", says Wim Souverijns, general manager of Celgene UK & Ireland. Without a change in attitude, and if plans for a new Cancer Drugs Fund go ahead, companies could decide to relocate their studies from England, although plans for devolution could provide a chink of light for companies, says Souverijns.

An Indian government panel has recommended waiving large-scale local clinical trials for a dengue fever vaccine from Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine arm of France's Sanofi, in a proposal that could hasten the product's release in the country by at least two years.

The situation for clinical trials at the execution level in China is very different from that in developed countries, given that sites are in hospitals and must be GCP-certified by the China FDA. Due to the limitations of study professionals, site management organizations have emerged as the solution to serve the rapidly increasing number of trials in the country following health care and regulatory reforms.

</p>

<p>Demonstrating the efficacy, safety and  differential benefit of a new drug relies on collecting and analyzing enormous  amounts of data generated in a clinical trial. Yet this process of extracting  knowledge from data is often the source of many inefficiencies. </p>
<p>We recently spoke with Dimitris Agrafiotis,  PhD, Vice President and Chief Data Officer at Covance to hear his thoughts on  how informatics has affected drug development and will continue to transform  the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p><b>Q: Why  is informatics important in a global context? </b></p>
<p>More and more major businesses and  industries are being run on software and delivered as online servicesâ€•from  movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners of this new  economy are Silicon Valley-style technology companies that are invading and  overturning established industry structures.</p>
<p>Even in aspects of our daily lives, the  dramatic impact of data and software is evident. As Marc Andreessen, the famed  software engineer and Silicon Valley entrepreneur, argued in a 2011 <i>WSJ</i> article &ldquo;Why Software Is Eating the  World,&rdquo; software and online services are disrupting every aspect of our global  economy. </p>
<p>I believe drug development will follow a  similarly predictable path. &ldquo;Peopleware&rdquo; will be increasingly replaced by  software and much of the cost and inefficiency of the current model will be  eliminated through more widespread adoption of digital technologies.</p>
<p><b>Q:  How does informatics support the conduct of efficient clinical trials?</b></p>
<p>I think of informatics as the art and  science of extracting insights from data. Similarly, this is the ultimate goal  of every rigorous and highly controlled clinical trial. From improved data  collection through mobile devices and biosensors to enhanced patient  recruitment, engagement and outreach through social media, along with more  widespread use of genomic data for personalized therapies and improved  assessment and mitigation of risk, informatics can and will play a large role  in clinical trials. </p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry, which has been  stubbornly recalcitrant to digital transformation, is about to be disrupted in  a profound and irreversible way. </p>
<p><b>Q: What  role can informatics play in data management, analysis and integration in a  clinical trial?</b></p>
<p>Often, clinical data is collected in a  variety of ways via a multitude of systems that are not designed to work with  each other. The same type of activity, such as data cleansing and  reconciliation, requires separate and duplicative processes, which introduce  unnecessary risk, cost and complexity. Worse still, the data is not  standardized from one trial to another, making it impossible to aggregate and  compare it across multiple trials, phases and/or compounds. </p>
<p>Informatics-based technologies can  integrate all the disparate data collected during the course of a clinical  trial, detect and correct critical errors in that data, standardize it to  conform to established data standards and deliver it to clinical teams in a way  that allows them to make informed decisions. </p>
<p>Our industry needs an effective clinical  data integration platform that can integrate, standardize and aggregate data  collected from any conceivable source system in real time along with the &ldquo;apps&rdquo;  that bring this data to life and make it usable by people who don&rsquo;t have  advanced computer skills. </p>
<p><b>Q:  How is informatics currently being employed to improve clinical trial  performance? </b></p>
<p>At Covance, we recognized that the model  for clinical development must change. We developed the XcellerateÂ®  Informatics platform, a technology solution to transform clinical trial conduct  by optimizing enrollment, integrating and delivering near real-time data and facilitating  collaboration between teams for more efficient trial management. </p>
<p>For example,  Xcellerate Forecasting &amp; Site Selection gathers data from more than 40% of  global clinical trial investigator performance data and taps into de-identified  health information with over 70 million patients. This information allows us  and our sponsors to assess the impact of laboratory inclusion and exclusion  criteria, identify pockets of potential eligible de-identified patients, their  primary care physicians and centers, enabling the efficient design and  effective execution of our clinical trials.</p>
<p>Xcellerate Trial Management integrates all critical  trial data to keep sponsors up to speed on enrollment results and trial  execution in near real time for informed decision making. Another solution  within our Informatics Platform, Xcellerate Insights, enables an integrated  view of all relevant operational metrics through a single-entry portal to facilitate  secure collaboration between Covance and sponsor project teams. </p>
<p><b>Q: What  role does informatics play in greater clinical trial safety?</b></p>
<p>While informatics can help optimize the  planning and execution of clinical trials, we can also leverage clinical trial  data to ensure data quality, patient safety and protocol compliance. Part of  our Xcellerate Informatics platform includes Xcellerate® Monitoring,  a tool designed to centralize and integrate all clinical trial data. </p>
<p>Supported by efficient and intuitive  workflows, users can view advanced analytics, browse holistic performance data  and proactively mitigate trial risks before they become crises. With several companies  already running Xcellerate Monitoring, it&rsquo;s been very exciting to witness how  informatics is optimizing performance in clinical trials.</p>
