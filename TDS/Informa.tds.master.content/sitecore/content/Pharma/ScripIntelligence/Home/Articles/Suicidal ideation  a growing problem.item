<p> For over a decade there has been considerable concern about drugs that can cause suicidal ideation as a side-effect, particularly antidepressants. </p> <p> The problem gained attention back in 2003, when the FDA issued a warning against the use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) Paxil (GlaxoSmithKline&rsquo;s paroxetine) in children and adolescents after a meta-analysis indicated that the drug increased the risk of suicide and suicidal thoughts in this population. Although a follow-up review of 20 placebo-controlled trials comparing eight antidepressant drugs with placebo found no reports of suicide, the agency said that an increased risk could not be ruled out, and it issued a general warning to doctors that antidepressants could increase suicidal behaviour in paediatric patients. </p> <p> In fact, concern about the risk of suicidal behaviour in patients taking antidepressants dated back to the beginning of the 1990s, when Lilly sent a &ldquo;Dear Doctor&rdquo; letter to psychiatrists in the UK warning about a possible association between the SSRI Prozac (fluoxetine) and violent or suicidal behaviour. </p> <p> After that, the problem seemed to escalate. Early in 2004, the FDA asked the manufacturers of ten antidepressant products to add a bolded statement on their product labels advising physicians to pay close attention to their patients for signs of worsening depression, or the emergence of suicidal thinking and behaviour. The warning applied not just to SSRIs but to other antidepressants too. </p> <p> Then in 2005, concerns about suicidality spread to include anticonvulsants as well as antidepressants. The FDA requested 14 manufacturers of anti-epilepsy products to re-examine their clinical trial data to see whether there was any evidence of drug-induced suicide and/or suicidality. The request was made after an analysis of clinical trial databases relating to marketed anticonvulsants had suggested an increased risk, and the receipt of a number of reports of suicidal behaviour from a personal injury lawyer who was trying to get the labelling changed for one product in particular. </p> <p> At the same time, the risk of suicidality in adults taking antidepressants also came under scrutiny, and at the end of the year the FDA ordered Lilly to place a suicidality warning on the labelling for its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder product, Strattera (atomoxetine). Other products about which suspicions were raised included Pfizer&rsquo;s smoking cessation treatment, Chantix (varenicline). Most recently, there have been reports from Japan of suicides among adults taking Tamiflu (oseltamivir). </p> <p> Now a study from China reported in the WHO Bulletin claims to have confirmed an association between suicidal thoughts and exposure to organophosphorus insecticides. The study, performed by doctors from Zhejiang Provincial Tongde Hospital in Hangzhou, China and the Institute of Psychiatry in the UK, was carried out in a densely populated coastal province of China. It found that people who stored pesticides in their homes, and who therefore presumably had higher exposure, were more likely to report recent suicidal thoughts. </p> <p> The study also found a link between suicidal thoughts and the ease with which insecticides were available. </p> <p> Organophosphorus compounds have been known for many years to be highly toxic, which is why they are banned in many countries. They are potent, irreversible inhibitors of cholinesterase, which is the mechanism of their lethal effects on insects, and also explains why some nerve gases are organophosphates. In addition, they can also have a delayed neurotoxic effect. They were first linked to an increased risk of suicide about ten years ago. </p> <p> On the face of it, there seems little to link organophosphorus insecticides with antidepressants, anticonvulsants and other types of drug other than their capacity to induce suicidal feelings. It is almost as if there were an &lsquo;epidemic&rsquo; of suicidal thoughts and behaviour. But whether there is indeed a common mechanism shared by all these classes of compound is as yet unknown. </p> <p> What these findings do suggest, however, is two things. First, perhaps it would be prudent to monitor Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients treated with cholinesterase inhibitors for depression. Depression frequently co-exists with dementia, and some studies have shown an association between Alzheimer&rsquo;s and suicide risk. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and depression share many of the same symptoms, so it can be difficult to tell whether a particular Alzheimer&rsquo;s patient is depressed. On the other hand, the fact that many Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients are institutionalised should facilitate monitoring to some extent. </p> <p> Second, the findings demonstrate once again that postmarketing studies play a vital role in the discovery of rare side-effects of marketed drugs. Even products that have been on the market for some time still need to be monitored, as unpleasant surprises have a habit of occurring. </p>
