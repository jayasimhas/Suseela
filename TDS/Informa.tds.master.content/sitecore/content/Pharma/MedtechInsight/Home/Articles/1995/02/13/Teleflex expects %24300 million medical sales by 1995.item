<p>Teleflex, the US aerospace, automotive and medical group, expects its 1995 revenues to rise to about $900 million, with medical sales accounting for about a third.</p><p>Teleflex' medical division turnover comprises 10% from OEM sales; 45% from Rusch International's hospital supply sales; and 45% from Pilling Weck's surgical devices, according to data presented to an analysts meeting last year.</p><p>Edward Weck, now part of Pilling Weck, was bought for $64 million from <strong>[C#198601245:Bristol-Myers Squibb]</strong> in late 1993. This is the latest in an acquisition drive that began in 1985, following Teleflex' decision to "focus on a very specific market niche: plastic and latex entry devices ... of the type that stay in body for fewer than 30 days," according to CEO Lennox Black.</p><p>Teleflex has high ambitions for its medical business. "Our objective is to increase annual revenues by 20% excluding major acquisitions and to increase operating profits at a higher rate than revenues," Teleflex Medical's president Richard Woodfield told analysts.</p><p>medical divisions</p><p>The OEM revenues are from the original medical extrusion business, derived from manufacturing for such customers as Deseret, US Surgical and Ethicon. About 60% of sales stem from the US and 40% from Europe.</p><p>Half of Rusch International's products are for anaesthesiology and respiratory care, half for urology. Most sales come from outside the US. "Another way in which the business is balanced is that 50% of the product line is reusable, 50% disposable", Mr Woodfield said.</p><p>Pilling Weck's sales are largely concentrated in the US. "Pilling has a broad-based surgical instruments line, but a small share of the clip market. Weck innovated the ligation clip and has a large market share," says Pilling Weck's vice-president Ervin Portman. Some 54% of Pilling Weck's 8,000 products are reusable.</p><pre>Pilling Weck's product mix Specialty instruments 30% Ligation 27% MIS, stapling, electrosurgery, others 23% General instruments 20%</pre>
