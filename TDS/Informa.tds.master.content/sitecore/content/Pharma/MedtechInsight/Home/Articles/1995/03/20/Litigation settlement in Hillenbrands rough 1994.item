<p>Hillenbrand Industries describes 1994 as a rough year after previously good earnings growth was hit by a hefty litigation settlement. On a positive note, the US healthcare and funeral group, merged its two largest healthcare subsidiaries and began to see a turnaround in another, Block Medical.</p><p>The acquisition of L & C Arnold in February 1994 - now Hillenbrand's German subsidiary - supported the Indiana-based company's sales in fiscal 1994, a period which saw 6% healthcare sales growth compared with the previous year. Another contribution to this growth came from increased therapy rental beds in use in the long-term care and homecare markets, Hillenbrand says in its annual report. Offsetting these gains was a drop in electric bed shipments, especially in the US acute care market.</p><pre>Hillenbrand's annual results ($ millions) 1994 1993 change Healthcare 924.09 875.70 6% Funeral services 652.94 572.22 14% Total revenues 1,577.03 1,447.91 9% Net income 89.46 145.82 (ended Dec 3rd, 1994; Nov 27th, 1993)</pre><p>Hillenbrand's net income was depressed by an $84.8 million cash payment in a September settlement of a patent infringement suit brought by Kinetic Concepts and a $14 million goodwill write-off related to the acquisition of Block Medical. Excluding the settlement costs, healthcare operating profit was down 2%; total operating profit excluding these costs was 4% higher than in 1993.</p><p>products</p><p>Healthcare subsidiary Block Medical, manufacturer of portable disposable and ambulatory electronic infusion pumps for homecare patients, fitted its Verifuse electronic ambulatory pump with the VoiceLink communication system. This allows a pharmacist to check the pump status or change its protocols via the telephone.</p><p>Among Hill-Rom's, the other healthcare subsidiary, newly introduced products, is a home-version of its Clinitron air fluidised therapy for the relief of pain through minimising shearing and friction. Clinitron At-Home is smaller, weighs about 40% less than the hospital version and can be set up in less than an hour. Rental of the unit is fully reimbursable in the US under Medicare Part B for patients with severe pressure sores, wounds and postsurgical flaps.</p><p>Hill-Rom also introduced the Efica CC Dynamic Air Therapy unit, designed to treat the complications of patients' immobility, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Hill-Rom's French subsidiary, Le Couviour, began manufacturing the Evolution bed which is now provided in both washable and non-washable models. At the German subsidiary, L & C Arnold, sales force and distribution system were restructured during 1994.</p>
