<p>Epilepsy and migraine may be linked, according to a study in Neurology (November). Researchers from Columbia School of Public Health and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine evaluated 1,957 patients with epilepsy and 1,423 relatives in the largest-ever study of the link between migraine and epilepsy. More than 20% of those with epilepsy also suffered from migraine, compared with 11% in the general population but less than half had been diagnosed by the patients' own GPs.</p>

<p>Epilepsy and migraine may be linked, according to a study in Neurology (November). Researchers from Columbia School of Public Health and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine evaluated 1,957 patients with epilepsy and 1,423 relatives in the largest-ever study of the link between migraine and epilepsy. More than 20% of those with epilepsy also suffered from migraine, compared with 11% in the general population but less than half had been diagnosed by the patients' own GPs.</p><p>The report's author, Professor Ruth Ottman says clinicians treating migraine or epilepsy should be sensitive to the symptoms and familiar with diagnostic practices. Co-author Dr Richard Lipton points out that antidepressants and antinausea drugs prescribed for migraine can lower seizure thresholds.</p>
