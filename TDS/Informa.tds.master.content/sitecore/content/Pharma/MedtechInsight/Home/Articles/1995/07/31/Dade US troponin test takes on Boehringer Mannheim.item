<p>Dade (US) launched its Stratus cardiac troponin-I assay at the annual meeting of the AACC (Anaheim, July 16th-20th). FDA clearance was granted on July 14th, after a two-and-a-half month review.</p><p>The fluorometric enzyme immunoassay is intended for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cardiac Troponin-I (<strong>[C#201200579:TnI]</strong>) rises to clinically significant levels four to eight hours after the onset of myocardial ischaemia and is not affected by skeletal muscle damage or renal insufficiency. The Dade assay has an analysis time of approximately 10 minutes, which allows the reporting of STAT results in as little as 30 minutes.</p><p>However, TnI is not the only cardiac-specific marker on the US market. Boehringer Mannheim received clearance for its troponin-T (TnT) test in May 1994 and a 20-minute, bedside version is under FDA review. But Dade says its assay is superior because Boehringer's T test takes 90 minutes and suffers from an unacceptably high false-positive rate - a claim Boehringer Mannheim hotly denies.</p><p>too sensitive?</p><p>So why are so many renal disease patients TnI-negative but TnT- positive? Boehringer Mannheim points to the links between kidney disease and cardiovascular damage and says that TnT is a genuine sign of myocardial damage.</p><p>Two-thirds of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is due to diabetes and hypertension, both of which contribute to cardiovascular disease, and dialysis is also associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. As many as 88% of ESRD patients have coronary artery stenosis and between 30 and 60% of dialysis patients have silent ischaemia by Holter ECG. About half of all dialysis patients die as a result of MI and other cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>Dr Paul Collinson, a UK clinical chemist who has been working with TnT for some time, says: "Detectable cardiac TnT may represent unsuspected myocardial damage." Dr Collinson's laboratory has previously shown that a significant number of TnT-positive patients who do not have AMI as defined by WHO criteria, go on to die from a subsequent, confirmed heart attack.</p><p>Dade says a combination of TnI and myoglobin testing eliminates the need for total CK, CK-MB and LD isoenzyme assays. Boehringer Mannheim is more cautious and believes that TnT testing should be combined with CK-MB for maximum diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>The recommendation follows research presented at the AACC which found that 30% of patients with high CK-MB but normal TnT were at high risk of heart attack. The study, presented by Dr Sol Green from New York's Bronx Lebanon Hospital, also found that 70% of patients with elevated TnT but normal CK-MB had a high risk of adverse cardiac events. About a quarter of cardiac profiles showed discordant results for CK-MB and cardiac TnT - mostly elevated troponin and normal CK-MB.</p><p>TnT can also predict which unstable angina patients are more likely to experience heart attacks and other adverse cardiac events, according to a study presented by Dr Collinson. Stratification, and revascularisation of appropriate cases could save money, says Dr Collinson, who is director of clinical pathology at Mayday University Hospital, in Thornton Heath, Surrey.</p><p>most popular item on the menu</p><p>Dade points to the overwhelming popularity of the TnI test on other manufacturers' systems. No one except Boehringer Mannheim uses TnT. That is because the patent is so strong and the rights held so closely, counters Boehringer. In fact the company does plan to offer the test formatted for other companies' equipment. First though is a 15-minute version for one of its own random access analysers, which should become available some time in 1996. The current TnT assay takes 90 minutes on the ES 300.</p>
