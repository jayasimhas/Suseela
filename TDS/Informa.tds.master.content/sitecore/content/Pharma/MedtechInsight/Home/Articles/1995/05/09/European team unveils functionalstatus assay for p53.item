<p>Researchers in France and Switzerland have developed a functional-status assay for the tumour suppressor protein p53. Normal p53 prevents genetic instability, which is not only important in cancer susceptibility but also for a positive response to radiation therapy.</p>

<p>Researchers in France and Switzerland have developed a functional-status assay for the tumour suppressor protein p53. Normal p53 prevents genetic instability, which is not only important in cancer susceptibility but also for a positive response to radiation therapy.</p><p>The test, which is reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (April 25th), involves extraction of RNA from clinical samples, reverse transcription and amplification by PCR. The amplified DNA is inserted into yeast cells which form white colonies if the p53 protein is functioning normally and red ones if it is not. The researchers point out that since the assay tests the critical biological function of p53, it can distinguish inactivating mutations from functionally silent defects.</p><p>Peripheral blood lymphocytes, tumours and cell lines can all be tested using the "simple convenient functional assay", say the researchers. However they admit it does have some drawbacks. The test requires high quality RNA if the entire mutation-prone region is to be tested in one step, which precludes the use of most pathology specimens. The test is also unable to detect large deletions or poorly expressed mutant alleles.</p><p>Nevertheless the new technique has a significant advantage over the HIS3 assay. As well as being able to detect temperature-sensitive mutations, the absence of a replica plating step means that large numbers of samples and many clones of each sample can be tested more easily, say the researchers.</p><p>OncorMed (US) is currently using the functional assay as a predisposition test for Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The company also conducts prognosis of metastasis for surgical cancer patients, using TumourCheck, a p53 test developed by Dr David Sidransky's group at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Maryland. The Li-Fraumeni test is performed under Institutional Review Board informed consent approval. More than 51 types of tumours have been shown to contain aberrant p53 and about half of all cases of diagnosed cancer have mutation.</p>
