<p>The US FDA is committed to implementing a pilot medical device external review programme this autumn, according to the CDRH's Office of Science & Technology. Talking to an FDA workshop on June 19th, Stephen Sykes, assistant director for biomedical programmes at the Office, said that the agency has three potential models for the scheme and "we hope to hear of many more models today".</p><p>The voluntary, two-year programme would allow third-party review of applications for low- or moderate-risk Class I and Class II devices. Any applications requiring clinical data would be excluded. Additionally, the agency emphasised, external reviewers could only recommend action - the FDA would make the final decisions. Mr Sykes estimates that five hundred 510(k)s would be reviewed under the yearly programme. He anticipates that manufacturers would pay the reviewers directly.</p><p>mini-FDA</p><p>The first of the three models envisages a "mini-FDA" performing the same review functions as the agency under FDA-written guidelines for each type of product, says Mr Sykes. The second model relies on "third-party certification" that identified standards have been met - "like the European system". However, both of these programmes suffer from certain statutory difficulties, says Mr Sykes - the laws concerning confidential information and power of outside groups would have to be changed.</p><p>The third model would eliminate the confidential information problem but has a much narrower scope. Reviewers could only consider 510(k)s for modification of an existing device - only products from the manufacturer of the predicate device would be eligible.</p><p>having doubts</p><p>Although industry has long sought external review, it is now questioning the benefits. External reviewers must be trained, one presenter said. "Who will pay for that? Will FDA advisors be taking time away (from reviewing other applications)? Will we pay extra for expedited review? If the FDA has the resources to fund training of external reviewers, why not just hire more FDA reviewers?"</p><p>Some feared the system might be excessively expensive, especially for small manufacturers. The Medical Device Manufacturers Association suggested "complete elimination of all Class I premarket notification", instead of external review. HIMA urged the FDA to consider drawing on emerging US accreditation programmes such as those under the National Institute of Standards & Technology. + calling to account</p><p>Third-party testing organisations were obviously eager to participate in the pilot programme, an FDA official noted. "The question is the price range and time it will take outside reviewers" to complete their tasks. FDA personnel were concerned that "this is the thin end of the wedge". "Privatisation and public accountability are riding on this experiment, and I am not sure public accountability can be measured," one said.</p><p>However, the mood was generally optimistic - both in industry and the FDA. "I think we could work with any of the three models," one CDRH official said. "The only question I have is the creation of guidelines" for the 500 devices identified for external review.</p>
