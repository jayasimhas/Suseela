<p>Most European countries now have medtech agencies. The first in Spain was set up in Barcelona in 1991.</p><p>"The future of technology evaluation lies in international collaboration," says Josep Espinas, head of Information at the Catalonian medtech assessment agency, AATM. As part of an unprecedented global evaluation, the agency is taking part in a worldwide study of osteoporosis. The project is the first of its kind where a large number of centres are simultaneously evaluating the same procedures. The final conclusions are to be published soon, says the AATM.</p><p>Until recently, assessment bodies in different countries tended to work on their own, evaluating the same technologies in different ways. This, according to Alicia Granados, director of AATM, has meant many technologies in daily use have never been formally assessed. However, the situation is changing. Since the early 1990s, there has been a strong movement towards harmonisation of assessment resources between nations. European centres especially have become more integrated with better dissemination of information.</p><p>AATM is a founding member of the International Network of Agencies of Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). It is on the executive committee of the European EUR-ASSESS project (see Clinica No 633, p 3). It also participates at the biennial ISTAHC technology assessment conference, last held in June in Stockholm; the EU-backed intensive care unit project, EURICUS-1; and the Telematics Applications Programme's Technology Assessment in Telemedicine (TASTE).</p><p>The economic evaluation of medical technology has become an integral part of healthcare provision. Since cost benefits are of increasing importance to any new technology and are used in any comparative study, assessment agencies' findings are indispensable to decision-makers at all levels, says the Catalonian agency.</p><p>Mrs Granados believes technological development has a double- edged effect on healthcare expenditure: it increases both the number of available procedures and the number of patients that can benefit from the advantages of techniques potentially less aggressive than conventional procedures. It also enables treatment of illnesses which were not curable before. Since decision-making is now closely linked to financial outcome, cost analyses are invariably integral parts of any report, says Dr Espinas. They can then be used to measure the efficiency of health spending.</p><p>The AATM evaluates all types of medical technology, including diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitation equipment. It is a non-profit-making, public company linked to the Catalonian Health Authorities (SCS) and funded partly by them. The agency works for both public and private companies as well as carrying out assessment for hospitals, health insurers and industry.</p><p>The agency had several precursors in Catalonia, beginning with the Comissio Assessora d'Alt Tecnologia in 1984, which was set up in response to the "continued scientific progress in medicine and the need to base decision-making on objective and independent information", says AATM's review.</p><p>The CAAT became the OTATM in 1991, evaluating low- and high-tech technologies, as well as new technologies, and subsequently became the Agencia d'Avaluacio de Tecnologia Medica in 1994. Indeed, the Catalonian authorities usurped their national counterparts by creating the evaluation agency several years before central government had defined a workable structure.</p><p>AATM publishes on average 10-15 assessment reports a year, most of which are available for public scrutiny by application to the agency. Projects proposed can vary from a brief report to several months' work. The assessment is carried out by agency staff and by external experts. Projects developed in the last year include cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative breast cancer screening programmes in Catalonia; assessment of surgical risks in patients undergoing extracorporeal cardiac surgery; and an analysis of utilisation patterns of MRI and up-keep of the MRI register in Catalonia.</p><p>accurate profile</p><p>The agency aims to provide objective, independent information (based on scientific evidence) which gives an accurate profile of the techniques or products under assessment.</p><p>The AATM's objectives are:</p><p>* to assess the consequences, in terms of efficacy, safety, effectiveness and cost of the introduction, adoption, and use of health technology by reviewing all available scientific evidence and information;</p><p>* to analyse the diffusion and use patterns of health technology with the greatest impact on the health care system in terms of health outcomes or economic cost as well as access, potential demand and appropriate use;</p><p>* to promote research specifically designed to generate information which facilitates the process of health technology assessment by encouraging collaboration between medical societies, universities, research centres, companies and other institutions;</p><p>* to formulate recommendations for the appropriate use of health technology; and</p><p>* to aid hospital decision-makers in the strategic investment plans for the acquisition of health technology.</p><p>While the Catalonian agency is not linked directly to the Spanish Health Ministry's agency (AETS) at the Carlos III Institute, they do meet periodically. In common with many Spanish institutions, the country is becoming increasingly decentralised and regional authorities are opening their own assessment agencies. Regular meetings are also held between the AATM and the Basque Country's agency.</p>
