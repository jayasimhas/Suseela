<p>The Italian medical devices and diagnostics industry has been invited by the Social Affairs Committee at the Chamber of Deputies to comment on the text of the Italian reagent rental plan bill. A meeting was due to be held on March 14th to hear non-Parliamentary opinions on the text, which aims to provide a formal structure to the practice of giving laboratory instruments free of charge.</p><p>Following this meeting the bill is due to be voted on within the Committee. If a 80% majority is obtained it will be converted into law, probably during May, without having to come before the Chamber and Senate. Otherwise, the bill may not become law for a couple of years.</p><p>Industry is anxiously awaiting the approval of the text. Many magistrates are interrogating companies and putting together cases against them based on the use of the reagent rental plans. Although it is unlikely that others will be jailed for this practice, as was the case in Palermo (see Clinica Nos 621, pp 1-2 and 625, p 3), the situation is still tense.</p>
