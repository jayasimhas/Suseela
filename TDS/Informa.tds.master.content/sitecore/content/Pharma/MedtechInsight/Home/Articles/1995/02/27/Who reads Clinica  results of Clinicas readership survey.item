<p>The results of Clinica's readership survey carried out in October last year highlight the diverse and fragmented nature of the world devices and diagnostics market. Of the 260 companies which participated in the survey, 46% are exclusively engaged in medical device manufacture and 17% are exclusively diagnostic producers.</p><p>Manufacturers and distributors account for 81% of the readership. Other activities include: services (consultancies, contract research) (9%); biotechnology (4%); intermediates suppliers, research organisations, government/regulatory bodies, trade associations and financial institutions (8%).</p><p>Within those categories, the fields of interest cover a broad range of subjects.</p><pre>Medical interests of Clinica readers* IVDs 93 Endoscopy 39 Cardiology 78 Imaging 39 Disposables 73 Drug delivery 35 Prostheses/orthopaedics 67 Respiratory/patient Catheters 60 monitoring 35 Electromedical 45 IV/dialysis 29 Woundcare 43 Ophthalmology 20 Surgical instruments 42 Dental equipment 19 * no of respondents (some have more than one interest)</pre><p>Marketing far outstrips all other functions of Clinica's readers: 104 respondents (40%) identified marketing as their sole responsibility, with a further nine listing it as one of their main roles. In all, 72 respondents are engaged in corporate management and 47 cited regulatory affairs as their main function.</p><p>In order to help us meet the needs of this broad readership, we sought opinion on the editorial content and coverage of Clinica. While the conciseness and timeliness of reporting and its international perspective are cited most frequently as "most liked" features of the newsletter, it seems readers cannot have too much market data. We will endeavour to include more market statistics and each quarter we will be producing a round-up of facts and figures published in the previous three months.</p><p>The Feature Supplements published in the past 18 months have generally been favourably received and the intention is to produce more. In order to address specific market sectors in more depth, we plan to publish more frequent feature supplements on a range of topics.</p><p>Next week's issue will include a four-page supplement on the impact of DNA amplification on clinical diagnostics. Other topics which will be covered in the next 10 months include: orthopaedics; Clinica's 1994 league table of the leading 100 medtech companies; reimbursement issues in Germany; an update on implementation of the European medical device directives; woundcare; and Latin America.</p><p>We would like to thank all those subscribers who responded to our survey. Your comments have been helpful in identifying readers' needs.</p>
