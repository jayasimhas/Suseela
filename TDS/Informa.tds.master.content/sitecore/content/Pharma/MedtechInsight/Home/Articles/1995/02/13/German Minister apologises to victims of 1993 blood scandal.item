<p>German Health Minister Horst Seehofer has apologised to the victims of HIV-infected blood transfusions. The Minister said during a Bundestag debate that he "apologised in the name of the federal republic for the federal authorities' mistakes". The statement comes after the publication by an investigative committee of a report on the 1993 blood scandal (see Clinica No 585, pp 10-11). The report says 60% of the HIV infections could have been avoided if the parties responsible had reacted promptly. Only 800 of the 2,000 patients infected are still alive, according to SPD politician Horst Schmidbauer.</p>

<p>German Health Minister Horst Seehofer has apologised to the victims of HIV-infected blood transfusions. The Minister said during a Bundestag debate that he "apologised in the name of the federal republic for the federal authorities' mistakes". The statement comes after the publication by an investigative committee of a report on the 1993 blood scandal (see Clinica No 585, pp 10-11). The report says 60% of the HIV infections could have been avoided if the parties responsible had reacted promptly. Only 800 of the 2,000 patients infected are still alive, according to SPD politician Horst Schmidbauer.</p><p>Mr Seehofer said during the debate that a final decision on a compensation fund for the victims would be reached by the end of March. The fund could total DM 700 million ($440 million) and would be 60% provided by the pharmaceuticals industry, 20% by the central government and 15% by the Lander. However, Mr Seehofer expressed regret that among the Lander only Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony had so far agreed to take part.</p>
