<p>Reporting Norbert Anselmann's presentation at a RAPS Conference in Barcelona, a recent article in Clinica (No 654, p 5), summarised several of the changes that were made to the April 1993 Working Document by the European Commission's published Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Although, as that article stated, the new Proposal does not differ significantly from the early draft and, mutatis mutandis, follows the content and structure of the two other medical devices directives, there are several matters on which changes have been made which are of considerable importance to manufacturers as well as to others involved. This article considers some of these matters.</p><p>Laboratory Products</p><p>The Commission's Proposal makes a welcome attempt in Article 1(2)(b) to enlighten the grey area surrounding the scope of the directive as regards IVD medical devices and laboratory products. It provides that products for general laboratory use are not within the scope of the directive unless, in view of their characteristics, they are specifically intended (claimed?) by their manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination.</p><p>Thus, for example, a standard laboratory pipette is not an IVD medical device because (if) its manufacturer does not specifically intend (recommend) it to be used for in vitro diagnostic examination. Moreover, even if a device manufacturer includes such a pipette in his diagnostic kit as a service item fully intending that pipette should be used with his kit, that pipette does not thereby become an "accessory" to the IVD device. To become an "accessory" for the purposes of Article 1(2)(c), it is the intention of the manufacturer of the service item, not that of the diagnostic kit manufacturer, that is the determining factor.</p><p>The conclusion seems to be that, where the manufacturer of a laboratory product exhibits in the product literature no specific intention that it should be used for an in vitro diagnostic purpose or in an in vitro diagnostic examination, nothing anybody else (eg. the manufacturer of a diagnostic kit) does or says can turn that product into an IVD medical device or an accessory. This is unless, of course, he does or says something in relation to that product that brings him within the extended definition of "manufacturer" in Article 1(2)(f).</p><p>Authorised Representative</p><p>Article 10 of the Proposal contains a major change in that, in dealing with the "registration of the manufacturer", where the manufacturer does not have a registered place of business in a Member State, he must designate "an authorised representative" (as defined in Article 1(2)(g) to carry out that "registration" activity for him. No longer is there a reference to "persons responsible for placing them on the market".</p><p>Similarly, where the manufacturer is outside the Community*, the information supplied by the manufacturer on the label, or on the outer packaging, or in the instructions for use must include the name and address of the authorised representative as well as that of the manufacturer. This replaces the previous requirement which envisaged a variety of different persons names and addresses appearing in the supplied information.</p><p>These new provisions relating to authorised representatives will probably be welcomed both by the IVD industry and by competent authorities. This is because they not only clarify a very grey area, but also they eliminate the altogether surprising possibility existing under the early draft (and, indeed, under the Medical Devices Directive) that the authorised representative need not be established within the Community ("where neither the manufacturer nor his authorised representative are established in the Community ..." April 1993 Working Document, Annex 3 paragraph 2).</p><p>It is likely that the medical device industry will seek to have similar changes introduced into the Medical Devices Directive.</p><p>As Article 1(2)(g) implies, the name and address of the authorised representative is of importance to the competent authorities and other bodies involved with the manufacturer's obligations under the directive; they will normally be of little or no importance to the user. Thus, in reality, a manufacturer located outside the Community will normally need to include a third name and address in the information he supplies, namely that of his local marketing entity or distributor. However, since that is not a mandatory requirement, he will at least be free to provide that local name and address on the label, in the instructions for use or both as he chooses.</p><p>Unfortunately, considerable uncertainty continues to surround "the authorised representative". For example, can a manufacturer who is outside the Community appoint more than one authorised representative for different products or for different product categories? There seems to be no reason in principle why he should not, but on the other hand, it would seem wrong in principle for him to be able to appoint authorised representatives for the same products in different parts of the Community. It would seem wrong in principle, for example, for it to be possible for a foreign manufacturer to appoint its subsidiary in each Member State as its authorised representative.</p><p>The precise nature of the powers and responsibilities of the authorised representative have always been unclear both under the Medical Devices Directive as well as under earlier drafts of the IVD directive.</p><p>Unfortunately, the definition of "authorised representative" in the IVD directive proposal affords little clarification for it merely defines him as the person who "acts and may" (not must) "be addressed by authorities and bodies in the Community in substitution for the manufacturers with regard to the latter's obligations in accordance with this Directive". Does this mean that, when so "explicitly designated", the authorised representative is legally responsible for the fulfilment of all the "foreign" manufacturer's responsibilities under the directive? Or is it possible for the authorised representative to be entrusted by the manufacturer with the performance of only some of those obligations?</p><p>No doubt, national enforcement authorities will argue that the authorised representative is the "<strong>[C#198700592:alter]</strong> ego" of the manufacturer and, as such, responsible for any infringement of national (implementing) law for which the manufacturer would have been responsible had he been located in their territory.</p><p>On the other hand, the Commission's draft "Guide to the Implementation of the Community's Technical Regulations based on the Rules of the New Approach and the Global Approach" seems to envisage that the authorised representative may have a more limited role placed on him by the manufacturer. It states that: "The manufacturer delegates these tasks in writing to the authorised representative, spelling out the manufacturer's obligations under the directives for which he is delegating responsibility to his authorised representative".</p><p>As an earlier draft of the guide said, the delegated duties may be of "an administrative nature, eg preparing the file and forwarding it to the Competent Authority, applying for type examination, making the EC declaration etc".</p><p>Associated with the question of what are the powers and responsibilities of the authorised representative is the question, "what, if any, competence or qualifications must such a representative have?" There is no guidance on this in the directive and presumably it is a matter, at least initially, entirely between the manufacturer and the candidate representative. However, at the end of the day, it is unlikely to be a defence for an authorised representative charged with an infringement of some national implementing law that he did not have the requisite competence or qualifications which would have enabled him to prevent that infringement.</p><p>The whole matter of authorised representatives needs clarification in a guidance document.</p><p>Classification and Reclassification</p><p>Although, for the purposes of conformity assessment, earlier Commission drafts had distinguished between reagent products listed in Annex 2, IVD's for self-testing and all other IVD medical devices, the words "classification" and "reclassification" were not used. Indeed, they are still not used in the proposed text of the Directive itself, but they are used in the accompanying "Explanatory Memorandum" (page 15).</p><p>Nevertheless, despite this change of language, the Commission has maintained its approach to Annex 2. This is that it should, at the outset, contain only those IVD medical devices which are currently subject to a pre-market control in most, if not all, Member States. Modifications by addition or deletion should only be made at a later stage in the light of experience (eg. through medical device vigilance) and having regard to the criteria specified in Article 12.</p><p>In maintaining this approach, the Commission was well aware that various other IVD reagent products have been suggested for inclusion in Annex 2, but it seems to have taken the view that there is insufficient rationale or agreement for any of them to be included at this time.</p><p>The point could also be made that the content of Annex 2 is a highly technical matter involving the collation and evaluation of product specific or product category specific data. It is therefore altogether inappropriate in a "new approach" directive to embark upon a product specific classification. Such matters are more appropriate for determination at a later time by the Committee on Medical Devices on a detailed technical basis than by the Council and the European Parliament which are more concerned with the broader issues of public health.</p><p>While the industry supports the Commission's approach, in the context of any modification of Annex 2, it will seek to ensure that: relevant manufacturers have a full and proper opportunity of being heard; modifications are based only on valid and compelling data; and, where additions are in fact made to the Annex, manufacturers and Notified Bodies are given adequate time to adjust to the consequences of the change.</p><p>Ethics Governing Distribution</p><p>The Commission's Proposal contains the long awaited proposals for amending the Medical Devices Directive in relation to various materials of human and animal origin. These probably contentious proposals have no application to IVD medical devices because the latter are specifically excluded from the scope of that directive.</p><p>However, the provision in the April 1993 draft of the IVD directive relating to an IVD medical device that incorporates tissues or substances of human origin (such as, for example, some control materials) has been changed. As a result (existing or future) Member State national regulations relating to the "ethics governing distribution" as well as those relating to the "ethics of the collection" of such tissues or substances (Article 1(3)) are valid and enforceable.</p><p>Whatever may be included in the phrase "ethics governing distribution" (and it may be differently interpreted by Member States) the intended result seems to be that where a Member State has national laws prohibiting or restricting the sale and/or supply of products incorporating tissues or substances or human origin, those laws are not affected by the IVD directive. They can therefore be used to prohibit the free circulation in that Member State of an IVD medical device incorporating such a substance even if that product was lawfully manufactured from material lawfully collected and then lawfully placed on the market in another Member State and validly carried the CE marking.</p><p>In this context it has to be remembered that it is a labelling requirement (Annex 1, Section 13(4)(l)) that a device incorporating tissues of human origin or substances derived therefrom must carry a statement on its label to that effect.</p><p>This provision marks a serious limitation to the free movement philosophy especially as the use of materials of human origin (especially in a commercial context) is receiving increasing attention within Member States. That said, it has to be remembered that the Treaty of Rome itself recognises the "reserved sovereignty" rights of Member States in relation to "public morality public policy (ordre public).." (Article 36).</p><p>[The amendments proposed to be made to the Medical Devices Directive include the same change regarding "ethics governing distribution"].</p><p>Technical Documentation</p><p>A new paragraph 6 in Article 9 (Conformity Assessment Procedures) brings together various provisions which, in the previous drafts, were to be found under the heading "Administrative Provisions" in Annexes 3 to 8. While this change avoids unnecessary repetition (and on that account alone is to be welcomed) it is of much greater importance than that because it resolves (at least for IVD medical devices) the much discussed question as to where the technical documentation must be kept when the manufacturer is not established in the Community.</p><p>Article 9(6) makes it clear that the manufacturer has two obligations in this respect namely (a) to keep the declaration of conformity, the technical documentation etc and (b) to make that material available to national authorities for inspection purposes for a period of 5 years after the last product is manufactured. Where, however, the manufacturer is not established in the Community, "the obligation to make the aforementioned documentation available on request applies to his authorised representative ...".</p><p>Clearly, there is no requirement that that documentation should be kept available by the authorised representative within the Community. However, the authorised representative should ensure that he has enforceable contractual rights against a "foreign" manufacturer to produce the specified documentation to the requesting competent authority either directly or via the authorised representative.</p><p>Failure on the part of the manufacturer to fulfil such a request would almost certainly involve the authorised representative in an infringement of the national implementing legislation.</p><p>Registration of Manufacturers</p><p>Article 10 introduces two changes from the previous draft. The first seeks to give a better understanding of what is meant by "categories of devices" by adding the words "as defined in terms of common characteristics of technology and/or analytes".</p><p>The second is the introduction of the requirement that the procedures implementing this Article must be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2); in other words, Member States' procedures implementing this registration obligation must accord with a procedure that is yet to be developed but whose development will involve the Commission and the Committee on Medical Devices. Clearly, if the proposed registration procedure is to work satisfactorily for a Community-wide purpose, it is vital that the procedures adopted by its constituent parts (ie. that Member State competent authorities) are made as harmonious as possible.</p><p>While this use of the Article 7(2) procedure to bring about harmony where, otherwise, Member States may proceed along different lines, is to be welcomed, it will have no application at least as a matter of law, to an area in which already divergent Member State practices are creating difficulties for medical devices. That area relates to the requirements being developed by some Member States for quite extensive product information to be provided not as a pre-marketing so much as an immediate post-marketing notification requirement.</p><p>That Member States have the right, consistent with Community law, to require manufacturers (or their representatives) to provide information about products placed on their individual markets was recognised in a Council Minute on the Medical Devices Directive. However, the exercise of that right as envisaged by some Member States will create such bureaucratic, translation and other problems that the whole purpose of the medical device directives could be in great danger of being frustrated. The whole question and inter relationship of manufacturer registration under Article 10 and product notification in each Member State is in need of urgent attention for medical devices generally.</p><p>* Although the proposal refers to the Community, the Directive will apply to the EEA.</p><p>Gordon C Tuck is Principal Consultant with Medical Technology Consultants Europe Ltd.</p>
