<p>The US market for patient monitoring equipment is forecast to grow from $880.8 million in 1993 to $1,161 million by 2000 boosted by increased sales of multiparameter monitors, according to a new report. The availability of portable multiparameter systems and smaller, battery-operated models combined with the ability to use them for a number of applications is expected to increase sales from $500 million to over $680 million in the same period, according to a report by Frost & Sullivan.</p>

<p>The US market for patient monitoring equipment is forecast to grow from $880.8 million in 1993 to $1,161 million by 2000 boosted by increased sales of multiparameter monitors, according to a new report. The availability of portable multiparameter systems and smaller, battery-operated models combined with the ability to use them for a number of applications is expected to increase sales from $500 million to over $680 million in the same period, according to a report by Frost & Sullivan.</p><p>There is a shift in the use of monitoring away from the hospital critical care unit which is leading to cheaper and smaller systems. In addition, the integration of healthcare providers and their increased buying power has forced manufacturers to compete on price, the report says.</p><p>Another major growth area in the monitoring market is accessories, which includes temperature and pulse oximeter sensors and disposable electrodes. This market, which is less affected by the trends influencing monitor purchases, is forecast to grow by more than $100 million over the period.</p><pre>Total Patient Monitoring Market Revenue Forecasts (US) 1993-2000 Year Revenues Revenue ($ million) Growth Rate (%) 1993 880.8 0.2 1994 879.3 (0.2) 1995 913.9 3.9 1996 952.9 4.3 1997 997.5 4.7 1998 1,047.2 5.0 1999 1,100.3 5.1 2000 1,161.1 5.5 Compound Annual Growth Rate (1993-2000): 4.0% Source: Frost & Sullivan</pre><p>US Patient Monitoring Markets is available from Clinica Reports (ref CBS530) priced $2,195 (US orders) or $2,245/&pound;1,400/&yen;36,000 (orders outside the US) at 18/20 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey, TW10 6UA, UK.
