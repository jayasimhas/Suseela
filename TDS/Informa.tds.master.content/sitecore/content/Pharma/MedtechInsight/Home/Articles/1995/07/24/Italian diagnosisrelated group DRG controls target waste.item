<p>Providers will find it more difficult to exploit the Italian healthcare service in future. Controls are being introduced as part of the new diagnosis-related group (DRG) system making it easier for assessors to pinpoint waste or abuse of the system. A Health Ministry circular dated June 29th warns that databases which are to be updated with DRG-linked information will be scrutinised and any local anomalies investigated.</p>

<p>Providers will find it more difficult to exploit the Italian healthcare service in future. Controls are being introduced as part of the new diagnosis-related group (DRG) system making it easier for assessors to pinpoint waste or abuse of the system. A Health Ministry circular dated June 29th warns that databases which are to be updated with DRG-linked information will be scrutinised and any local anomalies investigated.</p><p>The controls will affect most local healthcare spending since Regions must allocate approximately 80% of their annual patient treatment budget to financing services covered by the DRGs - including those contracted out to the private sector. The remaining 20% is to be for specific projects such as emergency services, organ transplants and mental health.</p><p>Under the new system, local health authorities and the new hospital businesses are paid according to treatment-group tariffs that have either been set regionally (according to government criteria) or, failing this, by central government.</p><p>three tariff categories</p><p>The Ministry sets out three types of DRG tariff categories - ordinary hospital, day hospital and rehabilitation cases. In addition to tariffs for each DRG, there will be daily rates, so that when patient stays exceed the maximum specified for each DRG, the cost of the extra days can be included. There will also be separate DRGs for day cases, split according to whether they are surgical or medical cases, and for rehabilitation. Day surgery DRGs will be part of a package to include diagnostic tests, pre-operative visits, surgery and post-operative care.</p><p>funding equation</p><p>Funding for patient services must be based on the previous two years' expenditure. Healthcare services must assess the quantity of services they can offer in a year according to: anticipated funding; DRG tariffs; hospital bed ratio (set nationally at 4.5 beds per 1,000 population for acute cases (10% for day cases) and one per 1,000 for rehabilitation and post acute long stays); and the average bed occupancy rate per specialty.</p>
