<p>With the acquisitions undertaken last year as part of Instrumentarium's strategy to focus on healthcare, the Finnish group's healthcare sales should rise to 65% from 50%. Similarly, exports are expected to increase to 60% from 50% of group turnover.</p><p>The main acquisition - Engstrom Medical from Swedish-based Gambro last August (see Clinica No 618/19, p 23) - signals Instrumentarium's expansion into the intensive care sector by expanding its Dantex subsidiary's position in the anaesthesia and patient monitoring markets, the company says. It adds that this commitment was emphasised with Instrumentarium's entry into the critical care information management business with the acquisition of Finnish Clinisoft.</p><p>Instrumentarium's after-tax profits rose 39% to FMk 194 million ($44 million) in 1994 due to improved efficiency in most of its business units and partly offset by exchange rate changes. Group turnover increased 3% in 1994 with exports rising 10% to FMk 1,039 million or 52% of total sales.</p><p>Exports contributed 80% to healthcare turnover, which rose 11% compared with 1993. More than half of this increase was due to the Engstrom acquisition. Among Instrumentarium's other healthcare business units, sales of dental X-ray equipment grew well, especially in Japan, the company says. Sales of mammography equipment were buoyant in the US and Germany.</p><pre>Instrumentarium's 1994 results (FMk millions) Net sales Operating profit (loss) 1994 % change 1994 1993 Healthcare equipment 1,055 11% 134 210 Optical retail 362 0% 46 33 Catering equipment 158 (17%) 5 (9) Distribution 375 (10%) 24 29 Other 58 53% 27 (33) Total 2,008 3% 235 229 (ended Dec 31st)</pre>
