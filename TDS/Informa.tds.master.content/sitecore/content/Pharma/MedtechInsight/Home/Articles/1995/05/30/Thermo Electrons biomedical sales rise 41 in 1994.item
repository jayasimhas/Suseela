<p>Thermo Electron's total sales rose 27% in 1994 (see Clinica No 645, p 11) but growth has been different in the various segments, with one of the strongest performers its biomedical products division.</p><pre>Thermo Electron's 1994 sales by business segment (in $ millions) 1994 1993 % change Instruments (environmental monitoring and analytical instruments) 650.1 516.7 26% Biomedical products (biomedical materials, mammography & biopsy systems, skin-incision devices, blood coagulation-monitoring equipment, left ventricular assist devices, neurophysiology monitoring instruments) 180.3 127.5 41% Alternative-energy systems 285.4 242.7 18% Process equipment 189.9 167.5 13% Environmental services 141.8 122.0 16% Advanced technologies 142.7 76.3 87% Intersegment sales eliminations (4.8) (3.0) Total sales 1,585.3 1,249.7 27% (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Thermo Electron has followed a spin-out strategy for years. This has led to the parent holding majority stakes in companies ranging from instruments manufacturer Thermo Instrument (83% owned by Thermo Electron) and heart-assist device developer Thermo Cardiosystems (58%) to Thermedics (51%). Furthermore, some businesses are wholly owned and not publicly quoted, including Nicolet Biomedical which produces neurodiagnostics monitoring equipment and Tecomet, active in medical components fabrication, including forged prosthetic and trauma implants. In 1995, Tecomet plans to introduce five new forged-hip devices comprising about 45 new catalogue lines for its primary medical products customer, Thermo Electron writes in its annual report.</p><p>Medical imaging products are manufactured by Lorad, part of ThermoTrex. Lorad's revenues rose 45% in 1994 to $54 million fuelled by increasing demand for mammography and needle biopsy systems. Lorad is developing a full-breast digital imaging, sonic CT and Doppler CT. "We are now building two clinical test units to gather full-breast digital imaging data for submission to the FDA." In 1994, ThermoTrex struck an distribution agreement with Hitachi Medical to market its mammography and biopsy systems in Japan.</p><p>subsidiaries in the news</p><p>Thermo Cardiosystem has had a successful 1994 with the HeartMate pneumatic left ventricular assist device approved in the US in October, followed this year by European approval for the portable air-driven version and FDA approval for use of the biomaterial Cardioflex in the manufacture of the HeartMate. Lehman Brothers analyst Sally Yanchus believes that the portable device could be approved in the US for in-hospital use by mid-1995 and for home use by late 1995 or early 1996.</p><p>Thermo Electron's largest subsidiary, Thermo Instrument Systems, has also adopted the parent's spin-out strategy and organised itself into seven separate subsidiaries. In March, Thermo Instrument took a large step towards becoming the world number one analytical instrument company when it agreed to purchase Fisons scientific instrument business for $300 million. Thermo Instrument's target is for 25-20% annual sales and profit growth, as in 1994 largely through acquisitions.</p>
