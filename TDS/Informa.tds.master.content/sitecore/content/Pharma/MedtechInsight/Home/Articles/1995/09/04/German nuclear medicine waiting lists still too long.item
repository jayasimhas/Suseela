<p>Some 12,000 German patients (an average of 99 per nuclear medicine therapy unit) were on the waiting list for treatment in 1993. This represents 38% of all cases treated in that year, says a report by the association of leading medical officials (AGLMB). The report, quoted in Arzte Zeitung, recommends that capacity be expanded by some 300 beds (or 37.5%) in the medium term. The number of nuclear medicine beds per 10,000 inhabitants would thus increase from 0.1 to 0.15 and the total number of beds from 791 to 1,090.</p>

<p>Some 12,000 German patients (an average of 99 per nuclear medicine therapy unit) were on the waiting list for treatment in 1993. This represents 38% of all cases treated in that year, says a report by the association of leading medical officials (AGLMB). The report, quoted in Arzte Zeitung, recommends that capacity be expanded by some 300 beds (or 37.5%) in the medium term. The number of nuclear medicine beds per 10,000 inhabitants would thus increase from 0.1 to 0.15 and the total number of beds from 791 to 1,090.</p><p>Capacity should be increased within existing therapy units rather than new units set up, the report states, because units should be of a minimum size to ensure optimum performance, economy, quality assurance and radiation protection. In all, 31,802 patients were treated with open radionuclides in Germany's 121 nuclear medicine therapy units in 1993. Benign thyroid disease accounted for 22,890 (72%) of these cases, malignant thyroid disease for 6,388 (20%) and other conditions for 2,524.</p>
