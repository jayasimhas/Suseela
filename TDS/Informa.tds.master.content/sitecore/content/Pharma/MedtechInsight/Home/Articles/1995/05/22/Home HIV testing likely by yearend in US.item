<p>Johnson & Johnson's home-collection HIV test could be approved by the end of the year. As long as the test fulfils safety and effectiveness criteria there is no longer a policy impediment to home testing, says the FDA.</p><p>"We would expect counselling and referral to be dealt with under the normal approval rules," an FDA spokesman told Clinica.</p><p>Last June, the FDA asked the Blood Products Advisory Committee for its opinion on home-collection HIV testing. "They felt, almost unanimously: one, it is better to know than not know; and two, that more people will know [if home-collection tests are available] ... That opinion constitutes advice to the agency," said the FDA spokesman.</p><p>Two manufacturers have home-collection kits under FDA review at the moment: J&J subsidiary Direct Access Diagnostics and ChemTrak. ChemTrak acquired the home-test through its purchase of Coonan Clinical at the beginning of 1995 (see Clinica No 636 Bulletin, p 1). J&J filed first and is furthest down the line. Neither J&J nor the FDA would comment on time-scale, but Clinica believes the test will be approved by the end of the year and that J&J is currently working to resolve issues raised during the review.</p><p>Vice-president of ChemTrak's HIV division, Steve Coonan, says its test is also fairly close to the end of the review process. "Unless the FDA comes back with something, we are almost there," he told Clinica. A recent New England Journal of Medicine article (May 11th) reported that Anonymous Testing Services also has a home collection test under review. This is not the case. However, ATS, which recently changed its name to Home Access Health, says a PMA submission is "days away".</p><p>Home Access Health believes it has a significant advantage over its competitors. While J&J and ChemTrak are diagnostics manufacturers building a counselling service around a diagnostic product, Home Access is a telemedicine specialist that has brought diagnostic technology into its information handling system, says president Rich Quattrocchi. The company has alliances with Waldheim Pharmazeutica (Austria), and Cambridge Biotech (US), and is already looking at the possibility of extending the service to Europe.</p><p>Mr Quattrocchi also claims the Home Access trial was "probably the largest to date with thousands of patients, in all risk groups, throughout the US". Pre-test counselling is by touch tone phone menu and either recorded questions and messages or direct counselling. A broad range of demographic variables will be collected at the pre-test stage.</p><p>Results of the 1992 US National Health Interview Survey, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (May 11th), revealed that those with least access to health care would be most likely to purchase a home-collection HIV test - a finding that confounds the usual pattern of home tests being used by higher income, more educated people. In particular, male, black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to say they would use the tests.</p><p>The National Health survey, carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics, did not ask how much people would be prepared to pay but Home Access believes cost is not an issue. The Rolling Meadows, Illinois-based company is aiming at around $50, about the same as the price at a doctor's or private clinic. A more expensive version will include overnight courier collection. Home Access has an exclusive licence to use Saliva Diagnostics' Omni-Sal collection device, but initial tests will use dried blood. A more expensive version will include overnight courier collection.</p><p>According to the US CDC approximately 33 million HIV tests are performed every year in the US and about 18% of adults have been tested. About 20% of tests are performed at public clinics, 31% in doctors' offices, HMOs or employer clinics and 25% at hospitals and out-patient clinics.</p>
