I joined Clinica as Business Editor in 2005, where I covered the wheeling and dealing that went on in the medtech sector - the big mergers and the bolt-on acquisitions, who's suing who, whose top-line is soaring and whose bottom-line is sinking. While keeping one eye on the big players, I focus the other on the "little guys", the innovative start-ups working on tomorrow's technologies. Through Medtech Ventures, which I launched in 2006, I keep abreast of what the next best thing is in medical technologies and it never ceases to amaze me the depth of ingenuity that the human mind is capable of - who said there's no creativity in science? Since becoming Editor in 2009, my biggest priority is ensuring our readers get the most value from our product. It's quality over quantity in this age of information overload, and the Clinica team only cherry picks what matters to the our readers. We are constantly honing our content to make it as relevant as possible to you our readers, so feel free to contact us with your feedback. .</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="3"><hr color="#CCCCCC" size="1"></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"></td> <td valign="top"><strong><span>Reed Miller</span></strong><br> Deputy Editor <br> <a href="mailto:reed.miller@informa.com">reed.miller@informa.com</a><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/ClinicaReed " class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @ClinicaReed </a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script> <br></td> <td valign="top"><p>I got my first job in journalism with The Gray Sheet, then part of FDC Reports, in 2000 and have been covering medical technology ever since.

I also spent three years working for theheart.org when it was the best news source for cardiologists and a year writing about pharmaceutical company compliance issues for HCPro, Inc. Now I'm tracking the bewildering and rapidly evolving universe of new medical technology, from IVDs to artificial hearts, from pre-clinical trials to commercialization. </p></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="3"><hr color="#CCCCCC" size="1"></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><img src="-/media/5B95862092244DBF918CAA5E72E149E7.ashx" width="100" height="150" border="1"></td> <td valign="top"><strong><span>Amanda Maxwell</span></strong><br> Medtech Regulatory Affairs Editor <br> <a href="mailto:amanda.maxwell@informa.com">amanda.maxwell@informa.com</a><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/ClinicaAmanda" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @ClinicaAmanda</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script> <br></td> <td valign="top"><p>Having covered European medtech regulatory affairs for Clinica for over a quarter of a century, I broadened my scope beyond the EU and became overall Medtech Regulatory Affairs Editor in 2012. Through the years, I have covered the European Directives, regulations and other documents that emerge from the European Commission, followed work on international regulatory convergence, and kept an eye on the national regulators, particularly France. I continue to witness and analyze the increasingly complex regulation of ever more technically sophisticated products, including regulation impacting drug/device combination products and companion diagnostics. I also monitor other regulations that impact the industry, <escenic_non_breaking_space></escenic_non_breaking_space>including environmental laws, standards, guidelines, and track funding and reimbursement issues. I particularly enjoy the close contact I have with key regulators at the European and international level and within EU member states, and industry leaders. At present, I am following closely developments related to the new Regulations on medical devices and IVDs and analyzing how they impact the sector.</p></td> </tr></table> <br> To explore the complete range of pharma news, data and analysis that our subscribers enjoy every day, click on the button below to start your free trial<br> <div><a href="http://www.clinica.co.uk/freetrial/"><img border="0" src="-/media/86FA42F76EB94E17AB910E54E2E95025.ashx"></a><br></div>  </p>
