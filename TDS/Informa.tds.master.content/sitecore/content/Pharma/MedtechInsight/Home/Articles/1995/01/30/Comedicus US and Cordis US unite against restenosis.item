<p>Comedicus (US) and Cordis (US) are joining forces to test a new method for preventing restenosis after angioplasty. Cordis will provide stents for coating with Comedicus' TriNORx nitric-oxide compound, which is currently under development. The two companies expect to negotiate a supply agreement later this year.</p>

<p>Comedicus (US) and Cordis (US) are joining forces to test a new method for preventing restenosis after angioplasty. Cordis will provide stents for coating with Comedicus' TriNORx nitric-oxide compound, which is currently under development. The two companies expect to negotiate a supply agreement later this year.</p><p>Comedicus chairman and CEO James Grabek told Clinica that TriNORx affects three of the mechanisms of restenosis: it dilates vessels; it inhibits platelet aggregation; and it inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. Initial test results will be presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans on March 19th-22nd, 1995.</p><p>The company is looking at various applications for site- specific delivery, he says. As well as stents, it is investigating coatings for coronary and vascular grafts. Comedicus says it is on the verge of signing agreements with two companies for further research into these applications. It is also developing a catheter for delivering TriNORx which it hopes to launch outside the US next year.</p><p>Some 400,000 balloon angioplasties were performed in the US in 1993 and approximately 200,000 coronary stents were implanted in 1994. Restenosis occurs in some 40% of angioplasties.</p>
