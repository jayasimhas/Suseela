<p>The US Federal Drug Law Institute (FDLI) and Center for Devices & Radiological Health's (CDRH) latest satellite video conference - on in vitro diagnostics - may not have given attendees much of the promised information, but officials did provide invaluable tips on gaining product approval. Duffy Miller, Clinica's Washington correspondent, reports.</p><p>On the agenda for discussion were: "bundling", whereby multiple uses or multiple products are folded into a single submission; classification and regulation of currently unclassified in vitro diagnostics, including immunohistochemical stains; and widely used in vitro diagnostics that have not yet cleared the FDA.</p><p>CDRH associate director Susan Alpert commented that a bundling proposal is currently "making the second round internally. We're still working on it very actively." No details were given.</p><p>Non-governmental groups as well as FDA personnel will be involved in regulation of now unclassified in vitro diagnostics, Dr Alpert noted. External <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> standards will be considered and standard-setting organisations consulted.</p><p>As for unapproved, but widely used, diagnostics, "We don't intend to pull them all" off the market, Dr Alpert assured the conference. "Some situations we think are critical" and a compliance policy guide "now being pulled together" will contain a timetable for compliance and data needed for particular items.</p><p>Of most value to lawyers and industry executives attending the conference were the main reasons given by FDA officials for their "Refusal to Accept" in vitro diagnostic applications.</p><p>Steven Gutman, acting director of the CDRH Clinical Laboratory Devices Division, cited: failure to chart performance adequately, to define and support intended use and to follow protocol; and inadequate quality control.</p><p>In vitro diagnostics for blood are also regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research in addition to the CDRH. Mary Lamb of the CBER said the main deficiencies she sees include:</p><p>failure to state intended use;</p><p>inappropriate comparative test - the agency wants a licensed or state-of-the-art diagnostic;</p><p>inadequate follow-up of discordant specimens;</p><p>insufficient specimens for the study population size;</p><p>site data not representative of intended use;</p><p>insufficient sensitivity data;</p><p>failure to test for interference;</p><p>clinical studies with fewer than three independent lots of each component;</p><p>inadequate justification of data;</p><p>inadequate controls;</p><p>inadequate stability studies; and manufacturing process changes during or after clinical trials.</p>
