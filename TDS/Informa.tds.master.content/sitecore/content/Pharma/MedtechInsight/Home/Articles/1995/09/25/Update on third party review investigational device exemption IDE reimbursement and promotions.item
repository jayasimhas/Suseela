<p>Clinica's Washington correspondent Duffy Miller reports on the latest developments in US regulatory affairs.</p><p>Center for Devices & Radiological Health officials discussed the planned outside-review pilot programme, reimbursement for investigational devices and promotion - federal regulatory issues that most concern medical technology companies - in Washington last week.</p><p>The FDA's project to allow third-party review of at least part of medical device applications is due to begin on January 1st, deputy director of the Center's Office of Device Evaluation Philip Phillips told the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS) annual conference on September 19th. "We're doing everything we can to meet that deadline," he said, "and hope to announce our plans in the Federal Register by November 1st."</p><p>Although claiming it is a little premature to give details, he said the notice will reflect current regulations. This rules out "harmonisation" with European review systems, he noted, since such action would require US legislative changes.</p><p>reimbursement of IDEs</p><p>A Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) regulation allowing Medicare reimbursement for investigational devices (see Clinica No 671, p 5) "is on the fast track, and should be published within the next few weeks", Mr Phillips said. "I believe it will provide reimbursement for most investigational devices." The FDA will recommend to the HCFA whether the agency should pay for particular devices.</p><p>Products will be divided into two classes, based on risk. Category A - the non-reimbursable devices - will include innovative Class III devices whose "absolute risk" has not been established, and the FDA is therefore unsure if the device type can be considered safe and effective. Category B - the reimbursable devices - will include Class I, II or III products where incremental risk (from a previous product) is the primary risk in question, and the underlying question of safety and efficacy of that particular type of device has been resolved.</p><p>Mr Phillips described criteria for determining how a device would be categorised.</p><p>* "A" devices are experimental Class III products of a type for which no PMA has been approved or Class III devices that would be reimbursable under "B" criteria had they not undergone significant modifications for new indications of use. * "B" devices are non-experimental. They may be products under investigation to establish substantial equivalence to a predicate device, or several Class III devices including those whose technical characteristics and indications are comparable to a PMA-approved product; with technical advances comparable to PMA-approved products; or whose technical characteristics are comparable to PMA-approved products under investigation for new indications.</p><p>Pre-amendment (pre-1976) Class III devices that have since become the subject of premarket approval are also reimbursable, as are non-significant risk devices for which the FDA may require IDEs.</p><p>promotional changes</p><p>A number of changes are also occurring at the promotions and advertising division, Byron Tart told the RAPS attendees. His group "is attempting to look collectively" with industry at the problem of industry-sponsored seminars and journal articles. (These have been the subject of much controversy since 1992, when FDA proposed strict limits on manufacturer dissemination of information through journal articles and at seminars. Discussion of unapproved uses was virtually forbidden.)</p><p>Mr Tart said he did not think there would be a problem with displaying works in progress or concept devices at meetings. Under the regulations, he explained, these early designs are not investigational. Even unapproved 510(k) devices can be displayed, provided they are not "commercialised", nor safety and efficacy claims made for them. Nor did he have a problem with journal articles on unapproved uses - if the manufacturer had been asked to supply the report and it was unsolicited.</p><p>He did, however, have a problem with press releases and Securities & Exchange Commission filings that were less than accurate about a device's approved indication. And he intends to send a letter to the laboratory industry about "silicone detectors" which claim to identify antibodies. These diagnostics have apparently sprung up since the furore over alleged breast-implant ailments began.</p><p>"I would be careful about testimonials in promotions," Mr Tart advised. All claims should have scientific substantiation, which is often difficult. Quality of life claims in particular "are pretty soft, but we probably won't bother you unless [the implication] modifies the intended use".</p><p>Mr Tart's group also plans to discuss with industry international symbols for labelling such as the European Union has proposed (manufacturer date, sterility, etc). This could require changes in the regulations, he noted, since the rules now demand that all instructions be written in the national language as well.</p>
