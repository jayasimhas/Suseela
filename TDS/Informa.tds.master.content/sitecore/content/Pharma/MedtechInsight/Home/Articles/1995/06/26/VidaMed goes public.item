<p>VidaMed, a developer of systems for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), went public with the sale of 3.1 million shares on June 21st. At a launch price of $6.50, a third below the price range mentioned in the prospectus, this was expected to raise in excess of $18 million net.</p><p>The Californian company's first product, the TransUrethral Needle Ablation system (TUNA), received the CE marking in February (see Clinica No 641, p 17). Approval in the US and Japan is still pending. VidaMed's Japanese distributor, Century Medical, is responsible for clinical trials in the country. In the US, TUNA is in clinical trials to gain data for a PMA (see Clinica No 626, p 21). VidaMed believes it should be ready to submit the application at the end of 1997.</p><p>VidaMed recently filed for FDA 510(k) approval for a general electrosurgical device for tissue ablation based on its radiofrequency and catheter technology. However, if approved, this would be for general surgical use only and VidaMed would be prohibited from marketing the device for more specific indications without additional clearances. The company expects to remain dependent on international sales via distributors for some years to come.</p><p>The TUNA system is designed to desiccate the prostatic tissues that surround and compress the urethra using radiofrequency energy. This procedure can be performed in about 30-45 minutes in an outpatient setting with a local anaesthetic. VidaMed envisages the system could be the therapy of choice and preferable to existing alternatives such as watchful waiting, or surgical intervention - mainly TURP, the primary interventional treatment since the 1940s. The market for electrosurgical equipment used in TURP is dominated by the <strong>[C#198600199:Pfizer]</strong> subsidiary Valleylab.</p><p>Average Medicare reimbursement in the US for TURP is about $8,600 and the initial cost of the equipment to the hospital about $16,000. Another hospital-stay procedure is laser-assisted prostatectomy which includes two similar procedures - visual laser-assisted prostatectomy (V-LAP) and contact laser-assisted prostatectomy (C-LAP). Average Medicare reimbursement is about $7,000 and the initial cost more than $50,000. A surgical laser catheter is inserted into the urethra and burns the prostatic tissue and the prostatic urethra.</p><p>Several other outpatient surgical procedures have recently been introduced, including transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and laser delivered interstitial thermal therapy (LDIT). Microwave systems have not received FDA approval for treatment of BPH. VidaMed believes microwave generators used for performing TUMT are currently priced in excess of $100,000. Clinical trials for HIFU are under way in the US and Japan and VidaMed says ultrasound systems used in the treatment are marketed at a price of about $100,000.</p><p>VidaMed believes its own system is more cost effective with fewer complications and shorter recovery time than other BPH therapies. The company estimates that the cost of the TUNA procedure in the US, including physician charges, will be about $2,300 with the RF generator being sold at prices ranging from $20,000 to $35,000.</p><p>patents</p><p>One risk to the company is involvement in possible patent interference proceedings in the US. EP Technologies and the University of California recently filed a US patent application in the field of body tissue ablation, VidaMed writes in its prospectus. These parties have asked the US Patent and Trademark Office for interference proceedings. The request would touch on two of VidaMed's US patent applications on which notices of allowance have been received. One of the inventors identified in the interference application is Stuart Edwards, now VidaMed's CEO but previously chief technical officer of EP Technologies.</p>
