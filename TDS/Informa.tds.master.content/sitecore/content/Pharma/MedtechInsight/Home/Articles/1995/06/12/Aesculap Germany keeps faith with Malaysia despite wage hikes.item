<p>Aesculap (Germany) remains committed to instrument production in Malaysia despite recent 8-10% per annum rises in its local wage bill. Although spiralling salaries have negated the very reason the Tuttlingen-based company moved into Malaysia more than 20 years ago - cheap labour costs - the company is not tempted by new locations such as Vietnam, Dr Uwe Trautmann told Handelsblatt recently.</p>

<p>Aesculap (Germany) remains committed to instrument production in Malaysia despite recent 8-10% per annum rises in its local wage bill. Although spiralling salaries have negated the very reason the Tuttlingen-based company moved into Malaysia more than 20 years ago - cheap labour costs - the company is not tempted by new locations such as Vietnam, Dr Uwe Trautmann told Handelsblatt recently.</p><p>"Our qualified staff are our greatest potential. We will not give them up for the sake of a few marks," says Dr Trautmann, general manager of local subsidiary Aesculap Surgical Industries. Aesculap Surgical, which represented the company's first foray into South-East Asia, is now its biggest manufacturing operation worldwide. Nine hundred staff are on the payroll in Malaysia, compared with 60 when operations started up in Penang in 1973.</p><p>Local staff loyalty is a cherished asset: some 80 local employees have been with the company from the outset. In addition, 186 apprentices have received their training from Aesculap, one-third of whom are still with the company.</p><p>Average investment in the factory stands at around DM 2.5 million ($1.7 million) a year. Just 2% of the 170,000 instruments produced in Penang each month are destined for local use. However, this is sufficient to give Aesculap Surgical a 70% share in the Malaysian hospital market. Approximately two tonnes of Aesculap products are flown back to Germany each week, including forceps, scissors and some six million scalpel blades.</p><p>Aesculap AG results</p><p>Parent company Aesculap AG posted net earnings of DM 15.5 million in the year to September 30th, 1994, on sales which fell just short of DM 525 million. Besides the dental and surgical branches, the company supplies the micro- neurosurgical, endoscopic, laser surgery, sterilisation and hygiene technology sectors.</p>
