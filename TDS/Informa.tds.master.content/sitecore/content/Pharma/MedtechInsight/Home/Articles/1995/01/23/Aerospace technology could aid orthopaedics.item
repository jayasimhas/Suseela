<p>Work by UK researchers could lead to orthopaedic implants which are more compatible with bone and thus last longer. AEA Technology, in a DTI-funded project with Corin Medical (see Clinica No 606/7, p 28), is developing a carbon fibre composite hip implant using manufacturing technology developed by the aerospace industry. Metal implants are much stiffer than bone, resulting in more load being taken by the implant, which then works itself loose. The advantage of carbon fibre composites is that they are strong but also lighter and more elastic than metallic implant materials.</p>

<p>Work by UK researchers could lead to orthopaedic implants which are more compatible with bone and thus last longer. AEA Technology, in a DTI-funded project with Corin Medical (see Clinica No 606/7, p 28), is developing a carbon fibre composite hip implant using manufacturing technology developed by the aerospace industry. Metal implants are much stiffer than bone, resulting in more load being taken by the implant, which then works itself loose. The advantage of carbon fibre composites is that they are strong but also lighter and more elastic than metallic implant materials.</p><p>The high manufacturing cost of carbon composites has been a major disadvantage for orthopaedic applications, but AEA will use carbon filament winding techniques developed for aerospace applications which it hopes will improve cost-effectiveness. Corin Medical will machine the implants and market them. The prototype hip has passed existing laboratory fatigue tests and results from biological tests suggest biocompatibility, Dr Paul Evans, head of AEA's bone and biomaterials section told Clinica.</p>
