<p>The latest market data from HIMA highlights a slowdown in the "big three". Jeanette Marchant reports from Canada. "Does your domestic strategy drive your global strategy? Or does your global strategy drive your domestic strategy?" Posing these questions at the Global Medical Device Conference in Canada last month, HIMA's Ed Rozynski said the challenge facing company managers is the allocation of scarce resources among competing global priorities.</p><p>Companies must identify the best market opportunities - in the shifting global market, the emerging Asian countries represent the fastest growing market for medical technology. Mr Rozynski, vice-president of global strategy and analysis for the US industry association, noted that the annual rate of growth in the Asian markets (excluding Japan) is currently around 20%, compared with 9% in the 1985-89 period. Conversely, growth in the "big three" markets of the US, EU and Japan has slowed to 7% from 8%.</p><p>Although still the largest single market, the US has seen its share decline from 60% of global sales in 1980 to 41% in 1994. The latest figures from HIMA show that worldwide consumption of medtech products totalled $115,000 million in 1994, with surgical and medical instruments accounting for the largest share at $32,550 million, followed by hospital supplies and implantables.</p><p>The geographical breakdown of sales highlights the continuing dominance of the big three, but per capita expenditure on healthcare in Asia and Latin America has enormous potential to increase, particularly as countries in these regions place greater emphasis on healthcare.</p><pre>Global market for healthcare products 1994 ($ millions) US 47,700 Western Europe 29,200 EU 27,900 Japan 23,300 Canada 2,600 Australia 1,200 China 900 Brazil 900 S Korea 870 Mexico 650 Taiwan 570 India 570 Saudi Arabia 350 Argentina 310 Thailand 250 Chile 250 TOTAL MARKET 115,000 Source: HIMA</pre><pre>Per capita consumption of healthcare technology products 1994 US $187 Japan 187 EU 83 Asia* 28 Latin America* 7 * represents four wealthiest countries in region Source: HIMA</pre><p>In evaluating market opportunities, companies should consider not only market size and growth but regulatory, healthcare and reimbursement systems, advised Mr Rozynski. Global business strategies require a balance between the need for economies of scale and national responsiveness. He recommended the establishment of worldwide strategy teams with broad geographic and functional representatives.</p><p>Challenges in emerging markets need to be considered at local level, as delegates heard at a session devoted to addressing the Asian market. New regulatory systems are being introduced for medical devices: in South Korea, for example, new regulations have entailed more work for companies, although a revision of existing rules is planned by the end of this year. This should lead to a system more in line with the European Union quality systems approach, according to Richard Larkin of CR Bard.</p><p>Healthcare purchasing and reimbursement policies, which are undergoing change in the region, also need to be taken into consideration.</p><p>Next week Clinica will publish a review of the emerging Asian markets from the Global Medical Device Conference.</p>
