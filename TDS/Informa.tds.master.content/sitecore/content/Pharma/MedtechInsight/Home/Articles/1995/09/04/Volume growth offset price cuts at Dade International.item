<p>Dade International, the US diagnostics manufacturer sold by Baxter last year, has reported a 3% rise in adjusted sales to $157 million for the 1995 second quarter. In the first half of the year, turnover was up 2% to $299 million when adjusted for a shortened reporting period for international sales and for product lines which Dade wants to sell off (see Clinica No 661, p 13). The latter concerns Burdick & Jackson and Bartels whose sales are excluded from Dade's first-half results.</p>

<p>Dade International, the US diagnostics manufacturer sold by Baxter last year, has reported a 3% rise in adjusted sales to $157 million for the 1995 second quarter. In the first half of the year, turnover was up 2% to $299 million when adjusted for a shortened reporting period for international sales and for product lines which Dade wants to sell off (see Clinica No 661, p 13). The latter concerns Burdick & Jackson and Bartels whose sales are excluded from Dade's first-half results.</p><p>Dade attributes the increase in adjusted turnover to higher volume sales of Microscan and Paramax product lines coupled with growth in the product service business. These increases were, however, partly offset by price cuts of non-cardiac Stratus products and by the loss of a portion of Dade Control's OEM business. Without adjustment, Dade's turnover fell 1.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first half. Costs of $21 million for a restructuring programme were written off at the beginning of the year, resulting in an $8.1 million net loss in the first half.</p><p>The US FDA issued an export certificate for products manufactured at Dade's facility in Aguada, Puerto Rico, on August 1st after a reinspection. Dade says this indicates that the FDA's warning letter of September 1994 is no longer considered outstanding.</p><pre>Dade International Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 157.3 159.7 11.1 9.0 6 months 299.2 314.3 (8.1) 17.4 (ended June 30th)</pre>
