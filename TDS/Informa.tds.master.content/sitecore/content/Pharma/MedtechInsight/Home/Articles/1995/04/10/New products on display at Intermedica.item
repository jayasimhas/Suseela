<p>Wissembourg-based Odam Brucker presented its Defigard 3002 IH defibrillator at Intermedica. The hospital-use defibrillator has four cassettes for different applications based on the use of electrodes for standard, slick paddle, internal and semi- automatic defibrillation. The system has been launched in France, Germany, Belgium and Spain, and the company is looking for a UK agent.</p>

<p>Wissembourg-based Odam Brucker presented its Defigard 3002 IH defibrillator at Intermedica. The hospital-use defibrillator has four cassettes for different applications based on the use of electrodes for standard, slick paddle, internal and semi- automatic defibrillation. The system has been launched in France, Germany, Belgium and Spain, and the company is looking for a UK agent.</p><p>MTT Electronique won the industrial award at Intermedica '95 for its transport container for organ transplants. Developed in collaboration with Electrolux with a research grant from ANVAR, it is the fruit of four years' work. Organs can be stored in transit for up to 24 hours. The company claims this doubles the length of time donor organs can be conserved. The graphic interface adapted by MTT allows programmable intracoronary perfusion, precise pH, temperature and pressure to be closely controlled. MTT has also developed a transparent, single-use container which keeps the organ in aseptic conditions until the transplant is carried out. The system is currently undergoing clinical evaluation at Inra. The "Organ Chain" system will be available through Electrolux' distribution network from the end of the year.</p><p>C et D Biomedical, a subsidiary of Hyco, presented Image, its pressure control monitor for irrigation/suction during endoscopy. The device allows interventional endoscopy to be carried out while an aspiration pump keeps fluid pressure in the bladder constant and lower than venous pressure. Hyco aims to sell the equipment initially to public hospitals and hopes to have 1,500 monitors in place in Europe within three years. The company expects to launch Image in the UK, France and Italy in June at a cost of some Fr 100,000 ($20,000). Hyco's director, Didier Lafoucriere, believes 4-5% of endoscopy procedures involve problems of fluid pressure. Due to the high cost of intensive care, he estimates the machine would pay for itself after just one problem. The device also includes an aspirated blood counter for the anaesthetist.</p><p><strong>[C#198700114:Guerbet]</strong> Biomedical presented its prototype ultrasonic revascularisation device, Angioson, on the ANVAR stand. Angioson uses ultrasound to remove plaque build-up in peripheral and coronary arteries. According to Dr Drobinski, cardiologist at Pitie Salpetriere Hospital, who helped develop the device, ultrasonic revascularisation could replace current laser and balloon methods. Guerbet Biomedical signed an agreement in 1991 with l'Aerospatiale to develop the system further. Phase I evaluation gave positive results, according to the company, and more studies are being carried out.</p><p>The Intermedica 95 research prize went to INSERM researchers at Bordeaux university and the Office of Industrial Evaluation (OVI) for the artificial bioresorbable membrane EndoPatch-EF. The elastic-fibrin material is suitable for use in digestive, urological, neurosurgery and ENT surgery, says Michel Rabaud, OVI's scientific director. EndoPatch-EF aids in the reconstruction of human tissue ad integrum and can be used for temporary replacement of tissue walls, reinforcement of surgical sutures and isolating infected areas. OVI, which has marketed the product since June 1994, specialises in technology transfer and hopes for a turnover of Fr 30 million ($6 million) by 1996. OVI estimates the French market will require 3,000 patches a year for digestive surgery alone and the world market for cardiac patches will approach 30,000 a year. The EndoPatch-EF Tympan is set for launch this month.</p><p>Philips Systemes Medicaux won a special jury prize for its Thoravision digital chest X-ray system as did Johnson & Johnson Medical for its Sterrado 100, hydrogen peroxide steriliser.</p><p>Intermedica was held at the Porte de Versailles, Paris, France, from March 27-30th and was co-organised by SNITEM, the French medical device industry association</p>
