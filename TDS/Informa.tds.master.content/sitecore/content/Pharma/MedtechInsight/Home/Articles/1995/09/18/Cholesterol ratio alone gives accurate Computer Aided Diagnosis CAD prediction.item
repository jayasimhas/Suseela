<p>The ratio of total plasma cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) defines cardiovascular risk as accurately as current North American screening guidelines (NCEP II), say Canadian researchers. A team led by Dr Steven Grover of the Center for the Analysis of Cost Effective Care, at the Montreal General Hospital analysed data from 3,684 men and women enrolled in the Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence and Follow-up Studies.</p>

<p>The ratio of total plasma cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) defines cardiovascular risk as accurately as current North American screening guidelines (NCEP II), say Canadian researchers. A team led by Dr Steven Grover of the Center for the Analysis of Cost Effective Care, at the Montreal General Hospital analysed data from 3,684 men and women enrolled in the Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence and Follow-up Studies.</p><p>Why the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL is as accurate as the LDL:HDL ratio when LDL plays a more direct role in plaque formation is not clear, admit the researchers in a paper in JAMA (September 13th). However, it could be the optimal lipid screening measurement as total cholesterol and HDL testing is relatively accurate, widely available and cheap.</p><p>The researchers also say that a risk model based on data from the Framingham study was more sensitive than the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (NCEP II) at 70% vs 45% and had only slightly reduced sensitivity (82% vs 86%). NCEP II guidelines consider all risk factors to be equal, whereas the Framingham data suggest weighting parameters such as diabetes mellitus in women and cigarette smoking in men.</p><p>The Lipid Research Clinic Prevalence and Follow-up Study was conducted from 1972 to 1976 in 10 North American Clinics. The Canadian group analysed data from a random sample of 15% of the participants, with a mean follow-up time of 12.2 years.</p>
