<p>BioLogix (US) is to receive funding for commercialisation of its hand-held, point-of-care diagnostic instrument and disposable biosensor systems under a new agreement with the New York-based Advanced Health Institute of Technology (AHIT). The agreement provides for the immediate arrangement of "a significant infusion of capital" into the San Francisco-based company. In exchange, AHIT will receive long-term equity participation in the company's publicly held securities and representation on its board of directors.</p><p>BioLogix management views the deal as an important milestone in its efforts to accelerate FDA approval and commercialisation of its diagnostics in the US and Europe. It also recently announced the issue of a European patent for its portable blood-chemistry measuring apparatus in 11 European countries (see Clinica No 662, p 13). The company is currently positioning itself as a low-cost producer in the point-of-care diagnostics market, the in vitro blood analysis sector of which is forecast to reach $14,000 million in 1995.</p>
