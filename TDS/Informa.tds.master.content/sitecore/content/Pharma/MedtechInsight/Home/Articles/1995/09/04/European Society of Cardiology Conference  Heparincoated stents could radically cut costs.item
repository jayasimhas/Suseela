<p>Heparin-coated stents could radically reduce the cost of stenting, paving the way for more widespread use. Hospital stay was cut from 8.5 days to 3.1 as a result of lower complications in a pilot study of Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems' polyamine-heparin-coated Palmaz-Schatz stent.</p>

<p>Heparin-coated stents could radically reduce the cost of stenting, paving the way for more widespread use. Hospital stay was cut from 8.5 days to 3.1 as a result of lower complications in a pilot study of Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems' polyamine-heparin-coated Palmaz-Schatz stent.</p><p>Data from the Benestent II pilot study confirm the theory that heparin coatings can eliminate the need for anticoagulation which in turn reduces bleeding complications - one of the biggest problems for stent patients. With lower complications there are fewer transfusions and less surgery: hospital stay can be reduced.</p><p>Professor Patrick Serruys, professor of interventional cardiology and director of the catheterisation laboratory at the Thoraxcenter, Rotterdam, presented the pilot data at the annual congress of the European Society of Cardiology (Amsterdam August 20th-24th).</p><p>The Benestent II pilot study comprised three initial phases, where resumption of heparin therapy after sheath removal was postponed progressively by six, 12 and 36 hours. In Phase IV, Coumadin and heparin were replaced by antiplatelet agents, ticlopidine and aspirin. Procedural heparin was administered according to activated coagulation times. Sub-acute thrombosis did not occur in any patient, despite the change in drug regimen. The overall clinical success rate was 99%, compared with 93% in Benestent I.</p><pre>Benestent II pilot results Phase : I II III IV Benestent I Patients 51 55 51 50 259 MLD post procedure (mm) 2.76 2.75 2.79 2.74 2.51 Diameter stenosis % 19 17 18 18 21 Event-free discharge (%) 93 100 98 100 100 Stent thrombosis (%) 0 0 0 0 3.5 Vascular surgery (%) 5.9 4.1 2.0 0 9.7 Blood transfusion (%) 2.0 0 2.0 0 3.9 Hospital stay (days) 7.4 6.1 7.2 3.1 8.5</pre><p>Three-month event-free survival was 86%, compared with 80% for current stenting practices and 70% for balloon angioplasty.</p><p>Prof Serruys said better technique and patient selection also contributed to the improvement in outcome in the pilot study. In particular the greater post-procedural minimum luminal diameter (MLD) is due to routine high pressure balloon inflation.</p><pre>Six-month restenosis MLD (mm) Restenosis Acute six-months (%) Benestent I 2.51 1.85 20 Benestent II (pilot I-IV combined) 2.77 2.08 13 Gain (mm) Loss (mm) Restenosis (%) Phase I 1.67 0.65 15 Phase II 1.67 0.94 20 Phase II 1.67 0.55 10 Phase IV 1.68 0.58 6</pre><p>outcomes</p><p>Data from Benestent I put the cost of stenting including subsequent complications at about Fl 20,000 ($32,000) compared with Fl 10,000 for PTCA, said Dr Ben van Hout of the Institute for Medical Technology Assessment at Erasmus University, Rotherdam. The decrease in ischaemic events during the first year contributed a saving of about Fl 1,500, which brings the additional cost of stenting to about Fl 8,500. The increase in event-free survival is about 11% in the first year, which represents an additional cost of Fl 77,500 per event-free survivor: "Much higher than the corresponding costs per event-free survivor following PTCA," said Dr van Hout.</p><p>However, the data are based on very limited information. They are drawn from ex ante analysis, without direct data, indirect costs or information about healthcare outside the confines of the trial. No account has been taken of quality of life or the additional costs to society, such as absence from work. Most notably the results do not take account of advancing stent technology.</p><p>Dr van Hout is in charge of the outcomes arm of Benestent II and he promises it will be one of the least biased studies yet performed. The protocol includes direct gathering of resource use, indirect costs and quality of life, in addition to patient passports, to track costs outside the trial.</p><p>MUST validates ticlopidine use</p><p>Antiplatelet drugs cut thrombosis and cause very few complications, according to Dr Marie Claude Morice of the Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud, France. Presenting preliminary data from the MUST trial, she said 260 stent patients treated with aspirin and ticlopidine had a sub-acute occlusion rate of just 1.15%. CABG was needed in only 0.38% of cases and MI occurred in only 1.92%. There were no vascular complications and only one case of gastro-intestinal bleeding. Most patients were discharged within two days. Dr Morice's group has used antiplatelet therapy with reduced heparin in over 1,150 patients, with sub-acute thrombosis in the region of 1.2-1.6%.</p>
