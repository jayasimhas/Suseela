Products in this category - including implants (but not orthopaedic fixation devices or dental materials), HIV tests and tampons - must obtain a Notice of Compliance before marketing.</p>

<p>Manufacturers of long-term implantable devices and HIV diagnostic kits will have to pay for premarket review by the Canadian Bureau of Medical Devices from September 1st under the regulatory agency's cost recovery plans. The Bureau intends to introduce fees for evaluating Part V devices in the next fiscal year which begins in April. Products in this category - including implants (but not orthopaedic fixation devices or dental materials), HIV tests and tampons - must obtain a Notice of Compliance before marketing.</p><p>The Bureau is drawing up a proposed schedule of fees which should be ready by April and come into effect in September, director Dr Richard Tobin told Clinica. In the first year, it plans to recoup Can$1 million in fees and Can$4 million each year thereafter.</p><p>The Canadian agency had originally planned to charge fees for notification of Part II devices (ie all devices) but, according to industry association MEDEC, this was challenged on legal grounds.</p>
