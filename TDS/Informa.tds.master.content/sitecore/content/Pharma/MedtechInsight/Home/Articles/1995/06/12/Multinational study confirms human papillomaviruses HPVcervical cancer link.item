<p>More than nine out of ten cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV). According to a multinational study organised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), just one type, 16, is responsible for more than 50% of those cases. The study, which is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (June 6th), found HPV DNA in 93% of more than 1,000 specimens of invasive cervical cancer collected from 22 countries with a high incidence of the disease over a three-year period.</p>

<p>More than nine out of ten cases of cervical cancer are caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV). According to a multinational study organised by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), just one type, 16, is responsible for more than 50% of those cases. The study, which is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (June 6th), found HPV DNA in 93% of more than 1,000 specimens of invasive cervical cancer collected from 22 countries with a high incidence of the disease over a three-year period.</p><p>Detection and typing was performed using a PCR protocol developed by the group's lead co-author Dr Michele Manos. More than 20 different types of HPV were associated with cervical cancer. The findings have direct implications for prevention efforts by showing how many different HPVs would have to be covered by diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine strategies.</p><p>According to IARC, cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in women worldwide. In developing countries it is by far the most common and fatal cancer. There are half a million new cases every year, about 80% in the developing world.</p>
