<p>The value of the UK breast screening programme, heralded as a flagship for preventive medicine, is being questioned by one of its pioneers. Professor Michael Baum, research director of the Institute of Cancer Research, suggests that more lives might be saved by reallocating scarce cancer resources to drug research and other emerging treatments. Prof Baum has resigned from the government's NHS breast cancer screening advisory group to voice his concerns.</p><p>In a letter to The Lancet (August 12th), Prof Baum looks at how the government's goal of reducing breast cancer deaths by 25% among women invited for screening (50-64 year olds) can be achieved. He points out that the government has unjustly claimed credit for a decline in death rates in this age group since the drop began five years before screening was introduced on a national scale.</p><p>The value of the screening programme will not become evident until 1997, he claims. Furthermore he believes that evidence to date suggests that "at the very best screening will add another 12% to the fall in breast cancer mortality by the year 2000".</p><p>Prof Baum believes his views have been sensationalised in the national press where he is quoted as saying that mammograms are "not worth doing" since they save too few lives at too high a cost and an unacceptable level of anxiety is caused by the high number of false positives. One in every 15 women is misdiagnosed in this way, according to an article in The Sunday Times.</p><p>In his letter to the Lancet Prof Baum says it will cost &pound;1 million for each woman who benefits from a screening programme costing &pound;27 million a year to run. This compares with the &pound;1.8 million that the commissioning committee for the NHS cancer research and development programme has to spend on a shortlist of 70 projects. He calls for expensive research into the screening interval and into screening women aged 40-50 to be scrapped.</p><p>Other UK breast cancer specialists disagree with Prof Baum's cost estimates. The cost of saving one life is between &pound;75,000 and &pound;100,000, state Dr Querci della Rovere and colleagues from St Margaret's Hospital, Epping, in a letter printed in the same issue of the Lancet. They also point out that screening accuracy has improved. The benign to malignant biopsy ratio of 4/1 has steadily improved and even been reversed in experienced centres.</p><p>Prof Baum's opinions are also contested by Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, who stresses that 1,250 lives are saved a year through breast screening. Earlier this year doubt was cast on the efficacy of the UK's screening programme due to the incidence of interval cancers (see Clinica No 640, p 3).</p>
