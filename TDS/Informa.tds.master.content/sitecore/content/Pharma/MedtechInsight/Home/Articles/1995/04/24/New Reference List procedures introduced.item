<p>In response to industry representations, new procedures for the Reference List are being introduced by the US Center for Devices and Radiological Health on May 1st, 1995. In a letter sent to medical device company executives earlier this month, Center Director Bruce Burlington outlines the initiatives designed to provide more notice and predictability to the procedures linking GMP compliance to the clearance of new product applications.</p><p>"Under the restructured program, attention will be focused on the appropriate linkage between serious GMP deficiencies and individual pending 510(k) applications," writes Dr Burlington. The agency will defer marketing clearances of Class I and II devices only if there is a reasonable relationship between current GMP violations and the application under review. The relevant FDA District Office will have initial responsibility for determining whether such a relationship exists.</p><p>When serious GMP violations are found during an establishment inspection, the District Office will issue a Warning Letter within 21 days and will advise the company if the violations are likely to halt marketing clearance of pending 510(k)s.</p><p>New 510(k) applications will be screened to determine if ongoing GMP violations relate to them. While scientific review of the application will not be interrupted if there are related GMP problems, the violations must be corrected before marketing clearance is granted by the FDA.</p><p>Warning Letter follow-up</p><p>Within 30 days of receipt of a company's response to a Warning Letter where serious violations are related to pending applications, the FDA will notify the company that either the response is adequate and marketing clearance will not be deferred; it is inadequate and clearance will not proceed until violations have been rectified; or that reinspection will be necessary to verify the corrective actions. In the latter case, if the agency is unable to carry out a reinspection within 60 days of being informed by the company that the facility is ready for inspection, the application will be cleared if there are no other outstanding concerns.</p><p>Companies are advised to provide a clear timetable for corrective actions and are encouraged to obtain an independent audit to verify GMP compliance. Dr Burlington also urges companies to contact FDA District Offices to check GMP compliance status.</p><p>The new procedures have been drawn up following meetings with HIMA, which filed a citizen petition in October last year challenging the legality of the Reference List. Last month President Clinton announced changes to the policy as part of the first package of regulatory reforms (see Clinica No 647, p 9).</p>
