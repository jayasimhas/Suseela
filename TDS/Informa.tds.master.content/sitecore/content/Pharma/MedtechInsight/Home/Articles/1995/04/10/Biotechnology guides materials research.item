<p>Philip Greenfield reports on further news from the Society for Biomaterials annual meeting in San Francisco last month.</p><p>At least half of the $54.3 billion US medical device industry is directly affected by biomaterials research, explained Allan Weinstein, CEO of <strong>[C#198700799:OrthoLogic]</strong>. Some 11 million people in the US have an implant of some kind. All of these devices are made with less than 20 commercially available materials all of which were originally developed for industrial applications, he said.</p><p>The investment in research and development in the medical device industry, at around 6% of sales in 1993, is higher than the aerospace, automotive or chemical industries. Around 6% ($300 million) of all venture capital funding has gone into the industry, he added.</p><p>Dr Weinstein stresses that the importance of biomaterials to the medical industry is not related to economics - biomaterials are not big business in themselves. As a rough guide, he estimates the value of the US orthopaedic biomaterials market at just $40 million a year. This goes a long way to explaining the current crisis in biomaterials supply (see Clinica No 648, p 16). "Just $40 million product sales cannot sustain a company involved in a class action product liability suit," he said.</p><p>research continues apace</p><p>The future for biomaterials will be guided by biotechnology-based research, predicts Dr Weinstein. Significantly, this year's meeting boasted three new sessions: biotechnology; biomolecular engineering; and hybrid artificial organs. In 2015, papers will be presented on tissue engineered products combining living tissue and artificial materials, he enthused.</p><p>Research already under way in this area was the subject of some of the papers at this year's meeting. Italian researchers presented their clinical experience with a tissue-engineered semi-artificial skin substitute. Dr Donati and colleagues at the University of Milan treated 16 patients with second- and third-degree burns using a combination of cultured autologous keratinocytes and Laserskin, <strong>[C#198700414:Fidia]</strong> Advanced Biopolymers' hyaluronic acid-derived (HYAFF) membrane (see Clinica No 602, pp 20-21). In addition, 18 patients with other types of wound (donor site, pressure sores) were treated.</p><p>The HYAFF carriers improved the growth of cultured keratinocytes - after seven or eight days, a lamina of HYAFF and keratinocytes is ready for use, according to Dr Donati. The skin grafts took in 60-90% of the burn patients (depending on size and severity of wound). This method offered faster healing times, fewer cases of infection, less pain and a more acceptable appearance of the healed wound, the researchers conclude. Laserskin is currently only available in Italy where it is distributed by Pharmacia. Plans are under way to launch the product in Europe and the Far East this year.</p><p>regenerating nerves</p><p>A US team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and New England Deaconess Hospital have developed a prosthesis which may aid nerve regeneration. The device, which consists of a collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) matrix in a biodegradable collage tube has been implanted in a 10 mm gap in the sciatic nerve of rats. Previous studies have indicated that a GAG matrix in silicone tubes enhances nerve regeneration, but the advantage of using collagen tubes is that they are biodegradable, the team said.</p><p>Dr Aria Landstrom and colleagues implanted filled and unfilled collagen and silicone tubes in rats for six weeks. They found the matrix-filled collagen tubes to be as effective as filled silicone tubes in promoting axonal regrowth. The researchers are now testing the functionality of the regenerated nerves using walking tests. In addition, the long-term effects of regeneration must be studied - earlier studies have shown that axons that do not reconnect die over time, said Dr Landstrom.</p>
