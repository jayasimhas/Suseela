<p>A second-generation PSA test developed by US researchers at the University of Washington Medical Center and Dianon Systems shows promise in better discrimination between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Presenting results of a study with the PSA II test at the American Urological Association's annual meeting in Las Vegas last week, the researchers commented that commercial PSA assays report a total PSA level (free and complexed molecules). PSA is organ-specific but not cancer- specific and above-normal serum PSA levels occur in a high proportion of BPH patients.</p>

<p>A second-generation PSA test developed by US researchers at the University of Washington Medical Center and Dianon Systems shows promise in better discrimination between prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Presenting results of a study with the PSA II test at the American Urological Association's annual meeting in Las Vegas last week, the researchers commented that commercial PSA assays report a total PSA level (free and complexed molecules). PSA is organ-specific but not cancer- specific and above-normal serum PSA levels occur in a high proportion of BPH patients.</p><p>The PSA II test recognises only the free PSA molecules and the proportion of free to total PSA is calculated as a percentage. In a recent clinical study, the new test distinguished 30% of men with histologically confirmed BPH who had an "abnormal" PSA test. "Measurement of the proportion of free PSA to total PSA has significant clinical utility for differentiating between prostate cancer and BPH, while retaining high sensitivity for detecting cancer in men who present with total PSA levels between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml," said Dr Michael Brawer, who headed the study at the University of Washington.</p><p>The PSA II test is available for investigational use only from Dianon Systems, which is sponsoring a large-scale study. The company expects to launch the test in Europe this year.</p><p>Matritech test</p><p>A serum-based assay which reacts with PC-1 is due to enter clinical trials by early 1996, David Corbet, president of Matritech, told the meeting. Matritech was granted an exclusive worldwide licence to prostate cancer-specific nuclear matrix proteins, including PC-1, developed by Johns Hopkins in 1993 (see Clinica No 572, p 3).</p><p>"The specificity of this antibody for cancerous nuclei, as well as its potential ability to identify pre-cancerous conditions on tissue biopsy, may offer an advantage over existing prostate cancer diagnostics products," according to Dr Jonathan Epstein of Johns Hopkins.</p><p>Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in men. Approximately 200,000 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed in the US in 1993 and around 38,000 men died of the disease. It is estimated that 165,000 new cases are diagnosed in Europe and 5,000 in Japan annually.</p>
