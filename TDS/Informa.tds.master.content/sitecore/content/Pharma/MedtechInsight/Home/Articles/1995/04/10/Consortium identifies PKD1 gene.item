<p>The American PKD1 Consortium has identified the polycystic kidney disease gene and has begun exploring its function. The consortium, IG Laboratories, the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Los Alamos National Laboratory announced the discovery at the 1995 Renal Cystic Disease Workshop in Bethesda at the end of last month. IG and the Johns Hopkins have filed a patent application on the gene's sequence, which is published in Human Molecular Genetics (April). The gene was tracked-down by a European team last year (see Clinica No 609, p 16).</p>

<p>The American PKD1 Consortium has identified the polycystic kidney disease gene and has begun exploring its function. The consortium, IG Laboratories, the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Los Alamos National Laboratory announced the discovery at the 1995 Renal Cystic Disease Workshop in Bethesda at the end of last month. IG and the Johns Hopkins have filed a patent application on the gene's sequence, which is published in Human Molecular Genetics (April). The gene was tracked-down by a European team last year (see Clinica No 609, p 16).</p><p>More than 500,000 Americans suffer from PKD - which causes progressive damage as fluid-filled cysts develop in the kidneys - and 6-7,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. ADPKD affects one in 1,000 people and about 10% of kidney dialysis and transplant patients in Europe and the US have the disease. Complications include aneurysms of the aorta and blood vessels in the brain. A DNA-based test would substantially improve the likelihood of early diagnosis in families with a history of vascular problems, which often manifest themselves before kidney disease per se. A genetic test would also be useful for identifying closely-related individuals as kidney donors.</p>
