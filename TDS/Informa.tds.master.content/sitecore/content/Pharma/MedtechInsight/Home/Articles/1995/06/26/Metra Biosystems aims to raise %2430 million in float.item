<p>One of a spate of spring public offerings from the medtech and diagnostics sector, <strong>[C#199000554:Metra Biosystems]</strong> (US) is taking the plunge after submitting its bone resorption tests to the US FDA for 510(k) approval in April and May. The Californian company intends to sell three million shares to raise about $30 million net at an assumed IPO offering price of $11 before the end of June.

<p>One of a spate of spring public offerings from the medtech and diagnostics sector, <strong>[C#199000554:Metra Biosystems]</strong> (US) is taking the plunge after submitting its bone resorption tests to the US FDA for 510(k) approval in April and May. The Californian company intends to sell three million shares to raise about $30 million net at an assumed IPO offering price of $11 before the end of June. Proceeds will be used to expand marketing, manufacturing capacity and fund clinical studies.</p><p>Metra's float would be priced similarly to that of its closest competitor, Ostex, at the beginning of the year (see Clinica No 640, p 10). In May, Ostex received 510(k) clearance for its bone resorption test, Osteomark (No 655, p 17). Metra warns in its prospectus that in the absence of FDA clearance for its Pyrilinks bone resorption test "Ostex may gain a significant advantage in terms of establishing relationships with collaborative partners and in securing market acceptance for its products". So far, Metra has entered into co-promotion and co-development agreements with companies such as Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, Ciba Corning Diagnostics and <strong>[C#198601109:Hybritech]</strong>, to adapt its tests to work with the installed base of automated systems. Metra competitors other than Ostex, include Bio-Rad Laboratories, Corning Nichols Institute, DSL, IncStar, Orion (Finland) and Osteometer (Denmark).</p><pre>Regulatory status of Metra's products Product name/ Launch Regulatory Status application date US Key International Markets Bone Resorption Pyrilinks 1992 Research use, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK - (polyclonal) 510(k) resubmitted clinical & research; April 1995 France, Japan - research Pyrilinks(II)1994 Research use, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK - (monoclonal) 510(l) submitted clinical & research; May 1995 France, Japan - research Pyrilinks-D 1993 Research use, France, Germany, Italy, 510(k) submitted Spain,UK-clinical&research; May 1995 Japan - research Bone Formation Alkphase-B 1995 Research use, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK - 510(k) scheduled clinical & research; to be submitted France, Japan - research June 1995 NovoCalcin 1993 Research use Germany, Italy, Spain, UK - clinical & research; Japan - research Growth Disorders Prolagen-C 1993 Research use Germany, Italy, Spain, UK - clinical & research; France, Japan - research</pre><p>Metra is currently selling five immunodiagnostic tests to measure bone resorption and formation and one to detect certain paediatric growth disorders, called Prolagen-C. In the US and Japan, these products are sold for research use only. In Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, they are sold for research and clinical use (see chart). Metra expects to submit a 510(k) for clinical use of its Alkphase-B in June 1995. This is one of its two bone formation tests, the other being NovoCalcin.</p><p>Metra's R&D efforts mainly focus on developing new formats for its tests. Another strand of work is the development of FactorBP-3, a test for insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, which is produced by the liver in response to growth hormone in the blood. The company expects FactorBP-3 to be introduced for research use during 1996.</p><pre>Metra's results Year ended Jun 30th 9 months ended Mar 31st 1993 1994 1994 1995 Product sales 0.62 1.44 0.99 1.80 Partner revenue 2.06 2.03 1.24 0.55 Total sales 2.68 3.47 2.23 2.35 Net loss (3.58) (3.58) (2.70) (4.60)</pre><p>International sales accounted for 79% of product sales in the first nine months of 1995 compared with 68% a year earlier and the company expects them to continue to account for a significant portion of future revenues. Metra warns that in order to expand international sales, the company may need to establish additional foreign operations and distributors, requiring financial resources which could affect its operating margins.</p>
