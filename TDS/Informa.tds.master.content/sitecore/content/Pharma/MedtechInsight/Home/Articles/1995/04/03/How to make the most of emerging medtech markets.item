<p>The emerging markets for medical technology account for just 5% of the $93,000 million world market but are growing at three times the rate of Europe and the US. India, China, Indonesia and Thailand are among those countries which are viewed as offering the greatest growth opportunities for Western device and diagnostic companies. Ulrich Nafe, chairman of EUCOMED, and Mark Throdahl, president of <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong>'s Drug Delivery division, considered industry's role in making the most of these opportunities at HIMA's annual meeting in California last month.</p>

<p>The emerging markets for medical technology account for just 5% of the $93,000 million world market but are growing at three times the rate of Europe and the US. India, China, Indonesia and Thailand are among those countries which are viewed as offering the greatest growth opportunities for Western device and diagnostic companies. Ulrich Nafe, chairman of EUCOMED, and Mark Throdahl, president of <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong>'s Drug Delivery division, considered industry's role in making the most of these opportunities at HIMA's annual meeting in California last month.</p><p>While Western Europe has economic and regulatory stability it is experiencing little growth, said Dr Nafe. Eastern Europe offers little hope for expansion in the near future. The political and economic restraints in the ex-Soviet Union pose too many risks and while Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary present better potential markets, they are much smaller.</p><pre>European medtech market ($ millions) Western Europe 20,414 Russia 800 Poland 420 Czech Republic 175 Hungary 160 Rest of E Europe 854 Source: MDIS</pre><p>The projected economic growth of Far East countries represents greater investment in healthcare and better opportunities for medtech companies, believes Dr Nafe. OECD figures suggest an 11.6% expansion in the Chinese economy in 1993-95; this compares with just 2.4% for Western economies. Economic growth in Singapore is put at 9%, in Malaysia 8.6% and Thailand 8.3%.</p><p>While there are opportunities for Western companies in the emerging markets, the challenges of a different regulatory and business environment must also be recognised, pointed out Dr Nafe. Many of the Far East markets, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan, have little or no regulation of medtech products. Others, such as Thailand, are developing quality systems and international standards, while South Korea is introducing a US FDA-type system.</p><p>Mr Throdahl sees a role for HIMA in working with governments in these countries to assist in developing regulatory systems. The establishment of an office in Singapore last month will enable the US industry association to foster better relations with key healthcare and regulatory officials in the region.</p><p>Industry needs to take a proactive role in helping to develop regulatory systems, agreed Dr Nafe. He highlighted fundamental differences in Western and Eastern business approaches. In order to take advantage of the emerging markets, companies need to initiate contacts and build trust with local businesses. Unlike the Western approach, business relationships have to be cultivated over a period of time. National trade associations should be set up and supported by Western industry, which could also advise and support national authorities, added Dr Nafe.</p><p>individual markets</p><p>Mr Throdahl presented a snapshot of some of the opportunities and challenges in selected markets.</p><p>* Japan, the third largest market after the US and Western Europe, accounts for 18% of world sales at $16,700 million. While annual medtech growth is 6%, the disposable product sector is expanding at 10-15%. Equipment growth rate is slower at 3-5%.</p><p>Instrument innovation in Japan and development of technologies are seen as opportunities. Additionally, Japanese quality sets the global standard enabling Western companies to compete with Japanese companies on their home ground. Negative factors cited by Mr Throdahl are the quality of local management and reimbursement issues.</p><p>* The $850 million Chinese medtech market is growing at around 20% per annum. Some 70% of the market is accounted for by imports, with Japanese companies having a higher share (25%) than US industry (21%). There are some 1,000 established manufacturers in China but quality is low, according to Mr Throdahl. Profitability, corruption and regulatory inconsistency are viewed as the main challenges to Western companies.</p><p>* New regulatory requirements for medical device imports, which account for 67% of the $750 million market in South Korea, are a major challenge for importing companies (see Clinica No 611, p 10). The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs reimburses 80% of healthcare and encourages local industry.</p><p>* A reduction in import tariffs to 50% (15% on components) by the Indian authorities has eased entry to the $500 million Indian market which is growing at 15% annually. Liberalisation of foreign investment has also helped, says Mr Throdahl, and the government is committed to healthcare. Despite these advantages, companies face low-priced competition, poor local management, inflation and problems with the infrastructure and regulatory systems.</p><p>company strategies</p><p>Timing of growth in these markets is uncertain since countries place different priorities on healthcare. Mr Throdahl also pointed out that market evolution may not mirror European and US market development as a result of differing clinical practices. Profitability cannot be assured, given local competitors, and adequate local management is a real problem.</p><p>Despite these caveats, he advised companies to capitalise on opportunities by developing long-term regional plans to complement their global business strategies. Outcomes data from local clinical trials could be used to manage reimbursement. Mr Throdahl advised companies to move away from centralised North American management and empower local managers.</p>
