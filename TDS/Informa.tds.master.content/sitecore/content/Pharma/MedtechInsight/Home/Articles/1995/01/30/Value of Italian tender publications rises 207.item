<p>Italian local health authorities and public sector hospitals published Lit 781,000 million ($480 million) worth of tenders in 1994, an increase of 20.7% over the 1993 figure. This does not necessarily mean that 20% more is being spent on goods and services by the USLs and hospitals; it is more likely that closer government scrutiny has led to an increased tendency to publish.</p>

<p>Italian local health authorities and public sector hospitals published Lit 781,000 million ($480 million) worth of tenders in 1994, an increase of 20.7% over the 1993 figure. This does not necessarily mean that 20% more is being spent on goods and services by the USLs and hospitals; it is more likely that closer government scrutiny has led to an increased tendency to publish.</p><p>The increase in healthcare tenders compares with an overall rise of 12.3% in the value of all tenders published by the public administration, according to a study by the Cresme research centre reported in Il Sole-24 Ore. Most sectors recorded a static first half due to the much contested contract law, followed by an increase in the second half once it had been abolished.</p><p>There has also been a rise in the number of tenders being published - due to a tendency for lots to be divided and for more, smaller tenders to be issued. Last year a total of 25,263 tenders worth Lit 18,513,600 million were published, compared with 18,743 tenders at Lit 15,877,800 million in 1993. The average value per tender fell from Lit 1,226 million in 1993 to Lit 1,070 million in 1994.</p><p>It is interesting to note that Euro-Bid Watch observed an 8% drop in the number of prosthesis tenders published in Italy over the 23 months to November 1994 (see Clinica No 638, p 6).</p>
