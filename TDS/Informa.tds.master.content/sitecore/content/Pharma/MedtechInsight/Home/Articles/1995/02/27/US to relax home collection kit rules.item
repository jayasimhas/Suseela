<p>Within the next few days, the US Food & Drug Administration plans to propose consideration of less stringent criteria for home-collection kits to detect serious diseases, such as AIDS. A week ago, the agency announced final mandatory performance standards for infant apnoea monitoring devices. The enactment of these regulations may be delayed, however, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p>

<p>Within the next few days, the US Food & Drug Administration plans to propose consideration of less stringent criteria for home-collection kits to detect serious diseases, such as AIDS. A week ago, the agency announced final mandatory performance standards for infant apnoea monitoring devices. The enactment of these regulations may be delayed, however, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>One of the new Republican Congress's major goals is to lessen government regulation. Legislation contained in bill HR 9 to accomplish this, now under consideration in the House, would begin by setting a six-month moratorium on government rules in progress since last November - including the regulations on diagnostic kits and monitoring devices.</p><p>The bill would also require important changes in rulemaking at the FDA and other government agencies - such as stringent risk-assessment and cost-benefit analyses - before regulations could be proposed. The legislation would require agencies to prioritise risks based on their threat to public health. HR 9 strives to reduce the paperwork burden - and associated costs - regulations impose on industry.</p><p>"One of the major concerns" with this legislation, House Speaker Newt Gingrich admits, is that risk-assessment analysis might prove unduly burdensome for healthcare companies. However, it is not written in stone, he added, suggesting that changes might be made when the Senate considers HR 9 or similar legislation. They may also add a few loopholes for desirable regulations.</p>
