<p>Component manufacturers should not be covered by the GMP regulations, consider members of the US FDA's Device Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Advisory Committee. However, at their meeting on September 13th and 14th to discuss the working draft of new GMP requirements, they recommended that all those who install, service or refurbish medical devices should be covered. This includes end users such as hospitals. The panel recommended that the law take effect between six and 18 months after publication of the final rule, which is expected in June next year.</p>

<p>Component manufacturers should not be covered by the GMP regulations, consider members of the US FDA's Device Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Advisory Committee. However, at their meeting on September 13th and 14th to discuss the working draft of new GMP requirements, they recommended that all those who install, service or refurbish medical devices should be covered. This includes end users such as hospitals. The panel recommended that the law take effect between six and 18 months after publication of the final rule, which is expected in June next year.</p><p>Panel members discussed the differences between ISO 9001 and the proposed FDA GMP standards. While the GMP requirements attempt to copy the ISO standards, they have been altered to avoid copyright problems. Revisions were also made because the ISO standards are voluntary while GMP standards are legal requirements. In general the US GMP requirements contain more omissions than additions to the ISO standards.</p><p>Several changes to the draft document have been made since the last public meeting in August. In addition to the exclusion of component manufacturers, several definitions including that of manufacturer and servicer have changed. The term "end of life" has been deleted. Manufacturer purchasing controls are to include evaluation of consultants similar to the evaluation of suppliers of parts and services. Traceability of devices remains a requirement and extends to the first person outside the manufacturer's control.</p><p>Many industry representatives who spoke before the panel supported removal of component manufacturers from regulation. However there was disagreement regarding the inclusion of servicers. While some argued that the law should encompass all servicers including hospitals, others said they should be regulated by other means. It was noted that legislation was needed to ensure that manufacturers provide third party servicers with access to service manuals or these groups will not be able to continue business and comply with the law.</p><p>A representative for the Health Industry Manufacturers Association said the trade organisation opposed legislation which requires manufacturers to give information to independent servicers. Several speakers complained that the new regulations could come into effect six months after publication while European authorities are allowing manufacturers three years to comply with new GMP regulations.</p><p>While the panel was unanimous in its recommendation not to include component manufacturers under the scope of the GMP legislation, they were divided (5 to 4 in favour) on the issue of third party servicers, installers and refurbishers. The panel voted 5 to 4 in favour of recommending that hospitals and other end users be covered by the new regulation along with the third party servicers. Members voted unanimously in favour of recommending that the new GMP legislation include wording that the manufacturer must supply safety and performance information including service manuals to those needing the information.</p><p>Panel members voted 6 to 3 in favour of recommending that the legislation take effect within six months of publication, except for the design control provisions and for those which were not previously regulated by GMP - these would become effective within 18 months.</p>
