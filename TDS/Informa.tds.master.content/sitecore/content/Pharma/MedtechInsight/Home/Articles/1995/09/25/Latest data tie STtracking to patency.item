<p>New data from TIMI-4 trial patients confirms the usefulness of ST segment tracking for predicting patency of infarcted vessels early in the treatment of acute MI. ST segment monitoring is widely believed to be a valid method of detecting coronary reperfusion, but conflicting results have been reported.</p>

<p>New data from TIMI-4 trial patients confirms the usefulness of ST segment tracking for predicting patency of infarcted vessels early in the treatment of acute MI. ST segment monitoring is widely believed to be a valid method of detecting coronary reperfusion, but conflicting results have been reported.</p><p>Writing in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers from Miami University School of Medicine say their data go some way to explaining the contradictions. ST must be measured continuously or at least every 10 minutes and changes must be evaluated against the peak level, not initial level, as ST segment fluctuates widely during MI, says the team which was led by Dr Aland Fernandez. Monitoring is enhanced by quantitative computer-assisted measurement.</p><p>Using TIMI-4 trial patients the researchers were able to compare ST segment data and early angiography, which was used to compare the efficacy of various thrombolytic strategies. The findings will be important for cardiac centres that do not have access to angiography, which is also highly sensitive if used early.</p><p>Defining ST recovery as a >=50% drop from the peak level gave maximum sensitivity and specificity, say the researchers, although sensitivity falls from 96% at one hour to 85% by 90 minutes.</p><p>In an accompanying editorial, Dr Gerald Timmis points out that RESCUE and TAMI-5 both highlight the desirability of rescue angioplasty for failed thrombolysis. "From the standpoint of both salvage and rescue, immediate determination of reperfusion outcomes, however achieved, is now clinically essential."</p><p>A number of manufacturers make sophisticated digital surveillance systems, including Ortivus Medical (Sweden) and Mortara Instruments (US). State-of-the-art equipment cost in excess of $7,500 and real-time bedside diagnosis requires bedside computing equipment to evaluate constantly the data, which adds to the cost.</p>
