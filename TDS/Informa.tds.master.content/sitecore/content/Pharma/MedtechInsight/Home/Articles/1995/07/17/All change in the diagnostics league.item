<p>Last year's takeovers in the diagnostics industry have made a significant impact at the top of the league table, reports Brigitte Ascher.</p><p>The purchase of Kodak's clinical diagnostics propelled Johnson & Johnson from number six to three. The switch of Ciba-Geigy's diagnostics business to Chiron carried the US-biotechnology company into the top ten in worldwide diagnostics. And in February, German company Behring Diagnostics acquired Syva and climbed from ninth to seventh.</p><p>So far this year, Clinica has recorded 16 mergers and acquisitions, about 20% of the total medtech M&A deals. Apart from Glaxo's pricey Affymax takeover, which has only peripheral impact on the sector, one of the largest deals was Hewlett-Packard's taking a stake in I-Stat (see list).</p><p>Diagnostics businesses now up for sale include <strong>[C#198600152:Eli Lilly]</strong>'s last-remaining medtech business, <strong>[C#198601109:Hybritech]</strong> - the diagnostics company with the worst sales decline in 1994. In May, DuPont offered its $335 million-turnover diagnostics operation on the market.</p><p>In diagnostics, the dominance by US companies is less pronounced than in the medical device and diagnostics markets combined. They contribute around 56% to total diagnostics turnover compared with some 60% in the overall medtech market. European companies, on the other hand, are much stronger in diagnostics with a 39% share of the market as opposed to 30% in the combined sectors. The diagnostics league table captures around 80% of the total diagnostics market estimated at $20,000 million by HIMA and indicates that the total market has grown 4% in 1994.</p><p>In June, Clinica published a table of the top 100 companies in the medical device and diagnostics industry (Clinica No 659, pp 14-15). In May, tables of the orthopaedics (No 654, supplement p 2) and the contrast media industries (No 654, p 12) were published.</p>
