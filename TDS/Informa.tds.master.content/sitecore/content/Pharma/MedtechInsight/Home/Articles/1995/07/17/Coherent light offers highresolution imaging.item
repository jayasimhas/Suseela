<p>Researchers in the US have developed a non-invasive, non-contact optical imaging technique which is already proving itself in ophthalmic applications. A prototype system has undergone extensive preclinical trials for high-<strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> cross-sectional imaging of the eye for early signs of disease and is now being transferred to industry.</p><p>Using safe and inexpensive communications technology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineers have developed optical coherence tomography (OCT), a technique in which coherent infrared radiation is passed through tissue to a depth of one or two millimetres and reflected light detected by interferometry. The technique is similar to ultrasound except that the information in the image depends on differences in optical rather than acoustic backscattering of tissue, the researchers say.</p><p>The beauty of the system is its resolution - structures measuring just 10 micro m are visible, making the technique useful for monitoring nerve fibre changes in the eye as an early indicator of glaucoma, macular degeneration and macular oedema. Blurring caused by patient movement is reduced using image processing software. "This is the first time we can look at a cross-sectional image of the eye at this level," James Fujimoto, professor of electrical engineering at MIT, told Clinica at last month's LaserMED 95 meeting in Munich, Germany. Prof Fujimoto believes the technique may offer earlier diagnosis of the leading causes of blindness.</p><p>A team headed by Dr Carmen Puliafito, chair of ophthalmology at the New England Eye Center at Tufts University, Boston, has used OCT on over 1,000 patients to date. Colour-coded images have a resolution ten times greater than conventional ultrasound. Another advantage of the technique is that unlike ultrasound it does not require contact with the eye or the use of saline solution.</p><p>optical biopsy</p><p>The next challenge for OCT is measuring non-transparent, highly scattering tissue. Working in collaboration with Dr Mark Brezinski at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the MIT researchers are now focusing on a system for in vivo optical biopsy. This would potentially allow a catheter fitted with an OCT device to produce high-resolution images of the morphology of atherosclerotic plaques for example. Some images have already been produced in vitro - the latest development is a new laser source which generates femtosecond duration (10(-15) seconds) pulses of infrared radiation to produce in vitro images with resolutions down to 3.7 microns.</p><p>With an in vivo imaging technique that has a resolution one to two orders higher than MRI, it may be possible to monitor early disease processes and guide intervention. There is still work to be done in combining the technique with a catheter or endoscope and speeding up image acquisition to allow real-time guidance of interventions. Prof Fujimoto does not see OCT displacing current imaging technologies though, rather "optical biopsy can provide more detailed information complementary to these techniques".</p>
