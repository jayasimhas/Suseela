<p>Caremark's (US) First Activity home uterine monitoring (HUAM) device does not help medical professionals detect pre-term labour in high-risk pregnancies nor is it linked to improved birth outcomes. Data on the device, which gathers uterine contraction information and transmits it to health centres by telephone, were presented at the annual meeting of the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians in Atlanta, US, on January 26th.</p>

<p>Caremark's (US) First Activity home uterine monitoring (HUAM) device does not help medical professionals detect pre-term labour in high-risk pregnancies nor is it linked to improved birth outcomes. Data on the device, which gathers uterine contraction information and transmits it to health centres by telephone, were presented at the annual meeting of the Society of Perinatal Obstetricians in Atlanta, US, on January 26th.</p><p>Caremark says the 33-month, multicentre study involved 1,355 women and is the first trial of the device to meet appropriate scientific validity criteria. In the study group HUAM data were made available to nurses, while in the control group the data were transmitted to a base station but kept secret. The study found no statistical difference in the rate of pre-term birth, birthweight or infant complications.</p><p>Attempting to put a positive light on the Caremark-funded study, Sandra Austin, president of the company's clinical management services division, said: "The medical community is not in total agreement about whether the availability of the monitoring data provided any additional benefits." However, medical monitor Professor Lawrence Devoe told the conference: "In fact, the study group that received specialised nursing care without the aid of the device performed as well as groups analysed in previous studies that used the device."</p><p>The US FDA is also sceptical of HUAM, attributing beneficial outcomes to the extensive nurse-patient contact that trial groups receive - a theory that Caremark accepts. The US Preventive Services Task Force reviewed all English language HUAM studies and trials in 1993 and found that there was inadequate evidence that home monitoring itself improves clinical outcome (see Clinica No 562, p 17).</p>
