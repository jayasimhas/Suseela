<p>Two US densitometer manufacturers are about to face each other across the court room. Lunar and Hologic are involved in several patent lawsuits related to X-ray and ultrasound densitometers. The first trial is scheduled to begin on September 25th.</p><p>The litigation is expensive for both these small, public companies. Lunar incurred $766,000 in legal costs in the latest quarter and the company expects continuing high legal costs through fiscal 1996. Hologic's third-quarter accounts show comparable legal bills.</p><p>Wisconsin-based Lunar describes itself as the market leader in bone densitometers with more than 3,400 X-ray and ultrasound instruments installed worldwide. In a separate product line, Lunar has US and Canadian rights to market the Artoscan extremity MRI, manufactured by Italian company Esaote.</p><p>Lunar reported 48% sales growth to $44.6 million in fiscal 1995 (ended June). Net income increased 15% to $6.7 million. Dr Richard Mazess, Lunar's president, attributes this to increased sales in each of the company's product lines, including the Expert DPX X-ray densitometers, the Achilles ultrasound densitometers and the Artoscan MRI.</p><p>Hologic, based in Massachusetts, has a similar turnover but has fewer instruments installed. It made a $3 million profit on $38 million sales in fiscal 1994 ended September. Its sales growth in the first nine months of fiscal 1995 does not match that of its opponent. Hologic's revenues grew only 7% to $30.5 million and the company's profits halved to $1.3 million.</p><p>Around 2,300 Hologic densitometers have been installed since it was founded in 1986. Late last year, the company decided to expand into two other segments of the bone densitometry market - ultrasound via the acquisition of WalkerSonix and biochemical markers via a development agreement with Serex.</p><p>Merck promotes osteoporosis diagnosis</p><p>Merck struck its agreements with Lunar and Hologic in June. Merck's interest in improving the diagnosis of osteoporosis stems from the expectation that its Fosamax drug (alendronate sodium) will soon be available as a non-hormonal treatment for osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.</p><p>As part of the deal, Merck will provide financial assistance to the two densitometer companies in placing additional equipment. It will also provide educational programmes to increase general awareness of bone mineral density testing. The company estimates that there are more than 700 instruments in clinical use in the US but adds there are still many parts without the equipment.</p>
