<p>Applied Imaging is among US companies to benefit from the initiative set up by the US and Israeli governments to promote technology partnerships between the two countries. A $550,000 grant has been awarded by the BIRD (Binational Industrial Research & Development) Foundation for the development of cytogenetic tests by Applied Imaging. The US company has set up an Israeli subsidiary which will focus on its foetal cell enrichment development programme.</p>

<p>Applied Imaging is among US companies to benefit from the initiative set up by the US and Israeli governments to promote technology partnerships between the two countries. A $550,000 grant has been awarded by the BIRD (Binational Industrial Research & Development) Foundation for the development of cytogenetic tests by Applied Imaging. The US company has set up an Israeli subsidiary which will focus on its foetal cell enrichment development programme.</p><p>The technology enables prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities with a simple venipuncture early in gestation. The Israeli research will work on increasing the sensitivity of the test and establishing certain performance parameters for the process. Applied Imaging's technology is expected to provide a safe, accurate and inexpensive procedure.</p><p>Over 2 million screening tests are performed each year in the US to detect common chromosomal abnormalities. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, offered to pregnant women over 35, has a small risk (0.5-2%) of foetal loss and is expensive - usually over $1,000. Serum screening, which is used in women under 35, has a high false positive rate, says Applied Imaging.</p><p>Dr Mitchell Golbus will manage the Israeli subsidiary and act as scientific advisor to the US parent. Dr Yaron Lapidot has been appointed project manager while Dr Alex Saunders will co-ordinate the project from the US. Applied Imaging recently completed a $4.65 million round of financing which will be used for multicentre clinical trials with the technology.</p>
