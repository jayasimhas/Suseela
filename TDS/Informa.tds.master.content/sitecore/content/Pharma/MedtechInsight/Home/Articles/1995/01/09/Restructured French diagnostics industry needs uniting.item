<p>In a difficult year for the industry, changes in market conditions and new legislation have forced some companies to close while others have had their products withdrawn. Claude Buffard, head of the French diagnostics industry association, SFRL, reviews events of the past year.</p><p>The inclusion of in vitro diagnostics within the remit of the Agence du Medicament has had significant repercussions for the profession. The Agency took over responsibility for the application of laboratory reagent legislation from the national health laboratory (LNE) in January 1993, and is increasingly applying strict rules to its field of activity. In preparation for its new role of inspecting reagent producers and importers, the Agency is already recruiting inspectors.</p><p>A law passed in January 1994 confirmed the Agency's power to withdraw reagents either temporarily or permanently if they represent a risk to public health. The IVD industry is confronted with periodic evaluations of "sensitive" reagents: HIV, hepatitis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis and rubella. Tumoral markers will soon be added to this list and any reagents failing to comply with criteria defined by the Agency will be withdrawn from sale. Nine tests for HIV detection were withdrawn in July 1993 and four HCV tests in September 1993 for lack of sensitivity. Subsequently, four more HIV tests were withdrawn in October 1994 as a result of their failure to identify one of the six samples of HIV subtype O sera used by the expert assessors. Finally, on November 14th, three HCV tests were withdrawn.</p><p>The diagnostics industry association, SFRL, has asked the Agency to give advance notice of the sensitivity criteria which must be met by these reagents so that, if possible, the industry can adapt production to meet these new demands.</p><p>Following a decree on September 8th, 1982, the French IVD industry has been required to comply with a registration system for all reagents intended for use in all medical laboratories. Registration is accepted on the presentation of a technical file in which the manufacturer guarantees the technical specifications of the product.</p><p>Other decrees have specified the conditions for the registration of blood grouping and RIA reagents. Special conditions have been laid down for the registration of reagents for HIV and hepatitis screening. These include preliminary assessments and the expert verification of the sensitivity and the specificity of the results. In the case of HIV reagents, batch-by-batch controls are conducted.</p><p>Meetings between Agency experts and SFRL working groups have been held with a view to defining procedures for the registration of rapid HIV tests and molecular biology reagents. A proposal, drafted by the SFRL, on the procedures for the registration of reagents and systems for retroviruses and hepatitis is currently being updated prior to its evaluation and validation by the Agency. The industry association has also prepared a working document on reaction surveillance for the Committee.</p><p>In addition to regulatory pressures, the French market is also subject to control of health expenditure. In 1993, the French social security budget showed a deficit of some Fr 56,400 million ($10,444 million) and the forecasts for 1994 were even more catastrophic. Increases in unemployment led to a fall in receipts which put the entire national health system at risk.</p><p>Thresholds for growth in expenditure have been agreed every year since 1992 with the directors of private medical laboratories and, more recently, with doctors, under the Health Ministry's contractual system. This involves healthcare professionals who signed agreements with health insurance funds relating to the annual level of growth of reimbursed expenditure.</p><p>The directors of private medical laboratories have always fulfilled their part of the contract. Indeed, the rate of annual growth of 4.82% agreed for 1993 was not even reached - it increased only 0.8%. With the private sector accounting for over 40% of the market, the diagnostics industry has been adversely affected by reduced turnover of laboratories.</p><p>The level of growth for 1994 was set at 3.4%. The agreement signed with the doctors provided for the publication of Opposable Medical References (OMR), proposals of good practices and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies which also limited the prescriptions issued by doctors. The first list of these references appeared in March 1994.</p><p>The negative list, together with the fact that the failure to apply these proposals is liable to result in sanctions being taken, has resulted in a significant drop in biomedical prescriptions and the turnover of private medical laboratories has fallen by 15% - in certain sectors, even more. Once again, the diagnostics industry has been affected by these measures.</p><p>To combat these problems, the private sector has been forced to restructure, resulting in the emergence of commercial professional groupings which allow the association of no more than five laboratories. Greater numbers of laboratories can work together under a different legal framework. Such groupings make it possible to establish technical platforms and a number have implemented quality assurance systems based on ISO 9000.</p><p>This restructured biological sector brings with it particular requirements in the fields of maintenance and personnel training and demands even greater guarantees of the profitability and quality of its supplies. It also requires techniques which can be used easily and more quickly in order to be able to operate with reduced staffing levels. At the same time, it needs to ensure the accuracy of results and the safety of operations - an essential issue among the public authorities following the problems of contaminated blood.</p><p>It is through the development of such services and exploiting the differences between them that companies will be able to move forward. The introduction of innovative, more precise and more reliable techniques together with new parameters to permit savings in the healthcare sector, coupled research into new markets, will be essential for the survival of the industry.</p>
