<p>Sofamor Danek has agreed to enter a strategic alliance with Genetics Institute in which the two US companies will develop biological products for use in spinal reconstruction. The products will use biopharmaceutical manufacturer Genetics Institute's recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) to induce bone growth in the treatment of spinal disorders.</p>

<p>Sofamor Danek has agreed to enter a strategic alliance with Genetics Institute in which the two US companies will develop biological products for use in spinal reconstruction. The products will use biopharmaceutical manufacturer Genetics Institute's recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) to induce bone growth in the treatment of spinal disorders.</p><p>Under the agreement, Sofamor Danek will obtain exclusive North American rights to the rhBMP-2 technology as well as patents for spinal applications, for which it will pay Genetics Institute $50 million over four years. The transaction is likely to result in a $50 million one-time charge to Sofamor's 1995 first-quarter earnings. Both companies will share in the profits resulting from the alliance. They also plan jointly to fund an independent medical education and research institute dedicated to biological spine reconstruction.</p><p>The agreement expands Sofamor Danek's area of activity to include biological reconstruction and fixation of the spine for the first time. Genetics Institute's executive vice-president Tuan Ha Ngoc noted: "The alliance is part of Genetics Institute's overall strategy to become the market leader in the biological reconstruction of bone and other connective tissue."</p><p>An estimated 200,000 spinal fusion procedures were carried out in the US in 1994. Preclinical studies with rhBMP-2 have demonstrated that it may eventually eliminate the need for painful grafts involving bone from the patient's hip being transplanted into the spine, according to Sofamor.</p>
