<p>Agen Biomedical (Australia) has reported a 6.1% decrease in sales to Aus$4.1 million ($3.0 million) for the half-year ended December 31st, 1994. Production difficulties with the company's HIV tests are cited as one of the reasons for sales falling "considerably short of budget". Sales targets for the year as a whole are now not expected to be met, Agen says. The company sustained an operating loss of Aus$859,000 during the six months, down from a profit of Aus$124,000 for the corresponding 1993 period.</p>

<p>Agen Biomedical (Australia) has reported a 6.1% decrease in sales to Aus$4.1 million ($3.0 million) for the half-year ended December 31st, 1994. Production difficulties with the company's HIV tests are cited as one of the reasons for sales falling "considerably short of budget". Sales targets for the year as a whole are now not expected to be met, Agen says. The company sustained an operating loss of Aus$859,000 during the six months, down from a profit of Aus$124,000 for the corresponding 1993 period.</p><p>Restoration of sales growth is not likely to occur until Agen's SimpliRED endotoxin test and a number of veterinary tests are launched in the next financial year. A limited introduction of the endotoxin test in the UK and Australia took place at the beginning of this year (see Clinica No 641, p 20). Clinical trials with the test are continuing in Europe and Malaysia. The company notes that sales of cardiovascular diagnostics have "sustained some losses against increasingly aggressive competition".</p><p>"Substantial cuts" in research, marketing and administration expenses have been implemented by Agen in response to lack of sales growth. However, an Aus$3 million syndicated R&D programme will provide significant financial support to the company's research activities over the next 18 months. Agen is focusing on the development of "new devices, including instruments, which will be capable of performing a wide range of rapid tests" - particularly in the cardiovascular field. This programme is being conducted in collaboration with several leading Australian research institutes.</p><p>Agen is joining forces with three other diagnostic companies and four research institutes in Australia to form a Co-operative Research Centre (<strong>[C#199700211:CRC]</strong>) for the development of new diagnostic technologies. The CRC has gained some Aus$14 million of federal government funding over the next seven years.</p>
