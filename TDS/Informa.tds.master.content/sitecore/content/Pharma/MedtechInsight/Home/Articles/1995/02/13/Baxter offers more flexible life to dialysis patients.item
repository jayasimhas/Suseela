<p>In a UK marketing drive for the renal product introduced last summer (see Clinica No 616, p 21), Baxter maintains that the higher cost to the NHS of its HomeChoice dialysis system is more than offset by the gains in patients' quality of life resulting from treatment while asleep. William Kilgallon, Baxter's renal division's marketing manager stressed this point at a presentation in London.</p>

<p>In a UK marketing drive for the renal product introduced last summer (see Clinica No 616, p 21), Baxter maintains that the higher cost to the NHS of its HomeChoice dialysis system is more than offset by the gains in patients' quality of life resulting from treatment while asleep. William Kilgallon, Baxter's renal division's marketing manager stressed this point at a presentation in London.</p><p>Jane Whittome, business manager at St Thomas and Guy's Trust, compared the cost of the various techniques on a per patient per year basis: &pound;20,000 for haemodialysis (HD) which is delivered in hospital three times a week; &pound;9,000 for peritoneal dialysis (PD or CAPD) at four exchanges a day; and &pound;13,500 for automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), the treatment delivered by Baxter's HomeChoice, a portable, video recorder-sized machine cleaning patients' blood overnight. Around half of the cost of HomeChoice is disposables.</p><p>A study led by Dr L K King at the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, which compared APD and CAPD concluded that while average fluid and disposables costs were on a par, the cost per patient of treating infections for CAPD was 10-20 times higher than for APD in 1990 and 1991 (Advances in Peritoneal Dialysis, Vol 8, February 1992).</p><p>The potential UK market for HomeChoice is estimated by Baxter at about half the current 24,000 dialysis patients treated. In 1993, 66 patients per million population (pmp) received dialysis. This should, however, be closer to 80 pmp or, depending on age and ethnic mix of the population, as many as 130 pmp in certain areas in the UK, says Dr Paul Williams, consultant nephrologist at Addenbrookes and Ipswich hospitals. In the UK, an evaluation of renal services by the Department of Health is due to be published this spring and Baxter says the review is expected to show an increased need for kidney dialysis facilities and equipment.</p><p>The world market for APD is estimated to grow to around $700 million by the year 2000 from $125 million in 1994). Gambro and <strong>[C#198601363:Fresenius]</strong> are the closest competitors to market leader Baxter but these companies do not currently have a small machine designed for home use, according to Mr Kilgallon.</p>
