<p>Further support for radiation therapy as a beneficial adjunct to surgery in breast, rectal and prostate cancer patients was provided by speakers at the American Radium Society meeting in Paris, France, on April 29th-May 3rd.</p><p>Five-year survival was as good for patients treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy (85%) as those who had mastectomy (79%), regardless of the stage of breast cancer, according to a US study based on the National Cancer Data Base. Of 75,143 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, over 11,000 received breast-conserving treatment, almost 40,000 were treated with modified radical mastectomy without radiation and the remainder had other treatment combinations.</p><pre>Five-year survival rates (%) Lumpectomy Mastectomy Stage 1 disease 91% 87% Stage 2 disease 82% 76% Stage 3 disease 62% 56%</pre><p>Presenting an analysis of the figures, Dr David Winchester of Northwestern University Medical School cautioned that the data were not specifically designed to compare treatments. Nevertheless, he believed they support other clinical studies "which have reached similar conclusions but have recently been questioned because of alleged misconduct by study investigators".</p><p>new, cheaper biopsy procedure</p><p>Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USFNAC) is a simple and relatively inexpensive procedure to determine whether suspicious masses on mammograms are carcinogenic, according to Dr Thomas Frazier of the Bryn Mawr Hospital, Pennsylvania (US). The procedure demonstrated 100% accuracy in diagnosing cancers in 166 women based on a three-month follow-up. Some 17 early cancers were diagnosed where none could be felt, he said.</p><p>USFNAC costs $4,667 to diagnose each cancer, compared with $52,505 per cancer using conventional biopsy procedures. Dr Frazier calculated the cost of biopsy alone by averaging the costs of five patients at $5,377 for standard biopsy and $478 per USFNAC procedure.</p><p>radiation therapy for rectal cancer</p><p>Radiation therapy before surgery increases survival without increasing long-term complications for rectal cancer patients, according to Dr William Reed, professor of surgery at Tufts University School of Medicine (US). The 10-year survival rate for patients treated with radiation and resection was 74%, compared with 41% for patients who underwent resection alone. The 10-year survival rate for patients who had their tumour completely removed (75% of the 149 patients) was 80% for those treated with radiation and 45% for those who underwent surgery alone. Long-term complications from radiation therapy were minimal, he added.</p><p>There will be an estimated 38,000 new cases of rectal cancer this year.</p><p>benefits for prostate cancer</p><p>Radiation therapy is required in prostate cancer patients who have an elevated PSA level after surgery, according to Dr David Koeplin, a radiation oncologist at the University of California- San Francisco. Some 73% of 51 patients who were treated with radiation following a radical prostatectomy before the postoperative PSA reached a level of one remained free of disease four years after surgery. This compared with 38% of patients who had PSA levels ranging from 1-10.</p>
