<p>The European Commission is drafting a letter to the French authorities in response to their notification of the ban on the sale and implantation of all non-saline breast prostheses. The Commission will request more information from the government on its action, Clinica understands, and propose discussions with the authorities.</p><p>The Commission recognises that this is a particularly sensitive issue, given consumer and medical concern about the safety of the products and industry opposition to the new measure, and is carefully considering its response. A one-hour long television programme on the subject was broadcast in France during the third week of June.</p><p>The French decision to only allow onto the market condoms that are subject to batch control by a Notified Body according to the French condom standard, is also under discussion at the European Commission and regarded as sensitive. However, since this a question of agreeing satisfactory testing methods, rather than discussing the inherent safety of an entire product range, it is hoped that this will be easier to resolve.</p>
