<p>Further plans to streamline the US medical device approval process are contained in a package of FDA reforms announced by President Clinton on April 6th. They follow policy changes in device and drug regulation proposed last month (see Clinica No 647, p 9). Among actions envisaged by the Administration are a pilot project for third-party review of low-risk medical technology; harmonisation of key international standards; and the exemption of 125 more categories from review. The FDA also plans to charge medical device companies user fees to help speed up the review process.</p>

<p>Further plans to streamline the US medical device approval process are contained in a package of FDA reforms announced by President Clinton on April 6th. They follow policy changes in device and drug regulation proposed last month (see Clinica No 647, p 9). Among actions envisaged by the Administration are a pilot project for third-party review of low-risk medical technology; harmonisation of key international standards; and the exemption of 125 more categories from review. The FDA also plans to charge medical device companies user fees to help speed up the review process.</p><p>The Health Industry Manufacturers Association welcomed the reforms which "represent important first steps toward ensuring that patients receive more timely access to safe and effective technology. We also appreciate the willingness of the Administration to be held accountable to self-imposed deadlines for implementing the proposals." HIMA president Alan Magazine stresses that the association is not in favour of dismantling or abolishing the FDA.</p><p>HIMA's vice-president of global strategy and analysis, Ed Rozynski, applauds "the Administration's decision to seek legislation and, more immediately, to consider ways to streamline the process for exporting medical technologies awaiting US review to countries that have already approved them for local use".</p><p>While the incremental changes are likely to relieve some regulatory burdens on small medical device manufacturers, there are several "significant concerns" the Medical Device Manufacturers Association believes must be addressed. The industry association would like to see the elimination of 510(k)s for all Class I devices and the Reference List and continues to argue against industry user fees.</p>
