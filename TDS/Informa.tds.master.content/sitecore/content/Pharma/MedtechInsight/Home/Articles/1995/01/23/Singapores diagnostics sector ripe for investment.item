<p>The Singapore government has targeted the diagnostics sector as ripe for investment and suitable for receiving priority government support. The country not only has an active R&D programme but also a successful emerging commercial sector in diagnostics, says a recent report from the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA), Biotechnology in Singapore.</p>

<p>The Singapore government has targeted the diagnostics sector as ripe for investment and suitable for receiving priority government support. The country not only has an active R&D programme but also a successful emerging commercial sector in diagnostics, says a recent report from the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA), Biotechnology in Singapore.</p><p>Companies already active in the diagnostics field in Singapore include:</p><p>* Genelabs Diagnostics - established in 1993 by Genelabs Technologies (US) to target the South-East Asian healthcare market, the company conducts over 99% of its business outside Singapore. Genelabs Diagnostics markets Western blot tests for HIV, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and H pylori; ELISA tests for HIV, HTLV and hepatitis C and E; rapid tests for HIV, hCG, hepatitis C and dengue fever; and instrumentation and software for rapid automated Western blotting. The company has an active research programme in collaboration with the National University of Singapore investigating both invasive and noninvasive technologies and a variety of molecular approaches to infectious agent identification and verification, the BIA report says. Genelabs' facility producing Western blot assays for HIV infection is certified to ISO 9002.</p><p>* Saliva Diagnostics (Singapore) - until August 1994, the company was a subsidiary of Saliva Diagnostics of the US; the parent company now retains a 49% equity stake in the Singapore operation. The only product manufactured at present in Singapore is the Omni-Sal saliva collection device.</p><p>* Innovative Biotech - produces a diagnostic kit for nasopharyngeal cancer and is currently developing kits for thalassaemia screening and for the detection of IgA/IgM/IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii.</p><p>* Scitech Genetics - is undertaking research into diagnostics for viral diseases.</p><p>dengue diagnosis</p><p>Research under way at Singapore's Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology is expected to lead to the development of "simple, early, rapid and reliable" diagnostic tests for dengue infection, according to the BIA report. Similar fundamental studies on human genital papillomavirus may contribute to the development of screening tests to determine the spread of the virus as well as its molecular diversity in humans.</p>
