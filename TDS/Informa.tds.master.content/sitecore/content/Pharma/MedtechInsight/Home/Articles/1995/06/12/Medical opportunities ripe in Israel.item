<p>Israel's Tel Aviv University is seeking business partners and funding for a range of medical device and diagnostic projects. Through its commercial arm, <strong>[C#200500057:Ramot]</strong>, the university is offering licensing opportunities in exchange for sponsorship of research projects and help in developing them for commercial applications. Current projects include:</p><p>* An enzyme immunoassay and prototype reagents for carboxypeptidase A and PLDH5. Patents applied for. Contact Mr Zeev Hollander.</p><p>* An immunoelectrode system based on antibodies bound to disposable felt carbon immunoelectrodes. $100-400,000 over one-two years required. Patent granted. Contact Dr Judith Rishpon.</p><p>* An anti-neuronal antibody test for Alzheimer's disease. Project aims to isolate and characterise the NF-H domain of the antibody for the disease and use it in an ELISA. $200-300,000 required over two-three years. Patent approved in Israel and pending in the US. Contact Prof Daniel Michaelson.</p><p>* Biological resurfacing of damaged human cartilage by autogeneic cell culturing and implant preparation. $600,000 over four years required. Patents granted in Israel, the US, the UK and Japan. Contact Prof Zvi Nevo.</p><p>* A biological, self-renewing, non-rigid, anchorage system for artificial implants. Experimental implants have been developed and tested successfully in vitro and in vivo in rats. Two-three years required to develop dental implants and three-five years for orthopaedic implants. Patents granted. Contact Dr Sandu Pitaru.</p><p>* Flexible, hollow fibres for infra-red energy transmission and temperature sensing. Patents have been granted and some therapeutic applications licensed. Two fibres are being developed: one for insertion into an endoscope and one for use in non-CO(2) lasers. $100-200,000 per year required. Contact Prof Nathan Croitoru.</p><p>* A contrast-enhanced echocardiography system. $150,000 required over three years. Patents granted. Contact Dr Victor Mor-Avi.</p><p>* A device for measuring the tightness of dental contiguity at contact points. A prototype has been developed and tested but additional studies are necessary to develop a hand-held instrument and a computerised version. Patent pending. Contact Alexander Vardimon.</p><p>Ramot can be contacted at 32 H Levanon St, POB 39296, Tel Aviv, Israel. Tel: +972 (3) 642 8765. Fax: +972 (3) 642 9865. Internet: Ramot@ccsg.tau.ac.il.</p>
