This was predominantly due to the 8.6% fall in exports, compared with a 4.4% rise in 1992.</p><pre>Japan's Medical Equipment Trade (Yen '000 millions) % change 1993* vs 1992 Exports 303.0 -8.6 Imports 456.7 +15.8 * provisional figuresSource: Ministry of Health & Welfare</pre><p>Product areas expected to experience rapid import growth in Japan over the next few years include: computed radiography systems; digital fluorography systems; PET; PACS; artificial kidneys; PTCA catheters and related products; angiography and microcatheters; thermal dilution catheters; angio fibre and ultrasound imaging products; sheath introducers; guide wires; surgical gloves; and medical non-woven fabric products.</p><p>the year gone by</p><p>A significant move was made in October to open up Japan's market to US - and other foreign - medical technology with the signing of a US/Japan trade accord. After months of difficult negotiations, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) agreed to issue a directive to all government hospitals to purchase more US medical equipment and diagnostic products and to report annually on the preceding year's purchases from foreign versus domestic suppliers.</p><p>In response to pressure from the US, the MHW agreed to delay implementation of new reimbursement prices for STMs (special treatment materials) until June 1st, 1994. STM producers - virtually all US companies - complained that they had only been given two weeks' notice of the proposed price changes.</p><p>The final version of the bill to revise Japan's medical device legislation was being drawn up by the MHW during the summer and was due to be presented to the Diet before the end of the year. Bringing Japanese device regulation in line with the US and EU, the new system will classify devices on the basis of patient risk. Class I devices will not require approval as long as they comply with GMP criteria, while Class II devices will have to undergo a marketing approval procedure. Class III products, such as artificial valves and pacemakers, will additionally require patient registration and tracking systems. The bill will also introduce regulations covering equipment maintenance, repair and re-evaluation.</p>
