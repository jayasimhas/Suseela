<p>German Health Minister Horst Seehofer's healthcare reform timetable looked under threat last week as rising costs (see Clinica No 660, p 3) forced him into crisis talks with the Krankenkassen, doctors and hospital representatives. While there is considerable agreement on the reforms, the Minister believes he must contain costs by the end of the year if the third stage of his reforms is to be successfully introduced.</p>

<p>German Health Minister Horst Seehofer's healthcare reform timetable looked under threat last week as rising costs (see Clinica No 660, p 3) forced him into crisis talks with the Krankenkassen, doctors and hospital representatives. While there is considerable agreement on the reforms, the Minister believes he must contain costs by the end of the year if the third stage of his reforms is to be successfully introduced.</p><p>Any draft law is expected to give most of the responsibility for administering the healthcare system to the medical profession and the Krankenkassen, reports Arzte Zeitung. However, Mr Seehofer has stressed that "if ... I produce a draft law recommending autonomy, while the Krankenkassen remain in the red, [it] will be thrown out".</p><p>The meeting last Tuesday will be followed on July 6th by the long-awaited report on healthcare reform from the Health Ministry's advisory healthcare committee; a special sitting on July 20th of the high-level Concerted Action on Healthcare group to discuss the report; and a meeting by the same group on September 14th to discuss health expenditure. Mr Seehofer adds: "If in the next 180 days we do not reach a decision to last the rest of the century, the reforms have no chance. The federal elections of 1998 will overshadow everything and hinder [them]."</p>
