<p>This review of events affecting the Australian medical device industry has been compiled by Anne Vukmanovich, manager of technical and regulatory affairs at the Medical Industry Association of Australia (MIAA).</p><p>In early 1994, as part of a strategic planning initiative, the various technical working parties of the MIAA were brought together under the umbrella of a single Technical & Regulatory Standing Committee with responsibility for co-ordination of industry activity relating to technical and regulatory issues. The Standing Committee's objectives are to ensure that, in all areas of technical and regulatory activity, industry is fully informed and leading the debate rather than reacting to changes. A second Diagnostics Standing Committee was also established to deal with the particular needs of the IVD sector.</p><p>The Technical & Regulatory and Diagnostics Standing Committees have committed to hold regular meetings and discussions with the relevant regulatory authorities, to facilitate communication between industry and legislators. Issues addressed during the year included amendments to controls on specific product types (urethral catheters, blood collection tubes, syringes and IOLs), labelling and revisions to the Australia GMP code.</p><p>In our pursuit of global harmonisation of device regulatory requirements, agreement was reached to adopt the European standard EN 46001 as the basis for a revised GMP code. The required legislative changes were made in May. The Australian industry has also become more active in global harmonisation activity, with representatives contributing to the Global Harmonisation Task Force and ISO TC 210.</p><p>TGA monitor</p><p>MIAA's Technical & Regulatory Standing Committee has resolved to act as a monitor of performance at the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA - Australia's device regulatory agency). Direct discussion with the appropriate sections of the TGA as well as through the industry representative on the Industry Government Consultative Committee are the mechanisms by which industry's views are submitted. Industry contributes to the costs of the government's therapeutic goods programme and it is appropriate that the services are delivered effectively and efficiently. By 1997/98, 50% of the costs of the therapeutic goods programme are to be met by industry. This will be phased in by a series of annual increases to the fees and charges applicable for registration and listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, premarket evaluation, GMP licence and inspection fees.</p><p>Several Therapeutic Goods Orders (TGOs), which are mandatory standards under the Therapeutic Goods Act of 1989, were undergoing revision through the year (urethral catheters, sutures, endotoxin and pyrogen testing and labelling requirements). Throughout the discussion on proposed changes, industry reinforced its commitment to the alignment with international requirements already in place.</p><p>clinical trials</p><p>On the clinical trial front, the MIAA submission to the Australian Health Ethics Committee's discussion paper on "legal liability, insurance and indemnity arrangements for institutional ethics committees (IECs)" emphasised the special considerations necessary in assessing clinical trial applications for devices, because of the added (and usual) step of surgical intervention. Two options for device trialling are available - the Clinical Trial Exemption (CTE) Scheme, which requires submission of data for TGA approval prior to commencement of the trial, and the Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) Scheme which allows a trial to proceed on notification of its acceptance by the relevant IEC.</p><p>Reiteration of the particular aspects of device trials in an independent "review of the role and functioning of IECs", it is hoped, will go some way to improving the level of confidence of IECs in approving device trials under the CTN Scheme.</p><p>device re-use</p><p>MIAA's persistence in pressuring for government action with respect to the practice of re-use of single-use devices led to the development of a draft national policy statement on re-use. Although finalisation was expected in late 1994, the decision by the National Health and Medical Research Council to establish an expert panel to obtain <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on a national approach, taking into consideration patient rights and safety, the responsibilities of manufacturers, re-manufacturers and service providers and the risks, costs and benefits of the practice has delayed development.</p><p>The review is not now expected to be completed before mid-1995 as it has been decided to conduct studies on the extent of re- use, the costs of re-manufacturing and the risks, before any recommendation is made to the NHMRC. Industry has challenged this proposal on the grounds that it is unnecessary to duplicate the work already done by an expert panel of the Therapeutic Goods Committee, meanwhile allowing the patient risk situation to continue.</p><p>The policy decisions of the Therapeutic Devices Evaluation Committee (TDEC) have a significant impact on the industry. MIAA has worked to decrease the "distance" between the industry and TDEC and, in the coming year, the objective is to encourage even greater transparency. The "reactive" mechanisms of the past are not appropriate in a continuously evolving legislative arena. Key issues which are currently on the agenda include: the establishment of a system of device tracking, amendments to the controls over devices of biological origin (in light of the emergence of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease), requirements for consumer product information, device classification (or re-classification), regulation of active implantables and computer-controlled devices.</p><p>diagnostics</p><p>MIAA's diagnostics sector has contributed to discussions on the evolution of the policy of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) as it affects the importation of biological products. Proposed policy amendments are intended to recognise the minimal risk of transmission of rare diseases by most IVDs and therefore to free up resources so that activity can be directed at higher risk product areas, thereby creating conditions where products can be imported more easily. Departmental restructuring in mid-year and the consequent loss of key personnel seems to have slowed progress in the implementation of new policy initiatives and the industry will recommence discussions in early 1995 as AQIS also moves towards a system of full cost recovery.</p><p>Other issues relevant to IVDs, which were addressed over the past year, included revisions to device labelling requirements to include "home use" IVDs, proposed elevation of the regulatory status of HIV and HCV kits to the level of "registrable" devices and further evaluation of the AQIS policy on importation of biologicals to include a system of broker's self-clearance agreements.</p><p>EU mutual recognition</p><p>The proposal for the signing of a Mutual Recognition Agreement between Australia and the European Union (to cover up to 11 industry sectors including medical devices) has also attracted industry's attention this year. At year end, three rounds of talks between the Australian and EU negotiating teams had been held. The purpose of the most recent round (November) was to finalise the scope of the agreement, to decide on the terminology to be used and to develop a dispute-solving mechanism, while still recognising the sovereignty and competitiveness of each party involved.</p><p>There are four product areas which are still to be resolved: devices of animal origin (largely due to Australia's particular quarantine restrictions); radioactive materials; devices incorporating substances which if used separately would be subject to the medicines directive; and products previously banned or restricted on safety grounds. The next round of talks is to be held in New Zealand in May 1995, with signing expected for those industry sectors for which negotiations have been completed. With respect to implementation, July 1st, 1995, is proposed, subject to <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> of outstanding issues.</p><p>medical waste</p><p>MIAA's Medical Waste Special Interest Group has had a very active year. It was recognised that there is a dearth of factual information on the proportion of total solid municipal waste that is represented by hospital waste and, of that, the proportion which is contaminated/infectious. MIAA commissioned Deakin University (Melbourne, Victoria) to examine and consolidate information on the relevant legislation governing hospital waste, the impact that waste classification has on volumes and consequent costs. The results of all but the last component were launched at seminars held in major capital cities throughout the year.</p><p>The report concluded that total hospital waste represents only 0.6% of the total solid waste stream in Australia, with "biomedical" waste representing one-sixth of that (ie 0.1% of total and 70% of the biomedical component attributable to waste generated as a consequence of direct patient care). The next project scheduled is the completion of a study on segregation effects, utilising data from actual hospital audits. Thereafter, it is intended that the issues of packaging and the use of plastics be addressed.</p>
