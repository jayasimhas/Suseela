<p> Wound care specialist Advanced Medical Solutions (AMS) today rebuffed an informal acquisition bid from fellow UK company and drug delivery firm Consort Medical. </p> <p> Rumours of potential takeover negotiations caused AMS shares to climb 20% to 40.5p each &ndash; its highest ever share price &ndash; during morning trading on the London Stock Exchange. This prompted Consort to acknowledge that it had made a verbal approach that &ldquo;may or may not lead to an offer being made for AMS&rdquo;. </p> <p> Shortly after Consort's announcement, Winsford-based AMS confirmed that it had received an approach with a &ldquo;verbal indication of a possible price to be offered&rdquo;, but this offer has been &quot;firmly rejected&quot;. Since then, AMS has not received a revised approach. It has also advised its shareholders to take no action at this stage. </p> <p> A spokesperson for Consort declined to comment any further, while a spokesperson for AMS did not elaborate on whether the approach was more financially- or strategically-motivated. </p> <p> AMS specialises in the design, development and manufacture of wound care products such as natural and synthetic polymer technology. Last year, the company made major strides in the market, after it enlisted orthopaedics heavyweight Stryker as the exclusive global distributor of its wound closure technology, LiquiBand, in the cranio-maxillo facial market (www.clinica.co.uk, July 9 2009). LiquiBand was then rolled out globally over the rest of the year and helped the company hit its full-year targets. </p> <p> In August 2009, AMS was granted 510(k) clearance by the US FDA for its silver-impregnated polyurethane foam dressings (www.clinica.co.uk, August 13 2009) and later in the year, bought the remaining 50% share of polyurethane foam manufacturer Corpura, a joint venture between AMS and Belgian company Recticel (www.clinica.co.uk, October 2 2009). These products, together with AMS' other wound dressing technologies, could provide the additional drug deliver platforms to grow the product portfolio of Consort. </p> <p> Hemel Hempstead-based Consort has been seeking to expand into adjacent drug delivery markets. In 2009, Consort built on its leadership position in the drug delivery and airway management market with the &pound;16.5m ($26.7m) acquisition of The Medical House (www.clinica.co.uk, September 24 2009). This acquisition saw Consort complement its Bespak drug delivery business by gaining TMH&rsquo;s portfolio of disposable autoinjector and a range of reusable needle-free injectors. </p>
