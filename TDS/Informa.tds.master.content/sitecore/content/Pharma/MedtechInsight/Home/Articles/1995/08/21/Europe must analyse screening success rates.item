<p>European Union cancer screening programmes need to be compared in the context of the European Parliament and Council's 1995-99 cancer action plan, argues ECOSOC's Committee of the Regions*. This recommendation was one of nine aimed at improving the plan. The group also proposed a special focus on breast, prostate and skin cancer because of their increasing incidence.</p><p>The Committee makes several criticisms of the plan and targets the "lack of a framework programme which would provide a binding approach" to its implementation. It also accuses the Commission of starting from an incorrect interpretation of subsidiarity and calls for greater regional involvement. It urges decision-makers to take account of regional quirks so that new measures can be better co-ordinated with regional projects.</p><p>* The Committee of the Regions is a Community advisory committee created by the Maastricht Treaty and reporting to the European Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC). It provides representation for the institutions of regional and local governments.</p>
