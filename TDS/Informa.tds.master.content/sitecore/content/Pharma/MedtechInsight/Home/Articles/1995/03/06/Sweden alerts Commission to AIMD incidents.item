<p>Warnings concerning the safety of two active implantable medical devices were notified to Sweden's Competent Authority at the end of February. They were the first two Swedish vigilance reports communicated to the National Board of Health and Welfare in the context of the AIMD Directive. The Board is unable to disclose the identity of the companies involved, on grounds of confidentiality.</p><p>The Board alerted the Commission immediately and was in the process of notifying other Member States as Clinica went to press. In all Sweden, has received some 10 vigilance warnings from other EU Member States, all involving products covered by the AIMD Directive.</p><p>The Swedish vigilance system, based on the medical device Directives, has been running since April 1994. It applies to all CE-marked products. There is also post-marketing control for non-CE-marked products: six regional inspectorates are responsible for reviewing the state and safety of equipment and all hospital care units are obliged to have quality assurance controls and to deal with problems as they occur. In this way the National Board of Health and Welfare receives both manufacturer and user reports.</p><p>The National Board of Health and Welfare receives some 200 reports of incidents from users a year. Approximately 50 of these concern injuries to patients or healthcare personnel and around five involve deaths. There are relatively few user reports of incidents involving AIMDs.</p><p>all products accounted for</p><p>Both CE-marked and non-CE marked medical devices are covered by the Swedish 1993 Medical Devices Act. European Union developments were seized upon as an opportunity to regulate the Swedish market early on. The Act demands high levels of performance with regard to health and safety for all devices and uses the same definitions as the AIMD and MD Directives. Additional ordinances have been published to introduce the Directives' various annexes and other more detailed regulations, including fees for registering and starting clinical trials.</p><p>The AIMD Directive's requirements became mandatory from January 1st, 1995, the same date as the MD Directive first came into effect.</p><p>European Directives - Swedish style</p><p>The medical device Directives allow Member States a certain amount of freedom in the way they regulate clinical investigations, their appointment of Notified Bodies and the languages they demand on labels for use and instructions. These are dealt with as follows: Clinical investigations</p><p>Although the National Board of Health and Welfare is responsible for clinical investigations, it passes trial applications to the Medical Products Agency (the pharmaceutical authority) for review. The Board hopes to have the necessary expertise to perform this task itself at a later date, but in the meantime it retains responsibility for final authorisation of clinical trials. It charges SKr 10,000 ($1,350) for each application.</p><p>Notified Bodies</p><p>Semko has applied to become a Notified Body under the Medical Devices Directive. The Swedish Handicap Institute is considering whether to apply or to act as a subcontractor and the medicinal products agency Lakemedelsverket (LV) is expected to apply for disposables. There are no Swedish Notified Bodies for products covered by the AIMD Directive.</p><p>Language requirements</p><p>Labelling and instructions for use must be in Swedish, although the language used in some manuals and for explaining technical drawings may be negotiable.</p><p>Unlike several other countries, CE-marked products do not have to cross any additional hurdles to qualify for reimbursement.</p><p>The Medical Devices section at the National Board of Health and Welfare welcomes enquiries. It can be contacted at: Socialstyrelsen, Medicintekniska sektion, S-106 30 Stockholm, Sweden. Tel: +46 (8) 783 3000. Fax: +46 (8) 783 3294.</p>
