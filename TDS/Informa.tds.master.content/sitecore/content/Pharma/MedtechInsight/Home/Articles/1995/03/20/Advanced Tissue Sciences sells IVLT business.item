<p>Stratum Laboratories is to acquire <strong>[C#198800088:Advanced Tissue Sciences]</strong>' In Vitro Laboratory Testing (IVLT) business assets and licensing rights to the Skin2 in vitro laboratory testing kits. Dependent on Stratum obtaining sufficient funding for the deal, ATS could receive $1.4 million on close of the transaction and $3.6 million in licence fees and milestone payments.</p><p>ATS could also receive a warrant to purchase a minority equity in Stratum and royalties on sales of Skin2 and other licensed products. Stratum intends to expand regulatory approval of the living human tissue as an alternative to animal testing. It has an option to license rights for up to six additional tissues.</p><p>"As we expand our focus on transplantation with our joint venture in cartilage and our collaboration on cardiovascular products, we see the direction provided by Stratum Laboratories as the next logical step for the growth of the in vitro business," says ATS chairman Arthur Benvenuto. ATS is working with Smith & Nephew to develop a cartilage replacement and is jointly developing tissue-engineered heart valves with St Jude Medical.</p>
