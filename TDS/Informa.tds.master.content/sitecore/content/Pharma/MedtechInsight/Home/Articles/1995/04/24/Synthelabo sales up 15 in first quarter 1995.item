<p>Synthelabo's first quarter sales for 1995 are set to rise 15% says the company, due partly to an upturn in the French market. This follows group revenues of Fr 8,120 million ($1,691 million) in 1994, up from $7,204 the previous year. Medical devices sales rose 6.5% in 1994, representing some 8% of group turnover.</p>

<p>Synthelabo's first quarter sales for 1995 are set to rise 15% says the company, due partly to an upturn in the French market. This follows group revenues of Fr 8,120 million ($1,691 million) in 1994, up from $7,204 the previous year. Medical devices sales rose 6.5% in 1994, representing some 8% of group turnover.</p><pre>Synthelabo's consolidated figures (Fr million) 1994 1993 Pharmaceuticals 7,458.2 6,579.4 Medical devices 662.2 625.4 Total 8,120.4 7,204.8 Adjusted net profit 696.4 578.8 Net profit attributable to group 680.4 561.1 Earnings per share 14.1 11.6</pre><p>Sales at Synthelabo's pacemaker division, Ela Medical, increased 7.2% to Fr 489 million in 1994 with domestic sales rising 6.4% over the previous year. Clinical studies will start on a new range of dual-chamber pacemakers towards the end of 1995, says the group's annual report, and the current pacemaker programmer interface will be improved. The company also hopes to provide new features to improve diagnostic capabilities, particularly for atrial arrhythmias.</p><p>Ela Medical's Defender implantable cardioverter defibrillator is currently in clinical development. The company claims it is the first ICS capable of analysing intra-cardiac signals from both the ventricle and atrium. Ela devoted 17% of its total sales to research and development, mainly on its Defender defibrillator.</p><p>Sales at Porges, the group's surgical catheter division increased 4.5% to Fr 173 million in 1994. According to the annual report, the subsidiary is entering a new growth phase, refocusing its activities towards the urological business and expanding in Europe; it has set up a new Spanish subsidiary in Barcelona. Porges has also become the French distributor for ADD-Stat laser fibres produced by US company Laserscope. The division is also developing a removable stent, Urethrospiral 2, which is set for launch this year.</p>
