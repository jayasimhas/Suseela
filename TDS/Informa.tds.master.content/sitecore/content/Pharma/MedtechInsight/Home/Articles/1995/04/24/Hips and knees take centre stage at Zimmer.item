<p>Philip Greenfield reports on Zimmer's R&D priorities Hip and knee replacements are the major focus for Zimmer. However, the US market offers little growth in dollar terms, particularly for hips - analysts Lehman Brothers estimate that the US hip market grew less than 1% in 1994 in dollar terms. This means that Zimmer must fight for its share.</p>

<p>Philip Greenfield reports on Zimmer's R&D priorities Hip and knee replacements are the major focus for Zimmer. However, the US market offers little growth in dollar terms, particularly for hips - analysts Lehman Brothers estimate that the US hip market grew less than 1% in 1994 in dollar terms. This means that Zimmer must fight for its share.</p><p>Dr Roy Crowninshield, senior vice-president and chief scientific officer at Zimmer, takes a positive view of the market. He believes there are still opportunities for a company with the resources to invest in research into the long-term performance of implants and their wear characteristics. "The challenge is to address the limitations that manifest themselves over a 20-year time frame," he explained in an interview with Clinica.</p><p>Much of Zimmer's research is aimed at minimising wear in knee and hip replacements. It spent four years refining the wear characteristics of knee implants to come up with its NexGen system (see Clinica No 643, pp 14-15). "This is likely the biggest product release we have ever had in terms of the effort put into its development," says Dr Crowninshield.</p><p>The company hopes to build on the success of its Insall/Burstein and MG II knee systems which together held 24% of the world knee market in 1993 (see table). Some sales of existing knee systems are expected to be lost to the NexGen system but Zimmer's strategy is one of growth. "I will be disappointed if the NexGen system doesn't increase our share of the US knee market to above 30%," he added.</p><p>Zimmer is "very active" in the area of improving the longevity of implants, according to Dr Crowninshield. The company is investigating ways to enhance the fixation of implants with bone and looking at new materials which match more closely the flexibility of bone. Clinical trials are under way using a new hip prosthesis made of a polymer/metal composite. The aim is to develop an implant which combines the flexibility of a cemented prosthesis with the femoral filling shape and porous ingrowth surfaces of a non-cemented device, according to Zimmer.</p><p>The <strong>[C#198700498:Epoch]</strong> hip comprises a cobalt-chrome core (the major load-bearing component) surrounded by a layer of low-stiffness polymer which in turn is coated with a porous titanium surface to promote bone ingrowth. A global, multicentre prospective trial is under way. Zimmer is also developing a single-component acetabular cup with thicker polyethylene and integrated fibre metal surface.</p><p>Dr Crowninshield concedes that growth in the hip market, particularly in the US, is low in dollar terms but better in terms of procedures, suggesting there has been price erosion and a shift to cost-effective systems.</p><p>"Through the use of moulding processes to establish the overall geometry, the cost of the [Epoch] implant may be comparable to many similar machined components," he believes.</p><p>Opportunities exist in the cemented market, according to Lehman Brothers, so the impact of the Epoch system, which is designed for cementless use, is uncertain. Opportunities may well be greater outside the US where cementless procedures are more common. "After we have gained additional clinical experience with this new product concept, we will have a better understanding of its commercial impact," says Dr Crowninshield.</p><pre>Zimmer's share of the world implant market (1993) Implant Market share Market share (%) ($ millions) Hip 17 94.2 Knee 24 81.9 Spine 20 36.2 Shoulder 15 12.6 Elbow 21 10.6 Wrist 15 0.24 Source: Clinica Reports: The International Orthopaedics Market</pre><p>peripheral areas</p><p>Spinal systems and smaller joints are of little interest to the company. It recently signed a cross-licensing agreement with Wright Medical Technology which granted the Arlington, Tennessee-based company worldwide rights to Zimmer's Modulock posterior spinal fixation system in return for femoral surface shaping instrumentation (see Clinica No 627, p 12).</p><p>Dr Crowninshield considers this a good deal for Zimmer. "The US spinal market faces regulatory problems and we were reluctant to pursue this area," he explained. "We had some technology of interest to Wright, so we decided it better served our purpose to license it and focus on research into other areas." Zimmer still sells a small range of spinal products in Europe but does not consider itself a significant player in the market.</p><p>In addition, "opportunities are less for everyone in shoulders, elbows, wrists and fingers", says Dr Crowninshield. "For example, a total shoulder is a class III device, as is a constrained elbow so it is more difficult to sell these devices in the US."</p><p>expansion into China</p><p>Zimmer is putting "substantial" investment in the emerging Chinese market. Research and development is a priority for this market as it requires specifically designed products, according to Dr Crowninshield. "The incidence of degenerative arthritis and osteoarthritis is very low in China, but there is a higher incidence of trauma," he revealed. In addition, aggressive use of steroids leads to a high incidence of femoral avascular necrosis and degenerative diseases such as ankylosing spondylisis are more prevalent, he adds.</p><p>Zimmer will have to provide implants and equipment at a much lower cost and offer training and surgical support for a country where the average patient has never seen a US medical device. Dr Crowninshield believes there is great potential in China, and other Asian markets, for low-cost orthopaedic equipment of better quality than is being provided by the many indigenous manufacturers. For example, "there is a much lower incidence of knee replacement in China due to lack of knowledge and available products. I think there is substantial potential for our systems here," he enthused.</p><p>The Chinese market could be enormous, but needs long-term investment and returns will be slow, predicts Dr Crowninshield. Zimmer has a sales office in China to market hips and knees as well as the full line of Linvatec, Hall Surgical and Zimmer Patient Care products and a Chinese plant is being planned (see Clinica No 635, p 14).</p><p>Zimmer was formed in 1927 and has been a subsidiary of <strong>[C#198601245:Bristol-Myers Squibb]</strong> since 1972. Sales in 1993 were $1,010 million, around 60% of BMS' medical device turnover. Zimmer's product range includes implants, fracture management products, arthroscopy powered surgical instruments, wound care and soft goods.</p>
