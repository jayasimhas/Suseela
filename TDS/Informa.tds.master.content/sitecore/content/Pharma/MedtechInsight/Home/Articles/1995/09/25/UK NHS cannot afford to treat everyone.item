<p>The UK National Health Service can no longer afford to provide universal healthcare, claims Rodney Walker, retiring chairman of the NHS Trust Federation. Within a week of this warning two reports have been published which seek to remedy the shortfall - Healthcare 2000 proposes further funding from the private sector, while the Royal College of Physicians advocates rationing services.</p><p>An ageing population and advances in medical technology are already stretching NHS resources, claims Healthcare 2000, an independent alliance set up last year to address the issue (see Clinica No 615, p 3). Presenting the group's report last week, Sir Duncan Nichol (former NHS Executive head and currently a consultant to leading private medical insurer BUPA) said: "The continuing gap between resource and demand is unlikely to close." Although the group does not claim to provide answers, it attempts to point to possible solutions of how to narrow the gap - a situation facing all major healthcare systems.</p><p>While the group believes that taxation should remain the principal source of NHS funding, it advocates increased private expenditure, through an extension of user charges and patient co-payments. Currently, just 15% of healthcare expenditure is funded privately (see Clinica Supplement October 1994, p 16). Healthcare 2000 suggests that by enabling patients to purchase additional services within the NHS - such as better food and accommodation - funding which might otherwise have gone to the private sector would be channelled into the NHS. Charges could also be levied for certain treatments that are not universally provided.</p><p>rationing</p><p>Healthcare rationing is not new, said Sir Duncan: what needs to be addressed is how to ration fairly. "Setting priorities (whether on the basis of health gain or with other or additional criteria) defines a set of services to which people are entitled. Although it may be very difficult to define this core set of services, given the uncertainty about outcomes for different categories of patient, the challenge must be addressed. If a core set is established, those who wish to do so and could afford to pay, could opt for additional access to services."</p><p>In a report published a day before Healthcare 2000 released its proposals, the Royal College of Physicians recommends rationing healthcare provision in the NHS. It advocates an independent national council to decide which treatments should be provided free of charge.</p><p>disease management</p><p>Trends in disease management and purchaser competition are noted by Healthcare 2000. "The integration of purchasing for primary and secondary care will allow the purchasing of a co-ordinated package of care within which a clinical pathway becomes the basis for disease management." The development of "multi-funds" by consortia of fundholding GPs is seen as embryonic Health Management Organisations (HMOs). Health Commissions, based not on geographical area but on groups of subscribers, could form the basis of purchaser competition. In addition, the private sector could compete within the purchasing market.</p><p>Emphasising that patients must be the focus of healthcare, the report advocates a patients' standards board and a consumer resource centre to provide information on medical advances. Furthermore, the introduction of a common core curriculum across healthcare professions is proposed in the light of changes in their role.</p><p>industry's involvement</p><p>Healthcare 2000's report was compiled from consultations with a broad range of interests - including patients, healthcare professionals and health economists, among others. Funded with &pound;100,000 from the pharmaceutical industry, the alliance has a 10-member steering committee: four focus groups - on managed care, professional development and clinical practice, funding and patient interests and consumer choice - prepared papers for discussion by the steering group. While pharmaceutical interests were represented in the groups, the medical device and diagnostic industries are notable by their absence. Interest in approaching this sector for additional support was indicated at the report's launch, although it is unclear what the advantages for industry would be.</p><p>Having produced the report, Healthcare 2000 plans to set up citizens' juries whereby randomly selected members of the public will listen to evidence and propose their own solution to the NHS debate. The group aims to put its proposals to politicians since their involvement is essential for any progress.</p>
