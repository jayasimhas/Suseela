<p>After years of trying to make minor adjustments in the US Food & Drug Administration device approval process, agency critics are now urging that drastic changes be made. The result could be a US system similar to that of the European Union, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller a public-private partnership, with health officials responsible for setting the rules and accredited third-party test houses (under government supervision) ensuring that companies comply with them.</p>

<p>After years of trying to make minor adjustments in the US Food & Drug Administration device approval process, agency critics are now urging that drastic changes be made. The result could be a US system similar to that of the European Union, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller a public-private partnership, with health officials responsible for setting the rules and accredited third-party test houses (under government supervision) ensuring that companies comply with them.</p><p>The Health Industry Manufacturers Association is the latest group to recommend this approach in Part I of a White Paper on public policy reform and the US healthcare technology industry. The remainder of the report, scheduled for release later this month, will discuss product liability laws and reimbursement systems for medical technology.</p><p>"Importing certain elements of the European system offers clear advantages," HIMA president Alan Magazine told reporters at a February 9th press conference. "Government could play the role of rulemaker and regulatory watchdog. Private-sector, third-party reviewers could provide an optional alternative to the FDA in conducting premarket review. They would use the FDA standards .... They could also ensure that device companies comply with all quality system regulations. The net result of this partnership in Europe is quicker product review and fewer government resources .... Ultimately, patients get more timely access to needed medical treatments. We would like to see a similar system, and similar results here in the US."</p><p>mutual recognition advocated</p><p>Separately, the HIMA White Paper also recommends accelerating the harmonisation process whereby the US and other countries will mutually recognise quality systems standards (eg the EU EN 46001 standard and US Good Manufacturing Practices). In addition, HIMA suggests studying other ways of mutually accepting review requirements, "such as by recognising a European Union or similar clearance as a basis for marketing in the US".</p><p>"It would be helpful," the paper says, "if the FDA had greater familiarity with international systems of device regulation. The agency should officially recognise other workable systems and adopt alternative models when they can be effective here. By 'harmonising' regulation on a global basis, the FDA can help reduce redundancy and encourage world trade."</p><p>To achieve this, HIMA believes the FDA should exempt from 801(e) export controls those devices that have already been approved or authorised for use through an established process of the recipient country. The industry association also believes that the FDA should accept the results of quality systems inspections conducted by the EU, Japan and other developed countries (based on recognised international standards such as EN 46001) in determining compliance with US Good Manufacturing Practices.</p><p>Not all the 40 White Paper recommendations are international in flavour. Other key sections focus on reducing unnecessary regulation, a return to the basic ideas of enabling legislation, and revised postmarketing controls and enforcement practices.</p><p>widely circulated</p><p>HIMA has sent its proposals to top Administration officials, including Vice-President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, FDA Commissioner David Kessler and key Center for Devices & Radiological Health staff. The document was also sent to all 535 members of Congress. HIMA has urged the latter to "use legislation, oversight, appropriations, and other measures to help expedite the flow of innovative, lifesaving, life-sustaining technologies to the patients who need them."</p><p>As previously reported in Clinica, important members of the new Congress have already made clear their impatience with the FDA. Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, responded immediately to the HIMA report. It "clearly shows the negative effects FDA policy has had on an important segment of the economy," he said. "It is apparent from this report that the 104th Congress must re-examine the goals and the tools the FDA is using to regulate this industry."</p><p>Mr Upton said he will introduce legislation - possibly this week - "which will address some of the problems within the FDA and help drug, medical device and animal vaccine manufacturers compete in the world marketplace."</p>
