<p>"Good opportunities exist in Colombia for suppliers of diagnostic and lab equipment, oncology units, rehabilitation apparatus and prostheses," believes Fernando Leal, president of the Colombian health promoters Salud Colmena. Dr Leal was speaking to industry at the UK Health Ministry as part of a Colombian health delegation. The aim of the meeting was to encourage links between the UK medtech industry and the Colombian health system, now that extensive reforms are under way in both countries.</p>

<p>"Good opportunities exist in Colombia for suppliers of diagnostic and lab equipment, oncology units, rehabilitation apparatus and prostheses," believes Fernando Leal, president of the Colombian health promoters Salud Colmena. Dr Leal was speaking to industry at the UK Health Ministry as part of a Colombian health delegation. The aim of the meeting was to encourage links between the UK medtech industry and the Colombian health system, now that extensive reforms are under way in both countries.</p><p>Of particular interest to the delegation was trauma equipment. Trauma is a priority for the country because of the high incidence of violence and traffic accidents. One of the most modern hospitals in Colombia, the San Pedro Claver ISS hospital, admits some 400,000 trauma patients a year and has one of the largest casualty units in the world, according to Fernando Salgado, its manager. The hospital has an annual income of around $60 million, $5 million of which it spends on medical equipment, excluding supplies.</p><p>While the UK doubled exports to Colombia last year to some $240 million, medical technology contributed virtually nothing. There is a dearth of UK companies operating in the Colombian hospital sector. "The vast majority of our equipment suppliers come from the US," confirms Edgar Gonzalez, the Colombian government's director general of health services. However, new opportunities are arising from high technology as a result of President Ernesto Samper's health reforms.</p><p>The reforms, which aim to improve the country's overall health status, include providing universal coverage and a shift from public funding to a model of private and public provision. At present three-quarters of healthcare is provided by the public sector. The Colombian National Health Service (Instituto de Seguros Sociales - ISS) is in the process of restructuring in order to compete with privately-owned entities, says Dr Salgado. "We need sophisticated tools, and to spend more to get appropriate and efficient equipment," he says. The ISS spends a total of around $20 million a year on medical equipment.</p><p>Over the last few years, the Health Ministry has spent around $80 million a year on equipment for public hospitals. This, however, has mostly been for the country's tertiary healthcare (see below), while the priority at present is primary - local centres - healthcare, states Dr Gonzalez.</p><pre>Colombian healthcare Primary 500 local hospitals 1,000 health centres 3,000 health posts Secondary 136 general hospitals Tertiary 32 specialty teaching hospitals Beds Public: 33,500 Private: 13,000 Social Security Institute: 6,500 Source: Colombian Health delegation</pre><pre>Population: 36 million Life expectancy at birth 69 AIDS cases per 100,000 pop. 1.5 Malaria cases per 100,000 810 Pop. per doctor (1991) 1,064 Pop. per nurse 2,632 Health expenditure 1960 1990 1995 as % GNP 0.4 1.8 6(e) (e) Colombian health delegation estimate Source: UN Human Development Report 1995</pre>
