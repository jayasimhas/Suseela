<p>St Jude Medical (US) is developing a less-invasive heart valve procedure in association with Heartport (US). The two companies, which have been collaborating for almost a year, announced the agreement at the Dane Bosworth healthcare conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last week. Preclinical evaluation of the technique has already been completed and Heartport expects to file an IDE with the US FDA shortly.</p>

<p>St Jude Medical (US) is developing a less-invasive heart valve procedure in association with Heartport (US). The two companies, which have been collaborating for almost a year, announced the agreement at the Dane Bosworth healthcare conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last week. Preclinical evaluation of the technique has already been completed and Heartport expects to file an IDE with the US FDA shortly.</p><p>Both companies have filed patents for the use of St Jude's mechanical heart valves with Heartport's endoscopic technology. As well as patents which Heartport has filed for the core technology and those covering the St Jude heart valve, they have sought protection for an endoscopic holder for the valve and a device for introducing and manipulating it into position for suturing.</p><p>route to growth</p><p>The worldwide agreement includes provisions for product development and licensing as well as the sale of the jointly-developed product. The development programme also includes valve repair surgery. St Jude president, chairman and CEO, Ronald Matricaria says: "The new technology represents an important new source of growth revenue for our core business." Worldwide approximately 200,000 heart valves are replaced or repaired every year. St Jude prostheses are used in about 85,000 of these.</p><p>Trials of port-access bypass surgery began earlier this month at Stanford University (see Clinica No 669/70, p 28) and this experience should help speed the valve work which Heartport CEO Wesley Sterman says "will be a clinical reality in the very near future". Heartport faces competition in the bypass market from CardioThoracic Systems' trapdoor technique, which leaves the heart beating (see this issue, p 20). Heartport is believed to be courting several partners Clinica understands that US Surgical's name has been linked to a possible instruments deal, although the company declined to comment.</p>
