<p>Orthopaedic surgeons are searching for an alternative bone graft material to overcome donor site morbidity associated with autografts. A number of osteoconductive graft materials have been developed but they do not actively promote bone growth. Projects are under way to find suitable osteoinductive agents and methods to deliver them (see also Clinica No 643, p 14).</p>

<p>Orthopaedic surgeons are searching for an alternative bone graft material to overcome donor site morbidity associated with autografts. A number of osteoconductive graft materials have been developed but they do not actively promote bone growth. Projects are under way to find suitable osteoinductive agents and methods to deliver them (see also Clinica No 643, p 14).</p><p>Studies presented at the Society for Biomaterials meeting unveiled hybrid materials comprising osteoconductive and osteoinductive components designed to provide bone graft substitutes with the ability to induce new bone formation.</p><p>Researchers at Intermedics Orthopaedics and Emory University School of Medicine (US) have used a resorbable composite comprising bovine-derived bone protein and a deorganified coral/collagen matrix in a rabbit lumbar spine model. The model is designed to have a 69% fusion rate with autograft (the typical fusion rate in humans is 65-95%, according to the researchers).</p><p>The composite (two sheets measuring 1.2 x 3.0 x 0.5 cm) was implanted in 64 rabbits and after five weeks promoted mechanically-sound fusion in up to 100% of cases, depending on bone protein dose. The material induces bone formation and appears to conduct bone along the implant until it is surrounded, at which time the coral resorbs, they said.</p><p>faster repair</p><p>Yale University researchers believe a composite of hydroxyapatite and recombinant osteogenic protein (OP-1, Creative Biomolecules) could be the ideal craniofacial bone substitute as it offers faster osteointegration and conversion into bone. Dr Craig Friedman and colleagues have performed initial studies in cats and found that 93% of the composite was converted into new bone within three months in 2.5 cm diameter full-thickness craniotomies.</p><p>sustained release</p><p>A team from the University of Michigan is the first to investigate resorbable polymers for delivering bone proteins. They have performed in vitro studies of a polyphosphate polymer for release of OP-1 over longer time periods and believe it may be useful for treating large defects in bone. Meanwhile, University of Pennsylvania researchers have achieved sustained release of proteins for up to 11 weeks with a dry silica-based gel and protein composite. During in vitro studies, the xerogel/protein composite released less than 3% of the protein over 24 hours. This is important since optimum bone repair requires sustained growth factor delivery for typically four to eight weeks.</p>
