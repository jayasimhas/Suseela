<p>The Norwegian Board of Health has sent out a Vigilance report to European Competent Authorities regarding Boneloc bone cement, recently withdrawn in Norway (see Clinica No 650/1, p 2). Boneloc, produced in Denmark by Polymers Reconstructive, a subsidiary of <strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> (US), has been associated with a higher than average hip implant revision rate in Norway. According to the Board of Health: "The results of hip prostheses with this cement ... were statistically significantly poorer than for prostheses with other cement types." The three-year revision rate was 10% with Boneloc compared with revision rates below 2% for all other cement types.</p>
