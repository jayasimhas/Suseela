<p>As economies develop, the demand for more sophisticated medical treatments increases. This pattern has repeated itself all over Asia as the region's economic strength has grown - in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnam. The region has some of the fastest growing economies in the world, reflected in the rapidly expanding regional demand for electronic medical, diagnostic and other high-tech equipment.</p><p>The mechanism of this medical technology growth pattern is two-fold. One side is public sector-driven. An expanding economy leads to larger government budgets, which in turn lead to increased funding for public services, including healthcare. Moreover, many of these countries have controlled infectious diseases to the extent that they are increasingly able to focus resources on procedures involving more sophisticated equipment.</p><p>The other aspect of the growth pattern, which is privately driven, is two-pronged. Firstly, many governments in the region are privatising healthcare delivery. This subjects healthcare providers to market discipline, prompting them to compete by offering better quality and higher-tech services. Secondly, as the economy improves, the consumer gains the means to pay for and demand better quality and higher-tech care. Some people, for instance, can afford to fly to Singapore to ensure the best available treatment in the region.</p><p>Economic growth rates in the region vary from 5.3% to 12.8%. Each country also differs dramatically in the volume and type of healthcare equipment required. This article summarises the medical technology needs of the Southeast Asian countries, as well as outlining the most appropriate ways of entering each market.</p><p>China</p><p>China's medical equipment market totalled $700 million in 1993, up 21% on 1992, 70% of which is imported. The country's GDP growth rate was 12.8%. The Chinese government is very interested in importing foreign technology, and now has the foreign exchange to do so.</p><p>China is already producing low-tech devices such as standard ultrasound and X-ray machines, as well as products such as medical gowns and linens and basic pharmaceuticals. The government has allocated foreign exchange amounting to 5% of the market to purchase high-tech equipment such as MRI and CT scanners, and usually makes these purchases in the first two years of any five-year plan. China needs 196 MRI and 2,064 CT scanners by 1997. Other items sought by the government include bio-instruments, electrophoresis, fraction collectors, gamma counters, beta counters, lab instruments, kidney dialysis machines, cytoscopes, electrocardiograph instruments and equipment for cancer detection.</p><p>Medical equipment purchases involve multiple decision makers and absolute <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong>, and only an authorised Chinese company can negotiate and sign contracts. Equipment valued at over $20,000 requires a licence, issued on an individual basis. However, equipment deemed "high priority", like MRI or CT scanners, may involve a more direct process. Five years ago, more than 85% of financing for medical technology purchases was conducted via the central government. That figure has dropped to about 15%.</p><p>Large or medium-sized facilities in special economic zones are likely purchasers of high-tech equipment. One factor in the decision to purchase high-tech, high-priority equipment is to boost the facility's government "book" rating, which helps determine the types of service the facility can perform as well as levels of reimbursement. Price and quality are the major considerations, however, in high-tech medical purchases. The Chinese believe the maintenance of high-tech equipment is the responsibility of the manufacturer, rather than the purchaser. It is imperative, therefore, to provide adequate after-sales support.</p><p>Hong Kong</p><p>Hong Kong spends 3.9% of its $95,800 million GDP - which is growing at an annual rate of 5.3% - on healthcare. Its medical standards are among the best in the world. Although Hong Kong's medical product market is mature (totalling $375 million in 1993), it still holds substantial opportunities for foreign products, and continues to grow at approximately 15% annually. In addition, Hong Kong acts as a gateway to the vast market of China, re-exporting nearly 75% of its medical device imports to that market.</p><p>Current government health sector objectives include increasing the number of healthcare facilities and hospital beds by 31.7% by the year 2000, especially in the acute care, psychogeriatric, ophthalmic and convalescent hospital sectors. Additionally, it intends to purchase high-tech devices such as MRI and CT scanners (8 and 18 respectively) - especially for brain scanning purposes automated laboratory devices; imaging and diagnostic equipment; cardiac output analyzers; hydrometers; thermometers; pyrometers; optical microscopes; photocolposcopes; ultrasound scanners; Phaco equipment; photocoagulators; minimally invasive surgery equipment; ultraviolet and infra-red apparatus and apparatus; based on the use of X-rays (including X-ray tubes) or alpha, beta or gamma radiation.</p><p>Approximately 85% of the 20,822 beds in the territory's 31 hospitals are government managed, making it imperative for foreign companies to pre-register with the managing entity, the Hospital Authority (HA). The HA advises companies of public tenders. As tenders originate from a committee of doctors who prepare specifications, suppliers need to address their promotional efforts to this committee. The Queen Mary and Prince of Wales hospitals are the most research-oriented and are therefore more receptive to the latest technology.</p><p>Indonesia</p><p>Indonesia's 1993 GDP was $125,700 million, with a 7% annual growth rate. Government spending accounts for 60% of Indonesia's medical equipment/device market, which totalled $105 million in 1993, 90% of which is imported. the market has been growing at around 10% annually. In 1992, 80% of government spending was accounted for by construction of buildings and infrastructure improvement and procurement of medical equipment, medicines, vaccines and insecticides. Current government healthcare objectives include upgrading equipment and construction standards in addition to improving information systems and reporting procedures.</p><p>Indonesian medical production is limited to low-tech instruments, bandages and dressings, scales, incubators and hospital beds. The best prospects for foreign equipment sales are X-ray machines, photographic plates and film, dental equipment and supplies, medical/surgical equipment, diagnostic and ophthalmic apparatus, electromedical equipment, mechanotherapy appliances, artificial respiration apparatus, clinical laboratory instruments, and medical furniture and mattresses.</p><p>Indonesia is expected to purchase seven MRI and 25 CT scanners by 1997. However, Indonesian practitioners are often confused about the quality differences between multiformat camera and laser CTs, mainly because most of the existing low-end CTs in Indonesia use multiformat cameras. Manufacturers can influence this through education. A few elite hospitals may also be interested in teleradiology, especially if they understand the teaching potential of the devices.</p><p>In 1994 the government relaxed regulations on foreign companies operating in Indonesia. This will make the investment climate far more favourable for overseas industry, particularly in the healthcare sector. Another giant stride towards open market policies occurred during US President Clinton's November 1994 visit to Indonesia, when joint business agreements valued at $40,000 million were concluded. This compares with total US investment in Indonesia between 1967 and 1992 of only $2,600 million and signals a favourable climate for US enterprises to enter the Indonesian market.</p><p>Malaysia</p><p>The Malaysian government increased its healthcare budget for 1994/1995 to $960 million, from $850 million in 1992/1993, a 13.6% increase. The country's GDP is growing at 7-9% annually. The medical equipment market, which is expected to grow at 17-20% up to 1995, was valued at $95 million in 1993, of which $20 million was accounted for by US products. Since Malaysia is unable to produce high-tech medical equipment at present, it imports about 90% of its medical laboratory equipment, but makes its own surgical blades, scissors and disposable blood transfusion sets. As Malaysia is a major producer of rubber, it also manufactures catheters, cannulas, syringes and surgical gloves.</p><p>Three new cardiac institutes are planned, as well as general outpatient clinics, boosting demand for MRI and CT scanners, X-ray apparatus and other equipment. Malaysia currently needs respiratory apparatus; cardiology equipment and electrocardiographic monitors; apparatus for diabetes diagnosis; X-ray electrodiagnostic and imaging equipment; ultrasound scanners; microscopes and parts; mechanotherapy appliances; massage apparatus; laboratory glassware; EKG accessories; HIV and hepatitis B testing kits; and cholesterol home-test kits. By 1997 Malaysia is expected to purchase 16 CT scanners (for Seremban, Alorstar, Kota Bharu and Melak hospitals) and 14 MRI scanners.</p><p>As 15-20% of the development budget goes towards purchasing modern medical equipment, selling to new medical facilities has the greatest potential. The government uses direct sales and tenders. Medical laboratory equipment is purchased through tenders advertised in local newspapers. To bid on tenders, US firms must have a local distributor and promote directly to end-users. Successful foreign companies must also have service locations based either in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.</p><p>Singapore</p><p>Singapore's 1993 medical equipment and device market was worth $140 million, up 12% on 1992. It imported medical devices valued at $218 million in 1993, re-exporting the balance to other Southeast Asian countries. Singapore's 1993 GDP was $53 million, with a 1994 projected growth rate of 8%. Its 2.9 million people are served by 22 hospitals with a total of 9,725 beds.</p><p>Singapore acts as a healthcare hub for the entire region. Some 20-30% of its inpatients are from other countries (mainly Malaysia), in large part because of its state-of-the-art medical technology. Singapore's health sector is currently undergoing a major restructuring programme, with the aim of transferring 30% of care to the private sector. Public hospitals have tended to purchase equipment conservatively, foregoing quality in favour of cost. As facilities are brought into the private sector, diagnostic equipment purchases are being dramatically upgraded.</p><p>Singapore is building three new hospitals which need equipment. Tan Tock Seng Hospital will include general medicine and surgery, respiratory medicine, haematology, immunology and geriatric medicine. Toa Payoh Hospital (to be renamed Eastern General) will include general medicine and surgery, orthopaedic surgery, geriatric and rehabilitation, psychiatry and accident and primary care. Kandang Kerbau Hospital will include obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics. Singapore is expected to purchase a total of six MRI and 21 CT scanners by 1997. Because of the island's ageing population, hospitals are interested in buying diagnostic equipment appropriate to this group, such as mammography units, angiography units, fluoroscopes, ultrasound equipment and portable X-ray units. Other types of equipment in demand are consumables used in cancer diagnosis and treatment, equipment used in minimally invasive surgery, patient monitoring equipment (intensive care and cardiac units), and dental autoclaves, sterilisers and hand pieces.</p><p>US manufacturers must be sure that hospitals are aware of their products in good time, because hospitals first define specifications, and then make an offer to the lowest bidder. This is best done by establishing a local presence to inform hospitals directly. Singaporean purchasing priorities are price, followed by technical sophistication. Service is also a major concern - Singaporeans rank US companies except GE (which has a service centre in Singapore) below their European counterparts. They factor the cost of maintenance and repair into total cost when comparing offers.</p><p>Taiwan</p><p>Taiwan's 1993 GDP was $210,000 million, with a 6.6% annual growth rate. The government's current development plan allocates $3,000 million to upgrading small and medium-sized hospitals and to improving other healthcare facilities. Plans for more than 22 large-scale private hospital construction projects over the next five years will consume another $1,000 million. Taiwan's 1993 medical device and diagnostic market reached $400 million, and is forecast to rise 12-18% by 1995.</p><p>Increasing affluence has boosted demand for plastic surgery equipment and laser equipment. Although Taiwan makes electrodiagnostic equipment, it is not of very high quality. Good prospects for sales to Taiwan include mammography units, cobalt 60 therapy, linear accelerator equipment, electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs, ultrasound scanners, ultraviolet or infrared ray apparatus, laser photcoagulators, shock wave lithotripsy apparatus, other X-ray generators, high tension generators, control panels and desk screens; and five MRI and 50 CT scanners by 1997. Taiwan also needs mechanotherapy appliances, massage apparatus, and orthopaedic appliances, including crutches, surgical belts and trusses.</p><p>The investment climate in Taiwan especially favours the US, even though the US and Taiwan have no formal diplomatic relations. The market for high-tech equipment is predominantly centred on public and large private hospitals. US equipment is perceived in Taiwan as high quality, advanced technologically and durable. However, the Taiwanese dislike what they see as the high price and lack of promotion associated with US equipment. The most successful approach to this market has been through local agents or distributors.</p><p>Thailand Thailand's GDP in 1993 was $89,000 million. By 1996, the National Health Development Plan budget is expected to reach $2,050 million, with more than 50% devoted to health services. Some estimates project that 1995 purchases of medical devices will reach as high as $315 million. The 1993 total was $185 million, and estimates of growth rates range from 20-24% per year. Some 60% of healthcare purchases are made by the government. The private sector is anticipating future demand for quality services by purchasing state-of-the-art equipment, although Thailand's FDA is reviewing possible instances of under-use of such equipment.</p><p>Thailand manufactures and exports medical products, mainly surgical supplies and appliances, ranging from condoms to ultrasound units, X-ray generators and ophthalmic lenses. The best opportunities for sales include X-ray equipment, scanners - MRI (24) and CT (36), exercise electrocardiography, cardiac pacemakers, oxygenators and electrical blood pressure monitors. There is growing demand for nursing home care for cancer and geriatric patients and increasingly for AIDS sufferers.</p><p>In Thailand, technological specifications and price are the most important considerations. More important in Thailand than in other Asian countries are reputation, trust, image at both corporate and representative levels and service both before and after the sale. Thailand requires importers of healthcare equipment to register with its FDA. Consequently, the best entry method is through a well-established local distributor.</p><p>South Korea</p><p>South Korea's 1993 GDP was $315 billion, with an annual growth rate of 5.6%. The South Korean medical equipment and diagnostic market rose 18% in 1993 to total $695 million, and is forecast to increase 17-20% in 1995. South Korea imports 70% of its medical device needs, 22% of which comes from the US.</p><p>South Korea's race to become an industrialised society left many hands, legs and fingers missing. Only recently have resources to aid these disabled people been made available. The rehabilitation market was estimated at $50 million in 1993. Best prospects for patient monitoring systems include standalone ECG/temperature monitors, with or without paper recorders; ECG/blood pressure monitors; oxymeters; and three-channel (ECG/NIBP or IBP/Temp) monitors. Diagnostic equipment required in South Korea includes ultrasound scanners and MRI and CT scanners (23 and 68 respectively by 1997). It also wants laser devices, for cosmetic, ophthalmologic, endoscopic and urological use.</p><p>To enter the South Korean market successfully companies should rely on local contacts or people who have spent a good deal of time in Korea, who speak the language and who know the market. This is mainly because the country has experienced an extended "closed domestic market" atmosphere in which all imported items, including medical equipment, have been considered luxuries. The government is taking steps to liberalise the market, however, with the recent lifting of most direct import bans. Many other such reforms are expected in 1996.</p><p>Vietnam</p><p>Vietnam's GDP in 1992 - the most recent figure available - was estimated at $10,500-$12,500 million, with a growth rate of 8%. Years of war coupled with the 20-year trade embargo rendered Vietnam's healthcare system antiquated at best. US President Clinton's lifting of the trade embargo in 1994 heralded the end of Vietnam's isolation, resulting in an influx of aid in 1993 alone of $1,860 million. Talks to formalise US-Vietnam trade relations are expected to take place some time in 1995.</p><p>Imports of all types of medical device and equipment are expected to increase. General Electric, for instance, already had a presence in Vietnam in February 1994, at the time the embargo was lifted. GE now has agreements to build two major healthcare centres in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, and it will sell Vietnam high-tech generators. Medical supplies in immediate demand include ultrasound equipment, medical disposables, pharmaceuticals, dental equipment, condoms, MRI and CT scanners (two and five respectively), and refurbished imaging equipment of all kinds.</p><p>A representative in Singapore is probably the best way to make sales contacts in Vietnam. Setting up a representative office in Vietnam, which is only permitted to conduct such activities as investment research and trade support and may not act as an independent profit-making operation, is also possible. However, procedures for setting up such an office can take up to 18 months, although applications from US firms may be expedited. Prospective importers need to show either a two-year record of business dealings with Vietnam or prospects of long-term trading relations with the country.</p><p>Ames Gross is the president of Pacific Bridge, a Washington, DC, consulting firm which assists medical companies in penetrating the Asian marketplace.
