<p>Peptide Innovations (US) is developing a synthetic peptide which it claims has applications in orthopaedic implant fixation, bone filling, tissue regeneration and fracture fixation. P-15 is a completely synthetic material designed to mimic the role of collagen in cell differentiation. "P-15 is based around the discovery that bone collagen binds cells. It acts like collagen and can regenerate skin, bone, cartilage - anything containing type I collagen," Frederick Georgette, president of Peptide Innovations, told Clinica at last month's Society for Biomaterials annual meeting in San Francsico.</p>

<p>Peptide Innovations (US) is developing a synthetic peptide which it claims has applications in orthopaedic implant fixation, bone filling, tissue regeneration and fracture fixation. P-15 is a completely synthetic material designed to mimic the role of collagen in cell differentiation. "P-15 is based around the discovery that bone collagen binds cells. It acts like collagen and can regenerate skin, bone, cartilage - anything containing type I collagen," Frederick Georgette, president of Peptide Innovations, told Clinica at last month's Society for Biomaterials annual meeting in San Francsico.</p><p>animal studies</p><p>Biocompatibility studies have been performed and the first three animal studies on cranial, tibial and mandibular defects demonstrated osteoinductive properties of P-15. The findings put P-15 in the same class as growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), according to the company. An advantage of P-15 over these growth factors is that, as it is synthetic, there are no immunogenic components to remove. In addition, there is no real limit to shelf life, claims the company.</p><p>Peptide Innovations is also developing delivery systems for the peptide - hydroxyapatite/P-15 granules have been used but "the most exciting area is using bioresorbable polymers", Mr Georgette told Clinica. The company, which has rights to all orthopaedic applications, has licensed P-15 to Colorado-based CeraMed for applications above the neck and to CR Bard for urological applications. An investigational device exemption has been granted by the US FDA for dental applications.</p>
