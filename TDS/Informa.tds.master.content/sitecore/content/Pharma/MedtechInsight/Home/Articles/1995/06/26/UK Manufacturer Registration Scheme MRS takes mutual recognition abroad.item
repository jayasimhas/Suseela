<p>The UK Medical Devices Agency's Manufacturer Registration Scheme (MRS) is close to reaching a mutual recognition agreement with TUV Product Services and has observed the German testing and certification organisation at work. Under the agreement, companies that CE mark their product following quality assurance approval from the TUV will be able to apply for MRS listing without undergoing a full MRS audit. In exchange, Notified Bodies, which are obliged to take into consideration any previous testing, will need to obtain details from the MRS.</p>
