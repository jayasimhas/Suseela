<p>Results in 1994 did not quite fulfil Germany-based Behringwerke's expectations. Turnover declined 1.6% compared with 1993 and operating profit fell DM 21 million ($15 million) to DM 197 million, mainly because of problems related to plasma products, says the company. Behring nevertheless paid after-tax profits of DM 127 million to its parent, Hoechst, 9% higher than the DM 116 million a year earlier. At the end of 1994, orders were above the year's average and the company is "reservedly confident" for 1995.</p>

<p>Results in 1994 did not quite fulfil Germany-based Behringwerke's expectations. Turnover declined 1.6% compared with 1993 and operating profit fell DM 21 million ($15 million) to DM 197 million, mainly because of problems related to plasma products, says the company. Behring nevertheless paid after-tax profits of DM 127 million to its parent, Hoechst, 9% higher than the DM 116 million a year earlier. At the end of 1994, orders were above the year's average and the company is "reservedly confident" for 1995.</p><p>Behring attributed a 2.5% decline to DM 418.5 million in its diagnostics sales to the more difficult market arising from cost containment efforts in Germany and abroad. The company plans to expand its diagnostics business globally and has taken a number of steps in this direction. Last August, Behring withdrew from radiodiagnostics (see Clinica No 616, p 16), and instead bought into the US diagnostics market with the Syva purchase earlier this year. Behring's diagnostics business is set to grow by two thirds in terms of turnover following this deal (see Clinica No 641, p 1).</p><p>The company's diagnostics R&D during 1994 concentrated on developing reagents for plasmaprotein tests, microbiological, blood clotting and immunoassays.</p><pre>Behringwerke's 1994 sales by division (DM millions) 1994 1993 change Diagnostics 418.5 429.4 -2.5% Therapeutics 861.6 882.8 -2.4% Veterinary 96.7 86.8 11.4% Total 1,376.8 1,398.9 -1.6% (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Group sales in Germany declined 4.8% to DM 700.6 million in 1994. Exports were DM 676 million, up 1.9%, with currency gains against the yen, for example, being more than offset by price cuts. Behring sold DM 196 million worth of goods in Japan.</p>
