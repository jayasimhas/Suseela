<p>Short-term savings on medical products worth Fl 200 million ($112 million) per year could be made in the Dutch healthcare system. Following an independent study of medical product use, the Dutch government believes that the savings can be made by tightening insurers' budgets and removing barriers to market forces.</p><p>The study was carried out by an independent volume control and cost limitation task force. In its initial report this year, the task force expressed concern over the high and rapidly- increasing cost of medicines and medical products. It believes reforms could lead to savings of Fl 650 million on these items in 1996 and Fl 900 million per year thereafter, over 20% of which would be on medical products.</p><p>ringing the changes</p><p>Some changes are already on the verge of implementation. From January 1st, 1996, the statutory insurance package (ZFW) budget will be split between hospital and "other care" costs. Within hospital care, a distinction will be made between capital for which the insurer will be only partly liable, and expense items for which it will be fully liable. The ZFW insurers will also become responsible for a range of services, including medical products, previously covered by the law on insurance against exceptional medical expenses, such as long-term care (AWBZ).</p><p>From January 1st, 1997, a compulsory own-risk measure will be introduced, whereby patients must pay the first Fl 200 towards the cost of treatment. The 1997 date is expected to coincide with the planned convergence of the public and private healthcare insurance systems. The co-payment will not apply to treatment by general practitioners, to whom access must be unimpeded, says the government. The existing rule on co- payment for medical products (15% up to a maximum of Fl 200) was abolished on January 1st, 1995.</p><p>no regrets</p><p>Other changes proposed by the government include the removal of oral contraceptives from the reimbursement list. Further withdrawals and additions could follow. Budget-management will be introduced in stages, with priority given to supply of medical products, and competition between insurers will be encouraged.</p><p>In the longer term, the task force proposes maximum reimbursement levels for incontinence products; investment planning for university hospitals; and price-setting for "premium" care cases. The government wishes to introduce these gradually but stresses that it is flexible - it has a "no regrets" policy which means no irreversible measures will be adopted.</p>
