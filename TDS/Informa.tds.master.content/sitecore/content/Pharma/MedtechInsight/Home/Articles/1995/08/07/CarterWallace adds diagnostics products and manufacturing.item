<p>Wampole Laboratories, the diagnostics division of US consumer products and healthcare group Carter-Wallace, is set to acquire a product line from BioWhittaker and new manufacturing facilities from Clark Laboratories. Wampole also acquires US marketing rights to new diagnostics products. Terms of neither deal were disclosed.</p><p>In the first agreement, Wampole plans to buy BioWhittaker's infectious disease and autoimmune tests in the ELISA and FIAX formats. These products accounted for a quarter of BioWhittaker's $55 million turnover in fiscal 1994.</p><p>In the second deal, Wampole will acquire exclusive US marketing rights to the entire line of diagnostic tests of Clark Laboratories. Under the agreement, Clark would also become the exclusive manufacturer of certain diagnostic test products being acquired by Wampole. New Jersey-based Clark specialises in the manufacture of enzyme immunoassay diagnostic tests for infectious and autoimmune diseases. CEO William Daly praised the deal for the combination of "Clark's strengths in development and manufacturing with Wampole's strengths in sales and marketing".</p><p>The Wampole division had a good fiscal 1995, helping to make up for a disastrous year for its pharmaceutical business which pushed the group deeper into the red. In its annual report, Carter-Wallace asserts that Wampole was able either to maintain or strengthen its position in most of its market areas.</p><p>Carter-Wallace attributes the good performance of the diagnostics division to a range of different products. Sales of serological tests were unusually strong and Wampole claims to have maintained its market leadership with Streptozyme, a test for streptococcal antibodies; and Rheumaton for detection of rheumatoid factor.</p><p>Mononucleosis testing sales rose 25%. Mono Plus, a rapid assay for infectious mononucleosis was introduced in June 1994 and contributed to the gain, Carter-Wallace says. It adds that the implementation of a marketing agreement with Baxter Healthcare in mid-year further strengthened the Wampole division.</p><p>Healthcare contributed 40% or $263 million to Carter-Wallace's group sales. Healthcare turnover fell 11% in fiscal 1995 (ended March) compared with the previous year, a drop that was due to discontinued drug Organidin.</p><p>Group sales were flat at $664 million and the New York-based company's net loss soared to $56 million from $20 in the previous year. R&D was scaled back by 21% to $41 million but costs rose 20% to $757 million because of one-off charges of $129 million related to the pharmaceuticals business.</p>
