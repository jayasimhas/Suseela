<p>Striking changes over the past decade have restructured healthcare in Brazil. However, the lack of resources and escalating inflation mean health reimbursement payments are often inadequate and the quality of services has been undermined, says a World Bank report on financing and delivery of the Brazilian healthcare system.</p><p>Cumulative inflation of over 4,000 million % between January 1980 and December 1991 has distorted the value of health reimbursement. Equally, the reimbursement for diagnoses does not take account of new technologies (nor drug therapies). Hospitals are therefore underpaid and physicians are awarded reduced fees, concludes the report.</p><p>The problem stems from the fact that reimbursement levels under the AIH system (government reimbursement payments) are not based on actual resource needs and have not been adjusted for inflation quickly enough. The report claims that to meet costs, hospitals try to fit needed treatment into the permitted treatment codes and bias patient loads towards well-paid procedures. Private hospitals have even been accused of "patient dumping" to avoid admitting patients with illnesses that are inadequately reimbursed.</p><pre>Comparison of cost per diagnosis at Umberto Primo Hospital, Sao Paulo, and AIH reimbursement levels (US$) Diagnosis UPH AIH % Reimbursed (adult clinical-surgical) Bilateral inguinal hernia 430 177 41 Cholecystectomy 631 414 62 Appendectomy 468 229 49 Endoscopic prostectomy 661 333 50 Acute MI 3,252 236 7 Paediatric bronco-pneumonia 1,628 179 11 Source: Cyrillo (1992) based on Matos data</pre><p>The data include personnel charges. Almost all the most expensive diagnoses require time spent in the intensive care unit. Outside these costs, the main charges are for hospital beds and food, followed by operating theatre use. Diagnoses themselves receive the smallest proportion of average costs.</p><p>The table opposite shows total costs for certain procedures at the Umberto Primo Hospital (UHP) in Sao Paulo and government reimbursement payment for the same procedures. UHP costs exceed payments for all diagnoses except radical mastectomy (not shown). However, the differences in actual cost and reimbursement payment for some procedures such as acute myocardial infarction and paediatric bronco-pneumonia are huge and suggest the need for serious reconsideration, says the report.</p><p>Another victim of persistent underpayment has been the quality of healthcare. This particularly concerns length of hospitalisation, adding more beds to wards, reducing staff wages and investment.</p><p>The health reforms of the early 1990s meant there was a shift from private to public providers and a decentralisation of services to regional health authorities. This led to a move from inpatient to outpatient (ambulatory) care and a shift of resource allocation towards prevention and away from treatment.</p><p>The Brazilian healthcare system differs greatly from those in other developing countries since it relies heavily on public reimbursement of privately-provided healthcare services. This, says the report, mirrors the Medicare system set up in the US for care of the elderly, whereby providers are paid a set amount for any given diagnosis rather than on a cost- reimbursement basis. In Brazil, only a small proportion of care is extended through public facilities, while private financing of healthcare is expanding rapidly. However, while Brazil has pledged universal healthcare coverage, it does not have the resources to carry this out.</p>
