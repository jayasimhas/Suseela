<p>The US spinal implant market could be destroyed by litigation, according to Dane Miller, president of <strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> (US). Speaking at the recent European Post Marketing Surveillance conference in Amsterdam, he revealed that the sector, which had a 1994 turnover of just $210 million, was facing $1,200 million worth of outstanding liability claims at the end of 1994. The amount is not related to patient compensation awarded in court, he stated, but rather to the costs of defence since 92% of cases are settled out of court.</p>

<p>The US spinal implant market could be destroyed by litigation, according to Dane Miller, president of <strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> (US). Speaking at the recent European Post Marketing Surveillance conference in Amsterdam, he revealed that the sector, which had a 1994 turnover of just $210 million, was facing $1,200 million worth of outstanding liability claims at the end of 1994. The amount is not related to patient compensation awarded in court, he stated, but rather to the costs of defence since 92% of cases are settled out of court.</p><p>Europe must avoid this kind of litigious environment, warned Charles Homsy, scientific director of Promotus (Switzerland) and a former US citizen. It bankrupts companies irrespective of guilt and curbs innovation, he said.</p><p>US juries are not trained to evaluate medical/scientific issues and, confused by contradictory expert evidence, are often swayed by the dramatisation of the plaintiff's pain and suffering, Dr Homsy stated. Lawyers, meanwhile, are attracted by the typically high fees they can earn in medical tort. Caught up in this situation, manufacturers frequently feel forced into pre-trial settlements - and because of the cost of defence and the threat of large legal fees.</p><p>Dr Homsy highlighted a number of cases of manufacturers bankrupted by the US legal system, including Vitek (US), producer of the temporomandibular joint disc replacements, of which he was president. Following product launch in the early 1980s, the company learnt of possible complications with its implants in 1986, although surgeons' reports were contradictory. After winning two legal trials, the company lost the third and ran out of insurance to appeal. As a result it went bankrupt in 1990. Shortly afterwards a paper was published which refuted the lawsuit allegations.</p><p>The breast implant class action demonstrates the vagaries of the US legal system. It recently resulted in the "US court system's largest-ever product liability pact" of some $4,000 million - of which 25% is the ceiling for attorneys' fees and costs. Yet just three months after the agreement in principle for this settlement the Mayo study was published - the third large epidemiological study in the US to vindicate the implants.</p>
