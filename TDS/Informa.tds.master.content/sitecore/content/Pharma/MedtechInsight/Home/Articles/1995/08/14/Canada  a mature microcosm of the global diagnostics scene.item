<p>Canada, with a population of 30 million, is often thought of as a sprawling poorer cousin of the US and is widely considered too small a market to be of strategic importance. A closer look at the Canadian diagnostics market belies this notion. Furthermore, the country provides a springboard to the diagnostic markets of the trading bloc created through the North American Free Trade Agreement to which Mexico became a signatory in 1994.</p>

<p>Canada, with a population of 30 million, is often thought of as a sprawling poorer cousin of the US and is widely considered too small a market to be of strategic importance. A closer look at the Canadian diagnostics market belies this notion. Furthermore, the country provides a springboard to the diagnostic markets of the trading bloc created through the North American Free Trade Agreement to which Mexico became a signatory in 1994.</p><p>All diagnostic products enter Canada under the jurisdiction of the Medical Devices Directorate of Health Canada. Diagnostics for infectious diseases, HIV, the home testing and over-the- counter markets are reviewed critically. The only home and OTC diagnostics available to the general public are diabetes self- test products and pregnancy, ovulation and cholesterol tests. Only the Canadian Red Cross and selected public health, hospital and private laboratories are licensed to perform HIV tests.</p><p>For all other laboratory-based diagnostic products, the notification and market approval process is relatively straightforward. Ultimately, the viability of a diagnostic product is determined by the market itself and not by a federal approval process. The manufacturer or distributor of a product to be sold in Canada supplies clinical data on product sensitivity, specificity and precision, along with user- directed information such as labelling, package inserts, user manuals, etc. There are no further requirements.</p><p>The clinical value of a product is determined by microbiologists, biochemists, pathologists and haematologists in the laboratory. These individuals provide the scientific leadership for Canada's hospital and private laboratories and determine the products to be used by their organisations.</p><p>The professionals work closely with university-based medical researchers - the University of Toronto (Ontario) ranks among the top five worldwide in terms of dollars devoted to medical research and McGill University (Montreal, Quebec) has a worldwide reputation among medical schools. Together, Quebec and Ontario contain 62.4% of the Canadian population and represent more than 50% of the country's diagnostics market.</p><p>The effort to contain costs has led to the formation of geographic buying groups, some voluntary and some mandated by provincial health care legislation, which tender for and recommend reagent and instrument systems to be used in hospital laboratories. Laboratory professionals have the right to use alternative products, once they have demonstrated that their choice does not result in operating costs which exceed those recommended.</p><p>Government formularies for test reimbursement for private and hospital laboratories, based on fee-for-service, are under review. Under pressure to cut healthcare spending, a reduction of payment schedules, payment ceilings and fixed-fee contracts are being negotiated. In Quebec, tests performed in private laboratories are not covered by the provincial healthcare systems and are paid under private insurance coverage or by the patients themselves.</p><p>Ninety percent of hospital laboratories (accounting for 60-70% of all tests performed) are not recompensed on a fee-for- service basis. They manage an annual budget to provide inpatient services and to accommodate outpatient testing referred by physicians.</p><p>Laboratory budget restrictions and rationalisation of resources have been a feature of Canadian health care since the mid-1980s. As a result laboratory professionals have gained experience in evaluating the cost/benefit of new technologies or technological enhancements of existing products before adopting them.</p><p>the Canadian diagnostics market</p><p>Throughout the 1990s the diagnostic reagent market has remained relatively stable, growing 3-5% annually, with some sectors performing more strongly than other, more mature segments. In 1994 the market for clinical diagnostic reagents and controls reached Can$252 million. The value of the market for clinical instruments is difficult to assess since, with the exception of haematology analysers, virtually all instrument placements are made on a reagent-rental or leasing contract. Nevertheless, there are approximately 645 instruments placed annually (see table). The 1994 market for clinical laboratory supplies was Can$195 million.</p><pre>Canadian diagnostic reagents market 1994 Can$ millions % % change vs '93 Routine chemistries 66 26.2 +5 Immunochemistries 62 24.6 +10 Microbiology 43 17.1 +5 Haematology 25 9.92 +1 Virology 23 9.13 +5 Coagulation 12 4.76 +5 Urinalysis 8 3.17 +1 Serology 5 1.98 +2 Cardiac markers 4 1.59 +15 Blood bank 4 1.59 +1 TOTAL 252 100.0 Source: StratCom</pre><p>At least 90% of the products used in Canadian clinical laboratories are imported.

Trained professionals serve an informed general public and a highly educated medical community in a climate of rationalised healthcare spending.</p><p>Canada's Health Care System</p><p>Canada comprises ten provinces and two territories. The federal Canada Health Act of 1965 legislated equal access to medical care across Canada, but the implementation of this legislation was left to the individual provinces. Therefore the health care system in each province is managed differently. These differences are a reflection of the political orientation, the industrial policies and social concerns in each province.</p><p>Shara Rosen is the senior consultant with StratCom, a market research and marketing communications company focused on diagnostics and medical biotechnology, based at 8255 Mountain Sights #160, Montreal, Quebec H4P 2B5, Canada.
