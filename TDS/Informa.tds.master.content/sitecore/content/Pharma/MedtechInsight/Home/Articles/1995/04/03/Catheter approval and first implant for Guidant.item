<p>Guidant's (US) ACS Rx Lifestream coronary dilatation catheter has received FDA approval for the treatment of blocked coronary arteries. The company says distribution will begin immediately; the product has been on sale in Canada and Japan since December 1994. Ginger Howard, president of Guidant subsidiary Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, says the ACS Rx Lifestream is "the first non-compliant perfusion balloon catheter released in the US".</p><p>Meanwhile another Guidant subsidiary, Cardiac Pacemakers (CPI), has announced the first implant of its Ventak PRx III HC AICD (automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator). The device was implanted in a 44-year old male at Elyria Memorial Hospital in Elyria, Ohio.</p><p>The PRx III HC system, which includes CPI's Endotak 70-series lead and its Model 2950 Programmer-Recorder-Monitor, is released in Europe and under review in the US. The device is based on CPI's Ventak PRx III but uses the pulse generator as one of the electrodes.</p>
