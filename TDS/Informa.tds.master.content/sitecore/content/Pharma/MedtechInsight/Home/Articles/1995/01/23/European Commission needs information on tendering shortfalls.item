<p>The European Commission is aware that fewer tenders are being published in the EU than should be and often an inadequate amount of information is given, George O'Brien of DGXV/B/3 (the Internal Market and Financial Service Directorate) told delegates at the recent IAPM conference. His statement was made in response to data given by John Chudleigh of Euro-Bid Watch, which demonstrated how lack of transparency in medical prosthesis tendering could constitute a barrier to trade.</p>

<p>The European Commission is aware that fewer tenders are being published in the EU than should be and often an inadequate amount of information is given, George O'Brien of DGXV/B/3 (the Internal Market and Financial Service Directorate) told delegates at the recent IAPM conference. His statement was made in response to data given by John Chudleigh of Euro-Bid Watch, which demonstrated how lack of transparency in medical prosthesis tendering could constitute a barrier to trade.</p><p>Mr O'Brien explained that his department is complaint-driven, but that it has not received complaints from medical prosthesis manufacturers. He hoped that Mr Chudleigh would take up his observations with the Commission. Once DG XV has the facts, it can intervene. The Commission, Mr O'Brien explained, has a difficult juggling act in regulating tendering procedures - between monitoring/controlling and maintaining subsidiarity.</p><p>Commission's public procurement objectives</p><p>Through its legislation programme, which has included the adoption of Directives on Supplies, Works, Services and Remedies for Works and Supplies, the Commission aims to:</p><p>* remove obstacles to competition and end discrimination in favour of national firms; and</p><p>* adapt and extend the coverage of the Community's regulatory framework to make public procurement more efficient in serving needs and using resources. This should be achieved by: ensuring SMEs are able to make their full potential contribution; obtaining substantial savings where costs differ widely for the same product; and building up a strong Union position in key industries, taking advantage of potential economies of scale and improved distribution of resources.</p><p>Many Member States have not completed the transposition of these Directives into their law and are due to be taken before the European Court of Justice.</p>
