<p>The expansion of the European Union and the opening up of eastern Europe make Austria far more interesting than it used to be.</p><p>Austria is the gateway to eastern Europe but culturally and economically placed firmly in the west. Its borders adjoin the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and former Yugoslavia as well as Italy, Switzerland and Germany. Companies can employ distributors in the lucrative if small Austrian medical device market - estimated at $470 million per year by MDIS Publications - and also use them to develop contacts in eastern Europe.</p><p>Of course, this assumes that companies can gain a foothold in the first place. The medical device market is dominated by one country, Germany, which provides 45% of Austria's supplies. Siemens is particularly prominent. Bearing in mind the proximity, common language and close historical relationship between the two countries, this will probably remain the case.</p><p>However, Austria is far from being an impenetrable market that non-German companies should avoid. On January 1st, 1995, it became a full member of the European Union, meaning that under the AIMD and Medical Devices Directives it must allow all CE- marked medical devices onto the market - a fact which could challenge German dominance. According to MDIS, manufacturers need to offer high quality innovative products or low-cost disposables to be able to compete.</p><pre>Austrian balance of trade in medical devices 1993 ($ millions) Selected products Imports Exports Balance ECGs and electrodiagnostics 66.6 37.6 (29.0) X-ray devices & related 82.0 27.0 (55.0) Dental devices 29.8 41.1 11.2 Syringes, needles & catheters 52.8 4.3 (48.5) Ophthalmic instruments 9.1 2.0 (7.1) Medical sterilisers 6.0 6.5 0.5 Other medical instruments 160.5 35.2 (125.3) Orthopaedic implants/appliances 33.0 6.6 (26.5) Dental prostheses 13.0 13.7 0.8 Other prostheses 11.1 7.0 (4.1) Pacemakers 10.6 0.3 (10.3) Bandages & dressings 29.6 25.1 (4.5) Other items 124.1 85.3 (38.8) Total 629.0 291.7 (337.3)</pre><pre>Austrian medical imports by origin - 1993 Germany 45% Other EU countries 19% US 17% Japan 5% Switzerland 9% Other 5%</pre><p>Medical device demand is expected to increase by some 3% per year in the medium term, according to MDIS. The major growth areas in imports are orthopaedics, prosthetics and dental equipment, which all saw import sales rise 10% in 1993. Imports of electromedical and X-ray equipment, on the other hand, fell marginally during the year. Exports rose 2% in 1993, with eastern Europe accounting for some 23% of medical instrument and 14% of electromedical device sales abroad.</p><pre>Austrian medical statistics Population (1994) 7.9 million Live births per 1,000 population (1993) 11.9 Deaths per 1,000 population (1993) 10.3 Health expenditure (1992) $15,600 million Health expenditure as % of GDP 8.4% Medical device market (1994) $470 million</pre><pre>Leading causes of death (1992) Circulatory diseases 42,781 51% Cancer 19,875 24% External causes 5,094 6% Digestive diseases 4,212 5% Respiratory diseases 3,926 5% Other 7,274 9%</pre><p>This 26-page profile of Austria is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications.
