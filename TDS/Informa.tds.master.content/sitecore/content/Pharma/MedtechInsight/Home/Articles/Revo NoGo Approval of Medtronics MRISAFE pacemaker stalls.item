<p> <b>US launch of Medtronic's MRI-compatible pacemaker, Revo MRI SureScan, is likely to be delayed as the company awaits the results of an FDA reinspection of its manufacturing facility. <i>Elizabeth Cairns</i>, Deputy Editor, reports. </b> </p> <p> The agency initially inspected the facility at Mounds View, Minnesota, last summer. It issued a warning letter to Medtronic in November 2009, stating that the processes used in pacemaker production did not conform to current good manufacturing practice. </p> <p> It has now completed its reinspection of the facility, but the results might not be forthcoming for several months. Until the FDA sanctions the production of the Revo and related devices, the device cannot be approved for sale in the US. </p> <p> The device had been on track to become the first MRI-compatible pacemaker on the US market. Revo &ndash; formerly known as the EnRhythm MRI &ndash; gained the backing of an FDA advisory panel earlier this year. Approval of the system was unanimously recommended by the agency's circulatory system devices panel on 19 March, though conditions were imposed (www.clinica.co.uk, 22 March 2010). The FDA usually follows its panels' recommendations but is not bound by them. </p> <p> The FDA classifies medical devices into three categories: MR-Safe, where the device is completely non-magnetic, non-electrically conductive, and non-reactive to radiofrequency (RF) energy; MR-Conditional, where the product may contain magnetic, electrically conductive or RF-reactive components which are safe in proximity to MRI, provided the conditions for safe operation are defined and observed; and MR-Unsafe. Revo is designated MR-Conditional. </p> <p> The pacemaker is already in use in Europe. Medtronic CE marked it under the name EnRhythm MRI SureScan in November 2008 (www.clinica.co.uk, 27 November 2008). Medtronic also launched two other MRI-safe pacemakers, the Advisa and Ensura systems, in Europe this year (www.clinica.co.uk, 1 July 2010). </p> <h3> &quot;No speculation&quot; </h3> <p> Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Medtronic said that the firm did not wish to speak to <i>Clinica</i> about its MRI-safe pacemaker technology, &quot;given where we are with the regulatory status in the US&quot;. The company confirmed that US approval of the device is &quot;pending&quot;, but said there was &quot;no speculation on timing&quot;. </p> <p> The FDA's actions could also delay the US release of the Protecta family of implanted defibrillators, as they are manufactured at the same facility. Designed to minimise inappropriate shocks, these devices were launched in Europe in June 2010, Medtronic having CE marked them in March. </p> <p> The delay in approval ought to benefit St Jude Medical, the second most advanced developer of MRI-safe pacemaker technology; it hopes to introduce its Accent MRI-safe pacemaker in Europe by the end of this year. Boston Scientific is also working on similar products, but these are at an even earlier stage. However, as Medtronic's device is significantly ahead of its competition, there is still every chance that the Revo MRI SureScan will be first to break the lucrative US market. </p>
