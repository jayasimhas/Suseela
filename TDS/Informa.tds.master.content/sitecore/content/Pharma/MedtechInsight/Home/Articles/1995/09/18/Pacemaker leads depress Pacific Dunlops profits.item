<p>Telectronics' faulty pacemaker leads have dragged profits down at its parent company, Australia-based Pacific Dunlop. An Aus$157 million ($118 million) write-off reduced Pacific Dunlop's profits to Aus$94 million in fiscal 1995, 69% less than in the previous year. Excluding the write-off, the picture is less bleak with profits down just 18% to Aus$251 million.</p>

<p>Telectronics' faulty pacemaker leads have dragged profits down at its parent company, Australia-based Pacific Dunlop. An Aus$157 million ($118 million) write-off reduced Pacific Dunlop's profits to Aus$94 million in fiscal 1995, 69% less than in the previous year. Excluding the write-off, the picture is less bleak with profits down just 18% to Aus$251 million.</p><p>The write-off included Aus$87 million for R&D costs for the Nucleus group, which consists of Telectronics and the smaller Cochlear bionic ear company. In the interim accounts, Telectronics had made an Aus$40 million provision. A further provision of Aus$17 million has been added for legal costs.</p><p>Pacific Dunlop expects the current difficulties at Telectronics to continue for at least the first half of fiscal 1996 with "significant losses" at the pacemaker producer.</p><p>Telectronics' US lead manufacture has been suspended after the company entered into a consent decree with the US FDA in May (see Clinica No 656, p 20). Audits of the US facilities by the regulatory agencies of the UK, Europe, Japan and Australia have been completed satisfactorily and production for sales in these markets continues. Telectronics introduced new products in the US earlier this year including a new-generation dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker and the Guardian 4310 defibrillator.</p><p>In a new addition to Telectronics' problems, the company voluntarily withdrew its Encor passive fixation atrial leads in September as a precautionary measure following four reported incidents of fracture and protrusion of the retention wire.</p><p>Legal action on the Accufix leads is proceeding In the US; 152 lawsuits have been brought, 37 of which seek class certification of all 35,000 patients worldwide. All lawsuits have been consolidated under a master complaint in the Federal District Court in the Southern District of Ohio, Cincinatti. This court will decide on class certification.</p><p>In Canada, a single action has commenced in Ontario and at the end of August, the Ontario Court of Justice granted certification of a class encompassing the 1,112 Canadian patients implanted with the Accufix pacing lead. Telectronics says it will seek leave to appeal.</p><p>Pacific Dunlop's healthcare business was not all gloom and doom in fiscal 1995. Cochlear, which will be offered for sale later this year (see Clinica No 650/52, p 22), achieved "excellent" results. Latex products manufacturer Ansell showed a 6% sales increase based on strong demand in all world markets, Pacific Dunlop says. It adds that the acquisition of the Perry glove business in May from Smith & Nephew (UK) has increased Ansell's share of the world surgical glove market.</p><pre>Pacific Dunlop's 1995 results (Aus$ millions) Operating Operating revenue profit (loss) 1995 % change 1995 1994 Healthcare Latex Products - Ansell 714 6% 88 74 Medical Products - Nucleus 354 -10% (2) 34 Consumer Products 1,326 5% 139 116 Distribution 1,448 16% 86 67 Automotive group 1,716 0% 132 137 Pacific Brands Food 1,064 10% 74 52 Industrial & electrical 675 -1% 89 106 Other 65 -16% (5) 1 Total (adjusted) 7,306 5% 601 587 (ended June 30th)</pre>
