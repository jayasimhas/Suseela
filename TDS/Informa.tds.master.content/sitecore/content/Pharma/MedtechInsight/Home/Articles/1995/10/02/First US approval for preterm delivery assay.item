<p>Tokos Medical (US) hopes to launch a foetal fibronectin immunoassay as a marker for preterm delivery by the end of the year. US FDA marketing approval was granted last week for the test to which Tokos acquired exclusive US and Canadian marketing rights from Adeza Biomedical in 1991 (see Clinica No 485, p 5).</p>

<p>Tokos Medical (US) hopes to launch a foetal fibronectin immunoassay as a marker for preterm delivery by the end of the year. US FDA marketing approval was granted last week for the test to which Tokos acquired exclusive US and Canadian marketing rights from Adeza Biomedical in 1991 (see Clinica No 485, p 5).</p><p>The fFN test helps physicians to determine if delivery is imminent when preterm labour symptoms occur between the 24th and 34th week of pregnancy. A positive result indicates that special intervention may be required, while a negative result means a less than 1% likelihood of delivery within seven to 14 days of testing. Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US. According to the CDC, the preterm birth rate rose to 10.7% in 1992 from 9.4% in 1981. Some $5,000 million is spent each year on neonatal intensive care for preterm babies.</p><p>Approval for the test, which had expedited review status, was recommended by an FDA panel in April (see Clinica No 650/51, p 23).</p>
