<p>Deficiencies in <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>'s quality assurance procedures at its US in vitro diagnostics manufacturing plants in Chicago, discovered during FDA inspections in 1993 and 1994, surfaced last week in a report in the Wall Street Journal. The complaints relate to good manufacturing practice violations which Abbott says it is addressing. A reinspection of the facilities affected is expected soon.</p><p>Following FDA inspections of Abbott's Chicago facilities in April-May 1993, Abbott received a Warning Letter in October 1993 citing failure to validate equipment and manufacturing processes adequately; and failure to maintain adequate written processing procedures, complete device history records and complete complaint files. Until these deficiencies have been corrected, stated the FDA, no pending PMAs or export applications will be approved nor 510(k)s cleared for products manufactured at the site.</p><p>A further Warning Letter was sent to Abbott in March 1994 following inspections of the Abbott Park facility in Chicago. Violations of GMPs included inadequate process validation and failure to follow-up complaints. Since the inspections and warning letters, the FDA has held meetings with Abbott and specific concerns were identified in a letter from the agency in October last year. Among these were inadequate validation of bead coating procedures for HIV and the Auszyme assays: prospective validation protocols are currently under review by the FDA.</p><p>little impact on earnings</p><p>Abbott says that these regulatory issues have had no unusual impact on its diagnostics business performance in 1994. A spokesman for the company told Clinica that the actions reflect the increasing level of scrutiny by the FDA of the healthcare industry. Production of tests at the Chicago facilities has not been halted. Abbott was "aware of no unusual issues related to product performance". No products have been recalled.</p><p>Abbott's diagnostic product sales were estimated at $2,148 million in 1993, accounting for 26% of $8,408 million total corporate sales (see Clinica No 625, p 13). Abbott is leader in the world diagnostics market and ranked fourth in the overall medical devices & diagnostics market (see Clinica's 1994 Review Issue, page 30).</p><p>The American Red Cross, which purchases three tests from Abbott for blood screening - HIV-1/2, hepatitis B surface antingen and HTLV, told Clinica that its relationship with Abbott was unlikely to be affected by the FDA's action. Abbott is the sole supplier of HIV and hepatitis B tests to the Red Cross.</p><p>US analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that the FDA-related issues will have no impact on Abbott's 1995 earnings. They comment that the regulatory issues highlight what is predominantly routine interaction between the FDA and diagnostics companies.</p>
