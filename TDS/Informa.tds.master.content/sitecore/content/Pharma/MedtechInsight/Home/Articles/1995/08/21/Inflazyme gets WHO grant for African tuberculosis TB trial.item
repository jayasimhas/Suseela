<p><strong>[C#199300303:Inflazyme]</strong> Pharmaceuticals (Canada) has been awarded a WHO research grant to test its TB kit in Uganda. The trial will be carried out by Makene University in Uganda and Cape Western Reserve University, Ohio, US.</p><p>The WHO is critical of many of the TB projects currently being funded by western governments. Inflazyme believes its kit was chosen because it is fast, reliable and inexpensive, which makes it ideal for use in Africa.</p><p>Tuberculosis is the leading killer of HIV-positive individuals on a global scale and most health programmes are currently ill-prepared to tackle the crisis. By the end of the decade, around one-third of all deaths among HIV-positive people will result from TB, according to WHO Global TB Programme estimates. In Abidjan, Ivory Coast, for example, 32% of AIDS patients are thought to have died from TB. HIV is now spreading most rapidly in Asia where TB infection is even more widespread than in Africa.</p><p>A special meeting of AIDS and TB research experts convened by the WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme in June attempted to identify the most relevant research and action to improve TB control in areas where HIV infection is prevalent or increasing. The group agreed upon a set of the most pressing research needs surrounding the HIV/TB co-epidemic:</p><p>* improve diagnosis; * the role of and need for preventive TB therapy for vulnerable populations; * research co-ordination and integration of TB services with HIV services at district level in areas of high HIV prevalence, including emphasis on the role of the private sector; * explore the barriers which impede TB patients from seeking and continuing care in high HIV prevalence areas; and * conduct a critical study of current expenditures for TB control in communities badly affected by HIV.</p>
