<p>Spain is among the last six countries to have transposed the Medical Devices Directive. During the second half of June, a draft medical devices decree was circulated to interested parties, including the Spanish and European trade associations respectively, FENIN and EUCOMED, with a 10-day comment period. Clinica's Jon Bryant recently spoke to Maria del Carmen Abad Luna, deputy director of the healthcare products evaluation division of the Spanish Health Ministry, about the latest regulatory developments.</p><p>When will Spain finish transposing the Medical Devices Directive into Spanish law?</p><p>We hope it will be completed by the end of the year, but are still awaiting comments and official reports.</p><p>The DGFPS has already been appointed a Notified Body for this Directive, ahead of the Spanish law. Are there likely to be any other Notified Bodies for medical devices?</p><p>At present there is little demand for certification. We don't have many Spanish manufacturers and can satisfy demand. If demand increases, another body may be notified.</p><p>Has Spain been asked by the European Commission to modify any parts of its AIMD decree?</p><p>The Commission wrote us a letter approximately a year ago with a series of questions; it was not a formal letter calling for changes. We answered immediately and we have not received anything since. We believe the Commission is studying our reply but has not answered us officially. We believe the answers we gave to the Commission and the measures that we have implemented are all justifiable.</p><p>How soon will work begin on the transposition of the (draft) IVD Directive?</p><p>Work will begin on the decree when we have a definitive text of the Directive. We are attending the Commission's IVD working group on the Directive.</p><p>Has Spain issued any Vigilance warnings under the AIMD/MD Directives. Have you received many reports from other countries?</p><p>We have received very few warnings about CE-marked products. Those we do receive, we treat in the appropriate way, evaluating each case on its merits. The company concerned is always contacted first before we inform other members. Up to now we have had to report only one incident, involving pacemakers about a year ago. We have received a few Vigilance reports from other Member States, though these are confidential.</p><p>The Vigilance reports we receive are not normally written in Spanish. First reports are generally in English. However, we ask that complementary information or explanations be written in Spanish if possible. The complex, technical nature of some issues means it is important that documents are understood fully and this may be more difficult if the text is not translated into Spanish. If an expert is required, we would prefer to receive the text in Spanish.</p><p>Spain also requires all documentation accompanying products to be in Spanish. Will there be any exceptions - for example for computer software, or for some professional-use products?</p><p>Computer software does not have to be written in Spanish, as long as instructions exist so it can be understood alongside messages that appear on the screen. Everything else has to be written in Spanish. Professional-use products means practically all products - only 10-15% of products are for direct consumer use - and documentation for these has to be written in Spanish.</p><p>Do applications for clinical investigations have to be in Spanish?</p><p>Since clinical investigations are national procedures, they have to be written in Spanish. Any procedure that occurs at administrative level has to be written in the national language or languages.</p><p>Will all medical devices need to be registered in Spain regardless of their class? What type of information is needed for registration?</p><p>Since the Medical Devices Directive has not yet been transposed, there is no obligation yet to register products according to their class. This is only required for AIMDs, which are all in Class III. We don't know what will happen until the Directive is published.</p><p>How is your department helping Spanish industry become more aware of, and prepare to meet, the new requirements?</p><p>Representatives from our department always attend industry conferences and can help explain new requirements. For the AIMD directive, we held an open day in the Health Ministry. We are also sending out information circulars to industry and hospitals. We are normally asked about future legislation at the many congresses we attend and are preparing information on CE marking at the moment.</p>
