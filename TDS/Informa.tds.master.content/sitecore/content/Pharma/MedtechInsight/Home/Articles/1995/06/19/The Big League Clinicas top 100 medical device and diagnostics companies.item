<p>Hot on the heels of the companies' reporting season, Clinica publishes its league table of the top 100 in the medical device and diagnostics industry in 1994. Sales by these companies account for over 90% of the world market.</p><p>The main difference from the previous year is the departure of <strong>[C#198600152:Eli Lilly]</strong> and the arrival of Kodak with an estimated turnover figure for its medical imaging business. Furthermore, <strong>[C#198600358:Bayer]</strong> has advanced in the ranking because its Agfa subsidiary's medical imaging sales have been added to its diagnostics turnover.</p><p>As in 1993, Baxter is by far the largest company but a large proportion of its turnover comes from US distribution - $2,400 million in 1993 and $2,475 million in 1994. If these figures are subtracted, Baxter's lead is less impressive. In 1994, for example, its lead over Johnson & Johnson would be reduced to around $1,500 million rather than $4,000 million. In the current year, this gap will be further reduced when the sale of Baxter's diagnostics arm and industrial division is taken into account. The two deals could reduce Baxter's turnover by some $800-900 million in 1995. At the same time Johnson & Johnson is catching up. Last year it bought some $500 million worth of turnover in the form of Kodak's clinical diagnostics division.</p><p>The biggest slide in the league in 1994 was by US Surgical in its second consecutive bad year. UK-based Vickers saw revenues drop significantly and WR Grace's medical products sales were down due to a decline in bloodline sales after US import alerts in 1993. Siemens turnover fell nearly 5%, in line with the German company's forecast.</p><p>currency effects</p><p>Japanese companies benefited from the strengthening of the yen in 1994 to the tune of about 10 percentage points. For example, the fastest growing Japanese company, Fukuda Denshi, saw its revenues increase 6% when expressed in yen but 18% in US$ terms. The German companies benefited too, but only slightly. The strongest growing German company was <strong>[C#198601363:Fresenius]</strong>, whose sales rose 15% in DM and 17% in US$ in 1994.</p><p>Geographically, some 60% of the top 100 companies' turnover has been achieved by US-based businesses and about 30% by European concerns, with more than half contributed by German-based businesses. Japanese companies account for just 8%.</p><p>Hectic merger & acquisition activity in 1994 will be reflected in the 1995 table. So far this year Clinica has recorded some 80 M&A deals compared with some 150 during the whole of 1994. The value of the deals is somewhat lower than a year earlier, at $3,500-4,000 million, because of the absence of massive mergers to date. Among the largest deals were Nellcor's purchase of Puritan-Bennett in May, Thermo Electron's acquisition of Fisons' scientific instruments, Smith & Nephew's purchase of Acufex and Johnson & Johnson buying Mitek.</p><p>Definition of medtech & diagnostics</p><p>The top 100 table embraces the medical device and diagnostics sector as reported on by Clinica. With definition a problem, some subjective decisions were required to define the sector. The following areas are included:</p><p>medical devices and instruments within cardiology, orthopaedics, patient monitoring, surgical, MIS, woundcare, drug delivery and imaging including nuclear medicine; the dental sector, home healthcare, some rehabilitation devices; dialysis devices (excluding dialysis services); hearing aids, surgical gloves, condoms, soft goods, casting and bandages; diagnostics ranging from immunoassays to home pregnancy tests (excluding diagnostic testing services as run by Roche or SmithKline Beecham); contrast media; ophthalmic products for surgical use (excluding contact lenses or lens care products). Scientific instruments such as Perkin-Elmer's and laboratory trade such as E Merck's are excluded.</p><p>Next week Clinica will publish a list of the 50 leading diagnostics companies to supplement this week's general top 100 table. This will be followed by league tables of cardiology, imaging, surgical and woundcare companies during 1995. Tables on the orthopaedics and the contrast agents industries were published in May in Clinica No 654.</p>
