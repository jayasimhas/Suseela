<p>Medical device suppliers in Spain were offered little hope for more rapid payment at industry association FENIN's Second Congress of the medical product industry. Delegates were told earlier this month that some health authorities' budgets already fall short of the purchasing funds they require and that deficits in some regions may even increase this year.</p><p>The major problem is that there are not enough resources, claimed Jose Antonio Souto Ibanez, the Andalucian health authority's director of finance. Other explanations were that the regions' budgets for 1995 were set against 1993 figures; that health managers were too distant from industry; and that banks could no longer offer the helpful credit facilities of the past.</p><p>While debts have been reduced over the last 12 months by some 14% to the end of February, according to FENIN, the situation is still severe and industry was not heartened by what health representatives at the congress had to say about the future.</p><p>Following the first congress of the medical device industry last year, deals were struck to guarantee payment within 90 days by Insalud, while some other health authorities confirmed payment would be made within a year. Improved credit terms with banks were also agreed for outstanding delays. However, the second meeting did not offer the same degree of open discussion - no representatives from Insalud were present, the Health Minister Angeles Amador was unable to attend and Xavier Trias, Catalonia's health representative, did not stay for questions.</p><p>Delegates at the conference believed the medtech business was treated less favourably than the pharmaceutical industry and wanted answers as to why the medical device industry faced worse repayment deals from health authorities. According to Pilar Gonzalez Gancedo, director general of pharmaceutical and medical products at the Health Ministry, the two sectors are treated in the same way, but delegates disagreed. No clear solution has been reached, a similar response given to international companies when they met the Economy Ministry several weeks ago.</p><pre>Days delay in payment for medical devices Region/Health March 1994 Feb 1995 Authority Andalucia 611 542 Canaries - 289 Catalonia 393 328 Valencia 179 196 Galicia 388 297 Navarra 100 104 Basque Country 115 121 Insalud 348 203 National average 387 301 Source: FENIN</pre>
