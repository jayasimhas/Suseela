<p>Oriol Dunach spoke to Clinica's Jon Bryant about Diagnostic <strong>[C#200900443:Grifols]</strong>' new pan-American deal.</p><p>Diagnostic Grifols, the IVD and medical devices division of Spanish company Grupo Grifols, has purchased a 25% share in US reagent manufacturer Quest Inter-national. The deal should increase the company's diagnostic sales, which are projected to reach Pta 2,500 million ($21 million) by 1996. Medical device sales, which include surgical instruments and catheters, are expected to be Pta 1,500 million, together representing some 15% of group turnover.</p><p>As part of a joint-venture agreement, Grifols will develop the instruments for Quest's ELISA TORCH technology. "We want to gain control of some interesting products," says Mr Dunach, general manager of Diagnostic Grifols. "Since we are shareholders, we will be able to guarantee distribution in those territories where we have subsidiaries."</p><p>TORCH: a multi-test for pregnant women which detects toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes</p><p>Quest will be responsible for US distribution while Diagnostic Grifols will market in Europe and through its subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Argentina, Chile, Portugal and Mexico. Mr Dunach expects the joint venture's kits to be available by the end of the year and to have an instrument prototype ready within 18 months.</p><p>Grifols is operating in a Spanish medtech market worth an estimated Pta 430,000 million in 1993, of which in vitro diagnostics account for about a quarter, according to device industry association FENIN.</p><p>The group's domestic sales in 1994 accounted for Pta 15,000 million with exports from Spain reaching Pta 5,000 million. Some 80% of exports go to Europe, particularly Germany and the UK, the remainder to the Middle East. Direct "ex-works" sales from its international subsidiaries were an estimated Pta 3,000 million.</p><p>The company has grown at around 20% pa over the last two years - the fastest growth being experienced by Instituto Grifols' plasma derivatives, says Mr Dunach. While some 75% of sales are in Spain, the company sees this figure decreasing over the coming years as other markets develop more quickly. The most rapid growth has been experienced in its Latin American subsidiaries. A Czech Republic subsidiary, opened in 1991, offers the company additional access to the East European market.</p><pre>Geographical breakdown of sales in Spain South 25% Valencia 15% North 15% Northwest 10% Barcelona 15% Madrid 20%</pre><p>Diagnostic Grifols has distribution agreements with Angiomed (Germany) - acquired by Bard at the end of 1994 - and SciMed (US) - acquired by Boston Scientific last November - for PTCA catheters, which run to the end of August. The group has also struck deals with Pajunk (Germany) for intra- and epidermal anaesthesia needles - both deals signed at the start of the decade; Endosonics (US) for intravascular ultrasound; and Applied Medical (US) for embolectomy and thrombectomy catheters.</p><p>"It is difficult to see the big diagnostic companies covering everything over the next decade," says Mr Dunach. Companies are more likely to specialise according to the fields of expertise and technology available. Smaller companies will have to specialise or form joint ventures with other smaller companies as Grifols has done with Quest, he believes.</p><p>Spanish companies have traditionally found it difficult to become international since companies are generally small. However, there are exceptions, says Mr Dunach. Outside Spain, Grifols has exported 120 auto microtitre plate washers to Italy and 80 to the Netherlands this year.</p><p>"We are making a major effort with R&D; those companies which have risked funds will benefit." Diagnostic Grifols spends approximately 4% of consolidated turnover on R&D. Mr Dunach believes this figure will increase for another year and then level off. The company is currently developing a Lyme disease ELISA and a Chagas' disease detection kit for Central and South America. It also has a Rickettsia test under development. However, the company says it will rely increasingly on its US partner for reagent development.</p><pre>Breakdown of Grifols' diagnostic sales Immunohaematology 50% Haematology 25% Microbiology & TORCH 25%</pre><p>"We want to develop our microbiology and haematology technology in order to achieve a more balanced diagnostics profile," says Mr Dunach. Grifols is also developing centrifuges, water incubators and DNA probe incubators, and has developed a semi-automatic sampler to automate the gel test whereby a reader can be linked to the sampler and both processes can be controlled by the same computer. The company has manufactured 300 samplers over the last three years. It also hopes to develop a "walkaway", larger version of the system since the centrifugal process currently has to be done separately.</p><pre>Grupo Grifols comprises: * Laboratorios Grifols: IV solutions, enteral nutrition, disposable blood bags * Instituto Grifols: Plasma derivatives * Diagnostic Grifols: Diagnostics, laboratory instruments and reagents * Logister: Medical and hospital software</pre><p>In 1985, Grifols had an IVD and medical devices joint venture with American Hospital Supply called Dade Grifols. When AHS was acquired by Baxter in 1985, Grifols sold Dade Grifols to Baxter and started its own diagnostics business from scratch. In 1987, when Alfa Therapeutic bought a 50% share in the group's diagnostic business (it already owned 50% of the pharmaceuticals business) Diagnostic Grifols was created. Alfa Therapeutic is wholly-owned by Green Cross, based in Osaka, Japan.</p><p>The group's products are marketed by wholly-owned Movaco in the Spanish and Portuguese markets and by Grupo Grifols International Division overseas. The group employs over 900 people in Spain and a further 100 in its foreign subsidiaries.</p>
