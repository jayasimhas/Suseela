<p>Congress is holding more oversight hearings on medical device matters at the FDA this year than ever before - many of them confrontational, none of them particularly friendly, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>The House Commerce oversight & investigation subcommittee has been studying retaliation by FDA employees against device and drug manufacturers who question the bureaucrats' edicts. The next panel session is scheduled for July 25th. Commissioner David Kessler may be invited to testify, the subcommittee says, "to explain ... the contradiction between his assurances [earlier this year] that retaliation will not be tolerated and his apparent unwillingness to provide timely assistance" to the subcommittee.</p><p>Subcommittee research indicates retaliation may be one reason the FDA took nine years to approve a simple breast self- examination device, Earl Wright's Sensor Pad. When Wright officials "invoked the procedures available to them under FDA rules to complain about the behaviour of certain officials, the reaction of these officials was hostile, unprofessional and contained veiled and not so veiled threats of retaliation," subcommittee chairman Joe Barton (R-Tex) told Commissioner Kessler several weeks ago. He had requested agency documents concerning Sensor Pad.</p><p>But Dr Kessler has been "strangely silent", Mr Barton told Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala last week. The subcommittee has received only "a token phone call" from FDA's legislative staff and an unsatisfactory letter from an Associate Commissioner. In his letter to Dr Shalala, Mr Barton claims: "It appears that Dr Kessler and his legislative and legal advisers have retreated to a position that the FDA itself will determine both the timing and extent of investigations of its employees. This is totally unacceptable."</p><p>He wants the Assistant Secretary for Health to "take over the task of assuring that documents requested from the FDA, both for this particular matter and all other matters where they are delinquent are produced forthwith". While Mr Barton hopes that "we can work together", he makes clear his intention to maintain the subcommittee's record of enforcing its requests for information: "We will not hesitate to compel the production of documents."</p><p>In a separate letter to Dr Kessler, Rep Barton may have unwittingly put a roadblock in the path of the FDA's proposed external-review project. Questioning apparent conflict of interest at the agency, he notes that some former high-ranking drug officials "have left the agency to take positions ... with consulting firms that may well have benefited from the recommendations of those individuals while they worked for the agency".</p><p>Mr Barton wants a list of all product review and compliance activities that the FDA permits outside consultants to perform and a corresponding list of the FDA officials empowered to approve or recommend such consultants. Outside review of medical devices could rely heavily on these consulting firms.</p><p>risk assessment under scrutiny</p><p>The House Committee on Government Reform & Oversight human resources & intergovernmental relations subcommittee plans a hearing on August 1st on risk-assessment standards used by the FDA in the evaluation of medical devices, including breast implants. "We will discuss the information provided to the FDA and Congress by implant manufacturers regarding the safety and efficacy of silicone implants," chairman Christopher Shays (R- Conn) says. "We are determined that women have access to the latest information on the biocompatibility of silicones used in breast implants."</p><p>Potential product liability will not be discussed, Mr Shays adds. "We will not attempt to try [pending implant] cases or to prejudge the conclusions of scientific studies still under way."</p><p>That same panel will hold a joint hearing with the national economic growth, natural resources & regulatory affairs subcommittee on August 3rd on Medicare reimbursement for investigational devices. Both the FDA and the Health Care Financing Administration are expected to report their latest plan to pay for some still-unapproved devices for the elderly.</p>
