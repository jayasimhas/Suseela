<p>US companies expect to gain a greater share of the Chinese medical technology market following the inauguration last month of the Medical Technology Subgroup (MTS) as part of the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. The Health Industry Manufacturers Association and the Medical Device Manufacturers Association were among US industry groups represented at the April meeting in Beijing.</p><p>The MTS, which plans to establish two separate task forces - for medical devices and pharmaceuticals, provides an officially- recognised forum in which US delegates will discuss issues of concern with the Ministry of Public Health and the State Pharmaceutical Administration of China, which regulates most medical devices. The MTS plans to meet twice a year, alternating between the two countries - the next meetings are scheduled in the autumn in Washington and in spring 1996 in China.</p><p>The Subgroup aims to identify commercial opportunities in the medical technology sector and provide information exchange. Expanded trade and investment in the sector will be a major focus of the MTS, which will prepare joint market studies on evolving trade problems and prospects. It seeks to assist in modernising China's medtech industry, where practical, and identify China's product requirements which could be met through US suppliers.</p><p>new device regulations</p><p>During the April meeting, HIMA president Alan Magazine met officials from SPAC to discuss the status of new regulations due to become effective later this year (see Clinica No 644, p 10). The medical device regulations, which have been drawn up in consultation with the US industry association, will encompass IVDs as devices. Export certificates from developed countries will be accepted and international standards will apply. Quality systems certifications will be reviewed by third-party organisations, while self-certification of low-risk devices will be accepted instead of premarket approval.</p>
