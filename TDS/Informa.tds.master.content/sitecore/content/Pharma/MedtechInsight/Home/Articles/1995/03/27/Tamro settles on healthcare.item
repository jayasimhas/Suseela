<p>With more than 98% of Tamro's turnover in 1994 contributed by healthcare, the Finnish group is close to fulfilling its of concentrating solely on this field. Tamro's sales rose 8%, as predicted by the Finnish company in November (see Clinica No 628, p 14). After three years of losses, it moved into the black with a net profit of FMk 79 million ($18 million).</p><p>The Hospital and Laboratory division strengthened its position in distribution and hospital supplies, the company says, and with sales growth above that of the market the division increased its market share.</p><p>A large sales increase by Kolmi-Set, the division manufacturing incontinence products and surgical textiles, was partly due to the inclusion of Tamro's French acquisition, Bollore Technologies, from the beginning of May. Tamro says the French unit showed a loss in 1994. Divisional profits growth was also slowed by decreased demand for non-woven material.</p><p>Sales growth at the division charged with developing business in eastern Europe, Tamda, has been slower than expected, says Tamro. During 1994, the company built up a distribution system in St Petersburg (Russia) and the Baltic states.</p><pre>Tamro's 1994 results (FMk millions) 1994 1993 change Hospital and Laboratory 273 243 12% Kolmi-Set 209 137 53% Pharmaceutical Distribution 2,784 2,585 8% Tamda 48 - - Other 189 265 - Total sales 3,503 3,230 8% Net income (loss) 79 (167) (ended Dec 31st)</pre>
