<p>Publication of the draft Austrian medical devices law, transposing both the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, could be delayed until the end of this year. Although the comment period has finished, and the text is ready to be presented to Parliament, it may not reach it before the summer break.</p>

<p>Publication of the draft Austrian medical devices law, transposing both the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, could be delayed until the end of this year. Although the comment period has finished, and the text is ready to be presented to Parliament, it may not reach it before the summer break.</p><p>There is speculation that the text may be debated at length in Parliament since there are various subgroups specifically interested in health matters.</p><p>The candidates for Notified Body status are still waiting to be designated. They have to be approved by the Ministry of Trade Affairs before being notified to the European Commission by the Health Ministry. Candidates include TUV Austria and the Graz Technical University (see Clinica No 618/19, pp 8-9).</p><p>The European Commission says it is not yet in a position to respond to Austria's failure to transpose the Directive. Austria joined the European Union on January 1st this year, and files are still being transferred from the EFTA authorities to the Commission.</p>
