<p>Premarket approval applications (PMAs) will be required for 43 Class III medical devices identified by the US FDA in the Federal Register of September 7th. The agency sets out its reasons for designating the preamendment devices (those marketed before May 28th, 1976, or substantially equivalent devices) as Class III. Requests for changes to classification had to be submitted by September 22nd.</p>

<p>Premarket approval applications (PMAs) will be required for 43 Class III medical devices identified by the US FDA in the Federal Register of September 7th. The agency sets out its reasons for designating the preamendment devices (those marketed before May 28th, 1976, or substantially equivalent devices) as Class III. Requests for changes to classification had to be submitted by September 22nd.</p><p>The proposed rule implements the FDA's strategy for reclassification of preamendment Class III devices outlined in May last year. If a PMA or notice of completion of product development protocol has not been filed within 90 days of publication of the final rule, commercial distribution of the device must cease. It may be used for investigational purposes only, notes the FDA, which advises that IDE applications should be submitted at least 30 days before the end of the 90-day period.</p><p>The devices for which PMAs are required include:</p><p>Haematology & pathology devices</p><p>* Automated differential cell counter (Class III when intended for uses other than to flag or identify specimens containing abnormal blood cells)</p><p>Anaesthesiology devices</p><p>* Electroanaesthesia apparatus</p><p>Cardiovascular devices</p><p>* Catheter balloon repair kit * Trace microsphere * Carotid sinus nerve stimulator * High-energy DC-defibrillator (including paddles)</p><p>Dental devices</p><p>* Karaya & sodium borate with or without acacia denture adhesive (Class III only if it contains 12% or more by weight of sodium borate) * Carboxymethylcellulose sodium & cationic polyacrylamide polymer denture adhesive * Polyacrylamide polymer (modified cationic denture adhesive) * Polyvinylmethylether moleic anhydride (PVM-MA), acid copolymer & carboxymethylcellulose sodium (NACMC) denture adhesive * OTC denture reliner * Root canal filling resin (Class III if chloroform used as an ingredient)</p><p>Gastroenterology-urology devices</p><p>* Colonic irrigation system (Class II when intended for colon cleansing when medically indicated, such as before radiologic or endoscopic examinations; Class III when intended for other uses, including colon cleansing routinely for general well being) * Implanted electrical urinary continence device</p><p>General hospital & personal use devices</p><p>* Chemical cold pack snakebite kit</p><p>Neurological devices</p><p>* Rheo-encephalograph * Intravascular occluding catheter * Implanted spinal cord stimulator for bladder evacuation</p><p>Obstetrical & gynaecological devices</p><p>* Obstetric data analyser * Foetal electro-encephalographic monitor * Foetal scalp clip electrode & applicator * Expandable cervical dilator * Vibratory cervical dilator * Metreurynter-balloon abortion system * Abdominal decompression chamber</p><p>Orthopaedic devices</p><p>* Ankle joint metal/polymer non-constrained cemented prosthesis * Elbow joint humeral (hemi-elbow) metallic uncemented prosthesis * Finger joint metal/metal constrained uncemented prosthesis * Finger joint metal/metal constrained cemented prosthesis * Finger joint metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis * Hip joint metal constrained cemented or uncemented prosthesis * Hip joint metal/polymer constrained cemented or uncemented prosthesis * Hip joint (hemi-hip) acetabular metal cemented prosthesis * Hip joint femora l (hemi-hip) trunnion-bearing metal/polyacetal cemented prosthesis * Knee joint femorotibial metallic constrained cemented prosthesis * Knee joint patellofemoral polymer/metal semi-constrained cemented prosthesis * Knee joint patellofemorotibial polymer/metal/metal constrained cemented prosthesis * Knee joint femoral (hemi-knee) metallic uncemented prosthesis * Knee joint patellar (hemi-knee) metallic resurfacing uncemented prosthesis * Shoulder joint metal/metal or metal/polymer constrained cemented prosthesis * Shoulder joint glenoid (hemi-shoulder) metallic cemented prosthesis * Wrist joint metal constrained cemented prosthesis</p><p>Physical medicine devices</p><p>* Rigid pneumatic structure orthosis</p><p>Written comments on the proposal are requested by January 5th, 1996.</p>
