<p>Sales of hospital and laboratory products at <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> Laboratories once again lagged behind pharmaceutical and nutritional products in the first quarter. The hospital and laboratory division recorded turnover of $1,049 million, up 5.8% compared with the previous year. The division sold $575 million worth of goods in the US; international sales, including direct exports from the US, were $474 million. Abbott's other division, pharmaceutical and nutritional products, saw a 20.5% increase in first-quarter turnover.</p><p>Corporate sales were up 14% to $2,215 million, with nearly 2% added by a weaker US dollar. Net income rose $51 million, or 14%, to $417 million in the period and R&D spending rose 9% to $247 million.</p><p>In the first quarter, Abbott began marketing tobramycin, valproic acid and digoxin drug assays for its AxSYM immunoassay diagnostic system. Abbott is selling 21 assays for the systems in the US and 33 internationally. Recently, the Illinois-based company received FDA clearance for alphaFP, CEA and PSA assays and says these will be available to customers in the near future. The company also began marketing its second-generation blood screening test for HTLV-I, human t-lymphotropic virus type I, a retrovirus causing a rare form of leukaemia and neurological disorders.</p>
