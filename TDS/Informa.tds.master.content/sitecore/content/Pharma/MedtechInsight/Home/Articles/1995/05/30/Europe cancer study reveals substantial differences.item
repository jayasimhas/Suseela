<p>Switzerland, Finland and the Netherlands have the highest rates of cancer survival in Europe, according to a recently-published study. EU-backed Eurocare compares the survival incidence of some 80,000 cancer patients diagnosed between 1978-85 in 11 European countries. Patients were followed up to the end of 1990.</p>

<p>Switzerland, Finland and the Netherlands have the highest rates of cancer survival in Europe, according to a recently-published study. EU-backed Eurocare compares the survival incidence of some 80,000 cancer patients diagnosed between 1978-85 in 11 European countries. Patients were followed up to the end of 1990.</p><p>For most types of cancer, survival rates are broadly similar throughout Europe. However, for breast, large bowel and stomach cancer - for which the stage of disease at the time of treatment is a major determinant of survival - there are substantial differences between populations, reveals the report. While the study's authors maintain that no direct conclusions can be down about the relative efficiency of different national healthcare systems in diagnosis and treatment referral, results highlight the disparity between northern, southern and eastern Europe.</p><p>Survival is high in Finland, the Netherlands and Switzerland for most cancers, while Estonia and Poland come off worst. Among western European countries, Spain and the UK are ranked lowest. The proportion of Polish male colon cancer patients surviving five years - 18% - is less than half the European average of 41%. Only 40% of Spanish cervical cancer patients survived more than five years, while in Italy, France and Switzerland, almost two-thirds of women survived more than five years.</p><p>Survival differences observed in the Eurocare study raise questions concerning the value of early diagnosis. Patients may be treated at a more advanced stage of disease in different countries, says the report, and have less prompt access to diagnostic or treatment services.</p><p>Survival of cancer patients in Europe Age-standardised five-year survival (%)</p><pre>Colon cancer Men Women Switzerland 49.8 56.9 Finland 47.8 44.8 Netherlands 47.0 47.3 Spain 46.3 42.9 Germany 45.5 40.5 France 45.0 45.1 Italy 37.6 44.0 Scotland 36.8 34.4 Denmark 36.7 39.8 England 34.5 34.2 Estonia 29.2 33.4 Poland 18.0 19.6 Euro average 41.1 40.4</pre><pre>Lung cancer Men Women Switzerland 11.8 12.3 Netherlands 10.5 - Finland 9.1 10.3 France 8.7 13.0 Germany 8.1 10.0 Scotland 6.3 6.4 Denmark 6.2 6.4 Italy 6.0 11.4 England 5.8 5.4 Estonia 5.6 8.2 Poland 5.1 9.7 Spain 5.0 - Euro average 7.0 8.8</pre><pre>Breast cancer Switzerland 75.7 Finland 73.5 France 71.4 Italy 70.8 Netherlands 69.9 Germany 68.4 Denmark 68.1 England 62.5 Spain 62.5 Scotland 61.8 Estonia 58.8 Poland 43.9 Euro average 66.5</pre><pre>Cervical cancer Switzerland 64.5 France 64.0 Italy 64.0 Netherlands 62.9 Finland 62.3 Germany 61.3 Denmark 61.0 Estonia 55.0 England 54.5 Scotland 51.9 Poland 51.2 Spain 40.3 Euro average 57.5 Source: Eurocare study 1995</pre><p>NB. Patients diagnosed 1978-85 and followed up to 1990 Survival figures are corrected for death from other causes</p><p>Funded by the European Community's BIOMED programme, the study was co-ordinated by Dr Franco Berrino, director of the Varese Cancer Registry in Milan, Italy. It covers 27 different cancers in adults (over 15 years old) and eight in children (0-14 years). Data were collected from 30 cancer registries using standard definitions and format.</p><p>No data were collected for bladder cancer, prostate cancer or lymphomas since definitions of the disease were considered too variable between countries, says the report.</p><p>A second study, Eurocare-2, will include data from Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia, as well as additional regions from Italy, Spain and Poland. Results are expected in mid-1997 for the next phase, which will include data for patients who were diagnosed between 1978-90 and followed up to the end of 1995.</p>
