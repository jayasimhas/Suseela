<p>Several groups are investigating the effect of low-dose radiation on restenosis. The most popular delivery methods are radioactive stents and post-procedural introduction of iridium needles. A Venezuelan team has actually tested a protocol in humans and US trials could be under way within the next two years.</p>

<p>Several groups are investigating the effect of low-dose radiation on restenosis. The most popular delivery methods are radioactive stents and post-procedural introduction of iridium needles. A Venezuelan team has actually tested a protocol in humans and US trials could be under way within the next two years.</p><p>Dr Judah Weinberger, head of research at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Centers' catheterisation laboratory, is currently going through the process of getting FDA permission for a multi-centre trial in first-time angioplasty patients. Dr Weinberger told Clinica that a final decision on isotopes had not been made yet. "It depends on discussions with the FDA," he said. Houston, Texas-based NeoCardia will manufacture the sources and afterloading devices. Initial safety studies will be probably be conducted at Columbia, with four or five centres participating in the restenosis trial.</p><p>Presenting the Venezuelan data, Dr Jose Antonio Condado, of the Hospital Miguel Peres Carreno, Caracas, said post PTCA irradiation with an iridium-192 wire was well tolerated in 11 patients, although mild spasm occurred in eight.</p><p>Low-dose radioactive stents do reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointimal hyperplasia in rabbits, according to Dr Christopher Hehrlein and a team from the University of Heidelberg and Nuclear Research Centre at Karlsruhe, Germany. The group used radioactive Palmaz-Schatz stents in rabbit arteries.</p><p>A US team from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington and Vanderbilt University in Nashville obtained similarly-encouraging results using beta-particle-emitting titanium stents in pigs. Although cell proliferation and density were similar in treated and control (non-radioactive stent) animals, the neointimal thickness was less in the radiation-treated pigs, according to Dr John Laird.</p><p>Dr Ron Waksman, of Emory University, Atlanta, said neointima formation in stented-pigs was markedly reduced at 30 days when the intervention site was pre-irradiated with an iridium source. The beneficial effects of low-dose radiation seem to be maintained for at least six months, said Dr Waksman, who also reported follow-up data from a trial in pigs subjected to overstretch balloon injury and 192-Ir irradiation.</p>
