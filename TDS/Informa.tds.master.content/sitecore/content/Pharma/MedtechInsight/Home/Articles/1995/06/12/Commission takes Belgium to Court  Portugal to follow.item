<p>The European Commission has decided to take Belgium to the European Court of Justice for non-communication of the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Belgium is the only country in the EEA that has not transposed the Directive, which first took effect on January 1st, 1993, and became mandatory at the beginning of this year.</p><p>The Commission has yet to notify the Belgian authorities officially. The Court of Justice hearing is expected next spring.</p><p>Portugal</p><p>Portugal, meanwhile, could follow Belgium to the Court for non-conformity with the Directive unless it responds quickly to the Commission's February 16th letter demanding some changes to its AIMD law. Portugal's position is on the agenda at the Commission's late June infringement meeting, which could result in the authorities receiving a detailed opinion from Commissioner Bangemann towards late summer.</p><p>The Commission has also been considering the Spanish approach to registration introduced in the country's AIMD law, which industry has criticised for being too onerous. The issue will be examined more closely later this year.</p><p>Almost all other Member States whose AIMD laws have been examined by the Commission received comments on their regulations from DG III (Industrial Policy) and remedied any deviations. The Commission is now studying the late AIMD transpositions in addition to available national laws implementing the Medical Devices Directive (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain have yet to transpose the MD Directive).</p><p>Greece</p><p>Although Greece published its regulations transposing the AIMD and MD Directives last August, these have only just been notified to the Commission.</p>
