<p>Under the revised 1995 Medicare fee schedule, the US Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has implemented a "significant" cut in the fee schedule payment for colour flow Doppler echocardiography procedures. The 1995 payment has been reduced to $4.15 from $55.30, despite "strong opposition" from the American College of Cardiology.</p>

<p>Under the revised 1995 Medicare fee schedule, the US Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has implemented a "significant" cut in the fee schedule payment for colour flow Doppler echocardiography procedures. The 1995 payment has been reduced to $4.15 from $55.30, despite "strong opposition" from the American College of Cardiology.</p><p>The HCFA defends this cut as the "correction of a mistake" made in 1993 when practice expense payments for equipment costs were shifted from the technical to the professional fee component. It argues that doctors who do not use their own equipment should not receive payment specifically intended to cover equipment costs. Payments in excess of the new $4.15 fee constituted "a significant and unintended windfall for physicians in 1993 and 1994", the HCFA says.</p><p>The ACC also plans to oppose the change in designation of certain pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion procedures from surgical to non-surgical. The HCFA is implementing the change, which the ACC estimates will result in doctors receiving $62 less on average per procedure, on the grounds that more than 50% of these procedures are carried out by non-surgeons.</p>
