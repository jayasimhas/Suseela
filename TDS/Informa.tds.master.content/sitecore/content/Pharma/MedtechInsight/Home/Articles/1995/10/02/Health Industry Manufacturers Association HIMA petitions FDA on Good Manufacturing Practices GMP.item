<p>Although the US FDA has eliminated the Reference List, the agency's new programme linking Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) compliance to device clearance is nearly as bad - and illegal, the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) believes.</p><p>In its petition to the agency, HIMA contends that there is no legal basis for suggesting that Congress intended to make compliance with GMPs relevant to the process of determining substantial equivalence. Furthermore, the GMP link "constitutes a significant new substantive change in the 510(k) notification process that violates the clear language and legislative history of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, and it must be withdrawn".</p><p>The new programme, linking GMP compliance with substantial equivalence, states that if there is a "reasonable relationship" between current GMP violations and the subject of an application for a Class I or II device, the FDA will defer issuing the 510(k) clearance. In addition, the agency will screen new, incoming 510(k) submissions to determine if there are ongoing, serious GMP violations "reasonably related" to the submission.</p><p>HIMA claims that unlike a PMA approval letter, a 510(k) order does not constitute "approval of the device or the facilities or processes used for its manufacture"; 510(k) clearance has been obtained even before establishing where a device will be produced. "In many cases, a device may be cleared by the FDA before a prototype of the device is even completed, and the FDA has granted 510(k)s for some devices that have never been manufactured."</p><p>The 510(k) notification process, HIMA points out, was based on the concept of substantial equivalence to devices marketed before the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 - and no GMPs for devices existed then. Nor did Congress tie GMPs to the process when new amendments were passed in 1990.</p><p>HIMA's new petition notes that the FDA already has "ample legal authority to deal with GMP problems": seizures, injunctions, partial or total suspension of a company's production, bans, civil penalties and criminal prosecutions.</p>
