<p>German Health Minister Horst Seehofer has indicated that he intends to fix health insurance premium levels by law but will give no advance warning as to when this measure is to be implemented. The Kassen will therefore not have the chance to pump up premiums beforehand.</p><p>In an interview with Der Spiegel, Mr Seehofer states that maximum premium levels will be fixed for both employers and employees. Increases will only be permitted in line with general wage rises but two "safety valves" will be built in to the system to ensure the continuing high quality of healthcare. The first is the free health insurance market: from 1997, Germans will be able to choose any insurer and insurers will be free to compete by, for example, offering extra services not included in the official reimbursement catalogue to be paid for by the customers themselves.</p><p>Kassen will also have the freedom to introduce innovative cost- saving measures which have been rejected as illegal in the past; for example, the AOK tried to introduce a GP subscription system whereby patients agreed to renounce the right to visit a specialist in the first instance in return for a reduced premium. Kassen and doctors must be given a level playing field, Mr Seehofer told Der Spiegel, and an arbitration system must be set up to solve potential disputes between different groups within the doctors' associations.</p><p>The second safety valve would be the option to increase premium levels if medical advances offer an important but expensive new treatment (eg a vaccination against HIV). Employees and employers would have to fund such an advance jointly but the self-administration system of doctors and Kassen would first have to vote in favour of utilising the new treatment.</p><p>better self-administration</p><p>German hospitals have been able to get away with minimal reforms in the past, owing to the influence of their powerful political allies, such as the churches, Land governments, unions and, in the past, Mr Seehofer admits, his own ministry. A proper system of collective self-administration must be implemented for all 2,400 hospitals which must ensure continued quality at a much more economical price. The bargaining power of the Kassen vis-a-vis the hospitals must also be strengthened. However, while they may in future be able to refuse contracts with certain particularly uneconomic hospitals, they will not be able to negotiate specific contracts with individual hospitals over reimbursement rates for particular procedures.</p><p>This may come as a disappointment to the national associations representing the statutory Kassen, which have recently published a strategy paper outlining the position they will be taking at this autumn's round of negotiations with hospital representatives. These negotiations, based on the new system of hospital financing under the Bundespflegesatzverordnung, will set the course for future expenditure developments. According to Arzte Zeitung, the Kassen do not believe that keeping premiums in line with basic wage increases is sufficient to contain escalating costs because hospitals have too many escape clauses.</p><p>In negotiations with each Land, the Kassen want to fix the type and number of diagnosis-related groups and special payment procedures to be carried out by individual hospitals for several years in advance. They have already approached the German Hospital Association in this regard but have not yet received a response, Arzte Zeitung reports.</p><p>The Kassen also want to negotiate with each individual hospital the scope of necessary in-patient procedures and to separate out nursing care cases (to be financed under the nursing care insurance law), short-stay patients and outpatient operations.</p>
