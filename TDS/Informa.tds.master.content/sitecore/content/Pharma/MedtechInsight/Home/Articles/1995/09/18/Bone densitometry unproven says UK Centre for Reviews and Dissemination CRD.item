<p>The case for bone densitometry in clinical practice is not yet proven, says Trevor Sheldon, Director of the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Writing in response to a review published in the BMJ in June, he says the authors provide no evidence to show that clinical decision-making in high-risk cases is influenced by the technique. The presence of multiple risk factors is more important in predicting hip fractures in older white women, he writes in a letter to the BMJ (September 9th).</p>

<p>The case for bone densitometry in clinical practice is not yet proven, says Trevor Sheldon, Director of the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Writing in response to a review published in the BMJ in June, he says the authors provide no evidence to show that clinical decision-making in high-risk cases is influenced by the technique. The presence of multiple risk factors is more important in predicting hip fractures in older white women, he writes in a letter to the BMJ (September 9th).</p><p>Dr Sheldon also refutes the authors' claim that the UK has too few dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry machines. There are 1.6 per million people compared with 2.9 in the US and 13.5 in Greece. However, Dr Sheldon says the UK only needs 0.7 machines per million people - if they are used to full capacity. The difference in availability is a reflection of better control of technology acquisition rather than of under-availability, he argues.</p><p>Drs Juliet Compstone, C Cooper and JA Kanis had said bone densitometry is important in the diagnosis of osteoporosis in high-risk groups. However, they did not claim it is justified for population screening. Osteoporosis is responsible for 150,000 fractures a year in the UK, at a cost of &pound;742 million ($1,113 million). This includes 60,000 hip fractures, 50,000 fractures of the radius and 40,000 vertebral fractures. However, as many as two-thirds of vertebral fractures probably go unrecorded. X-ray bone densitometry costs &pound;48 per scan.</p><p>Americans await outcomes data</p><p>The US Office of Technology Assessment says that the cost- effectiveness of bone density screening and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for osteoporosis rests on the unknown impact of oestrogen and progestin on heart disease. If hormone therapy has no heart disease benefits, impacts on quality of life could be pivotal in evaluating both screening and therapy - which can cause breast cancer and gallbladder disease. The results of randomised studies of HRT and heart disease are not expected for some time. The OTA report, which was published at the end of August was requested by the Senate Special Committee on Ageing (see this issue, p 8).</p>
