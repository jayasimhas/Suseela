<p>January 1st, 1995 was the deadline for the Medical Devices Directive to take effect in each of EEA countries (most of which are now EU Member States). No country had met the July 1st, 1994, target date for transposing the Directive and less than half the total number of states had introduced the complete package of regulations needed for their rules to take effect by January 1st. (The Directive, and the national regulations that implement it, do not become mandatory until June 14th, 1998.)</p>

<p>January 1st, 1995 was the deadline for the Medical Devices Directive to take effect in each of EEA countries (most of which are now EU Member States). No country had met the July 1st, 1994, target date for transposing the Directive and less than half the total number of states had introduced the complete package of regulations needed for their rules to take effect by January 1st. (The Directive, and the national regulations that implement it, do not become mandatory until June 14th, 1998.)</p><p>Denmark, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden and the UK had their regulations ready by January 1st. Greece had published its regulations in September, but as of late December had not notified the Commission. Finland, Norway and the Netherlands expected their laws early in the New Year, while France and Germany had framework laws, but were awaiting ordinances to implement the further requirements. The UK regulations will have taken effect on the 1st, but not without some suspense at the Medical Devices Agency when the opposition "prayed" to the Parliament to have the regulations annulled at the eleventh hour. Meanwhile, in Spain, there could be a six-month delay, the Italian regulations have become caught up in the political chaos there and it seems questionable whether the Belgian regulations will even be ready in 1995.</p><p>There will initially be 23 Notified Bodies in the EEA for medical devices, as long as the Dutch appointments of KEMA and TNO went ahead in late December as planned. Ten of the organisations are based in Germany, six in the UK, two in Sweden, and one each in France, Ireland and Spain. A further dozen or so appointments can be expected during 1995.</p><p>Switzerland (not a member of the EEA) looks likely to have its regulations in place ahead of Belgium. The medical devices unit at the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health anticipates that its ordinance transposing the two (AIMD and MD) directives will be published by October. Several organisations with expertise in testing medical devices are based in Switzerland and are interested in Notified Body status. Liechtenstein is due to apply the new Swiss medical devices regulations as part of their customs union agreement as soon as they take effect in Switzerland.</p><p>The single European market applies to all CE-marked medical devices, even in countries where the Directive has not been implemented in national law.</p><pre>Readiness of Appointment of Country MD regulations Notified Bodies EU Belgium The draft is Laboratoires Simon, still at the part of SGS-Group, working document and CEBEC both intend stage.
