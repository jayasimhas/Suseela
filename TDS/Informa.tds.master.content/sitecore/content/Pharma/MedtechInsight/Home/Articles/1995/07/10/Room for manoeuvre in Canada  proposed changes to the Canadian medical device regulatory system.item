<p>The proposed changes to the Canadian medical device regulatory system "are not carved in stone", Dr Richard Tobin, director of the Canadian Medical Devices Bureau, told delegates at the Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver on June 26th. He indicated that there is opportunity to modify the package of 16 proposals circulated for comment earlier this year (see Clinica No 644, p 10).</p><p>The proposed risk-based classification system for medical devices relies heavily on the European system, while "the safety and effectiveness considerations require a balance of premarket, postmarket and quality systems requirements," according to Dr Tobin. Much greater emphasis will be placed on ISO 9000 quality standards as a premarket requirement - bringing Canada in closer harmony with other countries' regulatory agencies. Interestingly, the Canadian proposals are being put out for international comment, indicative of the Medical Devices Bureau's aim to achieve global harmonisation.</p><p>Classification is only a means to directing the conformity assessment process, noted Dr Tobin. For Class I devices, manufacturers are responsible for technical documentation and the system is based on self-declaration of compliance with ISO 9002. A complete design examination will be required by the agency for Class IV (highest risk) devices.</p><p>Third party review is planned for all quality systems components, explained Dr Tobin, and is also an option under consideration for evaluation of data. Third party audit of ISO 9001 standards could be acceptable for Class IV devices.</p><p>A proposal to require bar code identification may be premature for devices, conceded Dr Tobin, suggesting that there may be further discussion on this particular proposal. This requirement would be unique to Canada, pointed out Henri Vienneau, president and general manager of Mallinckrodt Medical (Canada). Since some 70% of devices are imported, this could pose trade problems.</p><p>More workshops on the regulatory package are planned for the autumn with a view to publishing the proposal for comment in Part I of the Canada Gazette in January next year. Guidelines will be developed by March 1996 with publication of the final regulations planned for January 1997.</p><p>industry viewpoint</p><p>Mr Vienneau cast doubt on whether the Canadian proposals are in harmony with other regulations. Among features of the proposals, he noted that there is little support from industry for cost recovery by the Bureau for device evaluation activities. Fees are being phased in with a view to achieving Can$6.5 million in 1997/8. Industry contends that implants will bear the cost of fees: although accounting for just 10% of the Can$2,500 million market, they will fund 60% of cost recovery.</p><p>Industry association MEDEC's survey suggests that costs will exceed the revenues from device fees, according to Mr Vienneau. This will lead to fewer products and a subsequent shortage of funds to operate the system. MEDEC recommends that the cost recovery programme, due to begin in September, be delayed until an acceptable regulatory framework is in place and the industry will continue to work with the regulatory agency to achieve this. The total compliance cost needs to be identified and a fair solution arrived at, said Mr Vienneau.</p><p>The Canadian industry's profitability is under pressure from both pricing constraints and the weak Canadian dollar. Some 80% of sales are to hospitals which are operating on global budgets - a form of capitation. Healthcare reform has seen a shift toward regionalisation and the introduction of healthcare maintenance organisations. Each Province has 6-10 regions where the focus is on administration and central purchasing.</p><p>Of the 800 manufacturers and distributors operating in the Canadian device market, 75-100 account for the bulk of sales. Just 1.4% of sales is spent on R&D and Mr Vienneau underlined the importance of developing a regulatory system which fosters the domestic industry and supports innovation.</p>
