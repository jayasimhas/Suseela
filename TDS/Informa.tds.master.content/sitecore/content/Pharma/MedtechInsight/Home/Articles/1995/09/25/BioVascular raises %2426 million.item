<p>Bio-Vascular, a US surgery and imaging software company based in Minnesota, has raised around $26 million net in a share offer last week. The size of the offer was increased to 1.8 million from 1.5 million shares and the price achieved was some 10% above the assumed price in the prospectus. The shares were sold for $15.75. Bio-Vascular now intends to transfer its shares from the Nasdaq smallcap market to the Nasdaq proper.</p><p>Bio-Vascular has enjoyed a 73% growth in revenues in the nine months to July due to higher sales of the Peri-Strips staple line reinforcement used mainly in lung reduction operations. Peri-Strips account for 43% of the company's sales. Biograft, the preserved umbilical cord vein graft, on the other hand, fell 20% compared with last year, continuing the past two years' downward spiral. Bio-Vascular believes the sales decline is due to a trend towards non-surgical intervention for peripheral vascular obstruction and the higher price of Biograft compared with synthetic grafts.</p><p>The company is also active in medical imaging software developing products for interactive visualisation and analysis of 3-D image data. Its VoxelView high-speed imaging software has been licensed to 70 medical and research institutions as a research tool.</p><pre>Bio-Vascular's nine-month results ($ thousands) 1995 1994 Peri-Strips 3,533 249 Tissue-Guard products 1,193 664 Biograft 943 1,171 Surgical Productivity tools 1,371 1,276 Medical imaging software 1,085 1,301 Total revenue 8,131 4,702 Net income (loss) 597 (1,374) (ended July 31st)</pre>
