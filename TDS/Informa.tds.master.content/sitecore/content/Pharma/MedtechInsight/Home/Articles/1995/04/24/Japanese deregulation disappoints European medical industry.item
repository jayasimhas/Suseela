<p>Japanese deregulation plans for the medical device industry are unsatisfactory while the programme for in vitro diagnostics is only partially acceptable, according to the European Commission. The proposals - part of a wider, five-year, deregulation programme - do not meet EC requests for an opening up of the Japanese market to foreign goods.</p><p>mutual GMP recognition</p><p>The EC had asked medical device manufacturers with Good Manufacturing Practice approval in the European Union be exempted from the requirement to receive GMP approval in Japan. Such an exemption is already granted to companies with US GMP approval.</p><p>Although Japan has agreed to implement mutual GMP recognition with the EU, it continues to insist on visual inspections based on Japanese requirements. Moreover, consultations will precede any definite moves, so implementation could take up to five years. The EC rejects this proposal, saying it "falls short of an overall acceptance of the exemption as was granted to the US". Discussions on the subject are to continue.</p><p>IVDs not medical devices</p><p>Little more progress was made in the area of in vitro diagnostics. The EC wanted Japan to simplify its approval procedure for IVDs by reclassifying them as medical devices (they are currently classed as drugs) or as a separate category. Japan declined to do this, but the EC says "progress was made in a number of secondary requests".</p><p>EU in the slow lane</p><p>The opening up of the Japanese market is becoming a matter of increasing concern to EU manufacturers, which see the US making faster progress in reaping the benefits. It was the US/Japan framework agreement which initially forced Japan to move towards deregulation and US companies will gain the majority of public hospital orders for foreign medical equipment this year.</p><p>Although the US/Japan agreement treats all countries equally, in practice bureaucracy could be hindering the EU. According to Paul Brankin of the UK Department of Trade and Industry, both the European Business Centre and the US Chamber of Commerce hold separate talks with Japanese officials in Tokyo every three months. Information from these discussions is rapidly disseminated to US companies, but a lack of resources and disagreement between member countries means EU representatives are far slower to pass the results to European manufacturers.</p>
