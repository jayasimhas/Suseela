<p>The new London Stock Exchange listing rules, which came into force on January 4th, do not appear to be as threatening to start-up companies as the diagnostics industry had feared. The amendment requiring companies (in any sector) with no trading history to have at least &pound;20 million ($31.2 million) worth of R&D investment over the three years before they are floated is just one of the milestones that companies may choose to meet. There are other options and the system is "reasonably flexible", Dr Brian Richards, executive chairman of Peptide Therapeutics, told Clinica. Diagnostic companies with "revolutionary technology" in field trials under regulatory scrutiny should have no problem in obtaining listing, he said.</p>

<p>The new London Stock Exchange listing rules, which came into force on January 4th, do not appear to be as threatening to start-up companies as the diagnostics industry had feared. The amendment requiring companies (in any sector) with no trading history to have at least &pound;20 million ($31.2 million) worth of R&D investment over the three years before they are floated is just one of the milestones that companies may choose to meet. There are other options and the system is "reasonably flexible", Dr Brian Richards, executive chairman of Peptide Therapeutics, told Clinica. Diagnostic companies with "revolutionary technology" in field trials under regulatory scrutiny should have no problem in obtaining listing, he said.</p><p>Appropriate trials are still required to have been performed under the scrutiny of an internationally-recognised regulatory authority. This was considered appropriate given that EU legislation is forthcoming in the IVD area. However, there is an opportunity for negotiation with the Exchange in this area, and it is unlikely that a company will be refused listing, Mr Richards said, unless a product "manifestly goes against this requirement".</p><p>Regulatory scrutiny has not been required in the past and some companies and investors still consider the requirements to be too onerous. In Dr Richards' view they are "important criteria to attract investors".</p>
