<p>UK medical device manufacturer Smith & Nephew returned to profitability in the first half of the year. It reported a &pound;42 million ($66 million) net profit compared with last year's &pound;93 million loss resulting from a &pound;148 million one-off charge on the disposal of the Ioptex eyecare business. A rationalisation programme is under way at S&N and the first benefits are expected to be seen in the latter part of 1996.</p>

<p>UK medical device manufacturer Smith & Nephew returned to profitability in the first half of the year. It reported a &pound;42 million ($66 million) net profit compared with last year's &pound;93 million loss resulting from a &pound;148 million one-off charge on the disposal of the Ioptex eyecare business. A rationalisation programme is under way at S&N and the first benefits are expected to be seen in the latter part of 1996.</p><p>To dispel rumours about an impending takeover bid, CEO John Robinson says S&N has not received any approaches from any company. His comments at the results presentation were brought on by a new wave of speculation that a bid from US healthcare company Johnson & Johnson was imminent.</p><p>S&N would be an attractive target. In the first half the company continued its steady sales growth. Corrected for exchange rate moves, turnover rose 8% to &pound;488.7 million, growing faster than the markets in which it operates.</p><p>The UK outperformed all other markets, with underlying growth of 13% in the first half rising to &pound;91 million. S&N says it is reaping the benefits of the "One Company" selling approach which it introduced last year to address changes in the health service.</p><p>Similar changes in the German and French healthcare systems have prompted S&N to switch to the "One Company" approach there too, although it has so far been successful only in Germany. This market was largely responsible for the underlying sales increase of 13% in continental Europe. Spain and France have proven disappointingly flat in the first half. In Spain, a depressed economy and a doctors' strike are blamed; in France S&N's products suffered from government-imposed price cuts.</p><p>Sales in Africa, Asia & Australasia rose just 7% in underlying terms. This was mainly due to a slowdown in the South African market, which enjoyed a huge boom a year ago. Mr Robinson stressed the importance of the 25% growth rate seen in Japan and Asia pushing Japan to &pound;30 million and Asia to &pound;20 million. He expects this growth rate to continue.</p><p>Wound management showed the strongest growth of all business sectors - up an underlying 12%. Around half of wound management sales now stem from chronic wound products which are dominated by newly-developed products such as Allevyn and Allevyn Adhesive, Mr Robinson says. Trauma product sales have been held back by the decline of the &pound;20 million-a-year spine business. The US FDA's warning on the unapproved use of pedicle screws hurt sales significantly. Even after a recent partial approval (see Clinica No 663, p 19), Mr Robinson does not expect sales to recover to previous levels.</p><p>S&N's largest acquisition this year, Acufex for &pound;90 million, was completed on July 6th and does not feature in the first-half figures. S&N says integration is virtually complete and it will take an &pound;8 million integration cost charge in the second half of the year.</p><pre>Smith & Nephew's first-half results (&pound; millions) 1995 1994 % change % change * Casting & Support 92.0 79.9 15% 8% Wound Management 86.1 74.9 15% 12% Endoscopy 53.8 52.7 2% 7% Trauma 53.0 52.3 1% 5% Orthopaedic Implants 65.4 63.8 3% 5% Other medical 55.2 55.6 -1% 5% Total healthcare 405.5 379.2 7% 8% Consumer 83.2 78.2 6% 8% Total continued sales 488.7 457.4 7% 8% Discontinued operations 14.3 28.4 Total revenues 503.0 485.8 After-tax profit (loss) 42.0 (93.3) (ended July 1st) * corrected for exchange rate effects</pre>
