<p>UK women are to receive two mammograms of each breast instead of one under the national breast screening programme. The move comes shortly before the publication of a study which shows that several women screened for the second time had signs of cancer which were missed at the first examination. The study, details of which have not been released, suggests that this was partly due to the fact that only one mammogram was performed on each breast at the initial screening.</p>

<p>UK women are to receive two mammograms of each breast instead of one under the national breast screening programme. The move comes shortly before the publication of a study which shows that several women screened for the second time had signs of cancer which were missed at the first examination. The study, details of which have not been released, suggests that this was partly due to the fact that only one mammogram was performed on each breast at the initial screening.</p><p>In future, all women in the programme will have both lateral and vertical mammograms of each breast at the initial screening. This will make comparisons at subsequent examinations easier. According to Julietta Patnick, national co-ordinator of the NHS Breast Screening Programme: "We are confident that with the move to two-view screening ... we will start to see a decrease in the number of interval cancers."</p><p>Some 100,000 women have been examined under the Breast Screening Programme since it was started in 1988, with screening every three years. Breast cancer affects one in 12 women in the UK and kills some 16,000 women each year.</p>
