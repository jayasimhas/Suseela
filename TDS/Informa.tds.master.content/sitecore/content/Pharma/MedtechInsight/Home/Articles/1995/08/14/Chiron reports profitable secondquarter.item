<p>Chiron has returned to profitability in the second quarter, but the $349 million write-off taken in the first quarter pulls down results for the first half of the year. A $385 million loss was recorded for the six months ended June.</p><p>Chiron Vision saw sales jump 64% in the first half with the inclusion of the Iolab and Domilens acquisitions. During the second quarter, Chiron increased its equity stake in Technolas to 75% from 50%. Germany-based Technolas supplies excimer lasers to Chiron Vision. Chiron recorded a $1.8 million write-off for the acquisition of in-process technologies from this purchase.</p><p>Chiron's bDNA probe test sales rose due to higher shipments of Quantiplex HCV tests to its Japanese partner, Daiichi Pure Chemicals.</p><p>Ciba Corning's revenues, which had not been included in last year's results, rose 21% compared with the first half of 1994. Both major product lines - critical blood analyte systems and immunodiagnostics -reported increased sales and favourable currency rates accounted for 7% of the first-half rise.</p><pre>Chiron's second-quarter and first-half results ($ millions) 2nd quarter 1st half 1995 1994 1995 1994 Chiron Vision 53.4 24.8 76.8 46.7 bDNA probe tests 4.0 2.4 8.0 3.7 Ciba Corning 129.9 - 249.3 - Betaseron 22.4 17.5 24.2 28.2 Oncology products 15.2 11.4 27.9 19.5 Biocine 19.6 - 35.4 - Total product sales 248.33 60.33 432.24 105.82 50% share of pre-tax profit from j-v with Ortho Diagnostic Systems 21.4 15.6 39.5 31.1 Total revenues 281.75 100.11 500.0 191.49 Net income (loss) 0.8 5.1 (385.0) 9.9 (ended June 30th)</pre>
