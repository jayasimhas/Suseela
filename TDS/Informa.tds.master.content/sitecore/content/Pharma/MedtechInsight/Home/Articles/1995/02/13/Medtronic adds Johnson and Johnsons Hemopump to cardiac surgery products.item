<p><strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> has acquired the Hemopump Cardiac Assist System from Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems (part of Ethicon). Terms have not been disclosed. A catheter-mounted, left ventricular assist system designed to augment cardiac output, the Hemopump also has potential applications for use during minimally invasive coronary bypass surgery and other procedures. During surgery, blood does not leave the patient's body, unlike conventional heart-lung machines. Certain surgical procedures can be performed without stopping the heart completely.</p>

<p><strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> has acquired the Hemopump Cardiac Assist System from Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems (part of Ethicon). Terms have not been disclosed. A catheter-mounted, left ventricular assist system designed to augment cardiac output, the Hemopump also has potential applications for use during minimally invasive coronary bypass surgery and other procedures. During surgery, blood does not leave the patient's body, unlike conventional heart-lung machines. Certain surgical procedures can be performed without stopping the heart completely.</p><p>The Hemopump, which has completed Phase I clinical evaluation, is commercially available on a limited basis in Europe, including Germany and France. A pilot clinical evaluation in a small number of patients is under way in the US and Medtronic told Clinica that it will be concentrating on gaining US clearance for the system.</p><p>A smaller (14 F) percutaneous version of the Hemopump is being evaluated in Europe for use during high-risk coronary angioplasty procedures and in treatment of patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock. Medtronic intends to devote considerable effort to developing this version, initially in Europe.</p>
