<p>Revised medical device regulations designed to speed up the review process come into effect in Japan this week. Once approved, however, devices face the additional hurdle of gaining reimbursement - a lengthy and costly process, as delegates at the Fifth Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver, Canada, heard on June 26th-27th.</p><p>class system</p><p>Details of the new regulations were presented by Yukio Matsutani, director of the Medical Devices Division at the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. Under the new system, which came into effect on July 1st, 1995, devices are classed according to risk (see Clinica No 649, p 9). Manufacturing and import approval are not required for low risk (Class I) devices such as X-ray films, surgical microscopes and automatic analysers for clinical chemistry. Some 25% of medical devices fall into this category, according to Dr Matsutani.</p><p>The majority of products come into Class II (those which present a significant risk to the patient), for which Ministry approval is required. Fibrescopes, dialysers and CT scanners are included in this category. Third-party review of Class II device applications will be undertaken by the Japan Association for the Advancement of Medical Equipment to evaluate substantial equivalence to devices already on the market.</p><p>Class III devices (life-sustaining implantables) must have a tracking system in place, in addition to obtaining approval. Pacemakers, defibrillators and their leads; artificial heart valves and rings; and vascular prostheses (for coronary arteries, thoracic and abdominal aorta only) are included in Class III. Details of the device, its use and the medical facility where it was implanted must be recorded and maintained by the manufacturer or distributor.</p><p>second look</p><p>New medical devices will be re-examined on the basis of data derived from their use during their first four years on the market. Devices already approved will be re-evaluated in the light of advances in science and technology.</p><p>Manufacturers must comply with GMP and the licensing procedure for contract manufacture has been simplified, according to Dr Matsutani. For high-tech products, maintenance and inspection details are to be submitted with the application.</p><p>Further changes to Japanese device regulations are under consideration, noted Dr Matsutani. As part of the move towards deregulation, it is envisaged that licensing authority will devolve from the central government to prefectural governors in 1997. Computerisation of the application and review process is also on the agenda, as is a re-evaluation of standards.</p><p>reimbursement</p><p>While news of deregulation of the review process is welcomed by industry, the frustrations of the reimbursement system were highlighted by Ken Charhut, general manager of Baxter's Cardiovascular Group and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan.</p><p>Reimbursement decisions are made by the Ministry's Health Insurance Bureau once marketing approval has been granted. If reimbursement is denied, manufacturers can opt to proceed with marketing - although this is rarely the case - or apply for high technology to be included in the HAMTS (Highly Advanced Medical Technology System). Under this system, hospitals are reimbursed for related procedure costs, not for the products per se. Little financial reward is accorded to the manufacturer which does not get involved in the HAMTS process itself.</p><p>If a favourable reimbursement decision is made, the device may be included in Category A, whereby hospitals receive payment per procedure (excluding physician costs). Such indirect reimbursement has been approved for laparoscopy. For Category B devices, the Ministry sets an official price, which - with the exception of pacemakers - is done generically. For devices not covered by categories A or B, a new category has to be created by the Insurance Bureau. Since price controls were introduced for devices in June last year, only one or two new categories have appeared, noted Mr Charhut.</p><p>slow progress</p><p><strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong>'s implantable cardioverter defibrillator was used to illustrate the time taken to gain reimbursement in Japan. Reimbursed in Europe since 1988 and in the US since 1991, the ICD was approved for import in July 1994, some four and a half years after clinical trials began in Japan. Reimbursement was sought in August 1994 but was rejected early this year. The company now hopes for a favourable decision in April next year, by which time it will be over six years since the clinical approval process began.</p><p>Even when reimbursement is achieved, the benefits to manufacturers can be small. Mr Charhut cited laparoscopy as a technology which has received category A approval for eight surgical procedures yet is used in just 10-15% of all operations in Japan. Since the approval level is only 50% of the cost of the actual procedure, hospitals are losing money when laparoscopy is used. In this environment, new technology will not be rapidly taken up, according to Mr Charhut. He advised manufacturers to focus on products which reduce the cost of existing technology and on new technology which reduces post-operative costs. "Avoid products that emphasise technological innovation and efficiency in the overall costs," he concluded.</p>
