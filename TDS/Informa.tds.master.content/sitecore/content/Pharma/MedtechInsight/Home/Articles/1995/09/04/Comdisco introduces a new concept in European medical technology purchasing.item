<p>Are European purchasers ready for reconditioned and leased medical equipment in hospitals? David James believes they are. As divisional manager for Comdisco's Medical Equipment Group he has a mission to persuade decision-makers that the savings which can be made with reconditioned equipment make this an attractive alternative to purchasing new, expensive high tech systems.</p><p>Mr James aims to introduce a concept which has become established in the US to the European market and believes that healthcare reforms driven by cost-containment bodes well for Comdisco. Changes taking place in the US healthcare market have seen a surge in demand for reconditioned diagnostic imaging equipment as hospitals seek cost savings on capital equipment (see Clinica No 632, p 8). Comdisco's medical business has grown 25% per annum over the last five years; last year revenues increased 35% to over $100 million, contributing $6.4 million in pretax profit.</p><p>The UK is Mr James' first target market in Europe. From the Comdisco offices in Slough, he plans to work towards direct distributorship of medical equipment in Europe. Stressing that Comdisco is not a service company, he has sought the support of the major manufacturers - GE Medical, Siemens, Philips, et al - to establish co-operative arrangements. Mr James has seen life from the other side, having been Acuson's UK managing director, and recognises the advantages of working with the main players. It is in both Comdisco's and GE Medical's interests, for example, if a reconditioned GE MRI scanner is serviced by the manufacturer which can provide the components.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest hurdles to overcome are the buying habits of purchasers. The concept of leasing and purchasing reconditioned equipment challenges established principles: managers have been used to acquiring new systems with as many features as possible to satisfy clinicians' demands for a number of years. However, hospital managers are now faced with strict annual budgets. Initial reactions to Comdisco from NHS trust managers in the UK have been encouraging, says Mr James. Two seminars are planned in November - in London and Manchester - to provide an insight for trust decision-makers into the services provided by the company.</p><p>Some $400 million of medical equipment - MRI systems, CT scanners, radiation therapy devices, ultrasound, among others - is included in Comdisco's portfolio. The equipment is reconditioned at the company's US medical exchange facility near Chicago which received ISO 9002 certification last year. Each system is preserved as a single unit during the reconditioning process - spare parts from one system are not used to refurbish another. Product enhancements can be included during the reconditioning.</p><p>The aim is to provide another 10 years of life to reconditioned equipment, explains Mr James. Depending on the age of the system, savings of 35-75% of the purchase price can be achieved. Comdisco's target market is the &pound;50,000+ ($80,000+) equipment sector. On the question of tendering, Mr James says Comdisco will bid for relevant supply contracts but will also approach managers directly since reconditioning is not required to be put out to tender.</p><p>Comdisco also provides advice on financing capital equipment purchases or leasing. Mr James explains that the US company monitors equipment, markets for availability, pricing and technical advancements, and advises customers accordingly. Advice is available on what equipment will cost and on private financing solutions. As part of its asset management service, Comdisco can help hospitals develop a technology strategy through analysing current assets and needs, and reviewing options for upgrades and acquisitions. In addition to replacing old equipment, Comdisco provides temporary services and mobile units during the transition phase of installing new systems.</p><p>Mr James is confident that Comdisco will break new ground in Europe and expects to obtain the first contract by the end of this year. Equipment will initially be sourced from the US facility but eventually the aim is to set up a reconditioning plant in Europe. If reconditioned equipment gains preference over new systems, will Comdisco's source of supplies diminish? Mr James does not believe this will happen - there will always be a demand for new technology and manufacturers will continue to develop improved and more cost-effective systems.</p><p>Comdisco Medical Equipment Group's US parent, Comdisco Inc, reported net earnings of $44 million on revenues of $2,089 million in fiscal 1994 (ended September 30th). Based in Rosemont, Illinois, Comdisco has offices in over 100 countries. Outside North America, the medical business has distributors in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and is represented in Asia. The Medical Equipment Group plans to establish direct offices in Western Europe.</p>
