<p>Advanced Bionics' (US) <strong>[C#199901879:Clarion]</strong> Multi-Strategy Cochlear implant received a unanimous recommendation for marketing approval on July 21st. The FDA's Ear, Nose and Throat Devices Advisory Panel also recommended that the company follow the 144 US patients included in the PMA for five years to ensure long-term safety and efficacy. The device will be marketed for use in patients 18 and under with profound bilateral postlingual sensorineural deafness who are unable to benefit from a hearing aid.</p><p>The PMA contained data on 68 patients followed post-operatively for six months and another 14 patients followed for three months. Patients were used as their own controls; however, only 42 patients followed six months or more had both pre-operative and post-operative scores for detecting warning sounds. The trial showed that patients' hearing improved based on multiple tests. The product costs about $15,000 and total costs including surgery amount to $30,000, says Advanced Bionics.</p><p>Panel members expressed concern that the device may cause some vestibular damage. They concurred with the FDA stipulation that new cochlear implants be followed for at least five years to check for long-term health problems. Members agreed that the implants provide significant improvement in hearing. They recommended that surgeons and audiologists be required to take company-sponsored training programmes before purchasing the product.</p>
