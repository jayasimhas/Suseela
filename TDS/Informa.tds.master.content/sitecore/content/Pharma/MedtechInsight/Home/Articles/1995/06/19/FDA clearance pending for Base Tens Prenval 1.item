<p>Base Ten Systems (US) says it has been informally advised that the FDA will clear its Prenval 1 foetal abnormality software program as a Class 1 Tier 3 medical device under the 510(k) process. The Trenton (NJ)-based company expects to meet FDA officials by mid-July to complete the labelling details prior to formal clearance, allowing it to introduce the program by mid-September. The software was considered by the FDA's advisory panel earlier this year (see Clinica No 649, p 7).</p>

<p>Base Ten Systems (US) says it has been informally advised that the FDA will clear its Prenval 1 foetal abnormality software program as a Class 1 Tier 3 medical device under the 510(k) process. The Trenton (NJ)-based company expects to meet FDA officials by mid-July to complete the labelling details prior to formal clearance, allowing it to introduce the program by mid-September. The software was considered by the FDA's advisory panel earlier this year (see Clinica No 649, p 7).</p><p>Prenval 1 was the first free-standing software to be submitted for approval under the PMA process, says Base Ten. The company claims to have a strong balance sheet with no debts and approximately $9 million in cash available to capitalise on its "leading position" in this market. Class 1 Tier 3 is the classification used for low-to-moderate risk devices requiring rigorous review by the Office of Device Evaluation.</p>
