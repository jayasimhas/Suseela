<p>Orthopaedics offers no cause for excitement - only marginal growth is expected and no stunning technological breakthroughs are on the horizon, writes Clinica's companies editor, Brigitte Ascher. The industry is already highly consolidated and will become more so as the largest companies will use acquisitions to complete their product portfolios.</p><p>The market research departments of many of the large companies broadly agree in their cheerless assessment of growth over the next years. The US and Europe, the two main markets, are expected to show stagnation in value as a result of a small growth in units sold and pressure on prices.</p><p>Price rather than doctors' preference is becoming ever more important in an industry which used to compete on product features and design, innovation and service. In the US, this trend is exacerbated by the expansion of managed care and the advent of hospital buying groups. The pressure on prices could at worst lead to slight declines in value in the US. Because it lags behind US developments, Europe is seen marginally more optimistically but the trend goes in the same direction.</p><p>Asia is the only bright spot. Orthopaedics sales in this region are expected to continue to grow well in the foreseeable future, with growth estimates rates ranging from 10 to 20%.</p><p>Low market growth and little room for technologically-led improvements to profitability set the scene for continued consolidation. In the past two years, the relatively small industry has seen a significant number of acquisitions.</p><p>So far this year, Stryker bought Osteo and <strong>[C#198600199:Pfizer]</strong> bought Leibinger. In 1995, B Braun took full control of Aesculap, Smith & Nephew acquired Acufex and Orthofix bought American Medical Electronic. In 1994, <strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> purchased Kirschner and Wright bought Orthomet. Only the latest acquisition, Osteo, is still listed in the league table.</p><p>The orthopaedics industry is highly consolidated and likely to become more so. The top 10 companies in the table hold 80% of the market worth about $7,000 million. The top 20 hold 95% of the market.</p><p>As in the past two years, deals are likely to take the shape of one of the top 10 companies buying smaller fry. The rationale for purchases is the effort of global companies to complete their product portfolios, as they seem to agree that the secret to success is as wide a portfolio as possible.</p><p>An example of attempts to enter new markets are the Swiss osteosynthesis companies Stratec and Mathys. They are branching into new sectors as competitors encroach on their core area.</p><p>Another aim of acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations is for the large players to get their hands on the best in orthopaedics innovation. This is mainly found in the biomaterials sector, which is still very small because few products have been launched. Nevertheless, biomaterials are generally seen as most promising for future growth.</p><pre>DePuy's estimates of the orthopaedics market (as disclosed in its preliminary prospectus filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission) World US Hips 1,600 670 Knees 1,400 822 Extremities 80 54 Reconstructive implants 3,080 1,546 Spinal 400 200 Trauma 980 430 Sports medicine 790 590 Operating room products 600 401 Soft goods & casting 870 518 Bone cement 120 50 Bone growth stimulators 200 200 Total orthopaedics market 7,040 3,935</pre><pre>Orthopaedics League Table for Fiscal 1995 Rank Company Orthopaedics Orthopaedics sales Revenues in proportion ($ millions) to total medtech revenues 1995 1994 1995 1 Bristol Myers Squibb 1,142 1,000* 60% 2 Smith & Nephew 877 751 44% 3 Pfizer (Howmedica) 732 685 55% 4 Corange (DePuy) 656 578 23% 5 Stryker 609 503 70% 6 Sulzer 477 418 54% 7 Biomet 452 373 100% 8 Synthes USA (Synthes brand) 210* 190* 100% 9 Mathys (Synthes brand) 196 180* 100% 10 Beiersdorf 195 168 39% 11 Sofamor Danek 189 162 100% 12 Stratec (Synthes brand) 156 137 100% 13 Johnson & Johnson 150* 130* 2% 14 Wright Medical 123 96 100% 15 B Braun (Aesculap) 114 97 7% 16 Landanger Camus 85 58 100% 17 AcroMed 75* 70* 100% 18 Merck KGaA 71 61 27% 19 3M 70* 65* 4% 20 Orthofix 52 40 100% 21 Osteotech 28 25 100% 22 Osteo 24 23* 100% 23 Interpore 17 19 100% 24 Corin Medical 16 14 100% 25 Orthologic 15 5 100% 26 Danninger Medical 13 10 100% 27 Creative BioMolecules 13 6 100% 28 Exactech 9 5 100% 29 Spine Tech 8 4 100% 30 Genzyme Tissue Repair 5 0 100% 31 Exogen 2 0 100% 6,781 5,873 *) Clinica estimates are marked with asterisks.
