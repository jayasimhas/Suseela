<p>Medical equipment and services contributed 45% or $343 million of Elbit's $758.5 million turnover in 1994. The Israeli company's Elscint medical imaging subsidiary experienced "a reduction in profit" during the year, although EMS, which provides medical services and trades in equipment, enjoyed sales growth, Elbit says.</p><p>The integration of Diasonics, the US ultrasound manufacturer acquired by Elbit last October (see Clinica No 612, p 14), "is expected to result in additional expenses which may impact the near-term profitability of the company", according to president and CEO Emmanuel Gill. Elbit's net income fell 26.5% to $30 million during the year, reflecting expenses relating to acquisitions and changes of holdings in subsidiaries - mainly Elscint.</p><p>Elscint has reorganised its marketing and sales structure into two separate business units - nuclear medicine (NM) and CT/MRI. John Ariatti, formerly of <strong>[C#198700860:Otsuka]</strong> Electronics (purchased by Elscint in January - see Clinica No 639, p 17), has been appointed business unit director for CT/MRI. Donald Southard, Elscint's vice-president of sales and marketing, is temporarily acting as business unit director for NM.</p>
