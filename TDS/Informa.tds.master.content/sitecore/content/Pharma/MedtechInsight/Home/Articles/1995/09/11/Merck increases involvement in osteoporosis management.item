<p>Merck & Co (US) is to obtain worldwide exclusive rights to CompuMed's bone density test, OsteoGram, which uses computer image analysis of hand X-rays to assess osteoporosis risk. CompuMed will receive a licensing fee and royalties on sales of the test over five years. Specific financial terms have not been disclosed.</p><p>As part of the agreement, Merck will manage the OsteoGram Analysis Center which carries out computer analyses as part of the OsteoGram test. The centre will be operated on a non-profit basis through Merck's newly-established Bone Measurement Institute, separate from the company's commercial business. The institute "will conduct studies to help to increase the availability of bone measurement technologies, increase their accessibility to physicians and reduce the cost of bone mass measurement to healthcare payers", says Jeremy Allen, vice- president of Merck US Human Health and president of the institute. Dr Robert Lindsay, president of the National Osteoporosis Foundation, will chair the Institute's medical and scientific advisory board.</p><p>The Merck institute will support R&D of bone mass measurement technologies and will administer the agreement with CompuMed, which is expected to close on September 22nd, as well as others it has made in this field. Merck is providing financial assistance to US densitometer producers Lunar and Hologic and supported development of Ostex' Osteomark bone resorption test (see Clinica Nos 668, p 1 & 665, p 1).</p><p>CompuMed reports increased revenues</p><p>In the nine months ended June 30th, 1995, sales of OsteoGram amounted to $601,000, 45% more than in the comparable period in fiscal 1994. CompuMed attributes this to installations of OsteoSystem units in three international sites during the third quarter. Proceeds from a $5.1 million private placement will be used by the Manhattan Beach, California company to develop second-generation OsteoSystems as well as the TeleMedicine business. CompuMed markets telemedicine products for ECGs and cardiac event monitoring through its TeleCor subsidiary.</p><p>Total revenues were $2.38 million in the nine months, up 40%, while the net loss was reduced to $1.08 million from $3.46 million in the nine months ended June 30th, 1994.</p>
