<p>In an attempt to fund commercialisation of its first product and develop new ones, Ostex International (US) has floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The company has issued will issue 3.5 million shares at $9.50 each, thereby hoping to raise some $30 million net (shares were trading at $9.63 as Clinica went to press). Licence partner <strong>[C#198700463:Mochida]</strong> (Japan) has agreed to buy $7 million worth. Part of the funds will be used to establish a technical marketing staff, while R&D will be expanded and clinical trials accelerated.</p><p>Ostex develops products for the diagnosis and treatment of skeletal diseases caused by excessive bone, cartilage or connective tissue resorption. Its first product is Osteomark, a noninvasive measure of bone resorption for diagnosis of osteoporosis.</p><p>first markets</p><p>Osteomark was introduced in several European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in 1994. Distribution agreements for those markets have been signed with Technogenetics (Italy), Brahms Diagnostica (Germany), Shield Diagnostics (UK), Intermedico (Canada) and Immuno-Diagnostics (Australia). The test has yet to receive approval in the US or Japan but was submitted for review by the US Office of Device Evaluation in November.</p><p>Ostex requires extra funds while product sales remain low and losses continue. Most revenues in the past have come from tie-ups with other companies - particularly Mochida, Merck (US) and Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) - but no licence fees have been received so far this year. By September 30th, 1994, Ostex had a total deficit of $7.5 million. The flotation funds should suffice until 1998, it says.</p><pre>Financial history of Ostex International ($ millions) Nine months Fiscal years 1994 1993 1992 1991 Revenues Licensing fees - 0.9 0.9 - R&D fees 0.2 0.6 0.7 - Testing services & product sales 0.8 0.4 - - Total revenues 1.0 1.9 1.6 - Net loss (3.1) (1.9) (0.8) (1.2) (nine months ended September 30th, year ended December 31st)</pre><p>Ostex estimates that some 70 million women and 21 million men worldwide are at risk of osteoporotic fracture and that an extra 35 million people are at risk of skeletal degradation associated with Paget's disease. According to the US National Osteoporosis Foundation, the direct healthcare and indirect lost productivity costs of osteoporosis exceed $10,000 million annually in the US alone. Ostex believes the US osteoporosis therapeutics market to be worth $2,000 million per year.</p><p>Other diagnostic products being developed include an osteoarthritis immunoassay to identify cartilage loss. Ostex is also investigating rapid screening methods for discovering agents which can block bone resorption; and monoclonal antibody production. For the latter, it purchased a US specialty laboratory, Hybrilogic, in May 1994.</p>
