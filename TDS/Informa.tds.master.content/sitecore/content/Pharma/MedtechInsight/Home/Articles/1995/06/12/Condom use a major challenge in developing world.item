<p>Increasing the use of condoms to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases "remains a major challenge in many developing countries", says a recent report from Population Action International. In a survey of truck drivers in Nigeria, only 15% used condoms regularly despite having an average of six regular extramarital partners, while in Haiti only 5% of the male partners of women given condoms at a family planning clinic were using them.</p>

<p>Increasing the use of condoms to prevent the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases "remains a major challenge in many developing countries", says a recent report from Population Action International. In a survey of truck drivers in Nigeria, only 15% used condoms regularly despite having an average of six regular extramarital partners, while in Haiti only 5% of the male partners of women given condoms at a family planning clinic were using them.</p><p>Nevertheless, the subsidised promotion and sale of condoms through commercial channels has proved to be a cost-effective way to increase usage in countries as diverse as Ethiopia and Pakistan, the report says. In Zaire, annual condom sales through retail outlets have risen from 800,000 to 18 million over a three-year period. A project in Zambia has focused on the sale of a low-cost, attractively-packaged condom, Maximum, through both normal and non-conventional outlets, including bars, hotels and petrol stations. Maximum is now the most popular condom in Zambia, with sales averaging more than 500,000 per month at the end of 1994.</p><p>Although an estimated $1,500-3,000 million is needed for basic HIV and STD prevention programmes in developing countries, current expenditure represents no more than around 10% of this amount, according to the PAI report. In Nairobi, Kenya, over 20% of women attending antenatal clinics have a sexually- transmitted disease, with gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV infection rates at 5%, 8% and 15% respectively. A study carried out in Lesotho found that 33% of women at family planning clinics had trichomoniasis, 16% had syphilis, 10% had gonorrhoea, 8% were HIV-positive and 6% had chlamydia.</p><p>A priority for the healthcare community should be research into simpler, more rapid and less expensive diagnostic tests for use in countries with limited resources, PAI believes. Accurate diagnosis of sexually-transmitted diseases, particularly in women, remains a challenge.</p><p>The report, Preventing AIDS and STDs: Priorities for Family Planning Programs, is available from: Population Action International, 1120 19th Street NW, Suite 550, Washington, DC 20036, US.
