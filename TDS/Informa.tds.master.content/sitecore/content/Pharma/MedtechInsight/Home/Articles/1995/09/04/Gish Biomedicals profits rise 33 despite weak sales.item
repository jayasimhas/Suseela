<p>Improved gross profit margins helped boost Gish Biomedical's net income 33% to $1.7 million in the year to June. "Gross profit margin improvements were a function of changes in product sales mix, increased productivity and decreases in certain components of overhead," says CFO Jeanne Miller.</p><p>Meanwhile, sales rose just 2% to $21.6 million at the California-based manufacturer of devices for blood conservation, collection and reuse. The company believes, however, that new product introductions in fiscal 1996, such as the MyoManager and an oxygenator, should bring increased revenues. The MyoManager received US approval in July (see Clinica No 664, p 19).</p><p>At the beginning of July, Gish began direct shipments at hospital list prices to hospitals in a territory which stretches from Philadelphia to Florida. Gish's former distributor in the territory ceased replenishing its inventory during the fourth quarter which led to a shortfall in revenues of $600,000 in the period. Fourth-quarter sales were $5.2 million, down 5% compared with the previous year.</p>
