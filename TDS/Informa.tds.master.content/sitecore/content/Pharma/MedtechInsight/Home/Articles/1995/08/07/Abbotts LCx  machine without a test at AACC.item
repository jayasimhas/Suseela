<p><strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> presented its recently launched LCx probe system at the AACC annual meeting in Anaheim, California, July 16th-20th. The instruments have been approved in the US but assays are still under review. Tests for chlamydia and gonorrhoea were launched outside the US, Japan and France earlier this year (see Clinica No 657, p 1).</p><p>The LCx chlamydia and gonorrhoea assays are performed on urine samples, rather than swab and tissue culture: a breakthrough not just in technical terms but also in patient acceptability. The LCR technique, on which Abbott's LCx tests are based, can detect one to five molecules of pathogen DNA in a given sample. In contrast EIA requires between 100,000 and a million molecules or organisms. Non amplified DNA technology is at best 50 times more sensitive than EIA [2,000 molecules or organisms], but amplification is a quantum leap, says Abbott scientist Dr Helen Lee.</p><p>Dr Lee presented data showing that only amplified DNA tests consistently beat culture - the current gold standard for chlamydia and gonorrhoea.</p><p>GenProbe's Pace chlamydia test also beats chlamydia culture using endocervical swab material but is less effective in male urethral samples.</p><p>The LCx probe system has three components: a dry bath for sample preparation; a thermal cycler; and an analyser. The analyser is rotor-based and uses microparticle capture immunoassay technology to detect target amplicons. Tests under development include TB - which could be launched in Europe next year - pneumonia HIV, HPV and hepatitis B and C.</p>
