<p>Prudent purchasing and rational practice will be key factors affecting medical technology use by the end of the decade. Purchasing decisions are increasingly being made by committees who control large businesses.

<p>Prudent purchasing and rational practice will be key factors affecting medical technology use by the end of the decade. Purchasing decisions are increasingly being made by committees who control large businesses. Successful companies stand to gain all the business but will be expected to share the risks with their customers. This scenario of current trends in the US healthcare sector was reiterated by a number of speakers at HIMA's annual meeting in California last month.</p><p>The process of integration, already set in motion this decade, will see more hospitals merge into corporate entities, the purchase of private practices by hospitals and insurers, and the creation of new health plans by a new wave of providers and insurers. In order to survive these changes in the marketplace, companies will need to adopt different management styles, believes John Robinson, chief executive of Smith & Nephew (UK) and member of a panel of healthcare manufacturers and investors</p><p>who convened to consider the implications of market trends for industry.</p><p>Setting the scene, panel chairman John Wilkerson of the Wilkerson Group noted that of the 6,000 companies in the US medtech market, some 1,000 account for 90% of total revenues. Just 50 of the 84,000 products available have annual sales over $200 million. Concentration of the industry is set to continue: the top five device players account for 60% of total sales. Within some product segments, market shares are even greater than this. Dr Wilkerson questioned whether companies should judge performance on market share or corporate profitability, noting that operating margins in sectors such as cardiology and orthopaedics were as high as 25%.</p><p>Speaking from an international perspective, John Robinson pointed out that while the industry is still growing the rate has slowed. Uncertainty in the sector requires management. The trend toward consolidation into buying groups is common practice outside the US, he noted, adding that margins are the same in Europe as in the US. "Regulatory authorities will not go away," he said: industry must learn to work with existing systems.</p><p>Smith & Nephew's approach to the changing market is to sell its product range to buying groups under an umbrella corporate brand rather than product brand. Product management and development is global at Smith & Nephew, he stressed. Product innovation is the key to growth and he sees ample room for small, innovative companies.</p><p>funding start-up companies</p><p>From a start-up company viewpoint, Frank Fischer, president of Ventritex, voiced concern about the US climate for companies such as his. "The current reimbursement situation is killing start-up companies," he claimed. The lack of reimbursement for investigational devices means that the minimum number of patients for successful clinical trials will be enrolled. If approval can be obtained without clinical investigation, companies will do this, he said.</p><p>The cost of R&D forced KeraVision to move its basic research to Europe and South America, according to Thomas Loarie, chairman and CEO of the California-based company which has developed the Intrasomal Corneal Ring for correction of myopia (see Clinica No 519, p 16). He estimated R&D costs at $10,000 for direct treatment and $15,000 in indirect costs per patient. Emphasis is placed on public relations in the ophthalmic sector. Under the managed care system, marketing to the consumer is important, he said. In the non-reimbursed area, financing schemes are being investigated.</p><p>While some might disagree, Paul Brown, a partner in investors Volpe, Welty & Co, believes financing in the device industry is growing. Some 20% of public financing goes to device companies while private investments handled by Volpe, Welty are almost exclusively in medical devices. His company sees opportunities in the industry to meet the needs of integrated delivery systems, through controlling costs and providing technology to enable predictability of outcomes.</p><p>The system rewards products which lower costs rather than innovation, believe the start-up companies. Certainly cost control has become a feature of healthcare. Commenting on the trend to establish hospital networks, Bruce Kaechele, vice- president of business development at American Healthcare Systems, said there would be 500,000 fewer critical care beds by 2000. He believes managed care will become a dominant feature of the US marketplace and the winners "will be those which understand the concept of capitation".</p>
