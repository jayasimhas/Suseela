<p>Uromed (US) is to launch its Reliance Insert incontinence device in Germany this autumn. The single-use, balloon-tipped device is inserted into the urethra with a reusable applicator which, when depressed, inflates the balloon. The insert is removed to allow urination by pulling on a string which deflates the balloon. Average use is expected to be three times daily. The Reliance is indicated for stress urinary incontinence for patients unwilling to undergo surgery or as a stopgap before surgery. UroMed has filed for a 510(k) in the US and hopes to launch the device in other countries this year. Some 8.5 million women in the US suffer urinary incontinence.</p>
