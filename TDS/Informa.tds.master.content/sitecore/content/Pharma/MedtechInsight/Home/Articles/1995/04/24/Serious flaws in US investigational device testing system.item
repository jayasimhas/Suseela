<p>US medical device manufacturers and investigators can expect more government control of their clinical studies. A new Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General report, Investigational Devices: Four Case Studies, gives the FDA the ammunition it has sought for increased regulation of such testing, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>IG investigators "found that the system of testing high-risk medical devices for use in this country has some potentially serious flaws", Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said on April 19th. "While the case studies are not definitive, they are at least indicative of a systemic weakness in the approval process and a lack of trustworthiness by some in the device industry. The report shows that FDA would not be able to make valid decisions regarding the safety and effectiveness of the devices we studied."</p><p>The devices were not named, but described generally: "Device A" is a prosthetic device with a chemical coating to promote bone growth; similar, uncoated, devices have been approved. "Device B" is an orthopaedic device which promotes growth of bone mass between two bones; it is available both uncoated and with a chemical coating to promote bone growth. "Device C" is a device used in ophthalmic surgery. "Device D" treats urinary obstructions.</p><p>The report paints a foggy picture: manufacturers unsure of how many patients have been enrolled or how many devices have been used; patients inadequately counselled about unapproved products and procedures; and investigators unaware of their obligations or role.</p><p>an array of problems</p><p>Ms Brown says her researchers "uncovered problems with the distribution and accountability of these devices outside of approved clinical trials. We also uncovered potential weaknesses in the oversight of clinical trials at local sites, including problems with oversight by institutional review boards and the informed consent process." All four devices lacked adequate IRB oversight, IG inspectors believed. The issue of informed consent was criticised in the case of the orthopaedic and ophthalmic products.</p><p>Distribution and accountability appeared to be bewildering problems for all but the urinary product. Hospitals and investigators are unclear about their responsibilities for tracking and use, while manufacturers cannot always account for all products shipped. One producer could not account for 25% of the components shipped, the report notes.</p><p>"Investigational devices are often treated as if they were already approved as safe and effective," the report concludes, with the products "used inappropriately outside of approved clinical trials". That, industry will probably respond, is because the FDA evaluation process is so slow that devices are widely accepted and used before the agency approves them.</p><p>regulatory zeal</p><p>The report fits in well with the FDA's regulatory zeal. The Centre for Devices & Radiological Health requested the study last year because the CDRH was "considering possible revisions to the Investigational Device Exemption regulations", Director Bruce Burlington told the IG. "Among the revisions we are considering are changes affecting FDA's controls over commercialisation of investigational devices. To help determine the extent the regulation needs to be revised, it would be helpful to have objective data on the degree to which inappropriate commercialisation is occurring and on the economic and public health significance of such commercialisation." The agency is likely to interpret the report's statistics on slipshod tracking and accountability as disguised commercialisation and act accordingly. The report will probably bring about other changes, too.</p><p>"We will take whatever actions are warranted to further assure that investigational device studies are conducted in accordance with the highest ethical standards and all applicable Federal rules designed to protect patients," FDA Commissioner David Kessler told Ms Brown in a letter this month. "This could include actions against individual sponsors if evidence of scientific misconduct is sufficient to justify FDA intervention." (At least one of the four devices described in the IG report is already being audited by the FDA.)</p><p>"Although it is premature to specify what actions may be merited," Commissioner Kessler continued, "FDA generally acknowledges the apparent need to enhance the training of clinical investigators and local institutional review boards to ensure they have a clear understanding of their regulatory and ethical obligations. In addition, the agency may consider other measures to ensure the integrity of clinical investigators and the investigational studies they perform, particularly with respect to accountability of investigational medical devices."</p>
