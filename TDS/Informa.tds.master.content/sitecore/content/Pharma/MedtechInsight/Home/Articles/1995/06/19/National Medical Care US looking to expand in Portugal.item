<p>National Medical Care (US), the dialysis subsidiary of WR Grace (see above), is coming under fire after gaining a stronghold of the Portuguese dialysis market. Nine of the 25 clinics owned by the company have been purchased since 1980, while its share of the Portuguese dialysis market is just under 30%, says NMC. However, according to some Portuguese press reports, this exceeds the legal limit and the company risks a fine of Esc 100 million ($675,000). NMC denies this is the case.</p>

<p>National Medical Care (US), the dialysis subsidiary of WR Grace (see above), is coming under fire after gaining a stronghold of the Portuguese dialysis market. Nine of the 25 clinics owned by the company have been purchased since 1980, while its share of the Portuguese dialysis market is just under 30%, says NMC. However, according to some Portuguese press reports, this exceeds the legal limit and the company risks a fine of Esc 100 million ($675,000). NMC denies this is the case.</p><p>The US company's ever-increasing presence has irked some Portuguese doctors who believe the Health Ministry has favoured the US company, especially at a time when payment delays are increasing, says a report in O Independente.</p><p>Domingos Palma, director of the company in Portugal, told reporters it may have plans to purchase other clinics, but of greater interest are clinical laboratories. While the Massachusetts-based company has not finalised any plans, Mr Palma says the objective is to own 15% of the 500 or so clinical laboratories in Portugal. NMC currently owns 10 clinical labs in the country, according to Syed Kamal, vice- president of international operations. Besides Portugal, NMC provides European dialysis services in Spain, Germany, Hungary, the UK and Czech Republic.</p>
