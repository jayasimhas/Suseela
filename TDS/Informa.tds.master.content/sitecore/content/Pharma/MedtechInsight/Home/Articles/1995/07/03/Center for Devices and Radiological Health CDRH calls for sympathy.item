<p>Criticism of the FDA and plans for its reform are so common in Washington these days that agency officials take every opportunity to sing their own praises. The Center for Devices & Radiological Health is especially beleaguered and its officers are urging the industry to forget past problems and remember recent CDRH achievements whenever they can, writes Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p>

<p>Criticism of the FDA and plans for its reform are so common in Washington these days that agency officials take every opportunity to sing their own praises. The Center for Devices & Radiological Health is especially beleaguered and its officers are urging the industry to forget past problems and remember recent CDRH achievements whenever they can, writes Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>"Judge us on our current performance," deputy director for regulations & policy Joseph Levitt asked the Food & Drug Law Institute (FDLI) on June 26th. He acknowledged that the past few years have been difficult for industry, "but we have made great strides". Most importantly, he said, the FDA is fulfilling its mandate to promote public safety. He claimed FDA leadership in assuring electromagnetic compatibility of medical devices; co-operation with Telectronics' J-lead recall; a fluoroscopy safety campaign; corporate injunctions; and accreditation and certification of mammography facilities under the new Mammography Quality Standards Act.</p><p>quicker approval</p><p>Mr Levitt also cited quicker availability of devices - particularly 510(k)s - "and we will do more, [without] compromising patient safety". He produced statistics to prove his contentions that the 510(k) backlog and average and median review times are down; output is up; and more final decisions are being made within the statutory 90-day period. Some 97 new employees have joined in review functions. Product exemptions will soon be proposed for some 120 devices.</p><p>CDRH has also worked hard to improve communications with the public via fax and teleconferences, Mr Levitt said, and is "clarifying requirements" through guidance documents and panel meetings. "We have streamlined export procedures," he said, and international harmonisation has become very important, with industry urging more use of standards. "We must go beyond Good Manufacturing Practices ... as criteria to approval."</p><p>still sceptical</p><p>Alan Slobodin, chief counsel to the House Commerce Committee, told the FDLI that "there is healthy scepticism" in his committee. "The jury is still out on the FDA. Congress is still in a listening and learning mode." Staff have been working on legislation since chairman Tom Bliley (R-Va) said that FDA reform is one of his top priorities. Several people have suggested completion of the legislation this summer, with Congress debate in the autumn.</p>
