<p>Consensus on the third stage of German healthcare reform may be closer following two days of joint talks by non-hospital doctors and the Krankenkassen with Health Minister Horst Seehofer last month. Agreement on central issues such as reimbursement and the opening up of the hospital sector was reached, according to German press reports, although many details still need to be resolved, particularly those affecting the German Hospital Federation (DKG).</p><p>Both Kassen and doctors now agree that relative reimbursement levels for all non-hospital doctors should continue to be listed in a single book (the EBM). They also agree that absolute reimbursement levels should be negotiated by the Lander associations of doctors and Kassen (the Kassen had originally argued for the right to set contracts with individual doctors). However, it is not yet clear how disputes will be resolved - the Kassen want more than just an arbitration committee.</p><p>The two bodies also support government efforts to allow non- hospital doctors access to hospital facilities for outpatient operations. Hospital costs rose 6.7% in 1994 compared with 3.5% in the outpatient sector. With overall spending fixed, this means hospitals are gaining at the expense of non-hospital doctors. Further discussions on the topic between the Kassen, doctors and hospitals will take place in May. A law implementing the third stage of the reforms is expected in mid-1996.</p><p>some way to go</p><p>However, while non-hospital doctors and Kassen may be thinking along similar lines, the same is not true of hospitals. The DKG is resisting any new reforms while it fights changes in the second reform stage (the BPflV). Reimbursement negotiations with the Krankenkassen in 14 Lander have so far gone to arbitration; all those which have reached a decision have ruled in favour of the hospitals.</p><p>The DKG also criticises attempts by the Kassen to increase the number of diagnosis-related payments under the BPflV. Chairman Klaus Prossdorf has called for a moratorium until a three-year investigation into the effects of the law is completed. The DKG will join discussions with Mr Seehofer and the other medical groups in May or June.</p>
