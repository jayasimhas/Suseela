<p>F H Faulding (Australia) recorded a 3.6% sales increase to Aus$686.4 million ($508 million) in the six months ended December 31st, 1994. Net profits were up 1.6% to Aus$18.0 million. Sales and profit contribution by Faulding Imaging were both "in excess of the previous corresponding period", as a result of improved market share. The division's distribution agreement with Olympus Optical (Japan) has been renewed for a further three years. Selby Scientific, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Faulding since 1994, saw sales grow 11%, but the division recorded an operating loss for the period. Selby acquired Unicam, a New Zealand distributor of scientific equipment during the year.</p>
