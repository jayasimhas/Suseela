<p>Ostex of Seattle, Washington, has filed for an injunction to prevent Ostech from using the Ostech tradename. Ostex, which completed its initial public offering in January this year, claims that the use of a similar name is confusing to customers and investors. Ostech of New Haven, Connecticut, brought 2 million shares to market on August 2nd. Ostex' chairman and CEO, Ray Cairncross, says investors have been confused by the Ostech offering and have asked whether it is a further offering by Ostex. Both companies produce diagnostic and monitoring devices for skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. Ostex' bone resorption test, Osteomark, received US FDA clearance in May and is being made available to physicians through Corning Clinical Laboratories and the Corning Nichols Institute (see Clinica No 665, p 1).</p>
