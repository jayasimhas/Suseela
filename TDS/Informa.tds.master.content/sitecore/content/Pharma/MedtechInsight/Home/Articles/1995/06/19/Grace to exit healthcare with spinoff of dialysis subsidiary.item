<p>National Medical Care, the dialysis subsidiary of specialty chemicals group WR Grace, will be spun-off to Grace shareholders. The board of Grace decided this was a better solution for the company and its shareholders than other options, including a proposed takeover bid from the head of the subsidiary or a merger with Vivra Medical, the number two behind NMC in its market.</p>

<p>National Medical Care, the dialysis subsidiary of specialty chemicals group WR Grace, will be spun-off to Grace shareholders. The board of Grace decided this was a better solution for the company and its shareholders than other options, including a proposed takeover bid from the head of the subsidiary or a merger with Vivra Medical, the number two behind NMC in its market.</p><p>The spin-off will take the form of a special stock dividend to holders of Grace common stock and is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of the year. NMC will become a separate, publicly-traded company after it is spun off and will continue to be managed by its current executive team with its own board of directors. Dr Constantine Hampers will continue to serve as chairman and CEO and Dr Edmund Lowrie as president.</p><p>Dr Hampers appears happy with the solution: "While this transaction differs from the one I proposed last month [a $3,500 million buyout bid], the benefits to NMC are similar. NMC will be an independent company, able to shape its own future within the healthcare field." Among these future options is one mentioned by Grace CEO Albert Costello: "There is nothing to prevent Constantine Hampers and his team from pursuing mergers that make sense after the spin-off."</p><p>Through NMC, Grace is listed as number 71 in Clinica's top 100 companies in the medical device and diagnostics sector (see this issue p 15) with sales of $264 million last year. NMC's total turnover was almost $1,900 million, 37% of group sales of nearly $5,100 million.</p>
