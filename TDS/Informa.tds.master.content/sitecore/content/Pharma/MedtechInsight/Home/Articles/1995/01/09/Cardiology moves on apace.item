<p>1994 saw US approval of J&J's stent, radiofrequency ablation and a ventricular assist device and the launch of point-of-care heart attack tests Clinica's science writer, David Firn, looks back over an innovation-packed year.</p><p>RF Ablation Gets US Approval</p><p>In July the US Department of Health & Human Services served subpoenas on over 100 hospitals in an investigation of reimbursement for unapproved interventional devices. The investigation covered all products from pacemakers to atherectomy catheters but ablation catheters were top of the agency's hit list. In September the FDA threatened to rescind existing 510(k) approvals for diagnostic electrophysiology catheters.</p><p>The threat was not followed-up and by November EP Technologies' (US) cardiac ablation system gained approval and in December the Circulatory Systems Advisory Panel recommended approval for Atakr, <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong>'s (US) ablation system.</p><p>VADs</p><p>In February Baxter (US) became the first company to receive approval for a left-ventricular assist device in when its Novacor division received permission to market its wearable device in Europe. Thermo Cardiosystems' (US) pneumatic LVAS, HeartMate, received EU certification under the AIMD in April and US approval, as a bridge to transplant, in October. Thoratec expects to receive US approval for its bi-ventricular assist device following a December favourable recommendation by the FDA Circulatory Devices Panel. A wearable version of the pump is already available in Europe.</p><p>Telectronics Withdraws Leads</p><p>Telectronics Pacing Systems (US) was forced to withdraw its Accufix Atrial J pacemaker leads worldwide, following deaths when wires from the leads punctured the arteries of two patients. The defect is believed to have occurred in at least 13 cases in the US.</p><p>Point-of-Care Testing</p><p>Inappropriate hospitalisation for chest pain in the US costs $2-$4,000 million a year. Failure to diagnose and treat myocardial infarction (MI) accounts for the highest payouts in emergency malpractice litigation in the US. A test that could differentiate patients at risk from those who do not need immediate hospital care could save lives and money. Boehringer Mannheim and Sanofi both launched tests for cardiac-specific myoprotein.</p><p>In May Boehringer Mannheim received US marketing approval for Cardiac T, its Troponin T ELISA. Troponin T, which is more specific to cardiac injury than CK-MB, is released even after very minor events and remains elevated for 14 days or more. In a blinded trial in the UK, twice as many troponin T-positive chest-pain patients died or had a repeat episode compared with troponin T- negative patients.</p><p>Boehringer Mannheim launched Trop-T, a ten-minute, point-of-care test, in Sweden at the end of April followed by a pan-European launch in September. In December, Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur (France) launched a 30-minute troponin I test. Spectral Diagnostics (Canada) is not far behind. It submitted its point-of-care myoglobin test for US 510(k) approval in April and a myoglobin/CK-MB panel-test in August.</p><p>The new antibody-based tests are not likely to replace CK-MB testing overnight. Indeed, the well known and trusted test is still being improved. Helena Laboratories' (US) CK-MB subform assay can reliably detect myocardial infarction (MI) in 25 minutes. An electrocardiogram takes about 20 minutes. Electrophoretic separation takes only six minutes, compared with one hour for a traditional CK-MB test. Helena's test received 510(k) approval in January and the Beaumont, Texas-based company says it aims to develop an ambulance version so that initial results can be ready upon arrival at hospital.</p><p>Endosonics launches new imaging balloons</p><p>Intravascular ultrasound has yet to prove itself in trials but the feeling among interventional cardiologists is that it could drastically improve the outcome of most procedures - both by helping physicians to select the most appropriate device and by guiding the intervention itself. Endosonics (US) unveiled two new PTCA-imaging catheters at the European Congress of Cardiology, in September. The company says it is planning to incorporate micromotors into its ultrasound catheters.</p><p>Pacemakers keep getting smaller</p><p>In May Siemens announced the first implants of its 14 g pacemaker, the Microny SR+ (see front cover)</p><p>Resuscitation aggravation</p><p>Active compression-decompression (ACD) caused a stir in the US in 1994 when the FDA terminated a study of Ambu International's ACD device on the grounds that patients were unable to give informed consent! A study at the University of California - San Francisco found it to be more effective than traditional resuscitation methods. A finding subsequently backed up by a multi-site UK study.</p><p>INTERVENTIONAL CARDIOLOGY</p><p>The big news in interventional cardiology was the US approval of Johnson & Johnson's Palmaz-Schatz stent in August. FDA Commissioner David Kessler singled out the device - the first to get approval on the basis of randomised trials - for praise, saying that it will work better than angioplasty for certain types of patient. However, the benefits come at the expense of increased bleeding, clotting complications and longer hospital stays.</p><p>In France the Palmaz-Schatz stent is now used in around 14% of coronary interventions. However capitated reimbursement could prove a barrier to use in the US because anticoagulation requirements result in a longer hospital stay than is the case for PTCA. Bleeding is the major drawback to stenting but heparinised stents and ultrasound guided placement could, in time, overcome this. A heparin-coated version of the Palmaz-Schatz stent entered clinical trials in March. The pilot trials finished in late spring, but so far J&J has not released any details. Alternative access techniques - using smaller diameter devices inserted via the transradial route - could also reduce complications.</p><p>Morgan Stanley predicts a $300 million market by 1997 for the Palmaz-Schatz stent alone and says as many as 50% of angioplasty patients may be treated by stenting in the not-too-distant future. Although analysts have reacted enthusiastically some clinicians are advising caution, saying that the promising results of BENESTENT and STRESS have not laid to rest the spectre of delayed restenosis. Indeed the potential for late stent migration, metal fatigue and endarteritis will not be known for some time.</p><p>Angioplasty v Bypass Surgery</p><p>Three-year follow-up data from the EAST (Emory Angioplasty vs Surgery Trial) trial found no difference between PTCA and CABG in terms of death, myocardial infarction or ischaemia. Survival was 94%. There were, however, marked differences in demand for repeat revascularisation. Half of the PTCA patients underwent a repeat procedure. However with an average 3.4 lesions per patient the finding of equivalent outcome is a significant achievement for PTCA.</p><p>EAST has US National Institutes of Health funding for a further five years follow-up, which will take patients into the period where grafts start to clog up.</p><p>RITA Publishes Cost Data</p><p>The initial cost of PTCA treatment is 52% of the cost of bypass surgery. However, two-year follow-up data from the RITA (Randomised Intervention Treatment of Angina) trial show a cost increase for PTCA, taking it to 80% of that for CABG. The RITA trial group has secured funding to extend follow-up to ten years.</p><p>760,000 angioplasty procedures were carried out, worldwide, in 1994 - over half in the US.</p><p>Atherectomy Cuts A Niche</p><p>Follow-up from the ERBAC trial - laser ablation, rotational atherectomy and balloon angioplasty in type B and C lesions - support the wider use of the Rotablator. However, more and more evidence points to the targeted use of laser and atherectomy devices, something that randomised trials of cardiovascular disease patients have not adequately investigated. Many clinicians now think that atherectomy and ablation devices both have their own indications and probably perform much better and more cost effectively when used in these cases.</p><p>Cholesterol Lowering Pays-Off</p><p>An analysis of ten randomised, controlled studies of cholesterol lowering therapy should lead to an increase in all forms of lipoprotein and triglyceride testing. When taken together, the ten studies, reviewed by Drs Robert Superko and Ronald Krauss of the Cholesterol Research Center at the University of California found that treatment was clinically- and cost-effective.</p><p>ICDS FIRST CHOICE FOR SUDDEN-DEATH SURVIVORS</p><p>The policy of using implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy as a last resort in sudden, unexpected cardiac arrest survivors was questioned and rejected by a prospective randomised study reported at the European Congress of Cardiology meeting in September.</p><p>The trial, carried out at the Universities of Utrecht, Groningen and Amsterdam, found that mortality in ICD patients was almost half that of a group treated with conventional therapeutic drugs. In many centres ICDs are implanted only after antiarrhythmic drugs and VT surgery have failed.</p>
