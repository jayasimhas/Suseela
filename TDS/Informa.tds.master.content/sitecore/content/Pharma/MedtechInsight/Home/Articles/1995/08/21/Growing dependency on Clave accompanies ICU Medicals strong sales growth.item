<p>ICU Medical, a manufacturer of IV connection systems, reports continued strong sales growth based on its needleless Clave system. First-half turnover of $11.4 million was up 42% compared with the previous year.</p><p>In the launch year of 1993, Clave contributed 20% to ICU's revenues; by the first half of 1995 this had risen to 60%. ICU, based in San Clemente, California, expects that the general shift in demand from protected needle devices to needleless systems will further increase the company's dependency on Clave.</p><p>Apart from this one product, ICU depends crucially on two distributors which have provided an entry into the fixed contract hospital market. ICU's distribution agreement with McGaw, in place since 1993, was amended in May and will run until the year 2000. Some 20% of ICU's 1994 sales were contributed by McGaw.</p><p>In April of this year, ICU secured a second important distributor in the shape of <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>. This deal extends to 2002. These two distribution agreements corner some 60% of the total IV solutions and sets market, analysts at US brokers C J Lawrence estimate. ICU intends to enlist further distributors with similar arrangements.</p><p>Existing independent distributors include Tacy Medical; Professional Hospital Supply; and New England Medical Specialties. They accounted for 13%, 12% and 11% of ICU's 1994 sales respectively.</p><p>The existing rate of sales-growth is forecast to persist. The C J Lawrence analysts predict 41% for the full year 1995 and 42% for 1996. ICU's profits, on the other hand, remain depressed by its manufacturing expansion to rectify last year's problems when orders for Clave exceeded manufacturing capability.</p><p>The expansion of manufacturing is one of the purposes to which ICU aims to put newly-raised funds. In a second round of financing three years after going public, ICU sold 1.5 million shares and raised $16 million in June. In its prospectus, the company lists acquisitions and the expansion of marketing and distribution as further uses for these funds.</p><p>The company estimates the market for protective IV connectors at $170 million in 1994, part of the total $2,500 million IV market which includes equipment, solutions and supplies. Among its most immediate competitors are other manufacturers of safe connector products such as Baxter and Burron Medical, a subsidiary of German B Braun Melsungen. The market for IV therapy systems as a whole is dominated by Baxter, Abbott and McGaw, while <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong> and Sherwood Medical lead the hypodermic needle market.</p><pre>ICU Medical's 1994 and first-half 1995 results ($ millions) Full year 1st half 1994 % change 1995 % change Sales 16.5 45% 11.4 42% of which Clave 7.4 220% 6.9 109% Net income 2.9 -12% 1.6 -16% (ended Dec 31st, 1994; June 30th, 1995)</pre>
