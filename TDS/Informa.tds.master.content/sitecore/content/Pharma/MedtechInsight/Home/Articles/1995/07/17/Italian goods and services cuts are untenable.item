<p>The effects of inflation mean that the cuts in spending on goods and services for 1995, 1996 and 1997 dictated by the Italian Finance Law will be untenable, according to Carlo Orlandini, special commissioner of the National Institute for the Study and Treatment of Tumours. Writing for Il Sole-24 Ore, he states that the real reduction this year, corrected for inflation, is 26% (compared with 1993), not 18%. Cuts of 16% and 14% are planned for 1996 and 1997 respectively, also compared with 1993 spending levels. The cuts are indiscriminate, the author proclaims, since the same levels apply irrespective of whether a service has already taken cost-containment measures.</p>
