<p>While oestrogen replacement therapy for post-menopausal women may be cost-effective, screening to determine which women will most benefit "needs to be evaluated", concludes a US Office of Technology Assessment report. Perhaps all older women should be placed on medication, suggests the congressional agency.</p>

<p>While oestrogen replacement therapy for post-menopausal women may be cost-effective, screening to determine which women will most benefit "needs to be evaluated", concludes a US Office of Technology Assessment report. Perhaps all older women should be placed on medication, suggests the congressional agency.</p><p>After assessing the use of single photon absorptiometry, the only method of bone densitometry currently covered by Medicare, the OTA concludes: "The only condition under which BMD (bone mineral density) screening would become more cost-effective than giving HRT to everyone would be if it were shown: first, that there are no heart disease benefits from HRT; and, second, that hip fractures and other osteoporotic fractures have a dramatic effect on quality of life."</p><p>This highlights that cost-effectiveness is becoming the prime determinant of American healthcare, notes Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller. But healthcare providers and payers have little information on which to base these cost- effectiveness decisions.</p><p>As OTA says in another new publication: "No set procedure exists for evaluating new technologies." This is especially important, OTA continues, because while the US leads all developed nations in early and widespread use of advanced medical technologies, insurers are playing an increasingly active role in deciding whether new technology warrants coverage.</p><p>"The biggest barrier to decision-making - for all types of insurers - is the lack of reliable information on effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety when decisions have to be made. Cost-effectiveness receives considerable weight .... Private insurers recognise that they will continue to be gatekeepers for many new technologies and that they can be most effective if armed with better information at the earliest possible time. However ... they would also appear to welcome greater responsibility on the part of the medical profession, health care institutions, manufacturers and the federal government in assuring that new technologies are effective, safe and relatively cost-effective before they go into wide use."</p><p>OTA surveyed private insurance company medical directors concerning their decision-making process for covering new medical technologies. As examples they used three applications of laser therapies: laser angioplasty for opening narrowed or blocked coronary arteries; laser discectomy for treating herniated intervertebral discs; and photodynamic therapy for bladder cancer.</p><p>Although there is no set procedure that all insurers follow to evaluate new technologies, "it appears that most companies - whether indemnity insurers or health maintenance organisations (HMOs) - go about the process similarly. The company medical directors are nearly always involved in coverage decisions and, in most companies, are assisted by a committee", OTA found.</p><p>Factors considered in coverage decisions "appear to be relatively consistent across companies", OTA says, citing medical acceptability, efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness and regulatory considerations (eg FDA approval). HMOs appear to give more weight to cost-effectiveness - they were less likely to cover a new technology if it had a higher cost for the same effectiveness, OTA notes. The largest barrier to decision-making, for all types of insurers, is the paucity of reliable, relevant information.</p><p>Private insurers cover nearly three-quarters of all covered Americans. Although they have established some formal technology assessment programmes, so far they have conducted a limited number of evaluations and their recommendations are not always binding on the payers.</p><p>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which administers the federal Medicaid and Medicare programmes, issues only about ten national decisions on new technologies or procedures each year. However many more regional decisions are initiated by HCFA's 79 claims-processing contractors.</p><p>Since Congress has allocated no finances for the OTA for fiscal 1996, which begins on October 1st, these may be the last OTA studies, unless the agency is revived with fresh funding sometime in the future.</p>
