<p>The Brazilian medical devices and supplies market is worth an estimated $950 million, says a new report from the Canadian Consulate General in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Imports represent about $400 million, supplied mainly by the US, Japan, Germany and East Asia, from where most low-cost disposable items are imported. European suppliers retained dominance on the capital equipment market due to their ability to finance their exports, concludes the report.</p>

<p>The Brazilian medical devices and supplies market is worth an estimated $950 million, says a new report from the Canadian Consulate General in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Imports represent about $400 million, supplied mainly by the US, Japan, Germany and East Asia, from where most low-cost disposable items are imported. European suppliers retained dominance on the capital equipment market due to their ability to finance their exports, concludes the report.</p><p>Brazil also serves as a major distribution centre for neighbouring countries. The Mercosur agreement, signed by Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay at the end of last year, has created a market of almost 200 million consumers (see Clinica No 616, p 9).</p><pre>Brazilian market 1990-92 ($ millions) 1992 1991 1990 Local production 710 672 960 Exports 161 96 73 Imports n/a 415 289 Source: Canadian Consulate General, Sao Paulo: Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade</pre><p>The private sector in Brazil purchases some 50% of medical equipment, with the federal social health system (INAMPS) purchasing 30%, and state and municipal governments, acquiring the remaining 20%. A tendering system operates for medical equipment for hospitals. Most patients purchase home healthcare devices directly from manufacturers or high street distributors.</p><p>Public sector healthcare, which caters for an estimated 76% of the population, is focusing on the construction of small clinics while existing facilities are renovated and modernised, says the report. Generally, public services are still poor. Indeed, federal government investment declined from $87 per capita in 1987 to $23 per capita in 1993. This represents some 4.2% of the country's GDP, compared with 4.7% for Chile and 4.5% for Argentina.</p><p>Most healthcare resources are concentrated in the southern states. Some 70% of all medical facilities in Brazil are in Sao Paulo alone, says the report.</p><p>The vast majority of domestic production comprises small- and medium-sized companies. In 1992, large companies accounted for less than 3% of Brazilian manufacture. The 500 or so equipment manufacturers in Brazil employ more than 13,000 people and there are some 1,500 distributors.</p><pre>Composition of Brazilian market Medical equipment manufacturers 500 Clinical analysis laboratories 12,000 Radiology institutes 8,000 Hospitals (public and private) 7,500 Hospital beds 560,000 Dentists 130,000 Physicians 145,000 Source ABIMO, the Brazilian medical, dental, hospital and laboratory supplies industry association.</pre><p>dental care</p><p>The Latin American dental market is estimated to be worth $500 million a year, of which the Brazilian market accounts for some 63%. In 1992, the Brazilian market for disposable medical products, of which the dental industry is an important end- user, was $215 million, a rise of 15% from 1991. Industry sources predict the market will increase 7% a year to 1996. Dental care is available through the public sector, but lack of materials and waiting periods of up to four months for an appointment mean the overall service remains poor, says the report.</p><p>disposables</p><p>Domestic production of disposables was $197 million in 1992, manufactured by about 125 companies. Imports of disposables, which accounted for 20% of the total Brazilian market, are forecast to grow by 12% a year to 1996. Imports are led by the US with a 56% share in 1992. This figure may be inflated because Miami is often the final port for goods arriving in Latin America. Official statistics often record imports according to last country of shipment rather than place of origin, says the Canadian report. Trade sources consider disposables of US origin to be closer to 45% of Brazilian imports.</p><p>Import duties on most disposable products were lowered to 20% in July 1993. The government has, says the report, lowered import duty to as little as 2% for some products in order to lessen inflationary pressure. International standards such as ISO 9000 will be fully accepted, says the report.</p><p>building a brighter future</p><p>The Brazilian government has already planned healthcare investment equivalent to $15,000 million for 1995. However, healthcare in the public sector needs major reforms, according to Michael Valdes-Scott, head of the Latin American Trade Advisory Group (LATAG) based in the UK. Public healthcare is so rudimentary partly because the social services budgets are always the first to be cut. The private and military sectors, however, are "reasonably buoyant". "Investment is quite strong, technology modern and the quality of the doctors is very high, particularly in cardiology and ophthalmology," he told Clinica.</p><p>One way of dealing with the lack of funds in the public sector, as demonstrated by Chile, is to encourage employees to buy healthcare policies. Health insurance companies/policy controllers would then have money to set up hospitals and other healthcare centres, removing an estimated 40% of the population from the market. Current resources could then be devoted to the poorer population, says Mr Valdes-Scott. To do this, however, President Fernando Henrique would have to introduce new legislation.</p><p>Exposaude, the international healthcare industries exhibition, & 8th Brazilian exhibition of the industry of medical, dental hospital and laboratory equipment will take place from July 4th-7th, 1995, in the Palacio das convencoes do Anhembi, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
