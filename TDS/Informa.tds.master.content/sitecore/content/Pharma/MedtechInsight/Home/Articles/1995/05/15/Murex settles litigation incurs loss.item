<p>Murex has reported a net loss of $2.2 million in the first quarter ended March 31st, 1995, compared with a net income of $971,000 in the 1994 first quarter. The loss includes a charge of $3.1 million for litigation settlements. Murex and parties to 1992 class action suits and a subsequent action filed in 1994 have settled all claims for $5.4 million, of which Murex will pay a portion. Murex has not admitted liability to the claims, which alleged misrepresentation of company facts and insider trading. The settlement is subject to a definitive agreement and court confirmation.</p><p>Despite a $9.5 million reduction in revenues as a result of injunctions regarding Murex' hepatitis C screening test, sales grew 7% to $23.48 million in the quarter, says president and CEO David Tholen. R&D expenses amounted to $2.56 million compared with $1.36 million in the 1994 first quarter. These related to the introduction of the Hybrid Capture DNA probe to detect CMV and increased expenditure on development of the Immune Capture Enzyme Immunoassay technology due to be launched later this year.</p>
