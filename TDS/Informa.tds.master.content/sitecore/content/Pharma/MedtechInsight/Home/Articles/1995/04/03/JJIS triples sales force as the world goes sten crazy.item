<p>Interest in stenting has mushroomed since the publication of the STRESS and BENESTENT trial results in 1993. Atherectomy, which at one time seemed to be the route to reduced restenosis, has been eclipsed by the runaway success of stenting - but is fighting back. Meanwhile cardiologists are extending the list of applications for stenting and PTCA even into patients a hundred years old. David Firn reports from the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session, held in New Orleans from March 19th-22nd.</p>

<p>Interest in stenting has mushroomed since the publication of the STRESS and BENESTENT trial results in 1993. Atherectomy, which at one time seemed to be the route to reduced restenosis, has been eclipsed by the runaway success of stenting - but is fighting back. Meanwhile cardiologists are extending the list of applications for stenting and PTCA even into patients a hundred years old. David Firn reports from the American College of Cardiology Annual Scientific Session, held in New Orleans from March 19th-22nd.</p><p>Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems (JJIS) is rumoured to be selling a million dollars worth of Palmaz-Schatz stents a day. At a price in the US of $1,600 and a production cost of around a dollar J&J is sitting on a goldmine - at least until the rest of the industry catches up.</p><p>Interviewed at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting (New Orleans, March 19th-22nd), J&J's Coronary Systems manager Patricia Scheller declined to confirm the rumours but admitted the million dollar sales figure is not wide of the mark. The company, she says, has tripled its sales force and trained around 3,000 US physicians and nurses at STRESS trial sites in Canada and the US since the stent gained US FDA approval in August 1994.</p><p>selling like hot cakes</p><p>For the time being, the company has about 80% of the stent market. According to Ms Scheller, demand exceeds supply. The Palmaz-Schatz device is the only stent approved for use in de novo lesions in the US. Cook's (US) Wallstent is only approved for the threat of abrupt closure (bail-out stenting), but somewhere between 30 and 50% of US stent use is thought to be off-label. Some 75,000 Palmaz-Schatz stents have been implanted since the first human trial in Brazil in late 1988.</p><p>JJIS is not resting on its laurels. The company has an active peripheral vessel programme and given the chance would like to see stents everywhere, from hearts to tear ducts. Femoral stenting is under investigation and a preliminary renal study has been completed. "Portal hypertension is an intriguing market," says Ms Scheller. Pulmonary tree and paediatric stenting are possibilities and some physicians are attempting carotid and subclavian procedures.</p><p>One criticism of the Palmaz-Schatz stent is its balloon (it is supplied unmounted in Europe). Ms Scheller admits it is not the best in the world. "We are doing a lot of research to improve the system," she added. Whether this research includes purchasing a balloon manufacturer she would not say.</p>
