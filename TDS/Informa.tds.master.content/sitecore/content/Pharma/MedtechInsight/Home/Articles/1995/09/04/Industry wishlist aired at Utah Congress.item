<p>Clinica's US correspondent reports from Park City, Utah.</p><p>US medical device manufacturers do not want to dismantle the Food & Drug Administration - they want it to do more. But companies want the agency to view them as partners, not adversaries. This message was repeated at the Utah International Medical Congress, held on August 16th-19th. Attendees called for "coaching and consulting as well as policing", pre-scheduling of routine inspections, better communications and more industry involvement in developing more guidance documents.</p><p>Industry wants fundamental changes at the FDA. The substantial equivalence rule for 510(k) approval is "antiquated" and should be replaced by European-model standards, claimed Robert Britain of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association. Good Manufacturing Practices should be harmonised with ISO 9000 and EN 46000 quality systems, delegates urged. Another European idea, third-party review, was also favoured.</p><p>The Medical Device Manufacturers Association wants even more: a Center for Devices & Radiological Health, independent of the FDA.</p><p>All this calls for recognition by Washington that devices and diagnostics are different from drugs and cannot be regulated in the same way. "We must make it clear [to Congress and the FDA] that one size does not fit all," said Stan Bauman of the In Vitro Diagnostics Manufacturers Coalition. "We must become political activists, no longer simply reacting to rules but helping to write both law and regulation."</p><p>major FDA reform legislation unlikely this year</p><p>Only a few months ago, Washington circles were talking confidently about major FDA reform legislation this year. Both Republicans and Democrats agreed on the need for - if not the extent of - change. But time constraints and politics have intervened. Senator Orin Hatch told the Utah Congress he was not sure such a measure could be enacted this year - "given the pressure of the legislative agenda and the scope of the endeavour .... If it becomes obvious that a big bill can't go forward, then I think we ought to break it up into smaller pieces, and medical device reform should rank right at the top."</p><p>Two issues are already in stand-alone legislation: new export rules and reimbursement for some investigational devices. With the FDA's slow approval process, many devices become standard- of-care years before they are approved and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) can pay for them. The Advanced Medical Devices Access Assurance Act would change that, clarifying that Medicare must reimburse for clinical trials of "next generation" investigational devices - ie improved versions of already marketed products. Even if this legislation does not pass, Medicare may decide to pay for the devices. FDA and HCFA officials have been discussing the matter and "are near agreement", Center for Devices and Radiological Health Director Bruce Burlington told the Utah conference. The FDA will probably recommend that the HCFA reimburse for "evolutionary" IDEs, he said.</p><p>New export rules are less certain. No one is enthusiastic about the bill under consideration - the FDA Export Reform & Enhancement Act of 1995. It is certain to undergo at least minor revisions. The device industry has been mollified only by assurances that current rules may still be followed. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are divided on the bill's worth. Powerful liberal Senators say the Act's aim is trade, not public health, and may make shipment to countries without good regulatory systems too easy. The FDA and the Department of Commerce also apparently disagree on the measure and its trade versus public health focus. The Clinton Administration has not officially commented on the bill.</p><p>While not changing current IDE and certification requirements, the bill allows export of FDA-unapproved devices and drugs if they have been approved by a "Tier I" country. This list includes major west European nations, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Israel and Japan. Another "Tier II" group of countries with a regulatory system adequate to protect public health could also receive devices and drugs lacking FDA or Tier I-country approval. The General Accounting Office would determine which countries should be included on the Tier II list.</p><p>"It is my expectation that the list of Tier II countries will contain some potentially large markets," Senator Hatch says. "I think a strong case can be made that countries like Russia, India and China belong on this list."</p><p>These export provisions are also incorporated in a concept paper released by the Senate Labour and Human Resources Committee chairman, Nancy Kassebaum. Although the FDA Performance and Accountability Act of 1995 is still not in legislative form, Ms Kassebaum says her committee will mark-up the measure this month.</p><p>FDA no longer the only regulatory agency for devices</p><p>The US healthcare system is changing dramatically. Medical technology companies must not only "reinvent" themselves, as <strong>[C#198600502:Baxter International]</strong> executive vice-president Lester Knight noted: they must also learn to work with new types of providers. Industry must realise that in this new environment, the FDA is not the only agency to be reckoned with.</p><p>They must "forge partnerships" with other governmental bodies, HIMA vice-president Susan Zagame advised: the Department of Health & Human Services' investigative Office of Inspector General and the major medical technology purchasers - the HHS Health Care Financing Administration (which pays for government health programmes), the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defence.</p><p>little enthusiasm for user fees</p><p>Any support that once existed among medical device companies for user fees seems to have disappeared. A biological company executive's enthusiastic tale of how well drug user fees have worked for his company met only scepticism at the congress.</p><p>Representative John Dingell, who spearheaded the Administration's effort for user fees last year, has declined to introduce Clinton's plan in Congress this time around. The Administration, however, remains determined - the levies are included in its Reinventing Government initiative.</p>
