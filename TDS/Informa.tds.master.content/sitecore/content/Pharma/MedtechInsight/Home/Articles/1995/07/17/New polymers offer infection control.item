<p>In order to address spiralling hospital-acquired infection costs, Massachusetts-based manufacturer Implemed has developed a range of anti-infective medical polymers. The Oligon materials are based on oligodynamic iontophoresis, a technology which releases silver ions to destroy bacteria on the surface of the device. The process is activated as soon as the material comes in contact with body fluids.</p>

<p>In order to address spiralling hospital-acquired infection costs, Massachusetts-based manufacturer Implemed has developed a range of anti-infective medical polymers. The Oligon materials are based on oligodynamic iontophoresis, a technology which releases silver ions to destroy bacteria on the surface of the device. The process is activated as soon as the material comes in contact with body fluids.</p><p>Implemed boasts that almost any plastic medical device can be made anti-infective using the technology and plans to introduce the first of these, a polyurethane vascular access catheter, in Europe at the end of the year and in the US next year. The market for vascular access catheters is estimated at $675 million. The company plans to sell a range of infection-control devices and will also license the Oligon technology.</p><p>According to Implemed, the number of hospital-acquired infections has tripled in the last ten years to become the sixth leading cause of death in the US. Annual costs to the US healthcare system are estimated at around $12,000 million, half of which is device-related. Some 90% of this cost is non-reimbursable.</p>
