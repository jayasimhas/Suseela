<p>Computed tomography has faced stiff competition in recent years from new imaging modalities but it could regain an edge through spiral CT. Since its introduction in 1989, spiral CT has gained wide clinical acceptance and its advantages, which include speed, 3-D spatial <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> and lower X-ray dose, are being proved in a number of applications, according to researchers at the Rontgen Centenary congress.</p>

<p>Computed tomography has faced stiff competition in recent years from new imaging modalities but it could regain an edge through spiral CT. Since its introduction in 1989, spiral CT has gained wide clinical acceptance and its advantages, which include speed, 3-D spatial <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> and lower X-ray dose, are being proved in a number of applications, according to researchers at the Rontgen Centenary congress.</p><p>Radiologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital and the University of Cambridge presented data to show that fast CT can be used as the primary imaging technique for patients with possible acute aortic dissection. A 12 second continuous data acquisition technique allowed the radiologists to make confident reports on 52 of 54 patients.</p><p>In another study, the researchers used spiral CT with 3-D reconstruction as an adjunct to bronchoscopy in assessing 21 patients with proximal airway disease. Bronchoscopy alone is the method of choice but can block the airways and provides little information beyond the scope's reach. They found that the spiral CT technique provides accurate assessment of the severity and extent of airway stenoses, especially where the distal airway was inaccessible to bronchoscopy, and provides a guidance for bronchoscopy and surgery. The X-ray dose using the technique was 20% lower than with standard chest CT, they add.</p><p>new technologies</p><p>Volume rendering is a new method for displaying spiral CT data which allows simultaneous display of the volume of interest and the surrounding structures, says Dr Anwar Padhani of The Royal Marsden NHS Trust in Surrey. The technique allows the user to render bone 100% opaque or translucent - increased opacity produces a surface display and decreased opacity produces a fluoroscopy-type image. Although expensive, the cost of the software to perform the technique is coming down, says Dr Padhani.</p><p>Other new developments include multimodality imaging, in which a combination of modalities can utilise the advantages of each. Siemens is reported to be developing a combination CT/MRI system for diagnosis and staging of tumours, radiotherapy planning and imaging response to treatment. Virtual reality can also be used to improve presentation of CT data, plan endoscopic procedures, improve yield of endoscopic biopsy and screen for colonic polyps, Dr Padhani adds.</p><p>routine applications</p><p>Professor Willi Kalender, formerly at Siemens and the inventor of spiral CT, believes its future lies in routine applications such as vascular studies (CT angiography) and imaging the lungs and airways. Developments in spiral CT will be led by faster scan times, higher X-ray power and higher computing power, believes Prof Kalender. "The horsepower race is back on again," he says, adding that most manufacturers now produce systems with 60kW X-ray power.</p><p>Siemens shows Somatom Plus 4 system</p><p>Siemens says it has already sold five of its new top-of-the range Somatom Plus 4 spiral CT scanners in the UK since the January launch - including two in the first day of the Rontgen Centenary congress. Siemens claims to have the fastest system with sub-second scan times and believes the system to be particularly useful for imaging coronary arteries. The system was first shown at RSNA last November (see Clinica No 633, p 20).</p>
