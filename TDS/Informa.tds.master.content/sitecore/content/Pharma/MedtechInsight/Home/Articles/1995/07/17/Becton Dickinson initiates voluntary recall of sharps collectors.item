<p><strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong> initiated on July 7th a voluntary, worldwide recall of sharps collectors supplied by Med-Safe Systems (US). The decision came a day after US consumer group Public Citizen wrote to FDA Commissioner David Kessler demanding an immediate recall of the devices which, it claims, failed to meet quality assurances.</p><p>The consumer group says that Med-Safe produced around half a million sharps collectors which fell below wall thickness specifications between August and December last year. When Becton Dickinson was informed that the products were substandard, the company returned unused products to its supplier. However, it "failed to recall those that had already been shipped to its customers", states Public Citizen.</p><p>Becton Dickinson has initiated the voluntary recall because, whether or not there is a safety issue, its customers may be concerned as a result of the publicity caused by Public Citizen, a company spokesman told Clinica. He said that when a Med-Safe employee informed Becton Dickinson in December 1994 that devices produced in the previous six months did not meet the specified wall thickness requirements, the sharps collectors were returned to Med-Safe. Becton Dickinson decided, however, that the fault did not constitute a safety hazard and therefore did not recall devices already shipped.</p><p>Med-Safe corrected the problem in January this year and Becton Dickinson has instituted more frequent site inspections of the producer. It was not until April that the FDA contacted Becton Dickinson, according to the company, and reviewed its decision not to initiate a recall last year. Since the agency did not pursue the matter, Becton Dickinson assumed it had acted satisfactorily. There is no evidence that safety has been jeopardised, adds the company.</p><p>Depending on the response to the recall, some 5-10,000 devices could be returned. Med-Safe will bear the expense of replacing the devices, which retail at $3-4 each, says Becton Dickinson. All customers which have purchased devices produced during the June-December 1994 period have been contacted by Becton Dickinson.</p>
