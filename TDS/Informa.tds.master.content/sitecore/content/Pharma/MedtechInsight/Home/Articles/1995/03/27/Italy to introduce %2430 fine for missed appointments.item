<p>The Italian national health service will soon have a financial incentive to ensure its diagnostic resources are used efficiently. Health services that fail to test at the patient's appointment time will have to pay Lit 50,000 ($30) compensation. Patients are also being encouraged to help the system run smoothly - they will be fined Lit 50,000 if they do not arrive for their appointment.</p>

<p>The Italian national health service will soon have a financial incentive to ensure its diagnostic resources are used efficiently. Health services that fail to test at the patient's appointment time will have to pay Lit 50,000 ($30) compensation. Patients are also being encouraged to help the system run smoothly - they will be fined Lit 50,000 if they do not arrive for their appointment.</p><p>The new system is being introduced under the Public Healthcare Service Charter, due to be presented by the government soon. Similar to the UK Patients' Charter, the Italian version requires local health authorities to meet a minimum set of objectives, such as keeping to diagnostic appointment times. Other targets include ensuring ambulances arrive within eight minutes in urban areas and within 20 minutes in the country, and issuing welcoming letters to all in-patients.</p><p>The Charter will also require authorities to explain what services they offer and to grade the standard of those services according to locally determined quality indicators.</p>
