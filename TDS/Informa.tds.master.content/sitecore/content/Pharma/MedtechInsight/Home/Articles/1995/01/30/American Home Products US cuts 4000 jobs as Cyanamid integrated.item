<p>American Home Products (US) is to cut its global workforce by 4,000 in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of American Cyanamid (see Clinica No 617, p 1). This represents 5% of the company's 76,000 employees. All business areas will be affected, including AHP's own operations. The cuts come on top of 300 job losses announced in December (see Clinica No 632, p 18) and will be followed by further reductions in 1996.</p>

<p>American Home Products (US) is to cut its global workforce by 4,000 in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of American Cyanamid (see Clinica No 617, p 1). This represents 5% of the company's 76,000 employees. All business areas will be affected, including AHP's own operations. The cuts come on top of 300 job losses announced in December (see Clinica No 632, p 18) and will be followed by further reductions in 1996.</p><p>The consolidation of Cyanamid in the fourth quarter boosted AHP's turnover in fiscal 1994. Sales of medical supplies and diagnostics rose 18% in the final quarter and 4% for the year ended December 31st. Excluding Cyanamid and the divestiture earlier in the year of Corometrics, fourth-quarter sales were up 8% and full-year turnover rose 6% compared with 1993. AHP singles out needles, syringes, tympanic thermometry products and surgical devices for their high sales growth.</p><p>Group turnover for the year was up 8% to $8,966 million and fourth-quarter sales rose 22% to $2,586 million. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, growth for the two periods would have been 4% and 6% respectively.</p><pre>American Home Products' results 1994 Change vs Change vs ($ millions) 3 months 1993 (%) 12 months 1993 (%) Medical supplies 248.8 +18 883.6 +4 and diagnostics Pharmaceuticals 1,488.0 +23 5,199.9 +9 Consumer health 492.7 +10 1,802.1 +3 Total healthcare 2,229.4 +20 7,885.6 +7 Other 356.4 - 1,080.6 - Total 2,585.8 +22 8,966.2 +8</pre><p>Synergies from the Cyanamid acquisition will be "powerful over time", according to analysts at Alex Brown. However, the analysts have reduced their estimate of short-term earnings, believing that AHP will manage the restructuring to maintain growth at 9-10% over the next few years. Morgan Stanley expects savings to total $175 million in 1995, $325 million in 1996 and $525 million in 1997.</p><pre>AHP medical devices/supplies sales breakdown ($ millions) 1995e 1994e 1993 AHP Medical Supplies Sherwood Medical Catheters/syringes 425 417 409 Other 225 215 199 Corometrics 0 36 93 Quinton/clinical products 125 111 103 Symbosis 75 56 41 IMS/Biomedical 0 0 6 Total AHP 850 834 851 American Cyanamid Medical Devices Davis & Geck 272 286 295 Storz 299 279 261 Acuflex 58 54 50 Total American Cyanamid 628 619 606 TOTAL 1,478 1,453 1,457 Source: Morgan Stanley</pre>
