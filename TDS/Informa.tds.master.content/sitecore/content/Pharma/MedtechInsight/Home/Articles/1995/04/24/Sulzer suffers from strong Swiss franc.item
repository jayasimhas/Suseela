<p>In 1994, Swiss-based Sulzermedica suffered from continuing cost-cutting efforts in the healthcare sector combined with an 8% rise in the Swiss franc against the US dollar. Expressed in Swiss francs, the company's operating profit declined 5% but in US dollar terms this would have been a 2% increase. Sulzermedica's sales were similarly affected. While they fell 2% in Swiss franc terms, they would have risen 6% in US dollars.</p>

<p>In 1994, Swiss-based Sulzermedica suffered from continuing cost-cutting efforts in the healthcare sector combined with an 8% rise in the Swiss franc against the US dollar. Expressed in Swiss francs, the company's operating profit declined 5% but in US dollar terms this would have been a 2% increase. Sulzermedica's sales were similarly affected. While they fell 2% in Swiss franc terms, they would have risen 6% in US dollars.</p><pre>Sulzer's 1994 results (SwFr millions) Sales Change Operating Change from '93 profit from '93 Sulzermedica Pacemakers 330 +2% Cardiovascular 155 -5% Orthopaedics 571 -3% Sulzermedica total 1,056 -2% 232 -5% Other businesses 4,982 -11% 57 +148% Sulzer total 6,038 -9% 289 +8% (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>As in previous years, Sulzermedica contributed the major share of the parent's operating profits but Sulzer's other businesses showed improvements. Board chairman Pierre Borgeaud stressed that Sulzer would stick to its existing product lines and not depend solely on medical devices. With internal cost- cutting and market share gains, Sulzer's net income increased 5% to SwFr 195 million despite higher restructuring costs of SwFr 50 million in 1994 compared with SwFr 20 million a year earlier. At SwFr 226 million, group R&D spending was slightly down; for Sulzermedica, however, it rose 2% to SwFr 103 million.</p><p>In 1995, Sulzer expects a further improvement of the bottom line but concedes that currency exchange rates could dampen results. Incoming orders in the first quarter of 1995 were 1% higher than a year before. For Sulzermedica, however, first- quarter orders were down 7%, heralding a difficult year.</p>
