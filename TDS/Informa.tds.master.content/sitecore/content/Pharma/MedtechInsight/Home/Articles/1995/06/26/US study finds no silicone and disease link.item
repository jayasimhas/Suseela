<p>A US study of nurses has found no link between silicone breast implants and connective-tissue disease. The study of 87,501 female nurses, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (June 22nd), found 516 confirmed cases of connective tissue disease. Some 1,183 of the women had breast implants - 876 silicone-gel filled, 170 saline, 67 double-lumen, 14 polyurethane-coated and 56 of unknown type - but only three of the women with definite connective tissue-disease had implants and only one had silicone. All three had rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers did find a 50% increase in self-reported signs or symptoms of connective-tissue disease that was just short of being statistically significant.</p>

<p>A US study of nurses has found no link between silicone breast implants and connective-tissue disease. The study of 87,501 female nurses, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (June 22nd), found 516 confirmed cases of connective tissue disease. Some 1,183 of the women had breast implants - 876 silicone-gel filled, 170 saline, 67 double-lumen, 14 polyurethane-coated and 56 of unknown type - but only three of the women with definite connective tissue-disease had implants and only one had silicone. All three had rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers did find a 50% increase in self-reported signs or symptoms of connective-tissue disease that was just short of being statistically significant.</p><p>The study, which is couched in caution, including an unusually detailed disclosure statement, found no evidence of a link to connective-tissue disease per se nor any of a list of 41 signs or symptoms. The incidence, the authors say, is within the ranges previously found in population-based studies. However they add that the 95% confidence limit does not exclude a minor association that would still be of public health importance and that the strict disease definitions used for the study could have excluded some true or mild cases.</p><p>Public Citizen's Health Research Group says the study is too small. The lobby group argues that only one case of connective-tissue disease would be expected in the 1,183 women with implants. Even a five-fold increase in scleroderma, polymyositis, Sjogren's syndrome or mixed connective-tissue disease would have led to less than one case showing up among the nurses with implants, according to Dr Sidney Wolfe, the research group's director.</p>
