<p>The requirements for premarket review and bar coding contained in the proposed changes to the Canadian medical device regulations have been the main focus of discussions between industry, government and users to date. A series of meetings is planned over the next couple of months to discuss the package of 16 proposals for a risk-based classification regulatory system (see Clinica No 662, p 9).</p>

<p>The requirements for premarket review and bar coding contained in the proposed changes to the Canadian medical device regulations have been the main focus of discussions between industry, government and users to date. A series of meetings is planned over the next couple of months to discuss the package of 16 proposals for a risk-based classification regulatory system (see Clinica No 662, p 9).</p><p>Industry association MEDEC has asked why grandfathering is not being considered. It questions whether the Medical Devices Bureau has sufficient resources to cope with review of products already on the market and notes that the proposal will impose an additional financial burden on industry. MEDEC has put forward its arguments for grandfather provisions at the request of the Bureau.</p><p>While industry is not opposed to the principle of bar coding, it questions whether this requirement, which would be unique to Canada, is appropriate in the light of global markets. The introduction of a bar code or unique identification number should be considered with a view to harmonising with other countries' requirements, recommends MEDEC. The additional investment in equipment which such a scheme would entail for hospital users has also been highlighted.</p><p>More positive discussion has been achieved on the ISO 9000 standards, MEDEC's Kevin Murray told Clinica. More emphasis is being given to ISO 9000 quality standards as a premarket requirement, bringing Canada into line with other countries. MEDEC supports this proposal but has noted that start-up companies might encounter problems in meeting requirements.</p><p>As a result of the discussions of the proposed regulations, a revised draft is expected to be published in the Canada Gazette Part I early next year.</p>
