<p>At its meeting on March 31st, the US FDA's Immunological Devices Advisory Panel voted 5 to 2 against recommending approval of Base Ten Systems' software package, Prenval, designed to assist in processing alpha-foetoprotein measurements to predict the presence of spina bifida in foetuses. One member voted to recommend approving the Class III device after labelling changes.</p>

<p>At its meeting on March 31st, the US FDA's Immunological Devices Advisory Panel voted 5 to 2 against recommending approval of Base Ten Systems' software package, Prenval, designed to assist in processing alpha-foetoprotein measurements to predict the presence of spina bifida in foetuses. One member voted to recommend approving the Class III device after labelling changes.</p><p>The software includes a database manager to store the measurements, a calculator with specific algorithms to standardise alpha-foetoprotein levels for the age of the foetus and a word processor to write laboratory reports. The panel was asked to advise the FDA on: 1 (criteria for selecting algorithms to use when standardising the alpha-foetoprotein level for the gestational age of the foetus; and 2) an appropriate method of displaying the percent of positive alpha-foetoprotein measurements.</p><p>Joseph Jorgens, a software expert for the FDA, was satisfied that the manufacturer had performed the correct procedures to "ensure the software does what it's supposed to do and nothing else". Base Ten Systems presented data showing that the program was able to generate calculations equivalent to those created using traditional instruments such as hand-held calculators. The study included over 2,000 prospective samples and 1,300 retrospective samples from at least four institutes. The panel was concerned that only one of many algorithms included in the software was used for the study. The manufacturer did not provide outcomes data to assess the ability of the calculated values to determine accurately the presence or absence of spina bifida.</p><p>Questions were raised about the validity of the algorithms included in the package. Several members expressed their concern that approving the software would be an endorsement of the untested algorithms. Asked by the panel if the device could be reclassified or marketed without FDA regulation, the agency replied that it was committed to its current classification.</p><p>Voting against approval, Dr Harold Markowitz said: "I don't think the device warrants a PMA, it sets a bad precedent." He considered that PMA approval recommendation would give the company an unfair advantage over those who market similar products not regulated by the FDA. Dr Alexander Baumgarten commented: "For Class III classification, I want specific and ample evidence of efficacy and safety. That kind of evidence was absolutely not presented here."</p><p>Dr Michael <strong>[C#198601285:Watson]</strong> added: "I think the biggest problem is the formulas in the program [to standardise alpha-foetoprotein levels for the age of the foetus]. I voted for approval with conditions, the conditions being a much-improved educational programme in the manual explaining the pros and cons of existing formulas."</p><p>Dr George Elias, one of the two members favouring approval without conditions, considered that the manufacturer would be prevented from entering the market because the panel objected to the product being marketed with FDA approval. "It does not object to the product going on the market without FDA approval, however, as an unregulated piece of software."</p>
