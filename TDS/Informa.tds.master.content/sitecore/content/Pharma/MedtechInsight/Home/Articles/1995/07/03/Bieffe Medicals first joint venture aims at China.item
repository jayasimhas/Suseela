<p>Bieffe Medital is entering the Chinese market in its first joint venture. The Italian manufacturer of parenteral solutions and medical devices is investing $8.4 million in a deal with Tianjin Amino Acid which will produce parenteral solutions in Tianjin. The facility's turnover should rise to some $10 million by the third year, predicts Bieffe's president Alberto Siccardi.</p><p>Bieffe's 1994 turnover was Lit 150,000 million ($92 million), up 17% compared with 1993. Medical devices including systems for peritoneal dialysis account for some 60-70% of total sales, Dr Siccardi told Clinica. With 640 employees, the company produced more than 30 million devices for the administration of its 60 million units of parenteral solutions last year.</p><p>Around 60% of Bieffe's total sales are generated in Italy, 15-20% in other European countries and the rest in Latin America and Asia. The company spent $5 million on R&D last year. Internationally it competes with the likes of Baxter and <strong>[C#198601363:Fresenius]</strong>.</p><p>Bieffe's four business areas are all aimed at companies such as the hospital market and include:</p><p>* IV solutions for large-volume use; * devices and solutions, mainly for peritoneal dialysis, but also for extracorporeal haemodialysis; * clinical nutrition, plasma expanders and local anaesthetics; * and devices for surgery (sutures and staplers).</p><p>The company also has an engineering division, which concentrates on technology transfer and licensing and the supply of production plant on a turn-key basis.</p><p>Bieffe, headquartered at Lugano, Switzerland, manufactures at three sites Italy, one in Spain and three in Switzerland. It plans to open a new production site in Tunisia in the next couple of months. Furthermore, the company has ten production licensees throughout the world, including in Korea, Iran, Tunisia and Burkina Faso.</p><p>Commenting on the Italian market, Dr Siccardi told Clinica that a business that entirely depended on the flat Italian market could not expect to survive. International sales, on the other hand, are increasing at an annual rate of some 30-35%. Bieffe has been an active exporter for some four years. Although the company has been questioned briefly by investigators relating to the diagnostic imaging scandals surrounding the Italian pharmaceutical and device industries, it has not been subjected to the interrogations that many companies have experienced.</p><p>The company plans to have its devices CE-marked by early 1996 and is using the Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanita as its Notified Body. It is also in the process of registering a number of solutions and medical devices in some 20 countries worldwide.</p><p>main products</p><p>Among the company's most important products are large-volume bags and its in-house technology for producing ready-filled bags; an irrigator for use in arthroscopy and an aspirator for TURP procedures.</p><p>Bieffe recently introduced its FlexiStap stapler for intestines following stomach cancer surgery. Dr Siccardi claimed that although Ethicon and 3M are marketing similar products, Bieffe's stapler is longer and has 360 rotation flexibility. As a result it can travel further up the intestine and can be introduced orally.</p>
