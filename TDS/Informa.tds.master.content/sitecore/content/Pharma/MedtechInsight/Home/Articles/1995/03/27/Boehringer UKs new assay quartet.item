<p>Mid-March saw Boehringer Mannheim UK launch four new assays for research use which it claims are both faster and more sensitive than existing products. They are: the Luciferase Reporter Gene assay and three new kits for the detection of In Situ Cell Death (apoptosis).</p><p>Reporter Gene assay</p><p>The Reporter Gene assay has a detectable linear range of 10 fg/ml to 1 micro g/ml, and is capable of being measured in any microplate, tube luminometer or scintillation counter, or with photographic film. It is claimed to be faster and up to 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional isotopic and non-isotopic methods.</p><p>With the new kit, Boehringer has overcome a problem common to luciferase-based assays, namely their light emission characteristics and dependence on sophisticated detection hardware, claims UK business development manager Phil Sefton. Luciferase-catalysed light emission is characterised by a transient flash, usually less than half a second in duration, which rapidly decays and dictates the use of automated "flash luminometers" with injection capability.</p><p>Boehringer has modified the reaction to produce a stable light emission which lasts for several minutes and allows whole microplates to be analysed after manual addition of reagent, notes Mr Sefton.</p><p>Reporter gene assays are used routinely in transfection experiments to study gene expression in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells by linking a promoter sequence to an easily detectable "reporter" gene. To optimise the new product's application potential, Boehringer has linked it to the most widely-used reporter gene, firefly luciferase.</p><p>Available at a list price of &pound;98 ($156), the Reporter Gene assay contains all necessary reagents. The formulation of its lysis buffer enables samples to be evaluated using other non-radioisotopic assays such as CAT ELISA or hGH ELISA.</p><p>In Situ Cell Death kits</p><p>The new range of In Situ Cell Death kits consists of a Fluorescein kit for direct analysis by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry, and two kits for light microscopy. The latter differ only in their secondary detection systems - alkaline phosphatase (AP) and peroxidase (POD).</p><p>All three are claimed by Boehringer to "offer significant advances over market leader Oncor's existing detection systems, being faster and more sensitive, accurate and flexible".</p><p>The apotosis kits are based on the TUNEL method, which involves the labelling of DNA strand breaks in individual cells with fluorescein-dUTP. Strand break is described as a very early and selective marker of programmed cell death.</p><p>The Fluorescein kit (list price &pound;274) is said to be particularly fast and easy to use, since the strand breaks are directly labelled with fluorescein-dUTP, obviating the need for a secondary detection system for fluorescent analysis and eliminating one incubation and washing stage. The AP and POD kits (both with a list price of &pound;295) are intended for light microscopy applications in immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical techniques.</p>
