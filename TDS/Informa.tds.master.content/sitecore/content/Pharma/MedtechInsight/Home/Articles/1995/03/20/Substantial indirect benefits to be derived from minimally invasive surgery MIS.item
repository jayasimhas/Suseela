<p>The potential benefits to the US economy from use of laparoscopic technology in three surgical procedures amount to $1,900 million annually, according to a study by DRI/McGraw Hill. Funded by US health policy research organisation Health Care Technology Institute, the study calculated the gains which could be expected from quicker recovery and speedier return to work for patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery.</p>

<p>The potential benefits to the US economy from use of laparoscopic technology in three surgical procedures amount to $1,900 million annually, according to a study by DRI/McGraw Hill. Funded by US health policy research organisation Health Care Technology Institute, the study calculated the gains which could be expected from quicker recovery and speedier return to work for patients who undergo laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>The study shows the potential benefits associated with laparoscopy based on the number of traditional cholecystectomies, abdominal hysterectomies and inguinal hernia repairs carried out between 1988 and 1991 which could have been performed in a less invasive manner.</p><p>The greatest benefits are estimated for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which could result in indirect benefits of over $1,000 million each year, claims the report. This is based on shorter hospital stays (one day instead of five-eight days for abdominal surgery) and a reduced post-hospital recuperative period (five-seven days vs four-six weeks). The indirect benefits are estimated to be double the direct benefits ($500 million) realised by the healthcare sector.</p><p>The number of cholecystectomies rose from 500,000 in 1988 to almost 600,000 in 1991. During the same period, between 400,000 and 500,000 abdominal hysterectomies were performed annually and inguinal hernia repairs are estimated at over 530,000 each year.</p><p>"Except for gallbladder removal, where laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard, the laparoscopic approach accounts for a relatively small percentage of these procedures," says DRI/McGraw Hill.</p><p>The percentage of conversions to laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy is between 20% and 30%, yet the indirect benefits derived from this procedure could be $500 million a year. Use of laparoscopy for inguinal hernia repair is even lower, says the report, which estimates the benefits at over $200 million.</p>
