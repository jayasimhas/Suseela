<p>US OTC test manufacturer ChemTrak cautions that 1995 sales of its total cholesterol test will be substantially lower than during 1994. This warning is based on the most recent forecast by ChemTrak's marketing partner Advanced Care Products, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary. ChemTrak says it anticipates "few, if any" sales to Advanced Care Products in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>US OTC test manufacturer ChemTrak cautions that 1995 sales of its total cholesterol test will be substantially lower than during 1994. This warning is based on the most recent forecast by ChemTrak's marketing partner Advanced Care Products, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary. ChemTrak says it anticipates "few, if any" sales to Advanced Care Products in the second half of the year.</p><p>ChemTrak's 1994 results benefited considerably from sales of the cholesterol test, increasing the company's product sales to $7.78 million, nearly three times the level a year earlier.</p><pre>Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 2.19 0.35 (0.91) (2.26) Year 10.32 4.71 (1.07) (9.24) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Fourth-quarter results do not include the projected non-cash charge of $1.4 million connected with the proposed acquisition of Coonan Clinical Laboratories (see Clinica No 636, p 1) because the deal is not yet completed. The price has been raised from 400,000 newly-issued ChemTrak shares to reach 450,000 million plus $0.4 million in cash. ChemTrak's share price has fallen a firther 14% since the beginning of the year to close at $2.25 on January 23rd.</p>
