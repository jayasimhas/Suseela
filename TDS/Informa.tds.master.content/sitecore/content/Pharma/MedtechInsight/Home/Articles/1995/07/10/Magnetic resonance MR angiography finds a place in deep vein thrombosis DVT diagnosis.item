<p>Magnetic resonance angiography provides more accurate, reliable information of deep vein thrombosis of the pelvis than contrast venography, according to French researchers. In addition, MRA allows the diagnosis of clot spread. Contrast venography, the gold standard test following initial Doppler ultrasound, can be difficult to interpret and is prone to operator-induced variations, they say.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance angiography provides more accurate, reliable information of deep vein thrombosis of the pelvis than contrast venography, according to French researchers. In addition, MRA allows the diagnosis of clot spread. Contrast venography, the gold standard test following initial Doppler ultrasound, can be difficult to interpret and is prone to operator-induced variations, they say.</p><p>Dr Benoit Dupas and colleagues at the central university hospital, Nantes, compared MRA, contrast venography and colour duplex sonography in 25 patients with DVT of the pelvis confirmed by venography (The Lancet, July 1st). Two-dimensional time-of-flight MRA performed on a 1 T system has a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%, specificity of 98.5% and positive predictive value of 97.5% for diagnosing thrombosis at each level, from the femoral vein to the inferior vena cava. Venography could not be interpreted in 9% of levels and sonography was limited to the pelvic level.</p><p>The researchers conclude that although colour duplex sonography remains the first examination for suspected DVT, MRA provides better information than venography as a supplementary technique for diagnosing equivocal cases, clot spread and pulmonary embolism with normal ultrasound findings. It does have problems with complex flow (such as where vessels bifurcate), however, and previous studies recommend the use of cine MR images or phase contrast MRA at the expense of longer acquisition times and sensitivity to patient motion.</p>
