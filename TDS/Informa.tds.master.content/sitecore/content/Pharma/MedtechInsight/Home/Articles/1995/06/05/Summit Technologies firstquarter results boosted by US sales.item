<p>Summit Technologies' first-quarter sales have increased 94% compared with the previous year, mainly due to higher US sales of the company's excimer laser system. In March, the Massachusetts-based manufacturer of ophthalmic lasers received US FDA approval for its laser system for phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) to treat certain corneal pathologies (see Clinica No 646, p 20).</p>

<p>Summit Technologies' first-quarter sales have increased 94% compared with the previous year, mainly due to higher US sales of the company's excimer laser system. In March, the Massachusetts-based manufacturer of ophthalmic lasers received US FDA approval for its laser system for phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) to treat certain corneal pathologies (see Clinica No 646, p 20).</p><p>The improved first quarter follows a year which Summit described as the "end of the beginning" in the company's development. Sales in 1994 fell nearly 10% from the previous year largely because of lower international sales due to increased competition. In its annual report, Summit underlines that it is leading the race for US regulatory approval of the laser system for myopia. In February, Summit submitted additional data to the FDA for its PMA application for photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The company says it does not expect FDA approval before the fourth quarter of the year.</p><p>Summit believes that VISX (US), Technolas Laser Technik (Germany) through its US distributor Chiron, Nidek (Japan) and LaserSight (US) are conducting US clinical trials of PRK. With the exception of its closest competitor, VISX, Summit is confident that none of the "late arrivals will get approval until near the turn of the century" (see this issue, page 13).</p><pre>SUMMIT'S RESULTS Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1993 1995 1994 1993 Year - 24.21 26.80 - (15.38) (9.15) 3 months 7.11 3.66 - (2.00) (4.21) - (year ended Dec 31st; 3 months ended Mar 31st)</pre>
