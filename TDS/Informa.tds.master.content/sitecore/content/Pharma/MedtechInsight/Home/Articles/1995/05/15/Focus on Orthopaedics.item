<p>The orthopaedics market is poised to undergo a radical change as biology prepares to overtake mechanics in driving new technology. Biotechnology-based products will begin to reach the market in the next few years but their major impact will not be felt until the next century. In the meantime, the industry faces consolidation brought about by deceleration in major markets.</p><p>The world orthopaedic market is continuing to grow, but at a much slower rate than in the late '80s and early '90s. Clinica estimates that the total market grew nearly 8% in 1994 to around $5,100 million with similar growth rates forecast over the next several years.</p><p>The US market grew 5.2% to $2,474 million in 1994, according to Lehman Brothers, accounting for around half of the world market. Growth for the rest of the world is around 10%. The Western European implant market has been affected by reductions in reimbursement levels and thus the market remains soft, say the US analysts. The French market in particular has stagnated in the past year. The less penetrated markets of Asia and Latin American seem to be driving growth, they add.</p><p>the market</p><p>Implants account for the around two-thirds of the worldwide orthopaedics market in dollar terms. The rest of the market broadly comprises trauma/fixation devices, arthroscopy equipment and powered surgical instruments. Hip and knee implants represent most of the implant market in dollar terms, with implant prices varying widely between countries. In the US, sales of hip implants totalled $740 million in 1994, up less than 1% on the previous year. Knees fared better, increasing by 7.3% to $875 million, according to Lehman Brothers figures.</p><pre>1994 World Orthopaedic Market (in $ terms) US 50% - Hips 15% Knees 17% Other US 18% W European 30% Japan 10% Other 10% Source: Clinica/Lehman Brothers</pre><p>While the US hip implant market is stagnant in dollar terms some increase in procedures has been registered over the last year. Manufacturers are having to fight to retain or increase their share of an increasingly cost-conscious market. In addition, the reduction in revision operations from 91,000 in 1990 to 84,000 in 1993 (Lehman Brothers figures) suggests that hip implants are now lasting longer.</p><p>There is potential for sales growth in the next few years for the knee market in which there are still opportunities for high-performance systems which have a longer life span for use in younger patients. The analysts predict that hip implant sales will increase just 1% in 1995 to $747 million, with knee sales up 6.5% to $932 million in the same period. Earlier predictions of a slowdown in knee implant sales have yet to be realised but this will inevitably occur within the next few years.</p><pre>Hip & knee implants performed in US ('000) Hips Knees Total 1990 143 141 284 1991 142 177 319 1993 150 180 330 1994(e) 154 197 351 1995(p) 152 192 344 1996(p) 150 189 339 Note: hips do not include revisions; e=estimate; p=prediction Source: National Center for Health Statistics and Lehman Brothers</pre><p>market sectors</p><p>The hip and knee replacement market is dominated by a few large companies. <strong>[C#198601245:Bristol-Myers Squibb]</strong>'s Zimmer subsidiary has the largest share of the knee market, its MG II and Insall Burstein systems together holding around 24% of the world market. Boehringer Mannheim's DePuy enjoys the largest share of the hip market with around 24%. <strong>[C#198600199:Pfizer]</strong>'s Howmedica holds a significant share of both markets. Larger manufacturers are likely to experience erosion of their share of the market with sales going to some of the smaller companies, predicts Lehman Brothers. Other major players in the hip and knee markets include Smith & Nephew Richards, Johnson & Johnson Orthopaedics, Stryker (Osteonics), <strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> and Sulzer (Intermedics Orthopaedics).</p><p>The remaining implant market comprises spinal, shoulder, elbow and small joint implants. The market for spinal implants is valued at around $200 million, with the US holding the major share. This market is predicted to show one of the highest growth rates in the orthopaedics industry at around 12% per year, according to Clinica Reports. The main players are Sofamor Danek, Dimso (Stryker), Acromed and Synthes.</p><p>In 1994, the US spinal implant market suffered from the regulatory and legal constraints surrounding spinal pedicle fixation. It looks certain, however, that the FDA will reclassify pedicle screw implants to Class II devices and this is expected to open up the market to a number of companies. Sofamor Danek has received clearance for pedicle screws for very limited applications. In Western Europe, surgeons are far more cautious about the benefits of intervention for back pain which have yet to be proved.</p><p>The worldwide arthroscopy market is worth around $380 million worldwide, $230 million of which is in the US. By far the most common arthroscopy procedure is on the knee (75%), followed by the shoulder (17%), ankle, elbow, hip, wrist and spine. Some manufacturers believe the spinal arthroscopy market offers a large potential for growth with new, smaller cameras and instruments. The major arthroscopy manufacturers are Zimmer's Linvatec subsidiary, Smith & Nephew Dyonics, Acufex, Stryker and Arthrex which together hold around 75% of the market.</p><p>The orthopaedic trauma/fixation market is worth over $1,000 million per year, with around 50% of this in the US. Intramedullary nails, external fixation and compression hip screws are the largest part of the market, which is dominated by Synthes. Other major players include Howmedica, Smith & Nephew, Biomet and Orthofix.</p><p>The new area of bone growth stimulators, which are used for non-union fracture treatment, is thought to represent a potential $400-500 million worldwide market. These systems comprise electrical/magnetic stimulators which are placed next to the bone defect. The technology also has applications in spinal fusions of which around 125,000 are performed in the US every year. <strong>[C#198700799:OrthoLogic]</strong> (US) received approval for its OrthoLogic 1000 magnetic bone growth stimulator in March 1994 and achieved sales of $3 million in nine months.</p><p>leading companies</p><p>While Zimmer and Howmedica still dominate the worldwide orthopaedics market, they appear to be losing share to other major players and some smaller companies. Some of the best performers over the past year are shown in the table. Other companies, such as Stryker, Biomet and Wright Medical have increased their shares through acquisitions (see below).</p><pre>Orthopaedics League Table for Fiscal 1993 and 1994 Orthopaedics Orthopaedics Revenues in proportion ($ millions) to total medtech revenues Rank Company 1993 1994 1994 1 Zimmer (BMS) 970* 1,000* 59% 2 Howmedica (Pfizer) 657 685 57% 3 Smith&Nephew (Richards) 616 671 56% 4 Stryker 447 544 80% 5 DePuy (B Mannheim) 483 500 23% 6 Sulzer (1) 397 418 54% 7 Biomet 335 373 100% 8 Synthes 170* 185* 100% 9 Sofamor Danek 162 162 100% 10 Johnson & Johnson 125* 130* 2% 11 Wright Medical 78 96 100% 12 Aesculap 74 83 100% 13 Kirschner Medical (2) 67 70* 100% 14 Landanger-Camus 47 58 78% 15 Acufex (Am Cyanamid) (3) 50 55* 10%* 16 Orthofix 31 40 100% 17 Orthomet (4) 22 27 100% 18 Interpore 14 18 100% 19 Corin Medical 12 14 100% 20 Danninger Medical 9 10 100% 4,776 5,139 * Clinica estimates.

Growth rates of non-US companies are influenced by currency changes and are not identical with growth rates in accounting currencies.</pre><p>market trends</p><p>Factors identified by Lehman Brothers as affecting the US orthopaedics market in the current managed care environment include:</p><p>* reduction of supply inventory levels at hospitals through increased purchasing group power; resulting in</p><p>* pressure to control prices and increased competition among manufacturers; and</p><p>* standardisation of clinical practice patterns which result in lower procedure volumes.</p><p>In this environment, companies will continue to consolidate. Manufacturers that can acquire product and distribution capacity have the best chance of survival, say the analysts. Inevitably, some manufacturers will be squeezed out of the market.</p><p>In 1994, Stryker acquired its Japanese distributor, Matsumoto Medical Instruments, Biomet purchased Kirschner and Wright Medical Technology snapped up implant manufacturer Orthomet after the latter failed in its attempt for Kirschner. Wright has been busy working to build up a full orthopaedic product line.</p><p>geographical markets</p><p>Opportunities exist in new geographical markets, such as the Far East and Latin America. China may prove to be a large market for orthopaedic products but its needs are very different to Western markets. The potential exists for low-cost implants and equipment of better quality than is provided by the numerous local manufacturers. There is a low incidence of osteoarthritis in China, but the market for trauma products is considered large.</p><p>Zimmer has set up a subsidiary in China which will distribute a range of implants, Linvatec arthroscopy equipment, Hall Surgical powered surgical equipment and Zimmer Patient Care woundcare and softgoods. In addition, the company is investing in R&D for products designed specifically for China.</p><pre>Orthopaedic Market Share 1994 Zimmer 19% Howmedica 13% Smith & Nephew 13% Stryker 11% DePuy 10% Sulzer 8% Biomet 7% Others 19% Source: Clinica</pre><p>technology trends</p><p>Technological developments are likely to enhance existing implants through increased cost-effectiveness and improved patient outcomes. Products that offer the flexibility to be used for a number of applications (such as a single knee product that can be used for a variety of knee problems) may be one development, according to Lehman Brothers. Opportunities also exist for simpler instrumentation and minimally-invasive orthopaedic procedures.</p><p>One of the biggest problems with hip and knee replacements in particular has been their tendency to loosen over time. It is estimated that around 15-20% require a revision operation after ten years. This phenomenon is driving research by a number of companies which are addressing the problem in various ways.</p><p>Most major implant manufacturers have developed or are developing redesigned implants with reduced wear characteristics to prolong their life. Some of these new designs were displayed at the AAOS meeting in Orlando (see Clinica No 644, p 15). A major focus for researchers has been to investigate the wear of polyethylene components in articulating surfaces.</p><p>The tiny particles produced by articulation can cause osteolysis, bone dissolution, which may lead to implant failure. New designs increase the contact area between polyethylene components and metal surfaces and utilise modified sterilisation techniques to inhibit degenerative oxidation.</p><p>Other developments aim to prevent implants from working themselves loose by using more flexible materials. Composite hip implants whose stiffness matches more closely the flexibility of bone are under development at several companies. Zimmer is developing a composite polymer/cobalt chrome/titanium hip which is in clinical trials, while AEA Technology and Corin Medical are jointly developing a carbon-fibre reinforced polymer hip which is due to begin preclinical trials.</p><p>Surface treatments offer another approach to designing more flexible, cost-effective implants. Spire (US) has introduced a process that increases bonding between polyethylene components and the bone cement used in many hip and knee implants. This 30-fold increase in bonding strength could reduce implant cost by eliminating the need for metal backing plates and increase the adaptibility of product designs.</p><p>Another area companies are addressing is the need for simpler instrumentation for implant procedures. Some manufacturers have developed a single set of instruments that can be used for other hip or knee products in their range rather than one set of instruments for each product. In some cases this new instrumentation allows surgeons to make several bone cuts from one reference point.</p><p>Minimally-invasive orthopaedic surgery is a potential growth area, according to manufacturers, although its benefits in terms of cost and outcome have yet to be proved. One of the main areas may be spinal surgery in which access is limited and a less intrusive intervention would be desirable. Sofamor Danek is pursuing this area and Wright Medical Technology is also increasing its interest - it has licensed American BioMed's minimally-invasive spinal discectomy system.</p><p>Image-guided spinal surgery which combines MIS with MRI and CT images to guide the surgeon is under investigation. Sofamor has an exclusive worldwide licence to manufacture and distribute systems developed by Surgical Navigation Technologies.</p><p>MIS is also being used in carpal tunnel decompression as an alternative to open surgery. Controversy still surrounds the procedure with some surgeons believing the risk of complications outweighs the quicker recovery time. More than 200,000 carpal tunnel procedures are carried out in the US every year.</p><p>A new approach to fracture repair has been developed by Norian (US). The company has developed a bone mineral substitute material for repairing difficult fractures associated with osteoporosis and other systemic disorders that result in local bone loss. The Norian Skeletal Repair System (SRS) combines a bone graft material with a minimally-invasive delivery method. The material is injected into fracture sites where it hardens to provide a support while new bone grows into the implant. It is on sale in the Netherlands and clinical trials are under way in the US for wrist fractures. US trials for hip repair are planned for 1995.</p><p>A major application is in osteoporosis-related fractures. Figures vary, but there are around 100 million osteoporosis sufferers worldwide. This is expected to double in the next 30 years. There are around 30 million sufferers in the US and there is a high incidence in Japan (estimates start at five million). Osteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.3 million fractures annually in the US:</p><pre>Osteoporosis-related fractures in the US pa 300,000 hip fractures 500,000 vertebral fractures 200,000 wrist fractures 300,000+ others Source: Norian</pre><p>The total treatment cost of osteoporosis-related fractures is estimated at nearly $18,000 million per year and expected to rise to $60,000 million by 2020 due to the increasing elderly population.</p><p>new technologies</p><p>The most exciting future developments in orthopaedics will be based around advances in biotechnology. Key areas in which these advances are taking place are joint regeneration/repair and bone reconstruction. Both technologies will be relatively expensive and the requirement for cost/benefit analysis will lengthen time to market.</p><p>A number of products are under development for bone repair and reconstruction which, rather than just providing a platform for bone growth, actually stimulate growth. The first application for these proteins is the repair of non-union fractures. Around a quarter of the two million fractures that occur in the US every year experience problems with repair. Conventional treatments include bone cement and human bone in the form of autograft or allograft material, while more recent developments are bone graft substitutes and electrical/magnetic stimulation. These treatments vary in efficacy and have their own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Fracture repair is the first area set to benefit from the advances made in recombinant technology. Agents called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which actually promote bone growth, are expected to reach the market by the late 1990s. Many industry observers believe that these will shape the future of trauma. Other applications include spinal fusion and maxillofacial repair.</p><p>The BMP product closest to the market is Creative Biomolecules/Stryker's BMP-7 (OP-1) which is in Phase III trials for tibial non-union fractures. Stryker has invested $40 million in the project over ten years and has rights to bone and joint tissues. Stryker is initiating clinical testing in the US and Europe for additional orthopaedic indications using OP-1. This is mixed with bovine type-1 collagen to form a putty which is surgically placed. In the US, 40,000 non-union fractures per year are thought to be candidates for this treatment.</p><p>Genetics Institute's BMP-2 is in clinical studies around the world for applications ranging from trauma to maxillofacial reconstruction. The US company has formed an agreement with Sofamor Danek for spinal fusion applications of BMP-2, for which Sofamor has North American marketing rights. Other companies involved in BMP projects include BioPharm, which has licensed rights to Hoechst, and Sulzer's Intermedics Orthopaedics subsidiary which has developed a non-recombinant bovine BMP.</p><p>Delivery of bone growth factors and other osteoinductive agents is an integral part of this technology. Carriers under development include natural products such as collagen and demineralised bone and synthetic resorbable polymers. The main requirements for carriers are that they are resorbable, osteoconductive (bone is willing to grow on it), porous and easy for the surgeon to handle.</p><p>The total value of the market for BMP products is estimated at between several hundred million and a billion dollars worldwide.</p><p>cartilage repair</p><p>Advances in biology are also set to impact the joint replacement market. Several companies are developing cartilage cell replacement therapies which repair defects in cartilage caused by disease or injury and could prolong the life of the joint.</p><p><strong>[C#198600234:Genzyme]</strong> Tissue Repair, which was formed when Genzyme acquired BioSurface Technology, has already launched a US service for treatment of cartilage defects in the knee using cultured cartilage. The patient's own cartilage cells are extracted and grown in the laboratory before being surgically reimplanted.</p><p>According to GTR, between 100,000 and 200,000 people a year in the US and Europe are candidates for treatment with cultured cartilage cells in the knee at a cost of $10,000 per patient, valuing the market at some $1-2,000 million. Around 900,000 people in the US incur cartilage injuries every year.</p><p><strong>[C#198800088:Advanced Tissue Sciences]</strong> and Smith & Nephew have formed a joint venture to develop a cartilage replacement product which does not use the patient's own cartilage cells. The advantage of this is that only one intervention is needed and thus total recovery time is shorter. Results from initial studies showed success after six-months follow-up. The first product should be commercially available by 1998.</p><p>Also investigating cartilage and ligament repair technology are LifeCell, which is developing a processed allograft anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) which could be available in around three years, and <strong>[C#198600909:Organogenesis]</strong>, which has a collagen-based product in development for orthopaedic applications.</p><p>Patients over 65, the largest market for arthroplasty, are not likely to benefit greatly from cultured cartilage products. The largest market for this new technology is for patients who are likely to need a further 30 or 40 years' use of their joints. Treatments are expensive and are most likely to be used as an alternative to grafting or reconstructive ACL surgery.</p><p>Detailed cost/benefit data will be required for this technology to determine what value is added by using this technique. This technology is not likely to make much of an impact before 2000.</p>
