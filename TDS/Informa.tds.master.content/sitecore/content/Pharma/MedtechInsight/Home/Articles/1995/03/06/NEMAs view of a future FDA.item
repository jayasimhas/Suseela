<p>A public-private partnership for the US regulation of medical devices is envisaged by the Diagnostic Imaging and Therapy Systems Division of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). In its position paper on FDA reform, the industry group does not go as far as calling for privatisation of all the agency's functions. However, it adds its voice to supporters of a framework similar to that adopted in Europe, with product review and GMP inspections assigned to third party organisations.</p>

<p>A public-private partnership for the US regulation of medical devices is envisaged by the Diagnostic Imaging and Therapy Systems Division of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). In its position paper on FDA reform, the industry group does not go as far as calling for privatisation of all the agency's functions. However, it adds its voice to supporters of a framework similar to that adopted in Europe, with product review and GMP inspections assigned to third party organisations.</p><p>In the short-term, NEMA calls for reallocation of Center for Devices and Radiological Health resources to eliminate the backlog in new product submission review. The average product review time for a 510(k) is estimated by the CDRH at 188 days; for some diagnostic imaging modalities, review times are approaching 500 days, claims NEMA. This situation could be remedied by allocating 37.1% of available resources to each of the product review and enforcement programmes - rather than the 26.7% and 46.5% devoted to these activities respectively in fiscal 1994.</p><p>As an additional means to speed the review process, NEMA recommends that the CDRH reduce the volume of data required to support 510(k) clearances. Further acceptance of manufacturer certification to <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> standards is also advocated: NEMA points to the success of the pilot programme which has resulted in a 50% reduction in review time for certain diagnostic X-ray and CT devices.</p><p>NEMA urges the FDA to eliminate "the Reference List as a mechanism for delaying the review of product submissions". It also advocates a permanent forum for the industry and the CDRH to discuss issues of mutual interest and recommends the re- establishment of the industry-agency group set up two years ago.</p><p>Looking further ahead, NEMA recommends mutual recognition of GMPs between Europe and the US, requiring a single inspection of a manufacturing facility for both regions. In the long-term, NEMA envisages a regulatory system in which the CDRH continues to have enforcement responsibilities but would have oversight of third-party product review and GMP inspections. Independent organisations such as Underwriters Laboratories are considered equipped to carry out this work - along the lines of notified bodies in Europe.</p>
