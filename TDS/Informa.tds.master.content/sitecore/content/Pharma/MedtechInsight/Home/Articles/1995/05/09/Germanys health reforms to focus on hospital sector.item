<p>The hospital sector must be the focus of the third stage of Germany's health reforms, due to be implemented during 1996, believes Health Minister Horst Seehofer. Multi-party discussions on the details of the reform programme have so far excluded hospital representatives, however. The German Hospital Association (DKG) will not be invited to participate in talks with the doctors and Krankenkassen until the end of May, says Arzte Zeitung.</p>

<p>The hospital sector must be the focus of the third stage of Germany's health reforms, due to be implemented during 1996, believes Health Minister Horst Seehofer. Multi-party discussions on the details of the reform programme have so far excluded hospital representatives, however. The German Hospital Association (DKG) will not be invited to participate in talks with the doctors and Krankenkassen until the end of May, says Arzte Zeitung.</p><p>Mr Seehofer made it clear in discussions at the end of April that he wants to see the following changes:</p><p>* If the Lander decline to share in the costs of financing hospitals in the next stage of reform, the Kassen may need to introduce a specific member contribution for inpatient treatment.</p><p>* The hospital funding structure needs to be changed so that the Lander are credited for the investments they have made in the hospital sector. In return, they should be expected to contribute to the cost of services which are not reimbursable by the Krankenkassen.</p><p>* Non-hospital doctors should bear the responsibility for hospital admissions. The Kassen have promised to make data available to the doctors' associations so that they can monitor individual doctors' hospital admission patterns. In each Land the doctors' association is to be responsible for compiling data on referral patterns.</p><p>* Efforts must be made to avoid duplicating diagnostic tests through better communication between the in- and outpatient sectors.</p><p>One of the principal aims of the third stage of the reform programme is to open up hospital-based services to outpatients. Mr Seehofer is convinced that new financing methods for "highly specialised medical procedures" need to be established, so that they can be made more widely available on an outpatient basis. These are defined as procedures which by virtue of their medical or technological nature must take place within a hospital context and which are normally performed by a senior consultant. To this end, the doctors and Krankenkassen should collaborate on the drawing up of a catalogue of such procedures, Mr Seehofer believes.</p><p>However, doctors' representatives doubt that the structural problems which exist at senior consultant level can be solved in this way, Arzte Zeitung says. They consider the current decision-making process between consultant and hospital administration to be too cumbersome. Progress in introducing procedures such as day surgery is being hindered by a lack of appropriately trained doctors.</p><p>Germany's hospital sector is facing a deficit of around DM 1,000 million ($715 million) in 1995, according to DKG president Konrad Regler. The budget for hospital services is forecast to rise only 1.7% (3.5% in east Germany) this year.</p>
