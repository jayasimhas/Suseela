<p>Althin Medical, a Swedish dialysis company with manufacturing facilities in the US, was floated on the Stockholm stock exchange on April 28th. The public share offering, together with a private placement last year, has raised a total of $35 million for the Lund-based company.</p><p>Althin describes itself as "one of the world's few fully- integrated manufacturers of dialysis equipment". With 650 employees worldwide, it also distributes urology, anaesthesia, intensive care and heart surgery products in Europe. The company's Florida plant manufactures hollow fibre membranes for blood management devices, including oxygenators, bioreactors, haemoconcentrators and artificial kidneys. It claims to be the largest producer of haemodialysers in the US and distributes haemodialyser accessories such as extracorporeal bloodlines, transducer protectors, fistula needles and IV administration sets. At its Portland, Oregon, facility, Althin develops haemodialysis delivery systems.</p><p>Althin estimates its 1995 sales at $120 million and profits at $8.0 million. Last year it had profits of $4.1 million. The company expects to grow at around 15% annually and gain a greater share of the world kidney disease market. Althin estimates the total patient population will grow at 8-10% per year. Some 650,000 people worldwide have end-stage kidney disease, including around 200,000 in the US.</p><p>Last December, Althin acquired a new plant in Ronneby, Sweden, for the production of dialysis machines and disposable artificial kidneys for the European market. The company's largest market share is currently in the US. "With the establishment of a plant in Sweden, our goal is to reach the same market share in Europe, the Middle East and Africa," Althin says.</p>
