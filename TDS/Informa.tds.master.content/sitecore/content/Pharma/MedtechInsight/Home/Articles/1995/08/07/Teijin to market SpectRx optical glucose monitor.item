SpectRx, based in Atlanta, Georgia, is responsible for development and manufacture, and for marketing in all other world markets. Terms were not revealed.</p><p>The SpectRx system monitors diabetes by taking measurements in a patient's eye with a low-level, multicoloured light beam. Developed in collaboration with Harvard Medical School and the Georgia Institute of Technology (see Clinica No 578, p 15), it is designed to replace the standard haemoglobin A1c blood test for measuring average blood glucose levels.</p><p>SpectRx is currently developing qualitative, non-invasive diabetes screening technology with Boehringer Mannheim and a non-invasive jaundice screening system with Healthdyne Technologies. It holds 20 patents relating to non-invasive medical technology.</p><p>There are more than six million diabetes sufferers in Japan and up to 120 million worldwide, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Between 10 and 15 million diabetes tests are performed each year in Japan, where men over 40 and women over 35 are tested annually.</p>
