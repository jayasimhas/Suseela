<p>The safety provisions of the European Union's Medical Devices Directive have been called into question. Fundamental doubts were aired in Brussels on July 13th, during the Commission's meeting with Member States.</p><p>Originally scheduled to debate the French breast implant ban, discussions between the Commission and Member States focused almost entirely on safety assurances under the terms of the Directive, rather than on the French ban. Reports of the meeting indicate that the European Commission and Competent Authorities are nervous about how safe breast implants are, even if they meet the Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive.</p><p>Risk-benefit studies, required by the Medical Devices Directive to assess safety aspects and inform customers of residual risks, are normally considered sufficient. Norbert Anselmann, head of the medical devices section at DG III D 2, questioned how risk-benefits can be assessed for non-life-saving devices. Moreover, observers ask whether the French were correct in stating that the Competent Authority has to evaluate the manufacturer's risk/benefit findings and determine whether they have been carried out correctly? Or should Competent Authorities only intervene when something is being done incorrectly by a Notified Body, as the German expert suggested?</p><p>The promise of forthcoming standards added little reassurance. Breast implant standards cannot give a guarantee for a given number of years since they cannot take into account all stresses and strains, said Dr Enda Kenny, a member of the CEN working group on breast implant standards. In reply to a statement by Joseph Putzeys, head of the European Commission industrial affairs unit, DG III, that a standard is needed which presents 100% reliability, Mr Kenny said this would be difficult to provide if the state of the art was inadequate.</p><p>industry concern</p><p>In response to the anxiety amongst the Commission and Competent Authorities, observers say companies must rally together and provide more than the minimum requirements to support the integrity of the Medical Devices Directive. Clinica understands that there is great concern that the basis of self-certification is being questioned before there have even been any adverse events (in terms of the Directive).</p><p>The apparent weakness that has been exposed in the system could be remedied, it has been suggested, by addressing the regulation of elective products. Clinica understands that pressure is mounting to bring together Notified Bodies, Competent Authorities and the Commission to address this specific issue. This would be preferable, one expert told Clinica, to individual Member State action - not only for breast prostheses, but for other elective products.</p>
