<p>Ultrasound manufacturer ATL's fourth-quarter revenues rose 6% compared with the previous year. The company attributes this to its new fourth-generation all-digital system HDI 3000 (see Clinica No 625, p 21) and the mid-range Apogee product line.</p><p>ATL would have reported a small profit in the fourth quarter had it not been for a $1.6 million charge for cutting about 4% of its workforce and a $5 million charge for its patent lawsuit with <strong>[C#199200230:SRI International]</strong>. ATL lost an appeal in January (see Clinica No 636, p 2). Full-year results include a total of $12 million in one-time charges, including costs connected with the Interspec purchase last year.</p><pre>Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 104.65 98.48 (5.80) 4.35 Year 366.15 360.50 (20.20) (3.32) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>reorganisation</p><p>ATL announced the formation of four divisions with worldwide responsibility for operations.
