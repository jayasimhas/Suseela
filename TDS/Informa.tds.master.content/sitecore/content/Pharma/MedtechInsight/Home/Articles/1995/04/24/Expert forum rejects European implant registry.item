<p>Does industry share physician enthusiasm for implant registries? Amanda Maxwell reports from Amsterdam.</p><p>The time is not yet right for discussions aimed at setting up a European medical implant registry. Organisers of the recent second European conference on post-marketing surveillance, held in Amsterdam on April 10th-11th, were disappointed that their objective was not met. Despite the enthusiasm of the medical profession and reports of thriving hospital-based registries, industry is generally opposed to them.</p><p>Standards and regulations manager of Cordis Europa (the Netherlands) John Mathers, said it was an "impossible task". There are too many obstacles. "Who would control, pay for and monitor the registries?" he asked. The manufacturer is already regulated by separate obligations under the medical device Directives, while hospitals and physicians are not. Or as Terry Knapp, managing director and CEO of LipoMatrix, Switzerland, put it: "Manufacturers are charged with accountability, but compliance lies with physicians."</p><p>Harm Jan Roelants, who is involved in running Dutch implant registries, commented that it was too early to set up a European registry. More work needs to be done to expand current registries first, he suggested.</p><p>EUCOMED, the device association that represents manufacturers of active and non-active medical devices, made clear its position ahead of the conference. It is reluctant to support such registries, believing they go beyond European regulatory requirements. IAPM, the international association of medical prostheses manufacturers, is aware of the EUCOMED stance but feels that its members should decide for themselves.</p><p>Companies have their own distinctive vigilance obligations and related costs under the medical device Directives, which differ from what would be needed for post-market surveillance, a EUCOMED letter, sent to the conference organisers on March 13th, points out. There is no requirement for "any type of registration system" for medical devices in the Medical Devices Directive or under quality system standards EN 29001/2 and EN 46001/2. It also states that implant tracking is "not a required element of any post-production review process" and that for some implantable devices where registration has been a mandatory requirement, there was "no demonstrable benefit".</p><p>EUCOMED concludes: "With the exception of certain high-risk devices, ie pacemakers, heart valves and artificial organs, it is not evident what benefits are to be derived from implant registration schemes ... There are technological advances ... such as implant tagging, patient smart cards etc, which will obviate the need for any registration schemes in the near future."</p><p>what about AIMDs?</p><p>But is the active implantable medical device industry as free of registration obligations as EUCOMED believes it to be? Michael Gropp, director of regulatory affairs at Guidant, Belgium, drew delegates' attention to the European draft quality system standard, prEN 50103 (1993), for active medical devices, including active implantables.</p><p>This standard states that "appropriate identification and records should be maintained throughout the production process to ensure traceability. This helps in determining the causes of defective product, and allows other devices that might be subject to a similar failure to be identified". It stresses that a "more extensive traceability system is required for manufacture of active implantable medical devices".</p><p>It also presumes that the customer will actively wish to monitor performance since "recommendations should be provided by the supplier that allow the customer to monitor the performance of the implanted device throughout its life".</p><p>Clinica notes, however, that these requirements will never be mandatory, since all standards are voluntary. (The Directives make no mention of mandatory tracking and registration requirements.) The draft standards should be the subject of close scrutiny by manufacturers, however, who should ask themselves what their legal - as well as financial and administrative - position would be in Europe if a problem was linked to a batch of implants and it was impossible to trace those devices?</p><p>Telectronics (US) is already finding that while it took little time to track 90% of its Accufix J Atrial leads where implant records were kept, it is taking a great deal of time to track the remaining 10% in countries where there are no records.</p><p>support for registries?</p><p>Even if AIMD manufacturers consider these tracking and registration requirements apply to them, many are unwilling to become actively involved in and support the national and international implant data registries. Some prefer to develop their own systems and are reluctant to commit themselves to further financial expense.</p><p>Funding, however, is crucial to the survival of the registries and since, in many cases, there is no obvious and continuous source, the promoters are looking to industry for financial support.</p><p>Given the purchasing implications resulting from the findings of the registries, industry cannot afford totally to ignore them, even if not wishing to become a participant. Perhaps it is time for industry associations IAPM and EUCOMED to organise a joint conference on medical device vigilance and to examine industry's attitude to the registries that are being set up in hospitals across Europe.</p>
