Products developed for neurological applications are increasingly being used in other areas, such as the extension of ultrasonic aspirators to cardiac and orthopaedic surgery. Modular product designs which can be upgraded are becoming a feature. New digital models are replacing analog systems, providing cost savings. The report underlines the need to justify higher priced new technology with outcomes data.</p><p>Copies of the report are available from Clinica Reports, ref CBS 556, price: $1,995 (for US orders)/$2,045 for orders outside the US)/&pound; 1,300.</p>
