<p>Both the US Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) and the US Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA) have welcomed plans by Medicare, the health programme for the elderly, to reimburse certain unapproved medical technologies (see Clinica No 659, p 8). The new rules will be incorporated in the Advanced Medical Device Access Assurance Act of 1995, introduced in the House on June 6th and sponsored by Rep William Thomas and Senator Orrin Hatch.</p>

<p>Both the US Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) and the US Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA) have welcomed plans by Medicare, the health programme for the elderly, to reimburse certain unapproved medical technologies (see Clinica No 659, p 8). The new rules will be incorporated in the Advanced Medical Device Access Assurance Act of 1995, introduced in the House on June 6th and sponsored by Rep William Thomas and Senator Orrin Hatch.</p><p>According to HIMA executive vice-president Ted Mannen: "This is a pro-consumer bill that will restore access to the newest medical technologies at no additional cost to the Medicare programme." MDMA says: "With the passage of this legislation, another bureaucratic hurdle which deters responsible manufacturers from focusing on cost-effective research will be eliminated." HIMA claims that Medicare's refusal to pay for unapproved devices means that since February 1995, over 70 companies have had clinical trials of their products suspended by hospitals.</p>
