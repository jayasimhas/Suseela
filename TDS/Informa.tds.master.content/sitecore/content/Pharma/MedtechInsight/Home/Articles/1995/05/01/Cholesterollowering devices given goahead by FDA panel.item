<p><strong>[C#199500485:Kaneka]</strong> America's Liposorber LA-15 System and B Braun's Heparin Induced Extracorporeal Lipoprotein Precipitation System received conditional recommendations for marketing approval by the US FDA's Gastroenterology and Urology Devices Advisory Panel on April 21st. The panel voted 5-2 and 6-1 in favour of the devices respectively but stipulated that both manufacturers must perform post-marketing studies.</p><p>The products and data supporting their use are similar. Both devices remove low-density lipoprotein from plasma, but while Kaneka's product works by binding LDL-cholesterol to a dextran sulphate matrix, Braun's device involves the precipitation with heparin.</p><p>The target populations are patients who after drug and diet therapy have LDL levels over 300 mg/dl or those with documented coronary heart disease and LDL of 200-300 mg/dl. Data supporting utility were based on uncontrolled studies containing fewer than 65 patients. Treatments were performed every week or two resulting in acute drops in LDL-cholesterol levels of 70-80% which returned to baseline in about seven days. There were no prospective data to show the reduction in cholesterol was sufficient to reduce complications caused by hypercholesterolaemia.</p><p>The panel members stipulated that they were willing to recommend approval without data showing clinical benefit because the target patient populations lacked effective alternative treatments. Members did stipulate that prospective randomised studies would be needed if the companies wanted to expand marketing to less severe patient populations. Dr Borhani, who voted against the approval of Kaneka's device, said: "The company has a moral and scientific obligation to show if intermittent reduction of LDL-cholesterol has any benefit."</p>
