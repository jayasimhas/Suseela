<p>Telectronics Pacing Systems received some unwanted publicity from the US FDA on January 24th, when the agency advised doctors to check their pacemaker patients' lead-wires for possible fracture. The agency warned that fractures in the company's Atrial J lead could result in severe heart injury or death. However, most fractured wires are not medical emergencies, the FDA notes: if one is detected physicians may choose to replace it or monitor by fluoroscopy.</p>

<p>Telectronics Pacing Systems received some unwanted publicity from the US FDA on January 24th, when the agency advised doctors to check their pacemaker patients' lead-wires for possible fracture. The agency warned that fractures in the company's Atrial J lead could result in severe heart injury or death. However, most fractured wires are not medical emergencies, the FDA notes: if one is detected physicians may choose to replace it or monitor by fluoroscopy.</p><p>Telectronics told hospitals to stop implanting the device last November (see Clinica No 632, p 23) and has since recalled 98% of stocks. Last week the company wrote to doctors, asking them to contact affected patients. Telectronics also plans to contact the patients directly. The failure rate of the wires has not been ascertained but preliminary estimates based on the manufacturer's analysis suggest it may be as high as 12%. As of January 14th, 110 confirmed or suspected fractures had been reported. There have been two deaths and seven serious injuries.</p><p>42,000 under the shadow</p><p>The FDA says there are over one million pacemaker patients in the US but Atrial J leads are normally only used with dual-chamber devices. Up to 25,000 US patients may have the suspect leads. Telectronics' Northern Europe marketing manager, Carry Peters, says around 9,200 patients in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, UK and Scandinavia are in a similar position. Some 42,000 leads have been distributed worldwide since their launch in December 1987.</p><p>Telectronics says its independent physician advisory panel is recommending six-monthly fluoroscopic screening rather than X-ray examination. Fluoroscopy detected fractures in 12% of 525 patients, compared with a detection rate of only 1.4% by X-ray. The cause of the lead failure is not yet known.</p><p>Company vice-president Larry Wettlaufer says Telectronics will reimburse patients for the cost of screening and removal where it is not covered by their insurance. However, few patients have so far had leads removed. Indeed Telectronics is not recommending removal of all fractured leads because of the higher risk associated with surgery itself. Instead, it advises that early-stage fractures be monitored.</p><p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that in 1994 Telectronics - a subsidiary of Pacific Dunlop (Australia) - had an 11.3% share of the $1,984 million world bradycardia pacing market.</p>
