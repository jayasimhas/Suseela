<p>Harmonisation of US device approval regulations with those of other countries will be a cautious - and probably slow - process. "I don't see some European approaches as fitting" in the US, FDA Center for Device & Radiological Health Director Bruce Burlington told a HIMA device submissions workshop on July 24th.</p>

<p>Harmonisation of US device approval regulations with those of other countries will be a cautious - and probably slow - process. "I don't see some European approaches as fitting" in the US, FDA Center for Device & Radiological Health Director Bruce Burlington told a HIMA device submissions workshop on July 24th.</p><p>The CDRH is planning a "step-wise approach" involving "agreement on process". So far, the agency seems to have concentrated on preliminaries - nomenclature, principles and standards. Only after many other steps will the agency reach mutual recognition. First, the CDRH will tackle claims structure, product development guidance, post-marketing requirements, applications, the review process and interpretive criteria for clinical evaluation. Similar hurdles must be overcome for product evaluation, product quality systems and adverse event reports.</p><p>Dr Burlington favours the expansion of the global harmonisation task force to include product review - "at least on a pilot" basis (see Clinica No 662, p 7). "I suggest cardiac devices, but am open to suggestions where guidance can be easily prepared." The agency is also planning to "facilitate exchange of premarket assessments" with other countries - with Australia, New Zealand, Israel and South Africa among candidates. As an immediate priority, however, the agency will "particularly emphasise" harmonisation of good manufacturing practice requirements.</p>
