<p>US exports of medical equipment and supplies increased 8% to $9,200 million in 1994, producing a trade surplus of $4,300 million. International demand for US medtech products is projected by the US Department of Commerce to grow at an annual average rate of 12% over the next five years to reach $18,000 million by 2000. While Western Europe will remain the US' largest export market, trade with the major emerging markets in Asia and Latin America is expected to grow 20% annually.</p>

<p>US exports of medical equipment and supplies increased 8% to $9,200 million in 1994, producing a trade surplus of $4,300 million. International demand for US medtech products is projected by the US Department of Commerce to grow at an annual average rate of 12% over the next five years to reach $18,000 million by 2000. While Western Europe will remain the US' largest export market, trade with the major emerging markets in Asia and Latin America is expected to grow 20% annually.</p><p>Electromedical equipment exports accounted for a third of total medtech exports in 1994, says the US Department of Commerce in its US Global Trade Outlook 1995-2000 report. Surgical and medical instruments took the second largest share at $2,500 million.</p><pre>EXPORTS BY PRODUCT CATEGORY 1994 ($'000 MILLION) Electromedical Equipment 3,000 Surgical/Medical Instruments 2,500 Surgical Appliances/Supplies 2,000 X-Ray and irradiation Equipment 1,100 Dental Equipment 500 TOTAL $9,200 MILLION Source: US Department of Commerce</pre><p>Almost 45% - or $3,200 million - of US medical equipment and supplies exports went to Western Europe in 1993. Germany remains the leading European destination for US exports, taking $900 million in 1993 and $1,000 million in 1994.</p><pre>US medtech trade 1993-4 ($'000 millions) Exports Imports Country/region 1994 1993 1994 1993 Japan 1.4 1.2 1.1 1.1 Canada 1.0 1.0 0.2 0.2 Germany 1.0 0.9 1.0 1.1 France 0.6 0.5 0.2 0.3 UK 0.5 0.5 0.3 0.3 Major emerging markets 1.4 1.3 0.8 0.7 Rest of world 3.1 2.9 1.2 1.2 World 9.2 8.3 4.9 4.9 Source: Department of Commerce</pre><p>Recognising strong economic developments in major Asian and Latin American countries, the US medical equipment industry has begun a significant shift away from traditional markets in industrialised countries, notes the Department of Commerce. US exports to the emerging markets are projected to grow 20% per annum from $1,600 million in 1995 to $4,000 million by 2000.</p><pre>US MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TRADE 1993 EXPORTS Western Europe 44% Western Hemisphere 23% Asia 23% Other 10% TOTAL $8,300 MILLION IMPORTS Western Europe 49% Asia 32% Western Hemisphere 13% Other 6% TOTAL $4,900 MILLION Source: US Department of Commerce</pre><p>In 1993, exports of medical equipment and supplies to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan amounted to $360 million, while exports to South Korea reached $187 million. US exports to Chile, Brazil and Argentina have more than doubled in the five years 1989-1993 to reach $267 million.</p><p>Russia has become the 22nd largest export market, just behind Israel, notes the Department of Commerce. Russia accounted for 84% of the $78 million exports of US medical and dental equipment shipped to the former Soviet republics in 1994: consumption of US supplies by the region grew 45% compared with 1993. Declining exchange rates will mask an increase in the volume of exports to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, says the report. Nevertheless, it forecasts that Russia will become one of the top 15 markets for US medical equipment in the next few years.</p><p>Within Central Europe, Poland represents the largest export market, accounting for $20.4 million or 35% of total 1994 shipments of $59 million, followed by the Czech Republic, which saw US imports grow 66% to $13.8 million. Hungary accounted for under $12 million.</p><p>Exports to Japan increased 17% in 1994 to reach $1,400 million compared with $1,200 million the year before. During the same period US imports of Japanese medical equipment remained static at $1,100 million. Ongoing trade talks between the two countries are expected to increase the competitiveness of US products through modifications to the Japanese reimbursement system and government purchasing programme.</p><p>dominance of US industry</p><p>The US industry supplies some 52% of the global medtech market. Of the top 20 companies identified by the report, 13 are US-owned. Prompted by what US companies regard as excessive US regulatory requirements, industry investment overseas has grown significantly. The report points to an escalation of capital investment by US companies from $333 million in 1989 to over $1,000 million in 1992.</p><p>The report cautions that US companies will find it increasingly difficult to gain market share in major developing countries in Asia which are improving their domestic production capabilities of high-tech medical equipment. Furthermore, the US industry faces stiff competition from Japanese companies which have already become established in markets such as China and Korea.</p><p>US output grew 7%</p><p>Production of medical devices and diagnostics by the US industry totalled $52,700 million in 1994, an increase of 7.1%, according to HIMA estimates. Of the total, medical devices accounted for $44,300 million and diagnostics for $8,400 million. Output in the current year is projected to grow 8% to $56,800 million. Investment in R&D in 1994 was 6.8% of sales.</p><p>Consumption of medtech products was up 6.3% at $47,700 million in 1994. The US market for medical devices was $40,300 million, with diagnostics representing the remaining $7,400 million. A 7% growth to $51,300 million is projected for the US medtech market in 1995.</p>
