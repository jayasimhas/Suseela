<p>Simon Booth has high hopes for GU Medical Systems. Since his appointment as managing director of the UK medical instruments company earlier this year, he has changed the company's name from GU Manufacturing and embarked on a restructuring programme. His brief from the Dublin-based industrial holding company, DCC, is to raise the all-round performance of GU, rationalise its product range and build on the company's 75-year reputation in cardiovascular instruments and general medical telescopes.</p>

<p>Simon Booth has high hopes for GU Medical Systems. Since his appointment as managing director of the UK medical instruments company earlier this year, he has changed the company's name from GU Manufacturing and embarked on a restructuring programme. His brief from the Dublin-based industrial holding company, DCC, is to raise the all-round performance of GU, rationalise its product range and build on the company's 75-year reputation in cardiovascular instruments and general medical telescopes.</p><p>GU's turnover has hovered around &pound;2.5 million ($4 million) in the 1990s, led by the minimally invasive surgical product range. In order to turn around the lacklustre performance of the past few years, Mr Booth has set four main objectives for GU: to increase market share in key product areas; to listen and respond to customer needs; to develop new products; and to speed up operations. In order to address these objectives, the new-look GU Medical Systems workforce of 37 has been streamlined to incorporate three departments: customer care; sales; and manufacturing.</p><p>Some 61% of turnover is generated by UK product sales, with exports accounting for 12%, service and repair activities for 19% and distributor and other sales 8%. The company has strengthened its position in the UK MIS market with the launch of the Balance range of surgical instruments this year (see Clinica No 646, p 20). GU aims to increase its share of this sector from around 5% to 10-15% through the introduction of follow-up products to the Balance laparoscopic range. This is a main focus of R&D activities on which 10% of turnover is devoted. Substantial product development is also under way in the diathermy area - a sector in which the company has a strong reputation.</p><p>Described as a "revolutionary piece of equipment", the QE2000 electrosurgical unit has been developed with Nuvotek of Leeds. The system eliminates the use of patient plates and associated burns, as well as removing any likelihood of capacitive coupling and interference with ancillary equipment such as cameras.</p><p>From its UK headquarters in Park Royal, London, GU plans to widen its horizons to encompass more export markets. Product sales in the domestic market are targeted by a salesforce which has been expanded to cover the whole country. Elsewhere, Simon Booth is looking to improve exports to the Middle East, Africa, India, Asia and China. North America has also been identified as a potential export market. Product sales growth will be through OEM or distributor sales.</p><p>Believed to be the only British scope manufacturer which produces every single component, GU claims that its operations comprise "one of Britain's finest lens manufacturing units" - an activity set to expand further. The company is also proud of its repairs operation covering telescopes and electromedical equipment, used by customers worldwide. In fiscal 1995, telescope repairs hit a record high of over &pound;200,000. Repairs to instruments and EME are generating &pound;100,000 annually.</p><p>The changes already implemented at GU are expected to rewards immediately. Simon Booth is looking for annual revenue growth of 30-35% for the next three years.</p><p>Industrial holding company DCC has interests in food, services to the computer industry, energy and healthcare. It reported profits of IR&pound;25.9 million ($42 million) in the year ended March 31st, 1995, an increase of 21.3%, on revenues of IR&pound;404.7 million, up 20.6%. The group's healthcare operations showed an operating profit of IR&pound;2.3 million, up 37.8% on fiscal 1994, on a turnover of IR&pound;29.2 million. The directors' report notes that GU showed a small improvement over the previous year and finished the year strongly.</p>
