<p>Low-risk MI patients can be sent home safely after only three days, without admission to intensive care and with no need for non-invasive testing, according to PAMI-2 (Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction). The study also found that intra-aortic balloon-pump treatment significantly reduced ischaemic events and chest pain in high-risk cases. However, it did not reduce overall mortality.</p><p>Patient classification based on catheterisation data could cut the cost of acute cardiac care by a third, said principal investigator Dr Cindy Grines of William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan, who presented the trial data at the American College of Cardiology annual meeting (New Orleans, March 19th-22nd).</p><p>Although PAMI-2 did not compare angioplasty with thrombolysis, Dr Grines said the new data add cost-effectiveness to the growing body of evidence in angioplasty's favour. Preliminary figures from Beaumont and the Moses H Cone Memorial Hospital, Greensboro, North Carolina, were $12,600 for treatment in a cardiac care unit (CCU) and $8,500 for those patients sent, instead, to a stepdown unit.</p><p>"Early discharge is safe, feasible and cost-effective," said Dr Grines. The typical hospital stay for a heart attack patient is seven days, including two to three in a CCU. Dr Grines also said the results of the five-nation, 32-centre study refutes the accusation that only high-volume centres should attempt primary angioplasty (performed as a first line of treatment, without thrombolytics). Mortality for the stepdown patients was 0.4%, about the same as elective angioplasty. Mortality in the high-risk group was 5.5%.</p><p>Risk stratification procedure</p><p>"Once high risk is identified, then patients do need a more aggressive revascularisation strategy. It would make perfect sense that these patients should be stratified in the catheterisation laboratories. The majority of deaths occur within the first 48 hours of infarction, so there appears little rationale for non-invasive risk stratification prior to hospital discharge," said Dr Grines.</p><p>The PAMI-2 study also looked at the effect of intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABPs) in high-risk MI patients. IABP treatment significantly reduced in-hospital ischaemic events, the need for re-angiography and PTCA of the infarct-related artery but did not reduce death, recurrent MI or re-occlusion. It did not increase vascular complications, sepsis or the need for transfusion.</p><p>LV function data are not yet available but discharge left ventriculogram and one-month radionuclide images indicate that pumping may remodel the ventricle or improve ejection fraction, according to Dr Grines. "We are not 100% sure of the role of the intra-aortic balloon pump. The fact that it did not <strong>[C#198700592:alter]</strong> the endpoints of reinfarction and death might be attributed to the fact that acute catheterisation and angioplasty were so highly effective that these `high-risk' patients were not converted into a low-risk cohort - unlikely to show additional benefit form a device such as the IABP," Dr Grines told Clinica.</p><p>To outside observers, the supporters of primary angioplasty and thrombolytics often seem like zealots. Dr Grines has undergone something of a conversion. Having started out as a confirmed fan of t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator, a thrombolytic), she now says PTCA is superior to thrombolytics because doctors can quickly identify and treat the cause of an MI. "With thrombolytics, you give the drugs and sit there with your fingers crossed, hoping it will work."</p><p>The first PAMI trial, also led by Dr Grines and presented at the 1992 AHA New Orleans meeting, found that patients treated by primary angioplasty were less likely to die or have a serious cardiac event and had fewer intracranial bleeds than those who received t-PA thrombolysis. However cardiologists have been reticent to take up primary angioplasty, saying the benefits are modest and do not justify the cost of making it universally available.</p><p>Most thrombolysis data come, not surprisingly from pharmaceutical company-sponsored registries, which tend to focus on high-use sites. "Almost none of the PAMI centres is involved in the Genentec t-PA registry," said Dr Grines, who hopes the PAMI-2 data will change a few minds.</p><p>Only 20% of US hospitals have catheterisation laboratories and not all perform emergency angioplasty. However, 80% of the US population lives within an hour of such a facility. Some 94% of angioplasty centres offer 24 hour on-call coverage but many choose to offer primary angioplasty during the working day and thrombolysis overnight.</p><p>The results of GUSTO-2, which compares primary angioplasty to front-loaded t-PA, are due to be reported at the American Heart Association Meeting in November. However, there have been problems recruiting patients to the unstable angina arm of the study.</p>
