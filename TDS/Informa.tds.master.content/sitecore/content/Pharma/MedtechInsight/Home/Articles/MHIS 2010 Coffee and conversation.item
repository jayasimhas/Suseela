<p> <p><em><strong>Words and photos: Salina Christmas</strong><br> 6 October 2010</em></p> <p><a></a></p> <p>What better time to exchange ideas, and contact numbers, than during coffee breaks? In between panel discussions, delegates took the opportunity to survey the sponsor booths and to also discuss the presentations. As usual, the coffee machine got <em>Clinica</em> buzzing again.Open Surgery followers would have read our commentary on <a>the coffee machine at the lobby of GE Healthcare office</a> (<em>The aesthetics of interface, Clinica.co.uk, 23 March 2010</em>) in Hertfordshire. The coffee machine at the Radisson Blu hotel was not as baffling as the multi-buttoned model at GE Healthcare. But it was over that Swiss-made machine at the summit that <em>Clinica</em> first had a conversation with Fabio Sergio, Executive Creative Director, Frog Design. He was there to give a presentation on best practices for ongoing product development for m-health device. </p> <p>Sergio, an architect by training and also a design academic, explained: &ldquo;The user gets confused with the way the machine works because there is a disconnect between how he perceive a cup of coffee should be made, and how he perceive the machine should work.&rdquo; The design comes with an assumption about the user&rsquo;s level of literacy in using a coffee machine. This is, of course, a very low-level example of technological determinism, which we hope will not be applied to the design of m-health devices. </p>  <tr> <td><div></div></td> <td><div></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>It takes some of the delegates a few minutes to figure out how to work this Swiss-made coffee machine. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><div></div></td> <td><div></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Left:</strong> The Harley Street World team talks to the delegates. <strong>Right:</strong> A hotel staff looks on as Jason Goldberg, CEO, Ideal Life, chats to Roland da Silva, VP, CSMG. </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>More networking during coffee breaks. </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Left:</strong> Eric Leven, Director, Riproad, works the room. <strong>Right:</strong> Dr Adesina Illuyemi, NEDAP, exchanges ideas with Nils Masgard, CEO, iDoc. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Reportage: Salina Christmas </em></td> <td><escenic_non_breaking_space></escenic_non_breaking_space></td> </tr>  <p><escenic_non_breaking_space></escenic_non_breaking_space></p>  <tr> <td><div></div></td> <td><div></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Left:</strong> Desserts are a hit with the delegates. <strong>Right:</strong> Sara Khalid, DPhil candidate, Biomedical Engineering, Oxford University, with a colleague. </td> </tr> <tr> <td><div></div></td> <td><div></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Left:</strong> Robert Istepanian, Director, MINT, Kingston University, UK, in conversation with colleagues. <strong>Right:</strong> Fabio Sergio, Executive Creative Director, Frog Design, provides <em>Clinica</em> with an interesting insight on product design. </td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>People socialise and interact around coffee, and its associated objects.
