<p>EUCOMED, the European Confederation of Medical Supplies Associations, is preparing a list of proposed amendments in the light of the draft IVD-MD Directive. These include a change to the proposed amendment to the Medical Devices Directive (Article 19) to include viable human and animal tissues.</p><p>EUCOMED would like to see the two previous medical device Directives improved to reflect the IVD-MD's more rational approach to registration (Article 10) and the use of languages (Article 4.3).</p><p>The Association also hopes for clarification of the terms "placing on the market" and "putting into service" and for guidance on the difference between maintenance and refurbishment.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of EUCOMED, technical director Vicky Dedrick said she did not expect Article 19 to slow down the progress of the Directive, as other experts have suggested.</p>
