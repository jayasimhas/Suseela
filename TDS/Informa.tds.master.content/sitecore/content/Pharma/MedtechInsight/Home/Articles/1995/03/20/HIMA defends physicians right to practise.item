<p>The biggest barrier to medical technology access and information in the US, the Health Industry Manufacturers Association seems to believe, is the FDA. HIMA senior vice-president - and former FDA CDRH chief - Jim Benson told the US Pharmacopoeia on March 9th: "The FDA is usurping the judgement of physicians and substituting its own judgement on therapeutic practices."</p><p>The agency, Mr Benson continued, "has no authority to regulate the practice of medicine and therefore, is not in a position to clear procedures". Nevertheless, the FDA is accused of attempting to do just that - regulate the safety and effectiveness of therapies, not just the devices involved.</p><p>"The FDA cannot keep up with advances in the practice of medicine. Despite what is generally a conscientious and competent staff, the FDA simply does not have the resources to assess each procedure in which a medical device is used in a timely manner. To require [agency approval of] each and every procedure that falls within a general purpose clearance before information can be disseminated about the use of the device in the procedure would dictate medical process by an onerous approval system."</p><p>In the US, much of the information on state-of-the-art medical practice is provided by manufacturers to the medical community. Devices are constantly undergoing incremental improvements based on the continual feedback manufacturers receive from physicians. Preventing manufacturers from informing the medical community about these advances could "push back medical advancements [and] deprive patients of access to new procedures and life-saving technologies", claims HIMA.</p><p>Moreover, while the FDA can control manufacturers' claims in official product labelling, Mr Benson continued, the agency "has no general regulatory authority over device educational activities that are not labelling or restricted-device advertising".</p><p>WLF case</p><p>A lawsuit filed last summer by the Washington Legal Foundation (see Clinica No 631, p 7) could bring a solution. The WLF is seeking to overturn agency policies that restrict manufacturers from disseminating scientific information on off-label uses. "Clearly," Mr Benson said, "the time has come for the FDA to clarify its policies on off-label uses."</p><p>A US judge has turned down the FDA's request to dismiss the WLF's lawsuit. The agency argued that its draft policy is not ready for judicial review as it has not yet been finalised. It is still considering the WLF's objections and it is unclear when a final policy will emerge. The deadline for submission of comments to the FDA on questions raised by the WLF in its citizens petition expired last month.</p>
