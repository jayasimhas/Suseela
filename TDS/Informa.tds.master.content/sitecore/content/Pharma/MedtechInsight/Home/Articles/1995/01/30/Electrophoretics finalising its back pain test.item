<p>UK-based start-up company Electrophoretics International says development of its diagnostic test for chronic back pain is being finalised and licensing negotiations are about to begin. The test is based on Electrophoretics' identification of a blood protein marker that is elevated by peripheral nerve damage associated with chronic spinal pain.</p><p>Managing director Christopher Pearce says the company intends to remain entirely research-oriented and to fund future projects through royalty payments. The London-based company uses research facilities in the US and Switzerland. Its discovery was made using two-dimensional electrophoresis, a highly accurate but difficult-to-use technology, which Mr Pearce says few people outside academic institutions tend to use. Future investigation is to be targeted at markers for neurological diseases and cancers.</p><p>Electrophoretics was founded in 1984 and registered its current name last summer when &pound;2 million ($3 million) was invested in the company by financial institutions. Last December, it joined the London Stock Exchange, trading under Rule 4.2 on a matched-bargain basis. It is capitalised at around &pound;27 million. Electrophoretics wants either to progress to a full listing or to one on the Alternative Investment Market which is to be set up in London later this year.</p>
