<p>Swedish company Biora's Emdogain has obtained the CE marking as a Medical Devices Directive Class III device for periodontal regeneration. One of the first such products to be regulated under the Directive, Emdogain made its European debut last week.</p><p>Intended as an adjunct to surgery to provide for periodontal regeneration in patients suffering from loss of attachment due to periodontal disease or trauma, Emdogain is an enamel matrix derivative isolated by researchers at the Karolinska Institute. Applied topically as a gel, it creates a suitable root surface for selective periodontal cell migration and attachment. Emdogain breaks down during the normal wound healing process.</p><p>Emdogain has been shown to be effective in sites with periodontal pockets of more than 6 mm associated with vertical bone loss on radiograph greater than 3 mm. It has also shown efficacy with furcation involvements over 2 mm but not through-and-through defects.</p><p>Data from Swedish and US trials involving 300 patients showed that following formation of new attachment, aveolar bone was regenerated. In Emdogain-treated patients the attachment gains were significantly better than in controls: after 16 months bone restoration was two-thirds the normal level. Three-year follow-up showed a further improvement with 70% of the lost attachment recovered.</p><p>Biora stresses that wound stability is critical to the outcome of the regeneration procedure. If the link between the root surface and the healing connective tissue is broken, clinical failure will result. "Site-specific anatomy, surgical management, wound stabilisation during healing and post-surgical oral hygiene are critical factors for success," according to Emdogain's pack insert.</p><p>regulated as device worldwide</p><p>Emdogain received approval as a medical device from the Scandinavian Institute for Dental Materials late last year - prior to the effective date of the Medical Devices Directive. The product was launched on the Swedish market in January but, with certification from UK Notified Body BSI in April, Biora now has Europe-wide approval. The Malmo-based company has established its own marketing and sales organisation for the Nordic countries and Benelux. It will market the product through distributors elsewhere; a UK agreement is being negotiated, Biora's Tomas Hammargren told Clinica.</p><p>A PMA was filed with the US FDA in July 1993 and approval could be granted early next year, says Mr Hammargren. He expects the device to be reviewed by an agency advisory panel later this year. The Japanese regulatory authority, Koseisho, has confirmed that Emdogain will be classified as a device and an application is expected to be filed in late August. It should be on the Japanese market by autumn next year.</p><p>In 1994, some 5 million periodontal procedures were carried out worldwide, of which 2 million were performed in the US. The European market - where 1.2 million procedures were conducted in 1994 - is growing at a faster rate, believes Biora. Similarly, Japan, which accounted for 0.6 million procedures, is expected to register rapid growth. Emdogain costs SKr 1,050 ($140) in Sweden - one product is sufficient for one surgical procedure involving up to four teeth. Biora believes that Emdogain will be used in 25% of all surgical procedures within three years of launch in each market.</p><p>device vs drug</p><p>The implementation of the Medical Devices Directive on January 1st, 1995, means that biologically active dental materials should now be regulated as devices in Europe. This marks a departure from previous law in Germany, for example, where many dental products were regulated as pharmaceuticals. However, as Germany has yet to publish guidance on the Directive (see this issue, page 5), there is still some confusion in the marketplace. Debate among German dental product manufacturers on CE marking a year ago highlighted grey areas where ambiguity might occur over whether certain products should be regulated as pharmaceuticals or devices (see Clinica No 580, pp 8-9).</p><p>Mr Hammargren draws a parallel between Emdogain and Healon (hyaluronic acid) which is being reclassified as an ophthalmic device in Europe under the Medical Devices Directive. It is also considered a device in the US.</p><p>Biora believes that Emdogain represents an advance over the currently used guided tissue regeneration techniques provided by such companies as Gore (US) and Guidor (Sweden). In GTR surgery, which is widely used in the US, polymeric membranes are attached to the treated dental root. The ability of this technique to generate new tissues has been called into question, according to Biora, and it has been suggested that repair might be a more accurate term than regeneration. Biora contends that: "Emdogain can be used without membranes but membranes should not be used without Emdogain."</p>
