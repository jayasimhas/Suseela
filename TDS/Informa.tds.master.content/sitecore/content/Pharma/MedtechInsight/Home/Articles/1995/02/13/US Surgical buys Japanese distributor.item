<p>US Surgical is purchasing its Japanese distributor for $61 million to gain "greater control" in the expansion of its business in Japan, says the Connecticut-based MIS manufacturer. Payment involves $10 million in cash and the balance paid over seven years interest-free. The deal is expected to be completed by April 1st. The distributor's turnover is given as $100 million and US Surgical says the purchase will add more than $50 million in incremental revenue during the first full year of operations.</p><p>This purchase has led to a one-time charge in US Surgical's fourth quarter. Sales were reduced by $17 million for the reacquisition of inventory. Fourth-quarter sales were down 7% to $226.5 million and in the whole of 1994 fell 11% to $918.7 million. Net income for the year was $19 million after a $139 million loss in 1993 resulting from a restructuring programme. Fourth-quarter net income was $6 million, up from a $138 million loss a year earlier. Chairman Leon Hirsch described the year as "very good financially", highlighting that the debt-to-equity ratio was reduced from 114% to 38%.</p>
