<p>Substantial rewards are on offer for medical device companies prepared to employ a coherent long-term strategy to penetrate Indonesia's complex medical equipment market. A country whose economy has been growing at an annual rate of over 6% for the last 25 years and which is forecast by the World Bank to achieve middle-income status by the end of the decade, Indonesia has been unjustly neglected by the international healthcare industry. Companies should not be deterred by the difficulties of doing business in such a vast country, but should take advantage of Indonesia's huge potential, urged David Shaw, a Jakarta-based healthcare consultant, speaking at a recent UK Department of Trade and Industry seminar.

<p>Substantial rewards are on offer for medical device companies prepared to employ a coherent long-term strategy to penetrate Indonesia's complex medical equipment market. A country whose economy has been growing at an annual rate of over 6% for the last 25 years and which is forecast by the World Bank to achieve middle-income status by the end of the decade, Indonesia has been unjustly neglected by the international healthcare industry. Companies should not be deterred by the difficulties of doing business in such a vast country, but should take advantage of Indonesia's huge potential, urged David Shaw, a Jakarta-based healthcare consultant, speaking at a recent UK Department of Trade and Industry seminar. Liz Kicks reports.</p><p>At present Indonesia spends only 2% of GDP on healthcare, amounting to a per capita figure of no more than $13 per year. However, this is set to increase quickly as the government seeks to meet the rising expectations of the population and as overseas investors arrive to tap into the nation's growing prosperity. As in other Southeast Asian countries, government policy on foreign investment and trade restrictions is rapidly changing in Indonesia, Mr Shaw said. A radical deregulation package covering overseas investment was introduced in 1994 and a trade deregulation package is expected to follow shortly.</p><p>It is vital to keep in mind the sheer size of Indonesia when formulating a plan for market entry, according to Mr Shaw. The distance from Medan in the west of Sumatra to Jayapura, the main centre of Irian Jaya in the east, is further than from London to Cairo. The population - approximately 194 million in 1994 - is projected to exceed 250 million by 2000. This makes Indonesia the fourth most populous country in the world. While most companies choose initially to concentrate on Jakarta and the island of Java, it is important to recognise that the 26 regional capitals also have expanding economies with excellent market potential, Mr Shaw stressed.</p><p>A major constraint on the speed of development in the healthcare sector is the availability of government funding as Indonesia strives to keep its debt service ratio under control. However, there is strong and increasing competition between Western nations and financial institutions to offer attractive loans and financing packages, particularly as Indonesia's economy is seen as well-managed and the country has a sound track record in debt repayment. As the economy continues to expand - 1994 growth is forecast at 6.7-7.0% - the country will cease to be so dependent on overseas loans to finance healthcare infrastructure development, and market growth should become that much greater, Mr Shaw believes.</p><p>private sector growth</p><p>Growth in the private hospital sector has outstripped government sector development over the last five years. However, there is a major programme under the current five-year plan to upgrade state-owned hospitals to a higher category, particularly from grade B (600+ beds) to grade A (1,000+ beds). A substantial proportion of the current expansion in the healthcare market derives from this upgrading programme. Indonesia has only five grade A hospitals and, of these, no more than three can be considered of international standard, according to Mr Shaw.</p><p>Examples of current projects in the government sector include:</p><p>* French grant/soft loan to supply basic X-ray units to 63 hospitals throughout Indonesia as well as five cobalt radiotherapy units.</p><p>* Austrian soft loan to equip radiology departments in two Java hospitals.</p><p>* A range of equipment for specialist hospitals including the National Heart Centre (Harapan Kita) and the Cancer Centre (Dharmis) is being financed by several charitable foundations, in particular the president's own fund (Banpres).</p><pre>Indonesia - Government Hospitals 1994 Class A (1,000+ beds) 5 Class B (600+ beds) 63 Class C (300+ beds) 171 Class D (100+ beds) 131 Class E (specialist) 105 Source: Ministry of Health</pre><pre>Indonesia - Government Hospitals by Region 1994* Sumatra 88 Java & Bali 142 Nusa Tenggara 28 Kalimantan 42 Sulawesi 50 Maluku & Irian Jaya 20 * not including specialist hospitals Source: Ministry of Health</pre><p>Priority healthcare project proposals for 1994/95 issued to the international financial community by Indonesia's Ministry of Planning include the following:* Improving the X-ray diagnostic facilities in Class C and D hospitals - project cost $22 million;</p><p>* Development of respiratory emergency centre in Persahabatan - project cost $12.3 million;</p><p>* Development of emergency services for Hasan Sadikin Hospital - project cost $40 million.</p><p>With the relaxation of controls on foreign investment, the number of private sector hospitals in Indonesia has trebled in the last five years. The Ministry of Health has stated that 40,000 extra beds will be needed over the next five years - most of these are expected to come from the private sector.</p><pre>Indonesia - Private Hospitals 1994 Increase Hospitals Beds vs 1989 General hospital 350 35,165 53% Maternity hospital 74 3,358 68% Maternity home 603 11,039 60% Specialist hospital* 86 5,164 309% Specialist clinic 7 131 75% * eg leprosy, cancer, ophthalmology, psychiatry Source: DTI</pre><pre>Indonesia - New Hospital Projects Hospital Location Lippo Gleneagles Hospital Tangerang Lippo City Hospital Cikarang Lippo Group Cempaka Putih Lippo Group Kelapa Gading Lippo Group Royal Sentul Highlands Gleneagles Hospital & Bank Umum Nasional Medan Pantai Kapuk Hospital Jakarta Kota Baru Hospital Kemayoran Kiputih Hospital Bandung Trauma Centre Surabaya Diagnostic Centre Surabaya Nahla Hospital Kuningan Siti Aminah Clinic Jakarta (upgrade) Source: DTI</pre><p>major players</p><p>There has been a rapid decline in the volume of Dutch medical equipment purchased by Indonesian hospitals, despite the fact that many Indonesian doctors still train in the Netherlands, the former colonial power in Indonesia. German companies, on the other hand, have been extremely successful in penetrating the Indonesian equipment market, according to Mr Shaw. In the field of medical electronics, for example, GE has lost approximately 50% of its market share to Siemens in recent years, he said.</p><p>Major distributors of medical equipment in Indonesia include:</p><pre>Government Sector Private Sector Rifa Jaya (Shimadzu) Enseval Putria (Picker) Tiara Kencana Bersaudara (Aloka) Bhineka Usada Raya (Hitachi) Murti Indah (Toshiba) Rajawali Nusindo (GE/Trophy) Karindo (GE) Menjangan (Acuson) Andini Sarana Dian Graha (Siemens) * Thermal is the main agent serving military hospitals in Indonesia.</pre><p>While opportunistic sales may always be made in a booming market, it is unlikely that continuous sustained business can be achieved in Indonesia without permanent local representation, Mr Shaw emphasised. Companies which opt to cover the Indonesian market from elsewhere in the region (eg Singapore or Hong Kong) will not achieve the same success as their competitors with good local representatives, who speak Bahasa Indonesian and are familiar with the market.</p><p>Bob Manning and Jonathan Spencer, at the DTI's Indonesia Desk, can be contacted on 071 215 4738/5086.
