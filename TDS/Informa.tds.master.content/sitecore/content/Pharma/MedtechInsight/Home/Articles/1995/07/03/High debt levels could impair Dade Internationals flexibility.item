<p>Diagnostics company Dade International concedes that it is at a disadvantage compared with those competitors which operate on a less leveraged basis. Much of Dade's cash flow will be needed to service debt rather than being available for other purposes. The company emerged from a buy-out of Baxter's diagnostics operations last year with debts of around $310 million, 4.7 times its $66 million equity.</p>

<p>Diagnostics company Dade International concedes that it is at a disadvantage compared with those competitors which operate on a less leveraged basis. Much of Dade's cash flow will be needed to service debt rather than being available for other purposes. The company emerged from a buy-out of Baxter's diagnostics operations last year with debts of around $310 million, 4.7 times its $66 million equity.</p><p>The final acquisition price of the complex deal has not been disclosed but a Dade spokesman said it was below $400 million. Details of the company's operations have become available for the first time, showing that turnover declined 3% last year compared with 1993.</p><p>The purchase was completed on December 20th, 1994, when the diagnostics business became Dade International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diagnostics Holding, the acquisition vehicle. The latter is two-thirds held by Bain Capital and one-third by GS Capital Partners, an affiliate of the Goldman Sachs Group. To part finance the purchase, Dade issued $120 million worth of public debt.</p><p>As part of the deal, Baxter's US distribution division has exclusive rights until 2000 to distribute all of Dade's current products and certain products under development in the US. Baxter has an option to terminate the agreement after four years, while Dade can terminate it any time after 18 months have elapsed.</p><p>results</p><p>The business had sales of $670 million last year after $670 million a year earlier. Dade blames the decline mainly on Baxter's termination of an instrument supplier relationship in the US and, to a lesser extent, delayed capital expenditure in hospitals. The company depends heavily on the US, where it generated 70% of 1994 turnover, with 17% achieved in Europe and 13% in the rest of the world. Dade says that in 1994 its predecessor lost sales in the Stratus product line, primarily from its non-cardiac reagents products. Net income was $16 million after a net loss of $2 million in 1993 caused by a $30 million restructuring charge.</p><p>Excluding the turnover of two companies that are to be divested this year, first-quarter sales in 1995 were $142 million compared with $155 million a year earlier. Adjusted for these divestments, first-quarter sales would have been flat compared with last year, according to Dade. The company adds: "Increased sales in the Dade Hemostasis and Paramax product lines and strong international MicroScan sales growth were offset by price reductions implemented for the Stratus non-cardiac products and the loss of a portion of Dade Controls' OEM business." The business showed a $19 million net loss in the first quarter compared with a net income of $8 million a year earlier.</p><p>The two businesses up for sale are Burdick & Jackson, a manufacturer of high-purity solvents for chromatography and spectrophotometry, and Bartels, a producer of viral tests and reagents. Dade has estimated proceeds from the sale of these operations and excess land at $73 million, funds that will be used to repay debt. The two companies had combined sales of just over $34 million in 1994.</p><p>market share</p><p>One of the top ten diagnostics companies in the world, Dade says it addresses a $5,000 million segment of the total $12,600 million global IVD market. It claims a 14% market share in this sector with a leading position in three product categories - Dade Hemostasis in the haemostasis market, MicroScan in a niche of the automated microbiology market and Dade Controls in the controls market. The company has around 10,000 systems installed. About 84% of its 1994 sales were from reagents and consumables, 11% from instrument platforms and the rest from services. Some 60% of its revenues were derived from "closed" systems designed so that reagents and consumables can only be used on the instruments for which they were produced.</p><pre>Dade's product lines and estimated market size ($ millions) 1994 1993 sales Estimated world market Dade Hemostasis 131 320 Controls 47 220 Immunohaematology 34 - MicroScan microbiology 122 900 Stratus immunochemistry 121 4,100; Dade competes in a segment worth 1,900, of which: 630 thyroid dysfunction 420 cancer detection 370 drug treatment efficacy 220 MI diagnosis 170 screening for anaemia 140 screening for pregnancy Paramax clinical 5,300 in total, of which: chemistry 104 890 US mid-range Other product lines 111 670</pre><p>Dade's haemostasis systems are "open", meaning that customers can use reagents from a number of producers with instruments manufactured by other vendors. For this reason the company sold third-party instruments in an alliance with Medical Laboratory Automation, its haemostasis instrument supplier, until July last year. Baxter later entered into a supply and distribution agreement with Toa Medical (see Clinica No 641, p 1).</p><p>Dade and Toa finalised their alliance on June 20th. Haemostasis reagents and controls will be marketed under the Dade brand name, while instruments will appear under Toa's Sysmex brand name.</p><p>Another partner of Dade's is Electronic Data Systems with whom Dade Control is creating the LabLink network, an on-line information service linking IVD laboratories worldwide.</p><p>In the haemostasis business, Dade plans to introduce a new instrument for in vitro quantitative measurement of platelet function, reducing testing time and complexity and providing a level of standardisation which current tests lack, the company says. The instrument is designed as a "closed" system. Introduction is expected this year in Europe and in 1996 or 1997 in the US depending on approval progress.</p><p>Apart from haemostasis, Dade intends to focus its R&D on automated microbiology and development of its MicroScan product lines with its "closed" systems. Worldwide, MicroScan has about 3,000 instruments installed, its main systems being the WalkAway-40 and the WalkAway-96. Both are fully automated instruments that use dry reagent panels to conduct bacterial identification and susceptibility testing at the same time.</p><p>Among Dade's weaker sectors in terms of market share is immunochemistry where Stratus has an installed base of around 2,900 "closed" instruments. In the early 1990s, Baxter accelerated placement by providing Stratus instruments free to customers in exchange for ongoing reagent revenues. "This strategy was subsequently pursued by other competitors and is now considered standard industry practice," Dade says.</p><p>Stratus holds a 7% share in the US immunochemistry market, which is led by <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> Laboratories. "Domestic sales of cardiac-related tests represented almost half of Stratus' 1994 revenues," says Dade, highlighting one of the system's strengths. The company expects its alliance with Spectral Diagnostics to provide early access to advances in cardiac testing technologies (see Clinica No 559, p 5).</p>
