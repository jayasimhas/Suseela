<p>South Africa needs a regulatory system for medical devices which is "simply structured, workable and cost-effective", claims the medtech industry. A Medical Devices Agency should be created within the existing Medicines Control Council and should be up and running by January 1st, 1996, with a deadline for conformity to product registration requirements set for December 31st, 1998.</p>

<p>South Africa needs a regulatory system for medical devices which is "simply structured, workable and cost-effective", claims the medtech industry. A Medical Devices Agency should be created within the existing Medicines Control Council and should be up and running by January 1st, 1996, with a deadline for conformity to product registration requirements set for December 31st, 1998.</p><p>Speaking at the recent Healthcare Structure '95 conference in Johannesburg, Kenneth Marcus, vice-chairman of the Medical Devices Division of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of South Africa (SAMED) and managing director of Marcus Medical, urged South Africa's new ANC government to consider adoption of a regulatory system based on that of the European Union. Standards applicable in Australia and Canada could also be considered. Harmonisation of South African legislation with major international markets is vital, he stressed.</p><p>A transitional grandfather clause should be adopted, allowing South African manufacturers and distributors a three-year period to demonstrate that their products conform to an accepted international standard. If a device has been approved by an overseas Competent Authority, it would only need to undergo a simple registration procedure in South Africa, Mr Marcus suggested. He further proposed that a new Medical Devices Agency should move away from a system of individual device registration and adopt a system similar to the UK Manufacturers Registration Scheme.</p><p>Health Minister Dr Nkosazana Zuma confirmed last November that draft regulations on the registration of medical devices are currently in preparation. At present, the Medicines Control Council is theoretically empowered to register devices, but lacks the necessary legal framework to do so. The industry recognises that it may be two or three years "before meaningful device registration is implemented", according to Mr Marcus.</p><p>ANC healthcare plan</p><p>The observations on "appropriate health technology" contained in the ANC's National Health Plan for South Africa published last May (see Clinica No 600, p 11) are likely to translate into the establishment of a National Commission on Health Technology and - possibly - a National Essential Technology List.</p><p>The principal tenets of ANC health technology policy are:</p><p>* the linkage of technology with strategies to develop primary healthcare;</p><p>* the promotion of locally-manufactured equipment and controls on expensive imported items; * controlled allocation of specialised equipment based on need, availability of local expertise, effectiveness, affordability, quality and assurance of adequate maintenance;</p><p>* equitable access to all equipment for every sector of the population.</p><p>The device industry is concerned at the emphasis placed by the ANC on the formation of links with academic and research institutions "to co-ordinate the development of new technology and technological procedures". There is a danger that these bodies "could become the dictator of what should be used or developed in this country", Mr Marcus said. While deploring the "unhealthy" policy of import controls practised in South Africa in the past, he also warned that the trade agreements now being drawn up between South Africa and overseas governments "could hamper the development of a local device industry".</p><p>industry association</p><p>The South African medical device industry has lacked a single representative body since the 1960s. SAMED currently accounts for around 40% of healthcare companies active in the market and has set itself a target of 80% representation by the end of this year. SAMED believes, however, that the structure of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, of which it forms part, should be changed. The body should adopt a more appropriate name, such as The Association of South African Healthcare Industries, Mr Marcus proposed, and have separate representation for the medical device and diagnostic industries, as well as for the prescription and OTC pharmaceutical industries.</p><p>The South African device market is estimated at Rands 1,500 million ($430 million).</p>
