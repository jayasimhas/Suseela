<p>Italian national health service spending on goods and services must be cut by 18% in 1995 compared with 1993 levels, according to the recently approved healthcare bill annexed to the 1995 Finance Law. This is another blow to the healthcare industry - the original proposal had been a 15% cut on the Lit 18,000,000 million ($11,500 million) level of expenditure. In October the government suggested that the budget should be axed by 17% in 1995, 15% in 1996 and 13% in 1997 but the actual levels have turned out to be 18%, 16% and 14% respectively.</p>

<p>Italian national health service spending on goods and services must be cut by 18% in 1995 compared with 1993 levels, according to the recently approved healthcare bill annexed to the 1995 Finance Law. This is another blow to the healthcare industry - the original proposal had been a 15% cut on the Lit 18,000,000 million ($11,500 million) level of expenditure. In October the government suggested that the budget should be axed by 17% in 1995, 15% in 1996 and 13% in 1997 but the actual levels have turned out to be 18%, 16% and 14% respectively.</p><p>The cuts have been heavily criticised by Marco Boni, president of the Regional Associations of Supplies and Economic Affairs (Fare). In a recent article in Il Sole-24 Ore, Mr Boni accuses the government of indiscriminately targeting both efficient and inefficient healthcare services. He believes instead that the tendering system should be used to achieve maximum reductions in prices without compromising quality.</p><p>medical devices under scrutiny</p><p>Included in the cost-cutting measures is a requirement for Regions to set up departments to monitor and control the cost of goods and services, especially "medical-technical equipment", diagnostic materials and pharmaceuticals, and send six-monthly reports to the Health Ministry. Regions will also be expected to introduce centralised purchasing systems, fix reference prices and ensure suppliers are paid within 90 days. The bill notes that local healthcare or hospital services may only be put out to tender or renewed when the directly managed service and its employees have been disbanded.</p><p>Lit 6,300 billion savings</p><p>The government aims to make savings of Lit 6,268,000 million in the national healthcare service this year, through the introduction of long-planned reforms and other cost-cutting measures. This is reflected in the 1995 budget figure. The Regions believe that the government is underestimating its healthcare spending needs for 1995 by some Lit 8,000,000 million. The capital investment budget, has been increased by around Lit 200,000 million in 1995 to Lit 500,000 million. Although an improvement, this is well below the 1986-1992 average level of over Lit 1,600,000 million and will mean there is still little room for investment in high-tech medical equipment.</p><p>The tensions between the government and the Regions over the level of the healthcare budget are heightened by the fact that the Regions are entirely responsible for any overspending this year. Any deficit must be funded through levying healthcare taxes, increasing healthcare contributions or reducing services.</p><p>diagnostic charges</p><p>The rules governing patient payment towards diagnostic procedures have also changed so that a greater percentage of the population will be contributing. The cost of a diagnostic prescription (payable by all) has also risen. The only concession is that the upper payment limit for a related series of tests has been dropped to Lit 70,000, from Lit 100,000 per prescription. The new payment system is as follows:</p><p>* Italians under six (not under 10 as proposed) and over 65 (formerly 60) are exempt from paying the ticket (patient contribution towards diagnostic procedures) unless their "nuclear family" earns more than Lit 70 million gross (rather than Lit 100 million expected).</p><p>* the fixed payment per diagnostic prescription has risen from Lit 4,000 to Lit 6,000, and is graded upwards according to the number of tests being prescribed (requests from doctors for diagnostic procedures are presented on prescription forms in Italy). No more than eight tests may be included on one prescription form and they must be related. This charge also applies to those exempt from the ticket.</p><p>* the payment limit for those not exempt from the ticket has been reduced from Lit 100,000 to Lit 70,000 million.</p><p>Invalids, those with serious illnesses and pregnant women remain exempt from the ticket in most cases.</p>
