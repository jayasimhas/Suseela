<p>Imports of medical equipment account for almost 90% of Chile's estimated $100 million medical device market. Domestic production is limited to a small number of manufacturers focusing on disposables, says a new report published by Medistat. Imports increased by over 50% in 1992, but were flat in 1993 at about $88 million. The earlier rise was due to large demand for X-ray apparatus and medical instruments, says the report.</p>

<p>Imports of medical equipment account for almost 90% of Chile's estimated $100 million medical device market. Domestic production is limited to a small number of manufacturers focusing on disposables, says a new report published by Medistat. Imports increased by over 50% in 1992, but were flat in 1993 at about $88 million. The earlier rise was due to large demand for X-ray apparatus and medical instruments, says the report.</p><p>The medical devices market, as in other countries in Latin America, is dominated by US companies (see Clinica No 652, p 8). Germany and Japan held about 10% each of the overall market in 1993, while the EU held 22.5%. The US is dominant in all the major categories except orthopaedic implants - Switzerland is the main supplier with 39% - and hearing aids - Denmark has a 71% share. The UK supplied 62% of the blood grouping reagents market in 1993.</p><pre>Major medical device imports to Chile 1991-1993 Product Imports($'000) 1991 1992 1993 Syringes, needles & catheters 11,840 13,665 14,457 Other medical instruments 10,844 16,853 18,270 X-ray apparatus 6,898 10,248 11,350 Electro-diagnostic apparatus 5,611 16,679 9,137 (not ECGs) Bandages and dressings 4,555 5,747 5,223 Dental instruments 2,224 3,269 3,234 Ophthalmic instruments 731 1,732 2,151 X-ray tubes, parts & accessories 1,579 2,108 3,162 alpha/ss/gamma ray apparatus 1,469 499 1,016 Orthopaedic implants 1,285 2,186 2,171 Total medical device market 58,873 88,894 88,159 Source: Medistat</pre><p>The health sector has entered a period of rapid expansion and the medical device market is expected to grow 10-15% in 1995, according to the report. However, while the ageing population in Chile and the preponderance of chronic diseases are the hallmarks of a developed healthcare system, Chile still displays traditional problems of developing countries such as poverty in rural areas and extreme regional variations. Infant mortality is 6 per 1,000 live births in some affluent areas yet as high as 40 per 1,000 in poorer regions, compared with Spain (7.8 per 1,000) and the Philippines (47.8 per 1,000).</p><p>health expenditure</p><p>Total expenditure on health in Chile reached an estimated $1,700 million in 1993, representing 3.9% of GDP, according to Medistat. The government, keen to keep public expenditure growth below GDP growth, allocated a 5% increase in the public health budget for 1995. Employees contribute 7% of wages to either a private or public health insurance scheme. Private health insurance is made up of the Institutos Previsionales de Salud (ISAPRES) - 36 insurers which cater for some 20% of the population.</p><p>Public sector health services are provided by the national health services system (SNSS), which comprises 27 centres across the country and serves some 70% of the population. This is supported by the national health fund (FONASA), which provides supplementary low-cost healthcare to employees. In 1991, FONASA carried out around 4 million clinical diagnostic tests and over 100,000 surgical procedures.</p><p>Recent government attempts to alleviate poverty and decentralise buying procedures have received around $15 million in international support. France and Sweden have helped to install AIDS prevention programmes; Italy is supporting a cancer and high-risk healthcare programme. Germany has offered substantial loans for hospital rehabilitation, while the total value of healthcare loans from the World Bank, AIDB and Germany is $234 million in 1995.</p><pre>Chile in profile Population (1994) 14 million Health expenditure (1993) $1,700 million Health expenditure per capita $114 Hospital beds (1992) 42,879 Hospital beds (per 1,000 pop) 3.2 Doctors (per 1,000 pop) 1.1 Source: Medistat</pre><p>The 16-page country profile is included in Medistat, published by MDIS Publications Ltd.
