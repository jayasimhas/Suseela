<p>The number of new HIV cases in France has levelled off, according to latest figures from the Bulletin epidemiologique hebdomadaire. The total number of recorded AIDS cases since the start of the epidemic was 36,982 at the end of last June. However, experts estimate the actual figure at around 46,000, with some 29,000 having already died.</p><p>Some 3,100 HIV cases have been recorded in the first six months of 1995, 37% of whom were homo- or bisexual, 28% were drug users and 17% heterosexuals. Bulletin figures over the last few years of around 3,000 new cases every six months suggest a plateau has been reached, says the national network of public health. However AIDS cases among heterosexuals has been the fastest growing sector at around 11% a year. France has just under 10 AIDS sufferers per 100,000 people says the UN's human development report. This is the third highest level in Europe, behind Spain and Switzerland.</p>
