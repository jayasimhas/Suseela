<p>An opportunity to contest civil money penalty actions brought by the US FDA is ensured under new procedures which become effective on August 27th. The final rule, published on July 27th, provides for "an efficient, consistent and impartial hearing process".</p><p>Civil penalty actions, says the FDA, are typically brought against companies which, despite clear prior warning and an opportunity to correct violations, fail to comply with the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act. The Safe Medical Devices Act 1990 allows the FDA to assess penalties up to $1 million.</p><p>The agency calls the procedures "streamlined ... and designed to provide firms with a range of safeguards". These include settlement conferences, interlocutory appeal from rulings of the presiding officer, input on the appropriate amount of any penalty and additional time before a hearing for exchange of exhibits, witness lists and written testimony. Hearings will be conducted before an administrative law judge.</p>
