<p>US blood filter manufacturer Pall began a campaign this month to convince the US public that it should demand white blood cells be filtered out of donated blood before it is transfused. These cells (leukocytes) cause allergic reactions in some transfusion patients and can harbour cytomegalovirus - a risk to immunosuppressed patients, University of California professor Girish Vyas told a Pall press conference. Moreover, he added, the cells are not necessary in transfused blood.</p>

<p>US blood filter manufacturer Pall began a campaign this month to convince the US public that it should demand white blood cells be filtered out of donated blood before it is transfused. These cells (leukocytes) cause allergic reactions in some transfusion patients and can harbour cytomegalovirus - a risk to immunosuppressed patients, University of California professor Girish Vyas told a Pall press conference. Moreover, he added, the cells are not necessary in transfused blood.</p><p>Whether the Pall message has been received yet by US citizens is unknown - but it did reach the FDA and the American Red Cross, and they are not happy. FDA haematology chief Dr Joe Fratantoni immediately called the advice "premature". Available data do not prove that unfiltered blood is unsafe. An agency meeting of experts last March found filter studies conflicting and American Red Cross medical director Dr Rebecca Haley says that until research proves that people will benefit, the $35 cost of filtering a pint of blood would be wasted.</p>
