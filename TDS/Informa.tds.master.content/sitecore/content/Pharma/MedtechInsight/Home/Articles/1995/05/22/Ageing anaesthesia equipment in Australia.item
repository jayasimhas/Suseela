Speaking at the recent Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists conference, Dr John Russell of the department of anaesthesia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital issued a warning about the deterioration of capital equipment in many of Australia's hospitals. "A lot of the equipment was purchased in the 1960s and should have been pensioned off a long time ago," he said. Dr Russell expressed particular concern about equipment with an alarm system which has to be switched on manually rather than being activated automatically when the ventilator is working.</p>
