<p>Esaote Biomedica, the Italian company recently privatised through a management buyout, recorded sales of Lit 204,000 million ($130 million) in 1994, an increase of 15% on 1993. This result was obtained despite Lit 14,500 million worth of flood damage sustained by the Genoese facilities in last November's flood and despite an inhospitable domestic market.</p><p>Exports rose 46% in 1994, with notable increases in Russia and South America. With sales of around Lit 1,000 million, Japan became a significant market for the first time - especially for Esaote's ultrasound products and MR scanner, Artoscan.</p><p>Turnover by the Esaote Group in markets other than Italy accounted for 48% of sales. Esaote's subsidiaries in the US, France and Germany collectively saw a 45% increase - 54% in Germany and 40% in the US. The company obviously benefited from the devaluation of the lira in 1993 and 1994.</p><p>Operating profit was some 10% of turnover, the same level as in the past. The company has been able to reduce its debt slightly and hopes to float on the stock exchange by the end of 1996.</p><p>Esaote employs some 525 people in Italy and a further 130 in its subsidiaries. The company says it is reinforcing its position in imaging diagnostics, particularly ultrasound.</p>
