<p>In the first results since its initial public offering last December, Guidant has reported strong sales growth of its cardiac rhythm management (CRM) products. These rose 18% in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier. Guidant points out that operating expenses rose just 1% in the fourth quarter and CEO Ronald Dollens considers this reflects Guidant's initial success at cost control.</p><pre>Guidant's 1994 results ($ millions) Fourth change Year change quarter vs '93 1994 vs '93 Net sales 234.3 9% 862.4 9% Vascular intervention 122.0 -0.3% 464.5 3% Cardiac rhythm management 106.9 18% 378.6 13% MIS 5.4 35% 19.3 92% US sales 593.1 4% international sales 269.3 20% Fourth quarter Year 1994 1993 1994 1993 Net income (loss) 23.3 (23.6) 92.1 50.6 (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>In the full year, CRM product sales outperformed other business, rising by 13%. Guidant attributes this to the US introduction of the Ventak PRx tiered-therapy defibrillator and the Endotak endocardial lead system and to continued European sales growth. Turnover of vascular intervention products rose only 3% in 1994: the introduction of the Atherocath GTO atherectomy catheter, continued strong sales of ACS RX Flowtrack perfusion dilatation catheter and RS Elipse rapid exchange dilatation catheters and guidewires were partly offset by lower prices and by volume declines in over-the-wire catheter products.</p><p>corporate reorganisation</p><p>Guidant which is made up of five subsidiaries recently announced its intention to establish a new corporate structure. The company intends to streamline its sales force and combine the vascular intervention and the CRM businesses under one sales organisation from the beginning of April. The MIS business will remain independent.</p><p>A spate of managerial changes will also be implemented. William Hawkins, president of DVI, one of the subsidiaries, will additionally be responsible for US operations. Ginger Howard, president of ACS, will also look after Japan, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Jay Graf, president of CPI, will assume responsibility for compliance and process improvement.</p><p>summer split-off</p><p>Guidant's majority owner <strong>[C#198600152:Eli Lilly]</strong> plans to split off its entire 80%-stake in Guidant by the end of this year. Guidant's CEO Mr Dollens hopes for a July split-off. This will give Lilly shareholders the opportunity to exchange all or some of their Lilly stock for Guidant shares. The alternative is a spin-off in which Lilly shareholders receive Guidant shares as a dividend.</p>
