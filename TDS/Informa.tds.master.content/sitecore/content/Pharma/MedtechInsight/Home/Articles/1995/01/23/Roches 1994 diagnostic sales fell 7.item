<p>The strong Swiss franc depressed Roche's diagnostics sales which fell by 7% to SwFr 1,592 million ($1,244 million) in 1994. Expressed in local currencies, diagnostics were flat compared with 1993. Sales of Syva, acquired last year with Syntex, are not included because Roche has to sell the business this year. Behringwerke is in talks about acquiring Syva, but negotiations have not been completed (see Clinica's news bulletin No 636, p 1).</p>

<p>The strong Swiss franc depressed Roche's diagnostics sales which fell by 7% to SwFr 1,592 million ($1,244 million) in 1994. Expressed in local currencies, diagnostics were flat compared with 1993. Sales of Syva, acquired last year with Syntex, are not included because Roche has to sell the business this year.

Roche notes that demand for its Cobas Mira analytical systems continued to be high and that the Cobas Core business was expanded. Especially successful was the hepatitis C PCR test, says Roche.</p><p>Because of cost cutting measures corporate operating profit has "again improved compared with 1993" and "another increase in group profit can be expected," Roche says. Full details for 1994 are due in April.</p>
