<p>The FDA has released a revised version of its controversial guidance document on when to submit a 510(k) for a change to an existing device. Gone is the "matrix model" of the original (April 1994) draft. "The matrix appeared to confuse many more people than it helped," the FDA admits.</p><p>This has been replaced with a "flowchart model to help manufacturers decide whether device changes will necessitate 510(k) submissions". Since a flowchart containing all the logical steps necessary is large and cumbersome and could be quite daunting, the agency has included in the new draft four charts, an appendix, and 20-odd pages of narrative.</p><p>The proposal applies to design or labelling modifications, such as indications for use, claims for safety and effectiveness, and to legally marketed products which will need design or labelling changes after a recall. It does not apply to device kits, combination products such as drug/devices or biologic/devices, or refurbishers' or remanufacturers' products. The FDA intends to develop additional guidances for these products.</p><p>Additionally, proposed Good Manufacturing Practices regulations will impose certain requirements when device changes are implemented. This will obviate the need for 510(k)s in many cases. "The Agency may reasonably rely on the existing GMP requirements to assure safety and effectiveness of the changed device."</p><p>The basis for comparison of any changed device is the device described by a cleared 510(k) (the pre-1976 device), the FDA reminds manufacturers. They must submit a new 510(k) only when the sum of the incremental changes exceeds the regulatory threshold and could significantly affect safety or effectiveness of the product. When a submission is required, all current changes must be included and the new device compared with the originally cleared product. The new 510(k) will then form the basis of comparison for the next sequence of changes.</p><p>four categories</p><p>The flowchart divides changes into labelling, technology, performance specification changes and material alterations.</p><p>Most labelling changes represent attempts to clarify instructions or make devices safer, easier or more effective. In most instances, says the FDA, such changes will not require a 510(k), but changes in the labelling's indications-for-use section probably will. It identifies the only substantial change in the indications for use that could occur without the submission of a 510(k) as a change limiting use within the currently cleared indication. The agency says the manufacturer should ask whether the specific uses pose any additional risks or expand the use to a new patient population. However, additional contraindications based on new information should be implemented immediately; the new labelling can be submitted after the fact as an addition to the existing 510(k). Deletions of contraindications usually require a 510(k) submission before the change is made.</p><p>Two common changes that would require submission are reuse of devices formerly labelled "single use only" and changes from prescription to over-the-counter status.</p><p>The FDA's decision-making scheme for technology or performance specification changes includes alterations to control mechanisms, energy type and operating principles. 510(k)s are usually required for most of these, although new packaging or expiration dating may not be, since they fall within the remit of GMPs.</p><p>Material changes are the subject of several charts and an appendix (compendium of biomaterials) in the new draft. Most examples seem to require 510(k)s; new material being supplied to a specification is "probably" the exception.</p><p>The draft will be made available for public comment.</p>
