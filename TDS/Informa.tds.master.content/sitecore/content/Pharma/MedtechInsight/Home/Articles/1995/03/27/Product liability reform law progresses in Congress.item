<p>US Product liability reform legislation that could greatly aid medical device manufacturers has been passed by the House of Representatives. The bill went to in the Senate on March 15th and is scheduled for subcommittee consideration on March 28th.</p><p>The Senate legislation does not cover several areas particularly important to the medical industry. Two key examples are: the "government standards" defence against punitive damages, which would as a rule exempt FDA-regulated products from non-economic judgements; and the fact that biomaterials producers would not generally be held responsible for problems caused by devices incorporating their raw materials.</p>
