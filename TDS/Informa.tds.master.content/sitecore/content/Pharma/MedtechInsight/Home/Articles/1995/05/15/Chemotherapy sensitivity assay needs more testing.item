<p>Additional testing has been recommended by an FDA advisory panel for Bartels Prognostics' (US) in vitro assay for determining tumour resistance to the chemotherapeutic 5-FU. Five members of the Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel recommended on May 1st that additional testing be performed prior to marketing approval. Five other members, including the panel chairman, considered only post-marketing studies should be requested.</p>

<p>Additional testing has been recommended by an FDA advisory panel for Bartels Prognostics' (US) in vitro assay for determining tumour resistance to the chemotherapeutic 5-FU. Five members of the Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel recommended on May 1st that additional testing be performed prior to marketing approval. Five other members, including the panel chairman, considered only post-marketing studies should be requested.</p><p>The product consists of cell growth media and a microtitre plate coated with 5-FU. The FDA requested the assay be used to detect chemotherapy resistance, as opposed to sensitivity, in order to prevent patients from receiving the drug if they are unlikely to benefit.</p><p>The PMA was based on a study of 25 patients with breast cancer who had tumour specimens removed prior to receiving chemotherapy. An additional 34 tumour specimens were used to define the cut-off points for determining a resistant (rather than nonresistant) tumour. Resistance to 5-FU in vitro correlated with failure of therapy in vivo (P = 0.002). The test had a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 71% and negative predictive value of 94%. Survival data did not show that 5-FU sensitivity resulted in an enhanced prognosis and no quality of life assessment was performed.</p><p>Panel members expressed concern about the small number of patients in the study as well as the variable results produced by different laboratories. Additional premarket data were recommended to confirm that the assay provides consistent results from samples of the same tumour in different sites. Dr Edelstein, who did not want approval held up for additional data, said: "I feel the assay has some potential for benefit. I would prefer to see it used now." Panel members were unanimous in recommending the FDA require post-marketing clinical studies.</p><p>Probe to detect TB receives conditional approval recommendation</p><p>Gen-Probe Inc's (US) MTD Test received an conditional approval recommendation by the US FDA's Microbiology Devices Advisory Panel. Seven members voted on May 2nd to recommend the data be restratified to allow further subgroup analysis prior to approval while 3 members recommended the product not be approved based on the current data. The product includes reagents for the amplification of mycobacterial rRNA and a florescent probe to detect the polynucleotide. The assay is intended to be used in conjunction with sputum smears and other studies for the earlier diagnosis of tuberculosis.</p><p>Data supporting the product's utility included results on 6,079 sputum specimens taken from 2,609 patients at 6 centers. Patients were stratified for risk of TB based on the American Thoracic Society's classification. The assay had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 97%, positive predictive value of 81%, and negative predictive value of 98%.</p><p>Panel discussion focussed on determining patient subpopulations and conditions for which the assay provided clinical utility. Most members stated they thought the assay would be useful for ruling out false positive sputum tests caused by nontuberculosis mycobacteria in patients who were not taking antituberculosis drugs. Dr. Kadree, a panel member, said the test would be useful to her when a smear was negative for TB but she strongly suspected an infection and didn't want to wait 4-6 weeks for culture results. Dr. Gordin, one of 3 physicians opposing approval based on the current data, said "I don't think this is going to be aiding physicians in the treatment of tuberculosis .... because of design problems, questions about reliability .. I don't see a (need) in approving this."</p>
