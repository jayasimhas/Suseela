<p>Manufacturers selling radiography equipment in Germany need to be aware of new regulations which came into effect on January 1st. Some 400-800 X-ray machines will need to be replaced in the country as a result of new ordinances revising minimum quality standards, says the electromedical manufacturers association (ZVEI).</p>

<p>Manufacturers selling radiography equipment in Germany need to be aware of new regulations which came into effect on January 1st. Some 400-800 X-ray machines will need to be replaced in the country as a result of new ordinances revising minimum quality standards, says the electromedical manufacturers association (ZVEI).</p><p>The ordinances were issued by the Ministry for Employment and Social Affairs and are currently being transposed by the individual Lander. The major changes are as follows:</p><p>Compliance dates</p><p>Until the end of 1994, only newly-installed devices had to comply with the minimum requirements for radiography equipment. As of 1995, all equipment will have to comply, although the exact point from which it will have to do so will be either the regular audit (held once every five years after installation) or when the operator changes, whichever is sooner.</p><p>General requirements</p><p>Mobile X-ray systems for abdominal scans must have six-pulse generators with a total capacity of 10 kW and provide a <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> of at least 1 lp/mm. The lowest exposure time on stationary devices must be no longer than 15 ms.</p><p>Mammography</p><p>In contrast with other devices, mammography systems must comply with the new regulations from January 1st. Devices must not deliver an X-ray dose higher than 4 milligray (compared with 6 milligray previously).</p><p>Paediatric radiography</p><p>Devices for paediatric radiography must be capable of an exposure time of less than 5 ms and the film, screen systems must have a sensitivity of 400 at the voltage used. [NB: manufacturers generally define film sensitivity at 80 kV, but paediatric radiography uses far lower voltages - operators are therefore recommended to buy X-ray film and intensifying screens from the same manufacturer to ensure they meet the regulations.]</p><p>For further information contact G Olwig or A Nunneman at the Arztliche Stelle Rontgen Berlin, Flottenstrasse 28-42, 13407 Berlin, Germany.</p>
