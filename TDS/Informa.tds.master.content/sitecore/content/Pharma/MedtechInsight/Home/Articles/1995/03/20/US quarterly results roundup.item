<p><pre>American Electromedics Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 0.56 0.55 0.06 0.04 6 months 1.12 1.24 0.14 0.10 (ended Jan 28th)</pre><p>Despite lower sales, American Electromedics' net income in the first half of fiscal 1995 rose due to a favourable sales mix and lower operating expenses. The company manufactures devices to detect middle ear and hearing disorders.</p><pre>Analogic Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 52.54 49.59 3.13 3.76 6 months 103.47 95.69 6.61 6.96 (ended Jan 31st)</pre><p>Massachusetts-based Analogic manufactures high-precision medical and industrial, diagnostic and measurement instruments. At RSNA in December, a work-in-progress transportable CT Scanner was displayed which is to be marketed under a joint venture with Philips Medical Systems (see Clinica No 633, p 20).</p><pre><strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 120.72 95.66 20.54 18.08 9 months 323.81 272.89 57.07 50.20 (ended Feb 28th)</pre><p>Biomet's third-quarter results include a full quarter of Kirschner Medical's operations, the company that was acquired at the beginning of November. Biomet's reconstructive sales in the first nine months rose 22% to $194 million, its Electro-Biology (EBI) unit turned over $72 million, up 11% compared with the previous year. Sales of other products increased 17% to $58 million.</p><pre>Danninger Medical Technology Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 3.20 2.11 0.17 (0.90) Year 10.15 9.31 0.08 (0.77) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>In October 1994, Danninger's subsidiary Cross Medical received FDA approval to market the anterior portion of its Synergy Spinal System. Together with increased demand for Danninger's recovery products, this approval has resulted in 9% sales growth in 1994. Cross Medical has a 510(k) pending for the posterior portion of the Synergy System and clearance is expected during the first half of 1995.</p><pre>Fischer Imaging Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 18.37 19.40 (0.98) 0.46 Year 68.47 73.33 (5.64) 0.00 (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Fischer estimates that US shipments of diagnostic X-ray systems declined about 30% to around $1,000 million during 1994. The net loss of the Colorado-based company includes a $2.5 million restructuring provision and a $1.9 million charge related to the write-down of assets and increased reserves. In the fourth quarter, Fischer's sales suffered from delays in anticipated OEM shipments caused by customer-requested design changes.</p><pre>HemaSure Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 0.02 0.08 (1.52) (0.54) Year 0.39 0.51 (4.41) (2.23) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>In December, HemaSure filed a 510(k) for approval of its LeukoNet Filter (see Clinica No 636, p 4). R&D spending on this filter and on the development of the LeukoVir-MBS filter and the SteriPath pathogen inactivation system resulted in an increased 1994 net loss. At the end of the year, HemaSure had $12 million in cash and equivalents.</p><pre>Imre Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 0.78 0.94 (1.82) (1.66) Year 4.92 5.41 (6.15) (4.92) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>About 70% of Imre's 1994 revenue was from Prosorba column shipments to its distributor Baxter Healthcare. Baxter will not require any shipments in the first quarter of 1995 and is therefore obliged to make a take-or-pay commitment payment to Imre, says the company. Imre and Baxter are re-negotiating their distribution deal (see Clinica No 643, p 10).</p><pre>Medrad Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 23.37 20.55 2.86 2.29 Year 78.30 71.70 7.27 5.74 (ended Jan 31st)</pre><p>Higher fourth-quarter sales are due to Medrad's vascular injectors and disposable products and a 46%-increase in international sales, according to the company. In the full year, non-US sales increased 27% and market development was mainly aimed at France and Italy.</p><pre>Molecular Dynamics Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 9.10 10.11 (3.36) 1.21 9 months 24.49 28.37 (4.99) 2.97 (ended Sept 30th)</pre><p>Molecular Dynamics' nine-month net loss was caused by a $2 million charge related to the settlement of a lawsuit and to tax account adjustments. The company says that sales of its FluorImager 575 have recently increased but that shipments have been below expectations since the system was introduced in mid-1993. Molecular Dynamics believes this is due to the lack of broadly applicable reagent kits, a weakness that has been addressed by its alliance with Amersham International (see Clinica No 599, p 11).</p><pre>Possis Medical Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 1.33 1.62 (0.78) (0.92) 6 months 2.35 3.71 (1.71) (1.02) (ended Jan 31st)</pre><p>Possis' revenues declined in the first half of fiscal 1995 due to the sale of the company's pacemaker leads business in March 1994. In February, Possis filed an IDE with the FDA for its AngioJet Thrombectomy System for removing blood clots from coronary arteries and bypass grafts (see Clinica No 644, p 18). The company expects to begin coronary trials in the US and Europe by mid-1995. Last August, the company filed a 510(k) to market its Perma-Seal Dialysis Access Graft in the US. Possis hopes to receive the FDA's response in March.</p><pre>Imex Medical Systems Revenues Net income (loss) ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 2.18 2.04 (0.13) 0.05 6 months 4.27 4.34 (0.14) 0.17 (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Imex continues to invest in new product development and the expansion of its sales and marketing force.

Safeskin says it is in the final stages of building a new production facility in Thailand, the company's third in South East Asia.</p><pre>PLC Systems Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 1.79 1.19 (0.34) (0.90) Year 5.18 3.32 (2.56) (3.97) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>The increase in PLC Systems' fourth-quarter sales is due to the shipment of five Heart Lasers during the period - three to Germany, one to India and one to Brazil. At the end of February, 400 patients worldwide had been treated with transmyocardial revascularisation, says PLC's CEO Lee Hibbs.</p><pre>Marquest Medical Products Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 5.23 5.10 (0.65) (0.94) 9 months 14.73 15.61 (2.68) (2.56) (ended Dec 31st, 1994; Jan 1st, 1994)</pre><p>Marquest Medical manufactures and distributes specialty cardiopulmonary support, respiratory and anaesthesia disposable devices. During fiscal 1994 it concentrated its manufacturing in Englewood, Colorado, cut staff and reduced costs. This improved Marquest's gross margin to 23.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 1995 compared with 15.5% a year earlier.</p>
