<p>A group of British Norplant recipients is threatening to take legal action against UK distributor Hoechst Roussel because of side-effects and withdrawal problems. The subcutaneous contraceptive implant, manufactured by Leiras (Finland), is already the subject of several group actions in the US (see Clinica No 659, p 8) although none has yet reached court.</p>

<p>A group of British Norplant recipients is threatening to take legal action against UK distributor Hoechst Roussel because of side-effects and withdrawal problems. The subcutaneous contraceptive implant, manufactured by Leiras (Finland), is already the subject of several group actions in the US (see Clinica No 659, p 8) although none has yet reached court.</p><p>Paul Balen, the Nottingham solicitor who is acting for the UK group, believes there might be grounds for group action against the distributor for insufficient warnings about side-effects. He is also considering claims against general practitioners who are accused of having incorrectly inserted or removed the implant.</p><p>According to a report in The Times, just 4,000 of the 8,000 UK doctors who signed up for the Norplant training scheme completed the course, and just one in five GP practices has a doctor trained in the procedure. Problems arise, Hoechst says in the British Medical Journal, because the marketing company has no power to restrict its use to trained doctors.</p><p>Norplant has been used by some 40,000-50,000 British women since its introduction in the country in 1993. Adverse publicity and rumours about Norplant were reported in June to have driven US sales down from 800 to 60 a day.</p>
