<p>Insalud doctors are to play a much stronger role in Spanish hospital management, following a deal signed after 48 days of strike action and 25 days of discussions. Ironically, the agreement is very similar to one proposed at the start of the conflict. Both the Spanish health agency, Insalud, and doctors' unions expressed satisfaction with the deal, which also offers a Pta 30,000 ($244) per month salary increase for doctors, rising by Pta 38,000 a month in 1996, providing productivity targets are met. Salaries of Insalud doctors will not, however, be linked to higher doctors' wages in regions which control their own health budgets.</p>

<p>Insalud doctors are to play a much stronger role in Spanish hospital management, following a deal signed after 48 days of strike action and 25 days of discussions. Ironically, the agreement is very similar to one proposed at the start of the conflict. Both the Spanish health agency, Insalud, and doctors' unions expressed satisfaction with the deal, which also offers a Pta 30,000 ($244) per month salary increase for doctors, rising by Pta 38,000 a month in 1996, providing productivity targets are met. Salaries of Insalud doctors will not, however, be linked to higher doctors' wages in regions which control their own health budgets.</p><p>The new deal provides for each hospital to have a management committee comprising medical representatives from each department and hospital managers. From October 1st, decision- making will be devolved to the departments themselves.</p><p>Doctors estimate the new structure could save Pta 3,500-5,000 million in 1996 by better control of pharmaceuticals and medical products expenditure. A December report from the Audit Commission criticised Insalud for its lack of regulation of prosthesis purchases, complaining that the same product could be twice as expensive in some centres than others. It backed open competition of tenders for medical products (see Clinica No 657, p 2).</p><p>A "blue list" has already been created to deal with those patients who had their operations cancelled because of the strike. Some 30,000 operations were cancelled and a further 600,000 medical procedures suspended during the action, says a report in El Pais. However, there is no provision for extending working hours over the summer to deal with the backlog, as Health Minister Angeles Amador had suggested.</p>
