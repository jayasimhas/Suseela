<p>There is one essential ingredient when seeking finance for a diagnostic company - luck. The chairman of a conference entitled "Financing Diagnostics. How and where to raise money to develop a diagnostics company" emphasised this cautionary note. "It is generally overlooked that a great deal of luck is needed to finance successfully a diagnostics company," Dr Henry Simon of Schroder Ventures told delegates at the event organised by the Diagnostics Club in London.</p><p>The conference included information and tips for companies at different stages in the financing cycle - how to find business angels for the smallest needs; what venture capitalists are looking for in an investment; and how new rule changes allow diagnostics companies a full London Stock Exchange listing.</p><p>A case study of Scotland-based Drew Scientific was outlined by managing director Keith Drew, illustrating how important the co-operation of his bank had been for success. Other issues included the role of consultants, tips on insurance, legal aspects of financing and how and when to use a PR company.</p><p>Danger: Don't stand in the middle of the road</p><p>The diagnostics market in the next five years will be dominated by large companies with worldwide sales and service capabilities on the one hand and small boutique companies serving the large ones on the other. Only very few medium-sized companies will survive, the conference was told. Schroder Venture's Dr Simon said this would result from a marked slowdown in growth rates.</p><p>He estimated worldwide sales of medical diagnostic products at about $15 billion in 1993 compared with about $1,000 billion for total healthcare spending. "A compound annual growth rate of 23% during the seventies increased diagnostic sales to $3.5 billion in 1980," he said. "The growth rate during the 1980s was 12% compound a year resulting in 1990 sales of $12 billion. But it is expected that the growth of medical diagnostic products will slow to between 6% and 8% during the 1990s."</p><p>As Dr Kenneth Noonan of The Wilkerson Group said: "The diagnostics sector is on the way to becoming a classic oligopoly."</p><p>Dr Simon sees chances for start-up companies in the high-tech area and in sample-handling. Tests for cancer, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis are required and the clinical aspects of ageing in terms of diagnostics need investigating. On the low-tech end, the handling of samples could be successfully simplified, from developing noninvasive tests to improving the handling of pap smears.</p><p>a love affair?</p><p>Given that the UK boasts more diagnostics companies, more good ideas and a larger venture capital industry than the rest of Europe, there is "room for a love affair" between the two, said Dr John Walker of Advent International. But he stressed: "The diagnostics industry must understand the venture capital beast." Venture capital needs to produce a 30% compound rate of return on money. Funds require a thorough business plan, interesting research projects, clearly defined market positions for the products and a strong management team. Venture capitalists need to "establish a value" within three to five years. This time frame was disputed by Dr Hamish Hale of Apax Partners who estimated that a venture capital fund will have to stay in a start-up company for as much as six to ten years.</p><p>difficult to invest</p><p>Dr Walker considers investment in advanced molecular fields such as gene probes "very difficult for venture capital funds". He believes it is easier for the large diagnostic companies to pick up promising technology and develop it in-house, since they are better able to assess its potential.</p><p>In future, he thinks only the specialist venture capital funds will invest in diagnostics companies. He suggests the pathology market as an opportunity.</p><p>How to make the opportunities knock</p><p>Finance opportunities come in all sizes - from business angels to a full stock market listing. An angel himself, Nicholas Cross estimates that "the informal equity capital on offer is roughly twice the size of the formal venture capital market." He defines angel investors as locally-based individuals with money they can afford to risk, who are prepared to make an initial investment of between &pound;50,000 and &pound;500,000 ($75,000 and $750,000) and stay in the company between five and ten years. Mr Cross stressed the potential role of business angels in filling management gaps in start-up companies.</p><p>At the top end of financing, UK diagnostics companies can now go for a full listing on the London Stock Exchange. Revisions to the listings rules, in force since January 4th, allow the listing of non-drug companies "as long as non-drugs progress through appropriate trials under regulatory or official scrutiny", explained Dr Brian Richards of Peptide Therapeutics Group. He conceded that some consider the criteria too hard for new companies to fulfil - such as the condition of a minimum &pound;20 million market capitalisation. Dr Noonan of The Wilkerson Group agreed, remarking that it makes a big difference on which exchange a company floats. He contrasted the US Nasdaq with the much more stringent requirements of the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>don't let BIMBOs frighten you!</p><p>The practical effects of the various financing methods were detailed by Charles Mayo of lawyers Simmons & Simmons. "All types of financing involve debt or equity, or a combination of the two known as 'mezzanine', and each type involves distinct legal considerations." In any case, a legal "minefield" needs to be navigated: from the implications of the various securities markets (the London Stock Exchange, a future Easdaq in Europe or the planned Alternative Investment Market in London) to structuring sources of finance, reducing personal liability and protecting intellectual property and licences. Mr Mayo warned that under no circumstances should companies be intimidated by the jargon so dear to venture capitalists - ranging from BIMBO to BOGOF to RAMBO. He recommended: "Always ask what it means."</p><p>The Diagnostics Club was formed three-and-a-half years ago to create a forum for the exchange of ideas between research groups and manufacturers. The club's manager, Dr Valerie Owen, has strong feelings about the need for appropriate and profitable technology transfer. Previous meetings have focused on patenting, venture capital, and marketing ideas. Membership of the Diagnostics Club numbers about 100 mainly UK companies.</p><p>In addition to newsletters, the Diagnostics Club provides a subscription service for diagnostics related patents and a quarterly bulletin listing members' expertise and interests. The club also provides a referral service to introduce innovators to potential partners.</p>
