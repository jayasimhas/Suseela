<p>AccuMed, the US laboratory diagnostics manufacturer which this month acquired UK company Sensititre (see Clinica No 642, p 14), is itself to merge with Alamar Biosciences (US). According to a letter of intent signed by the two companies last week, Alamar will swap its common stock, and additional shares based on performance goals, for AccuMed shares. The new company, to be called AccuMed, will be owned 51% by former Alamar shareholders. The transaction should be tax-free.</p>

<p>AccuMed, the US laboratory diagnostics manufacturer which this month acquired UK company Sensititre (see Clinica No 642, p 14), is itself to merge with Alamar Biosciences (US). According to a letter of intent signed by the two companies last week, Alamar will swap its common stock, and additional shares based on performance goals, for AccuMed shares. The new company, to be called AccuMed, will be owned 51% by former Alamar shareholders. The transaction should be tax-free.</p><p>lifeline deal</p><p>The merger offers a lifeline to Alamar, which is involved in a costly lawsuit with Difco Laboratories over misappropriation of trade secrets (see Clinica No 630, p 14). It recently terminated direct sales efforts, selling only to existing customers, and has suspended all R&D projects. It says there can be no assurance of a favourable outcome to the lawsuit. Court proceedings against Difco are to start on August 28th and a stipulated order has been issued preventing Difco from marketing or selling products covered by the lawsuit without 60 days' advance notice to Alamar.</p><p>Alamar CEO Kenneth Miller says synergies from the merger with AccuMed will offset "complications associated with our lawsuit". The company made a net loss of $846,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 1995 and is now seeking between $312,000 and $625,000 in bridge financing. It also intends to conduct a warrant solicitation to obtain $325,000 in working capital. These plans remain unaffected by the merger.</p><pre>Alamar Bioscience results Revenues Net loss ($ millions) ($ millions) 1995 1994 1995 1994 3 months 0.1 0.2 (0.8) (0.8) (ended Dec 31st)</pre><p>Individual brand names for Alamar's and AccuMed's products will be maintained under the merger agreement. Alamar manufactures bacterial susceptibility and identification test kits and Mr Miller is keen to point out that "AccuMed is a strategic fit" with these products. The new company will have a seven-member board with Peter Gombrich, current CEO of AccuMed and co-founder of St Jude Medical, as chairman and CEO.</p>
