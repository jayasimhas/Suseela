<p>Arrow International's management plans to sell part of its stake in a public offering at a price which is expected to be announced in early May. The Pennsylvania-based critical-care manufacturer also intends to acquire Therex, a development-stage company in Massachusetts.</p><p>In the flotation, Arrow offers around 13% of total stock or three million shares, 2.5 million of which are sold by management. The sale will lower management's shareholding from 73% prior to the offering to 61%.</p><p>At an assumed price of $34.89, the offering would raise $16.3 million net for the company from the sale of 0.5 million shares. On April 24th, Arrow shares closed at $33.50. The company intends to use the funds to repay debt incurred in connection with the Therex acquisition, to finance its pending equity investment in Cardiac Pathways and use the remainder for general purposes.</p><p>acquisitions</p><p>Arrow wants to purchase Therex for $6.3 million in cash and 325,000 shares of stock, valuing the target at around $17 million. Therex develops implantable, constant-flow drug delivery pumps and a line of implantable vascular access ports for the administration of drugs and blood sampling for chemotherapy and other chronic disease treatments.</p><p>Industry sources estimate the US market for implantable drug delivery pumps and ports at about $140 million in 1995 with an average annual growth rate of about 15%.</p><p>Therex' main product is the Model 3000 Constant Flow Implantable Pump, which is refilled percutaneously, and is on sale in Europe and Canada. Arrow expects the pump to receive US FDA clearance during 1995. It received an advisory panel recommendation and final results of follow-up clinical testing have been submitted to the FDA. In 1994, Therex had sales of about $2 million and a similar pre-tax operating loss.</p><p>The Therex purchase will be Arrow's second investment in as many months. At the beginning of March, Arrow bought 9.7% of Cardiac Pathways stock for $9 million and in a separate agreement acquired certain manufacturing and distribution rights to Cardiac Pathways' proprietary Trio/Ensemble mapping catheter system and Radii radio-frequency ablation catheters for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia. Arrow's distribution rights will be worldwide, except for Japan and certain European countries. Arrow expects to file a 510(k) for Trio/Ensemble during 1995.</p><p>In September 1994, Arrow bought a 1% stake in Thoratec Laboratories and followed this with a distribution agreement relating to Thoratec's Bi-Ventricular assist device system (see Clinica No 645, p 15).</p><p>first-half sales rise a quarter</p><p>In the first half of fiscal 1995, Arrow's international sales rose 44% to $33.4 million compared with the previous year. Total sales rose 25% in the period, mainly due to increasing volume sales of Arrow's major product lines, higher shipments of ArrowGard Blue antiseptic surface-treated catheter products and sales of intra-aortic balloon pumps produced by Kontron Instruments. The latter was acquired in February 1994.</p><pre>Arrow's six-month results ($ millions) 1995 % change vs 1994 Critical care sales 82.1 17.3% Interventional procedure sales 17.4 88.8% Total sales 99.9 25.4% Net income 15.5 19.2% (ended Feb 28th)</pre>
