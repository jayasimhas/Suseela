<p>Germany's third-largest Krankenkassen group, the Betriebskrankenkassen (BKK), has called for the continuation of budget-capping beyond 1995 following publication of its preliminary financial results for last year. Healthcare expenditure in 1994 increased 8% in west and 18% in east Germany, while Kassen income rose just 6.5% and 11% in the two regions respectively.</p>

<p>Germany's third-largest Krankenkassen group, the Betriebskrankenkassen (BKK), has called for the continuation of budget-capping beyond 1995 following publication of its preliminary financial results for last year. Healthcare expenditure in 1994 increased 8% in west and 18% in east Germany, while Kassen income rose just 6.5% and 11% in the two regions respectively.</p><p>The BKK claims the shortfall means that it has had to draw on reserves. It says the data make clear how fundamental it is to maintain a system which encourages thrift and economy in each of the medical sectors. The diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) which replace fixed budgets in 1996 will cover just 20% of hospital costs (hospitals account for a third of all health spending). In 1995 only 100 of Germany's 2,359 acute hospitals introduced DRGs to opt out of the fixed budgets.</p><pre>Betriebskrankenkassen income/expenditure 1994 Percentage increase versus 1993 Expenditure west Germany east Germany General practitioners 4.5% 16.0% Dental treatment (excl prostheses) 6.0% - Dental prostheses 18.0% 30.0% Pharmaceuticals 5.0% 18.0% Medical aids & remedies 9.0% 15.0% Hospitals 8.5% 17.5% Sick pay 8.0% 25.0% Total expenditure 8.0% 18.0% Income Basic wage-related premiums 2.8% 7.0% Other income sources 5.5% 10.5% Total income 6.5% 11.0%</pre><p>The largest increase, in reimbursements for dental prostheses, reflects heavily reduced spending on prostheses in 1993, the first year of the fixed budgets, says the BKK. The large rise in hospital expenditure is due to wage increases and use of items not covered by the fixed budgets.</p>
