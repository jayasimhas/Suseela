<p>This review of developments in international device regulation has been compiled for Clinica by Gordon Higson, chairman of Medical Technology Consultants Europe and a leading member of the global harmonisation task force.</p><p>The global harmonisation task force has now been in existence for just over two years. At its last meeting in June 1994, the task force took stock of progress to date and considered its future role in the light of the establishment by ISO of Technical Committee 210, with a general remit relating to quality systems and other common aspects of medical devices.</p><p>Achievements to date were mainly in the field of national GMP requirements. The task force had studied in detail the draft US and Japanese GMP regulations and commented extensively on them early in 1994. The Japanese and US delegates reported that these comments had had considerable influence on the two regulations, but the proof of this will be seen early in 1995 when the US GMP regulation will be published and an English translation of the Japanese GMP is expected to become available. We can also expect to see Canadian and Australian GMP regulations introduced or revised to bring about greater compliance with the requirements of ISO 9001 and EN 46001.</p><p>The rapid production of the guidance on the implementation of quality standards for medical devices was also seen as a considerable achievement. Further development of this guidance will be left in the hands of ISO TC 210 but publication, in advance of an international standard, is likely in several participating countries during 1995.</p><p>The task force established as a basic principle that it wishes to work in close liaison with ISO TC 210. The role of the task force is seen as that of addressing regulatory issues not amenable to the standards process and leaving to ISO those issues (such as the production of guidance and auditing standards) which fall properly in the province of a standardisation committee.</p><p>With this in mind, the work of Study Group 1 assumes great importance. This group has been revised and expanded in membership and given new terms of reference to examine the regulatory obstacles between participating countries and to propose to the task force topics where harmonisation is believed to be feasible and to recommend priorities.</p><p>This group will therefore shape the future activities of the task force. It was due to hold its first meeting in Brussels on December 19th-20th, 1994.</p><p>While results cannot be anticipated at this time, the list of possible candidates for future harmonisation activities is impressive:</p><p>* classification * performance/effectiveness requirements * requirements for clinical data* adverse incident reporting * post-market surveillance/tracking * labelling</p><p>The openness and lack of defensiveness so far shown by members of the GHTF has been remarkable. This is expected to be reflected in the publication of several regulations for GMP or Quality Assurance which will effectively implement ISO9001/2 and EN 46001/2 in the major trading countries. CE-marked products should become acceptable in Australia and some other countries and rapid progress on one or more of the candidate topics before Study Group 1 is hoped for.</p><p>My own view is that classification, adverse incident reporting and labelling are prime subjects where the existing regimes have many common elements. Minor modification of current systems to bring worldwide harmony is certainly possible and one can hope that further work and increasing contact within the GHTF, which above all has the possibility of removing distrust among members, will leave participating governments feeling that they can safely change some of their existing mechanisms without any loss on their part.</p><p>* The next Global Medical Device Conference will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on June 25th-28th, 1995.</p>
