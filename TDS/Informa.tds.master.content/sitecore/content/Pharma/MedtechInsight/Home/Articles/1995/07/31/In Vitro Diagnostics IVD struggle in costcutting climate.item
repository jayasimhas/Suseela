<p>The IVD industry - in the front line of reimbursement cuts - is brushing up its image. Jeanette Marchant reports from Vancouver.</p><p>Laboratory testing is a sitting target for healthcare expenditure cuts. Although it accounts for a relatively small proportion of total costs, testing is easily identified and any reduction in diagnostic testing is seen by governments as a means to achieve short-term savings. The Global Medical Device Conference in Vancouver, Canada, last month devoted a session to hear how industry is coping in a new environment.</p><p>EDMA placing emphasis on PR</p><p>The IVD industry has to accept the natural limitations to its products and focus on the medical and economic outcomes, claimed Eckhard Lachenauer, president of <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong>'s European Diagnostic Systems and an executive committee member of EDMA. A Arthur D Little study commissioned by the European Diagnostic Manufacturers Association identified the following trends in IVDs in Europe: there is growing demand for economic justification of laboratory testing; purchasing is becoming centralised, resulting in a smaller number of companies; and protocols are defined more closely by third-party payers.</p><p>The European market, which accounts for 38% of the world diagnostic market, saw sales decline 5% in 1994 to ECU 4,400 million ($5,850 million). In 1995, a similar decline is expected, with volume down 7%.</p><p>While the pressure is mounting to reduce healthcare spending, Mr Lachenauer pointed out that reimbursement for laboratory testing represents just 4% of total healthcare costs, with the cost of tests accounting for just a quarter of laboratory testing. Industry must emphasise the role IVDs play in reducing the economic burden of disease to society and in improving the cost-benefits in healthcare. In the light of the new business environment, EDMA's focus is shifting from regulatory and technical issues to healthcare politics.</p><p>As part of its proactive strategy, EDMA is embarking on a communication programme, targeting user and adviser groups. Third-party payers are regarded as an important partner for industry since their role is shifting from "money changer" to a more competitive player aimed at reducing costs.</p><p>In order to reinforce its messages EDMA has sponsored studies to demonstrate the economic benefits of testing. Savings achieved by diabetes type 1 monitoring amounted to ECU 9,500 per patient, hepatitis C testing achieved annual savings of ECU 54 million and therapeutic drug monitoring of tricyclic antidepressants saved ECU 730 per patient.</p><p>US companies take proactive stance</p><p>Similar studies have been sponsored by industry under the auspices of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry, the results of which were announced this month at the AACC annual conference in California (see Clinica No 644, p 21). Former AACC president Dr Lemuel Bowie told the Vancouver meeting that industry must accept the results of the studies whatever the outcome.</p><p>The general perception that technology a priori increases healthcare costs threatens the diagnostics industry. In fact laboratory costs represent just 9% of Medicare hospital costs, Dr Bowie pointed out. Outcomes studies, such as those conducted in conjunction with industry, are designed to demonstrate the impact of laboratory testing on healthcare costs.</p><p>In some instances testing costs may be higher but they reduce total expenditure. For example, Dr Bowie produced data showing the impact of implementing clinical practice guidelines for coronary angioplasty. With a new testing protocol for MI profiling, laboratory costs increased from $458 per case to $466, but total costs declined from $7,311 to $6,909 per case in 1994. The industry needs to "work creatively in drawing a link between laboratory and overall patient care", he advised.</p><p>The key challenge for the IVD industry is to research and produce "outcomes-driven products against a constantly changing legislative, regulatory and reimbursement environment", claimed Paul Landauer, director of external affairs in <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>'s Diagnostic Division. CLIA reform provides an opportunity to change the US administrative structure: industry association HIMA is pursuing efforts to bring product approval, classification and quality control clearance activities within one agency - the FDA: currently the CDC plays a large regulatory role.</p><p>Reimbursement of IVDs has declined significantly in the past decade, pointed out Mr Landauer. Medicare reimbursement of total cholesterol testing, for example, has dropped from $7.90 to $5.85 in the 10 years since 1986. Clinical laboratories are a target for Medicare savings and proposals are under consideration to cut by 90% reimbursement of automated tests. Yet, argues the industry, payment levels must be maintained in order to sustain R&D. It is therefore, essential for IVD's contribution to healthcare to be "quantified, communicated and understood".</p><p>prices in Japan under pressure</p><p>Reimbursement prices in Japan, which are revised every two years, are also on a downward spiral, claimed Morichika Tanemura, consultant to the Japan Association of Clinical Reagent Industries (JACR). Reimbursement for IVDs is calculated on an individual test basis, and includes associated costs as well as the product cost. Blood glucose testing, for example, is reimbursed at &yen;80 ($2).</p><p>IVDs' share of National Medical Care expenditure has remained constant - at around 7% - for the past decade although total healthcare costs rose from $170,700 million in 1986 to $234,800 million in 1992.</p><p>Although the IVD market maintained 6% growth in the early 1990s, Mr Tanemura cautioned that demand is levelling off and annual growth in the rest of the decade is expected to be in the region of 3%. Sales in 1994 totalled $3,100 million, of which instruments accounted for 16%. The bright spot in the reagent market - put at $2,600 million in 1995 - is the immunochemistry segment which accounts for almost half the market. Mr Tanemura noted that some blood chemistry testing is being replaced by immuno-related testing, mainly as a result of tighter government reimbursement and price declines.</p><p>While there are opportunities for manufacturers of tests which meet market needs for early disease detection and improved performance, they will be adopted in the reimbursement scheme only if conventional or outdated tests are abolished and removed from the list.</p><p>There appears to be little chance of changing the regulation of IVDs in Japan where they continue to fall under the same umbrella as drugs. Mr Tanemura noted that the major Japanese reagent manufacturers are also pharmaceutical companies and the major thrust to establish a separate category for IVDs comes from importers.</p><p>Regulation of IVDs has been streamlined to some extent through the new classification system. Most Class II products do not require extensive data submissions: Class II-1 comprises existing analytes with a new assay method; Class II-2 are old analytes and old methods (accounting for over 90% of all reagents). Licence applications for Class II IVDs must be examined by the Ministry of Health & Welfare within six months. The MHW is also planning to introduce a notification system for Class II reagents based on risk, similar to the US and EU systems. Issues yet to be resolved are implementation of post-marketing surveillance and GMP regulations.</p>
