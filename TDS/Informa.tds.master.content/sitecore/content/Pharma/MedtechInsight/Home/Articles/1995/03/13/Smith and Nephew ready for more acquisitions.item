<p>There were no surprises in Smith & Nephew's preliminary results released on March 6th. The core businesses perform well in the second half and operating margins improved from 17.9% to 18.2%. Gearing has been reduced to zero and the UK company is seeking acquisitions to complement its business activities.</p><p>Pre-tax profit was &pound;172.2 million ($275.5 million) before exceptional items on turnover of &pound;964.6 million in 1994. A pre-tax profit of &pound;157.6 million was reported in 1993 on turnover of &pound;948.7 million. Smith & Nephew recorded an exceptional loss of &pound;150 million on the disposal of the Ioptex intraocular lens business in 1994.</p><p>Additionally, the group has charged &pound;27 million against profits to cover a rationalisation programme involving production facilities and restructuring of European distribution. This programme will entail the loss of around 200 jobs worldwide - most through voluntary redundancy - over the next two-three years, according to Smith & Nephew's chief executive, John Robinson.</p><pre>Smith & Nephew annual results (&pound; million) 1994 1993 % change* Product sales Casting & support 169.5 152.4 +11 Wound management 147.5 136.4 + 8 Arthroscopy 105.2 100.9 + 4 Trauma 104.7 98.4 + 6 Orthopaedic implants 124.7 117.8 + 6 Other medical 137.3 143.9 - 5 Total healthcare 788.9 749.8 + 5 Consumer 161.0 149.6 + 8 Total 949.9 899.4 + 6 Discontinued operations 14.7 49.3 964.6 948.7 Operating profit Healthcare 124.5 143.0 -13 Consumer 21.0 18.3 +15 Total 145.5 161.3 -10 Discontinued operations (1.4) 2.5 Total 144.1 163.8 Pre-tax profit/(loss) (5.5) 164.9</pre><p>Strongest growth by product area was achieved by casting & support sales which increased 11% (in nominal terms) to &pound;169.5 million, accounting for 21.5% of the Group's Healthcare business. Wound management products increased their share of the world market from 10% to 11% in 1994 with sales up 8% to &pound;147.5 million, boosted by a 28% rise in advanced chronic wound product revenues. Smith & Nephew claims third place in the world wound management market, behind 3M and Convatec.</p><p>Arthroscopy sales registered strong growth in Europe but flat sales in the US, where Smith & Nephew has a 75% share, pegged overall growth at 4%. A decline in spinal procedures in the US was responsible for holding trauma product sales growth to 6%. Despite depressed prices, orthopaedic implants recorded a good year in the US with 10-12% unit growth. The French government's decision to hold back on reimbursement depressed orthopaedic implant sales. Elsewhere in Europe, sales were slow in Spain and Italy.</p><p>The gloves business - around &pound;45 million sales - reported slight growth in 1994 and is profitable. However, if Smith & Nephew were made a good offer for the business, it would accept it, Mr Robinson told Clinica.</p><pre>Smith & Nephew shares in world markets 1994 1993 Wound management 11% 10% Casting & support 28% 26% Trauma 14% 14% Arthroscopy 29% 28% Orthopaedic implants 8% 8%</pre><p>Geographically, the Pacific Rim markets - although still accounting for less than 20% of group sales - continue to record the strongest growth rates.</p><pre>Smith & Nephew sales by geographic market (&pound; millions) % 1994 1993 change UK 162.7 154.4 +5 Continental Europe 197.7 186.5 +6 North America 415.2 405.4 +2 Africa, Asia & Australasia 174.3 153.1 +14</pre><p>Sales in Japan, where Smith & Nephew employs 150 sales, marketing and administration staff, grew 33% to &pound;20 million in 1994. Outside Japan, South East Asian sales increased 25% to &pound;20 million. In the US, Mr Robinson highlighted the deal struck with AmHS last year (see Clinica No 630, p 15) which covers virtually all the company's products, except gloves. The supply arrangement generated $35 million in 1994 and is expected to bring in $50 million this year. More contracts along these lines are likely, says Mr Robinson, so that in five years' time some 80% of Smith & Nephew's US business will be with the big buying groups - compared with just 25% now.</p><p>R&D</p><p>Some &pound;30 million, or 3% of sales, is invested in R&D activities which are focused on tissue engineering in the wound management and orthopaedics sectors. The commercial benefits of this work are unlikely to be felt for three-five years. In the meantime, Smith & Nephew is expanding its product line through acquisitions. The Homecraft purchase for &pound;29 million last month (see Clinica No 640, p 14) has expanded Smith & Nephew's rehabilitation business and the company "will continue to build in this area", says Mr Robinson.</p><p>There is widespread speculation in the City that the UK company will make an acquisition on a far larger scale than the Homecraft purchase. Net cash of &pound;38 million was generated in 1994 and debt eliminated. The company is in a position to make a purchase in the region of &pound;500-600 million. Chairman Eric Kinder says: "We will continue to invest in the key areas of our business and we are confident that organic growth will continue. We have been actively pursuing acquisition opportunities in our existing areas of expertise and will continue to do so."</p>
