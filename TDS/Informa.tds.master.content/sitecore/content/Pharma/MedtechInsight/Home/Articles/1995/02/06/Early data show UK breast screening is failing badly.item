<p>The incidence of interval cancers in the third year after screening is barely lower than would be expected without screening at all, according to the first published data from the UK NHS breast screening programme. At 15.8 intervals cancers for every 10,000 women screened, the rate (from the north west region - 24 months after screening) is higher than the Swedish Two County trial (9.4) and about the same as that found in the Nijmegen (15.7) and Stockholm trials (19.2).</p>

<p>The incidence of interval cancers in the third year after screening is barely lower than would be expected without screening at all, according to the first published data from the UK NHS breast screening programme. At 15.8 intervals cancers for every 10,000 women screened, the rate (from the north west region - 24 months after screening) is higher than the Swedish Two County trial (9.4) and about the same as that found in the Nijmegen (15.7) and Stockholm trials (19.2).</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the UK figures reveals that 30% of the interval cancers are the result of false negatives, 8.5% are mammographically occult and 62.5% are true interval cancers, says epidemiologist Professor Ciaran Woodman, writing in the British Medical Journal (January 28th). Between 50% and 60% of interval cancers occur in the third year after screening. Most other national schemes repeat screening at two years.</p><p>Several strategies are suggested in an editorial by consultant radiologist Dr MJ Michell:</p><p>*Increasing the optical density of films; *Additional training in detection of the signs most likely to account for false negative readings; *Increasing screening frequency to every two years; *Introducing two-view mammography at the first examination.</p><p>The first strategy has already been implemented at no extra cost, says Dr Michell, and the last has been carried out experimentally with significant results. Changing to biennial screening, however, has obvious cost and staffing implications. The NHS told all its screening centres to change to two-shot X-rays last month (see Clinica No 638, p 2) but the UK Department of Health says no decision will be taken on screening frequency until the completion of a five centre trial involving 100,000 women in 1996.</p><p>A second editorial casts doubt on general practitioners' commitment to breast screening. There is evidence, says GP Dr Paul Creighton, that the second round of breast screening has failed to reach as many eligible women as the first. He calls for more funds, increased managerial support and vocational training for practice managers.</p>
