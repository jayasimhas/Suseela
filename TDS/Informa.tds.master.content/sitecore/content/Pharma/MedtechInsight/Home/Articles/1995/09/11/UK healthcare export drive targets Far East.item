<p>A UK government-led trade delegation is to travel to the Far East this month, seeking export opportunities for UK healthcare companies. "Health Action Asia", led by Health Minister Gerald Malone, will visit health officials, hospitals and trade associations in Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan. The delegation will include representatives from the ABHI, companies supplying the UK NHS and the British Postgraduate Medical Federation - also representing the London First Centre, an agency aiming to promote overseas investment in London's medical expertise and resources.</p><p>The Department of Health sees itself as a "facilitator" helping to open doors abroad for individual businesses, Mr Malone told a press briefing on August 31st. The Minister will also be looking at the healthcare systems of the four countries, considering in particular the benefits of private sector financing for public sector services.</p><p>John Wotton, chief executive of HNE Healthcare, who will represent the ABHI on the visit, said: "We see the Far East as one of the major growth areas for healthcare exports over the next 5-10 years. It is not only important to establish good, sound trading links with distributors, but also to understand local needs at first hand." Other UK companies participating in the trip include SIMS, DePuy International, Graseby Medical and MSB, a Wiltshire-based firm producing disposable diagnostic ECG, monitoring and defibrillation electrodes, which opened a manufacturing facility in Singapore a year ago.</p><p>UK equipment exports</p><p>UK exports of medical equipment to Singapore rose 47% in 1994 to &pound;15 million ($22.5 million). There was a positive trade balance in all product categories except orthopaedic appliances (imports from Singapore valued at &pound;9.1 million in 1994) and rubber items, with imports of &pound;1.6 million.</p><pre>UK equipment exports to Singapore (&pound; millions) 1994 1993 Instruments (ophth/med/surg/dental) 4.2 2.6 Orthopaedic appliances 7.3 4.8 Electromed appliances (excl X-ray) 0.5 0.4 X-ray apparatus 0.4 0.1 X-ray film 1.0 0.6 Mechanotherapy appliances 1.4 1.5 Rubber goods (eg gloves, contraceptives) 0.2 0.2 TOTAL 15.0 10.2</pre><p>UK medical equipment exports to Thailand fell 5% in 1994 to &pound;4.3 million, although this should be seen in the context of a near tripling of export value (+283%) in 1993.</p><pre>UK equipment exports to Thailand (&pound; millions) 1994 1993 Instruments (ophth/med/surg/dental) 2.2 2.4 Orthopaedic appliances 0.7 0.8 Electromed appliances (excl X-ray) 0.4 0.5 X-ray apparatus 0.9 0.7 X-ray film - 0.01 Mechanotherapy appliances 0.1 0.1 Rubber goods (eg gloves, contraceptives) - 0.01 TOTAL 4.3 4.52</pre><p>Malaysia increased its equipment imports from the UK by 9.4% in 1994. Exports of medical rubber items from Malaysia to the UK totalled &pound;11.6 million in 1994, down 17.2% on the previous year.</p><pre>UK equipment exports to Malaysia (&pound; millions) 1994 1993 Instruments (ophth/med/surg/dental) 3.9 3.6 Orthopaedic appliances 0.6 0.4 Electromed appliances (excl X-ray) 0.4 0.2 X-ray apparatus 0.1 0.07 Mechanotherapy appliances 0.3 0.3 Rubber goods (eg gloves, contraceptives) 0.03 0.3 TOTAL 5.33 4.87</pre><p>Exports of equipment from the UK to Taiwan almost doubled in 1994 to &pound;5.96 million, with X-ray apparatus experiencing the biggest increase - up nearly 2,400%, albeit from a very low base.</p><pre>UK equipment exports to Taiwan (&pound; millions) 1994 1993 Instruments (ophth/med/surg/dental) 2.0 1.1 Orthopaedic appliances 0.9 1.0 Electromed appliances (excl X-ray) 0.9 0.6 X-ray apparatus 1.8 0.07 Mechanotherapy appliances 0.3 0.2 Rubber goods (eg gloves, contraceptives) 0.06 0.04 TOTAL 5.96 3.01</pre><p>London First</p><p>The London First project, which is making its own efforts to attract investment to London, is promoting the capital's "unique diversity and concentration of expertise, innovation and resources" in the medical arena. It points to London's "critical mass" of hospitals, medical schools, practitioners and teachers, highlighting the benefits of state-of-the-art equipment in medical schools and hospitals and the presence of the Medical Devices Agency, "offering simpler and quicker licensing procedures and market access to the whole of the EU".</p>
