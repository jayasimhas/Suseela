<p>French health expenditure will continue to rise rapidly unless fundamental reforms take place, concludes an OECD report. It claims health reforms since the 1970s have been too weak and fragmented to contain cost pressure, given the current dynamics of the system and the ageing of the population.</p><p>The Health Ministry expects savings of up to Fr 10,000 million a year from the medical guidelines (RMOs), of which there are now 147. It also believes the inauguration of the medical dossier (see Clinica No 646, p 4) will allow better co- ordination of treatment. However, while these measures may reduce some unnecessary consultation and prescriptions - up to an estimated 20% of healthcare spending - they do not essentially change the current system as no aggregate budget caps will be enforceable. A break in growth rate trends will only be achieved through more fundamental reform, says the report.</p><p>While volumes of healthcare spending are very high, price levels for health services are considerably lower than other EU countries, says the report. France is, in fact, the only country where prices for most goods and services have risen less than inflation (see diagram below).</p><p>Trends in the relative price of healthcare</p>
