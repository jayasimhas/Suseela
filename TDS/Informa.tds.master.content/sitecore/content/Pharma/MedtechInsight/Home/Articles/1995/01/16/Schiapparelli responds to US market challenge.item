<p>Turnover by Schiapparelli Biosystems (US) rose 4.7% to $8.43 million during the 1994 first half, considerably less than had been anticipated given the launch of the ACE (Automated Chemistry Expert) system in autumn 1993.

<p>Turnover by Schiapparelli Biosystems (US) rose 4.7% to $8.43 million during the 1994 first half, considerably less than had been anticipated given the launch of the ACE (Automated Chemistry Expert) system in autumn 1993. The US market was not as receptive as had been hoped due to the anticipated healthcare reforms, the company says, and sales were hit by the uncertainty surrounding the reimbursement of diagnostic tests. Schiapparelli responded by "radically restructuring" the organisation and increasing its direct sales force. The US business, which made a loss of $737,000 for the first six months of 1994 (compared with a loss of $2.8 million in the 1993 first half), hopes to break even by the end of the year.</p><p>During April 1994, Schiapparelli Biosystems signed an agreement with Microgenics, the Boehringer Mannheim US subsidiary, concerning the ACE system. Under the agreement Microgenics has exclusive development rights to a personalised version of the product aimed at US hospitals with fewer than 100 beds. The development should be complete by September this year. Schiapparelli Biosystems was rewarded with an immediate $750,000 for the deal and foresees a "significant increase in production volumes" of the product and a strengthening of its image through the agreement.</p><p>Schiapparelli Biosystems BV</p><p>In the Netherlands Schiapparelli Biosystems BV (based in Woerden) reported a 23% increase in first half sales to Fl 4.95 million. The company included the ACE in its product list and continued to sell its own products as well as those of its US sister company in all markets not covered by Schiapparelli Biosystems Inc. The Dutch business made a net loss of Fl 458,000, compared with a loss of Fl 400,000 in the 1993 first half.</p><p>Schiapparelli Biosystems (US), which has instrument production facilities in Fairfield, New Jersey, and reagent facilities in Columbia, Maryland, and its Dutch sister, are both part of Schiapparelli International BV (of the Italian Schiapparelli 1824 group), formerly known as Alfa Schiapparelli Wasserman BV.</p><p>The company sold its interest in the Schiapparelli Searle joint venture during the 1994 first half for some $4.3 million.</p>
