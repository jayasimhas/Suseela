<p>New enzyme-based heart attack tests may face an uphill struggle because US cardiologists are largely unaware of their existence. Boehringer Mannheim (Germany) and Spectral Diagnostics (Canada) both showed rapid-tests at the ACC and both admit that promoting their use will be tough.</p><p>Spectral has the lead in the US. Its CK-MB/myoglobin test was approved by the FDA earlier this month (see Clinica No 644, p 18). Boehringer's troponin T test, Trop-T, is still awaiting clearance. A laboratory version, Cardiac-T, was approved in May 1994 (see Clinica No 614, p 21) but by the time a blood sample has been taken, sent to the laboratory, spun down, tested and a report sent back to the emergency room (around 30 minutes in most hospitals), diagnosis is likely to have been made another way.</p><p>Another significant difference between the two tests is that troponin is a rule-in test - a positive result means definite myocardial damage - while CK-MB and myoglobin are rule-out markers because they are also released by non-cardiac muscle.</p><p>Spectral's marketing partner, Dade International, plans to promote the panel test alongside a laboratory-based troponin-I test. Emergency room physicians can rapidly rule out myocardial infarction (MI) with the panel test and patients can be transfered to a cheaper clinical unit. Patients who test positive for troponin-I can be admitted to a cardiac care unit.</p><p>first to launch?</p><p>Dade launched its troponin-I test in Europe on March 21st and says it will be the first to launch in the US. Sanofi (France) launched a troponin-I test in January. Dade marketing manager Lisa Marton says the Spectral test will be launched in about two weeks' time, helped by a series of symposia.</p><p>Spectral will remain firmly focused on cardiac-specific R&D, says vice-president Fred Hillier. He believes that emergency room staff will take to the 18-minute test quickly but admits that pressure from the public may be needed to overcome the ambivalent attitude to new enzyme tests.</p>
