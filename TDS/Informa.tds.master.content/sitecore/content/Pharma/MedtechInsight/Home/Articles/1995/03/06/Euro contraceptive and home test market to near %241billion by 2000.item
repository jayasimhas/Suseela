<p>The European market for contraceptives and home diagnostics is expected to grow to $908 million by 1999, up from $608 million in 1993, says a new report from Frost & Sullivan.</p><p>Condoms represent the majority of sales, having an 80% share ($484 million) of the market. However, growth in condom sales is slowing, says the report, due primarily to the AIDS threat losing some of its impact. Italy spends the most on condoms, $136 million in 1993, set to increase to $218 million in 1999. This is followed by the Spanish condom market, at $100 million, and Germany at $95 million in 1993. Of European countries, the female condom is so far available only in the UK, Spain and the Netherlands, due mainly to "regulatory difficulties".</p><p>The report concludes that, due largely to the presence of the <strong>[C#198900461:London International]</strong> Group, over half the European condom market is supplied by European production, as is the vast majority of home tests and spermicides. Imports come mainly from the US and Far East.</p><p>The European market for pregnancy tests was worth $104 million in 1993 and is set to grow to $161 million by 1999. It has been one of the fastest growing OTC markets in recent years, says the report. Italy has a 26.4% of the European market followed by Spain (21%) and Germany (18%). Overall, the contraceptive market is dominated by strong brands and a few leading vendors, says the report.</p><pre>European market for OTC contraceptives and home tests 1993 Condoms: $483.6 million Pregnancy tests: $104.5 million Spermicides: $15.6 million Ovulation kits: $4 million</pre><pre>European market for OTC contraceptives and home diagnostics in 2000 Pregnancy Tests: 18% Spermicides: 2% Ovulation kits: 1% Condoms: 80% Source: Frost & Sullivan</pre><p>The European market for OTC contraceptives and home diagnostics in 2000 is available from Clinica Reports (ref CBS532) priced $2195 (US orders) or $2245/&pound;1400/336,000 (orders outside the US) at 18/20 Hill Rise, Richmond, Surrey, TW10 6UA, UK.
