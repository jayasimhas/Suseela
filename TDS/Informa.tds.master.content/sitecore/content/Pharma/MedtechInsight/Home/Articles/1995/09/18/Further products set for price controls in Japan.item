<p>Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) plans to impose price controls on a range of products as part of a biennial review of its price control system for medical equipment and supplies. It seems unlikely, however, that new controls for the products concerned will be introduced in April 1996, as planned, due to the Diet's failure to agree on a budget.</p>

<p>Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) plans to impose price controls on a range of products as part of a biennial review of its price control system for medical equipment and supplies. It seems unlikely, however, that new controls for the products concerned will be introduced in April 1996, as planned, due to the Diet's failure to agree on a budget.</p><p>The intention is that prices will either be set by function, in which case pricing will be the same as for other competing products, or else they will be included in technical fees paid to Japanese hospitals to cover the costs of specific procedures. The table below lists some of the products that stand to be affected by the controls, as outlined in a recent US Health Industry Manufacturers Association newsletter.</p><pre>Product categories under proposed price controls Products to be priced according to function as part of technical fees level of technology paid to hospitals for specific procedures fixation splints special surgical sutures miscellaneous cardiac catheters elastic bandages for angiography guide wires & the head, neck & torso catheters sclero-therapy kits & catheter inducers & sheaths endoscopic ligations for orthopaedic accessories oesophageal varices Foley catheters</pre><p>HIMA seeks delay</p><p>HIMA has been working with the US government in an effort to obtain information on the MHW proposals and to delay the introduction of the changes. The association's director of global strategy, Terri Zavada, told Clinica that the US overtures had met with a "positive reception" from the MHW, adding that parliamentary delays in implementing the changes had allowed talks to proceed in a more relaxed fashion than might otherwise have been possible.</p><p>HIMA's policy is not to fight against the price controls per se, she said, rather to make sure that the functional categories reflect the higher prices that the higher-technology products should command.</p>
