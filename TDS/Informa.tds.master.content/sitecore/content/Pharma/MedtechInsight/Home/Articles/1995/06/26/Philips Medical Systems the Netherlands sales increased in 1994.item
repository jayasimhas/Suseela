It is not medical systems, therefore, that are responsible for the 12% decline of the Professional Products and Systems sales in 1994. Sales of Professional Products and Systems were Fl 8,167 million ($5,200 million). Philips says that on a comparable basis, adjusted for effects of consolidation changes and exchange rates, the decline was no more than 2% (see Clinica No 649, p 18).</p>
