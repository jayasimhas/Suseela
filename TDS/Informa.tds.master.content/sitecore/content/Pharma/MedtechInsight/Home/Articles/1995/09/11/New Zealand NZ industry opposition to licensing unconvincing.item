<p>New Zealand's Ministry of Health finds medical device industry objections to the proposed introduction of product licensing "unconvincing". In a new report analysing comments submitted following last year's discussion paper on regulatory reform, the Ministry contends that the industry "did not advance any reasoned argument why the proposals would not work or why an alternative scenario would work better".</p>

<p>New Zealand's Ministry of Health finds medical device industry objections to the proposed introduction of product licensing "unconvincing". In a new report analysing comments submitted following last year's discussion paper on regulatory reform, the Ministry contends that the industry "did not advance any reasoned argument why the proposals would not work or why an alternative scenario would work better".</p><p>The Ministry had proposed that medical devices should be regulated according to four risk categories (high-, moderate- and low-risk and exempt), with a system of controls proportional to the risk and benefit of each device (see Clinica No 606/7, p 13).</p><p>In their submissions, device manufacturers and suppliers opposed these graded licensing proposals, which they fear will cause delays and increased paperwork and costs. Instead, industry favours a notification process for all medical devices and the licensing of manufacturers. This, it says, would place the onus to prove product safety on the manufacturer, which would be audited by the industry.</p><p>no self-assessment for high-risk</p><p>In its Report on the Analysis of Submissions on Proposals to Reform the Regulation of Therapeutic Products, the Health Ministry states that a move towards self-assessment for high- and moderate-risk devices would not be appropriate, since it would neither align New Zealand's regulation system with that of major trading partners nor provide adequate assurances of product safety.</p><p>The Ministry goes on to note that suppliers have had the opportunity to take responsibility for product safety under the current regime, but have not consistently done so. Officials concede, however, that self-assessment is appropriate for low-risk devices, as proposed in the discussion paper.</p><p>healthcare providers back proposals</p><p>The bulk of the comments regarding medical devices came from regulated healthcare providers and their associations, which largely supported the government proposals. Two non-industry submissions are mentioned in the report. One is from a practitioner with concerns that the licensing of laboratory tests could entail a loss of flexibility in service provision and restrictions on locally manufactured devices. Another respondent suggested reducing bureaucracy by waiving licence requirements for products developed in facilities certified to the ISO 9000 standard.</p>
