<p>The Zeiss Group (Germany) does not expect to make a profit again until fiscal 1997, when it aims to achieve a 5% return on turnover. Fiscal 1996 (ending September 30th) is forecast to result in a loss, albeit a smaller loss for the group as a whole than the DM 60 million ($43 million) figure estimated for east German subsidiary, Carl Zeiss Jena. The Jena company is not now expected to attain profitability until fiscal 1998, some years later than was originally anticipated. In an interview with Handelsblatt, Zeiss Group chairman Peter Grassmann put this down to "management deficiencies".</p>

<p>The Zeiss Group (Germany) does not expect to make a profit again until fiscal 1997, when it aims to achieve a 5% return on turnover. Fiscal 1996 (ending September 30th) is forecast to result in a loss, albeit a smaller loss for the group as a whole than the DM 60 million ($43 million) figure estimated for east German subsidiary, Carl Zeiss Jena. The Jena company is not now expected to attain profitability until fiscal 1998, some years later than was originally anticipated. In an interview with Handelsblatt, Zeiss Group chairman Peter Grassmann put this down to "management deficiencies".</p><p>Following losses of DM 184 million (DM 140 million at Carl Zeiss Jena) on turnover of DM 2,500 million in 1994, sales of DM 2,600 million and a loss of between DM 100 million and DM 120 million are expected in the current year. The loss will again be attributable largely to the Jena subsidiary. The overall parent organisation, the Carl-Zeiss-Foundation, will make a profit, however, thanks to Schott Glaswerke.</p><p>The atmosphere at Zeiss has improved somewhat since Mr Grassmann took over as chairman at the start of 1995. The end of last year saw public conflict between the executive board and the works council regarding a lack of consultation over job losses. The total number of group employees (15,900 in 1994) was originally to be cut by 3,000 but it now appears this figure has been reduced to 2,400.</p><p>In May this year, the Land Thuringen sold its 49% share (held through Jenoptik) in Carl Zeiss Jena to the Zeiss Group for the symbolic sum of DM 1 but wrote a clause into the contract stipulating that the number of employees at Carl Zeiss Jena must make up at least 20% of the total number of employees in Carl-Zeiss-Foundation companies. This would mean a minimum of 1,300 employees in Jena; the most recent restructuring plans involve cutting the number by 30% to 1,450.</p><p>In the Zeiss Group as a whole some 200 jobs have been saved by transfers to flourishing areas such as semiconductor optics. Furthermore, management has attempted to save certain less profitable areas by forming joint ventures. The proposed joint venture with Leica (Switzerland) (see Clinica No 644, p 17) in the field of electron microscopy, which is expected to record a turnover of DM 100 million per annum, has not yet been approved by the EU competition authority.</p><p>One means by which Mr Grassmann proposes to economise is through shifting production to low-wage countries. A joint venture (70% Zeiss-owned) has been set up with the Belarus company, Bellomo, a former Soviet arms manufacturer, to produce simple microscopes, and Zeiss' Hungarian subsidiary, Carl Zeiss Hungaria Optikai (which manufactures spectacle lenses), has recruited an additional 160 staff.</p><p>A more long-term cost-cutting measure, which will not begin to bear fruit until the year 2000, is a lowering of pension provisions for the concern as a whole. The emphasis on cost reduction has not, however, prevented the group making major investments such as the DM 30 million modernisation of the ophthalmic production site in Aalen and a DM 40 million injection into semiconductor lens production.</p>
