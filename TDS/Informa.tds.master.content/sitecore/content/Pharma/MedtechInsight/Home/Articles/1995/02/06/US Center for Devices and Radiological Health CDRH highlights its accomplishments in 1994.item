<p>Among the 26 PMAs approved by the US Center for Devices and Radiological Health in fiscal 1994 were four "firsts" for the US market. They include a ventricular assist device to serve as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (Thermo Cardiosystem's HeartMate); a contrast agent for use in ultrasound imaging of the heart for wall motion studies (Molecular Biosystems' Albunex); the use of the <strong>[C#198601109:Hybritech]</strong> Tandem PSA Assay for prostate cancer screening; and a stent for initial treatment of symptomatic, short lesions in large coronary arteries (Johnson & Johnson's Palmaz-Schatz).</p>

<p>Among the 26 PMAs approved by the US Center for Devices and Radiological Health in fiscal 1994 were four "firsts" for the US market. They include a ventricular assist device to serve as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (Thermo Cardiosystem's HeartMate); a contrast agent for use in ultrasound imaging of the heart for wall motion studies (Molecular Biosystems' Albunex); the use of the <strong>[C#198601109:Hybritech]</strong> Tandem PSA Assay for prostate cancer screening; and a stent for initial treatment of symptomatic, short lesions in large coronary arteries (Johnson & Johnson's Palmaz-Schatz).</p><p>In its nine-page list of "accomplishments" in 1994, the agency includes the reduction of the backlog of 510(k)s by 75%, from 1,894 active and overdue at the end of 1993 to 460 active and overdue at the end of last year. The median time to action decreased from a peak of 220 days to approximately 120 days - "the best time since the third quarter of 1992," the CDRH claims. In addition, 148 Class I devices were exempted from premarket notification, reducing the number of annual submissions by approximately 600, or 10%.</p><p>During the year, the CDRH hired 143 new device reviewers, of whom 71 are female and 37 are from minority groups.</p><p>PMS</p><p>The Center warned some 250,000 health professionals of "problems with potentially unsafe medical devices" on seven occasions. The number of adverse event reports processed by the agency increased from 97,753 in 1993 to 112,917.</p><p>A forum was established for Center-wide discussion of emerging health problems, regulatory issues, safety and efficacy concerns, scientific and technical research, and database analysis. In all, roundtable discussions were held on 24 topics last year.</p><p>enforcement activities</p><p>The processing times for export requests were reduced by 75% "despite a 40% increase in the number of requests". Some 790 export requests were received and 756 requests processed in an average time of 16 days. Processing times for export certificates declined by 80% "despite a 60% increase in the number of requests". Of 2,276 export certificates received, 2,259 were processed in an average of nine days.</p><p>Continuing its emphasis on bioresearch monitoring, the Center issued 48 warning letters (compared with 18 the year before), suspended five Institutional Review Boards, rescinded two 510(k)s, implemented the application integrity policy against two device companies and withdrew three PMAs, two 510(k)s and two IDEs as a result of violations uncovered during inspections.</p>
