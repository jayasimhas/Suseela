<p>With the purchase of Fisons' scientific instruments business, Thermo Electron will nearly double its instrument sales and will be well have achieved its goal of becoming number two in the sector behind Perkin-Elmer.</p><p>Thermo Electron owns 81% of Thermo Instrument Systems, the buyer of Fisons' business. In 1993, Thermo Instrument Systems had sales of $584 million while Fisons' scientific instruments turned over around $400 million.</p><p>The purchase is the latest move by Thermo Electron in an acquisition-led growth strategy which has included Nicolet Instrument Corporation, Spectra-Physics Analytical and Gamma-Metrics. Only its attempted hostile takeover of Puritan-Bennett last year was thwarted.</p><p>The "effective timing and integration" of past acquisitions accounts for the 27% rise in 1994 revenues and the 35% increase in net income according to chairman George Hatsopoulos . Sales grew to $1,585 million and net income to $103 million. Last year, Thermo Electron was listed at the top of the Fortune 500 companies relating to growth in earnings per share for years between 1983 and 1993 with a compound annual rate of 97%.</p><p>spinout strategy</p><p>Since 1983, Thermo Electron has followed a strategy of organising certain of its businesses into separate subsidiaries and selling a minority interest in these to outside investors. Thermo Electron believes this provides additional motivation to the subsidiaries' management through the establishment of stock option incentive programmes, as well as capital to support their growth.</p>
