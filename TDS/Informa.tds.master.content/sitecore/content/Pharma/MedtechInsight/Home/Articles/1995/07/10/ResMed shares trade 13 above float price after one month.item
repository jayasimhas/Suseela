<p>Australia-based ResMed, developer of products for the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), has seen its share price hold steady just above the level it floated in the US. At the beginning of June the company sold three million stock at $11 apiece. ResMed's Nasdaq-quoted shares closed at $12.50 on July 6th.</p><p>ResMed is a Delaware corporation, formed in March 1994 as holding company for its Australian, European and US subsidiaries, but its headquarters are in North Ryde, Sydney. Of the three million shares sold in the initial public offering, two million were sold by the company, raising around $20 million in new funds. These are to be used to expand manufacturing, sales and marketing and possibly make acquisitions of complementary businesses or technology, ResMed writes in its prospectus. The remaining one million shares were sold by existing stockholders, with around 280,000 coming from executive officers and directors. This reduced their stake to just below 15% compared with 27% before the offering.</p><p>OSA, ResMed's target illness, is a breathing disorder in which the upper airway frequently collapses during sleep resulting in cycles of subconscious awakenings. In severe cases, these can occur several hundred times a night. OSA can be treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers low positive airway pressure through a nasal mask or variable positive airway pressure (VPAP) which provides different pressure levels for inhalation and exhalation.</p><p>ResMed's products consist of air flow generators and air delivery systems including nasal mask, tubing and headset. The end user price of generators varies from $800 to $3,000 and generator sales accounted for 61% of the company's 1994 turnover. Some 23% was contributed by the Bubble Mask which ResMed sells for $100-$200 and manufactures on an OEM basis for Puritan-Bennett, one of its competitors.</p><p>The latest available generator model, Sullivan IV, was introduced last October but is not yet sold in the US. Under development is AutoSet, a microprocessor-controlled air flow generator which automatically and continually adjusts pressure in response to changing breathing patterns and stores data for subsequent analysis. Also in the pipeline is the Pediatric CPAP for infants and children.</p><p>About 20 million US citizens suffer from sleep apnoea, the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research estimated in 1993. Of these around 6.5 million over 30 years old suffer from moderate to severe OSA, but it is estimated that less than 3% of those affected know the cause of their fatigue and other symptoms. ResMed estimates that last year, CPAP treatment was prescribed for over 100,000 new patients in the US.</p><p>The company's turnover has increased from just below $1 million in 1990 to $14 million in fiscal 1994 (ended June). About 47% of its 1994 sales were generated in North America, 30% in Europe. Two distributors account for a large proportion of ResMed's revenues - 18% by Medical Gases of Australia and 19% by German company Priess Med Technik. In the first nine months of fiscal 1995, sales were 80% up compared with the previous year at $16.8 million and net income doubled to $2 million.</p><p>The US market for OSA treatment products is dominated by <strong>[C#198601203:Respironics]</strong>, according to ResMed. Other competitors include Healthdyne Technologies, Puritan-Bennett, and Sunrise Medical's subsidiary DeVilbiss Healthcare.</p>
