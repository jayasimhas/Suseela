<p>Computed tomography is at the centre of a dispute in Germany over so-called "large medical devices". Draft regulations limiting the number of devices for CT, MRI, cardiac catheterisation, radiotherapy, lithotripsy, PET and biomagnetometry have been submitted to the Bundeslander for review.

<p>Computed tomography is at the centre of a dispute in Germany over so-called "large medical devices". Draft regulations limiting the number of devices for CT, MRI, cardiac catheterisation, radiotherapy, lithotripsy, PET and biomagnetometry have been submitted to the Bundeslander for review. However, some Lander are calling for the removal of CT scanners from the list.</p><p>The regulations dictate the number of each type of device to be installed in relation to the size of Lander populations. Doctors or hospitals buying a listed device must obtain approval from the Land government if they wish to be reimbursed by the state Krankenkassen for its use. If the Land cannot give permission, because the maximum number of devices for the area has been reached, the device may only be used with private patients.</p><p>Udo Degener-Hencke, the Health Ministry official responsible for the draft, told Clinica that the regulations are expected to be approved by parliament in the spring. The number of CT scanners will be limited to one per 60-90,000 population. However, whether these devices will remain on the list at all is debatable.</p><p>odd one out</p><p>The dispute arises because the draft standardises the Lander's existing planning procedures. The Lander are currently free to decide which devices require planning approval and although only one Land, North Rhine Westphalia, excludes CT scanners, several others are considering doing so.</p><p>The head of the North Rhine Westphalian committee for large medical devices, Sigrun Bever, believes that CT is necessary for "basic patient care" and should therefore be free from restriction. Another factor is that appeals from doctors and hospitals who had been refused planning permission were clogging the Social Court - CT scanners account for almost half of all registered large devices.</p><p>fall in quality</p><p>However, the Health Ministry draft states that exclusion of CT would reduce quality as "long-term it would lead to increased competition between providers of the service". The Ministry is supported by Ernst Bruckenberger, head of the large device committee in Lower Saxony, who says that anyone who wants to exclude CT "has not thought about the future of radiology".</p><p>The electromedical manufacturers association (ZVEI) also attacks the draft for the level of the limits it imposes. A spokesperson told Clinica that the numbers of devices allowed effectively prevent any more large medical devices being installed in Germany.</p>
