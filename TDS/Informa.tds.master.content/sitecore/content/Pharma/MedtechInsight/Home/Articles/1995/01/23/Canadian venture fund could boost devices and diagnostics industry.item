<p>A new venture capital fund in Canada has linked up with the` Canadian Medical Research Council (MRC) to target health sciences. In exchange for a share of the profits, the MRC will help the Canadian <strong>[C#199901167:Medical Discoveries]</strong> Fund to identify medical research with potential commercial value. The fund expects to raise around Can$150 million ($107 million) in its first year.</p><p>The fund is run by Medical Discovery Management in conjunction with MDS Health Ventures, an established venture capital company. It is sponsored by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a scientific and professional employees' union, and marketed by Talvest Fund Management. The fund's principal objective is to invest in Canadian health science companies, with particular emphasis on businesses engaged in the early stages of research or product development and on initiatives with global potential. Investors will benefit from tax credits.</p><p>three-stage selection</p><p>Under the fund's three-stage selection process, promising research projects will be identified by the MRC's peer review procedure. The council could make around Can$1 million per year from providing this service if profit forecasts are correct. A panel of medical and healthcare business experts, employed by the fund, will then identify investment opportunities. These will finally be assessed by MDS Health Ventures.</p><p>Selected projects will receive financial and management support. Typical investments will range from Can$1-3 million per project, paid in instalments to reduce risk. Some 50% of investments will be made in early-stage commercialisation projects and 50% in businesses entering the product testing, development and production stages. Targeted companies could become publicly-traded within five years. Several promising projects have already been identified.</p><p>substantial control</p><p>However, the fund also insists on substantial control over business strategy. Scientific and commercial performance will be regularly evaluated and representatives from either Medical Discovery Management or MDS Health Ventures may sit on the companies' boards.</p><p>Fund manager Calvin Stiller stresses the high risk involved. However, he believes the potential for commercialisation of Canada's health sciences industry is enormous because so little has been done to promote and develop the commercial aspects of Can$1,000 million worth of research performed in the field each year.</p><p>other ventures</p><p>MDS Health Ventures is an affiliate of MDS Health Group, claimed to be Canada's largest health sciences company. The venture company also has three other health-related funds worth some Can$200 million. Companies and products in which it has invested include:</p><pre>Company Product Applied Genetics (US) Diagnostic and therapeutic products to address brain disease. Osteopharm (Canada) Bone stimulating factor for diagnostics and therapeutic products for osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Resound (US) Hearing devices. Andronic Devices (Canada) Robotic applications to healthcare problems. Morphometrix (Canada) Products for fast analysis of cytological specimens. ISG Technologies (Canada) Medical imaging workstations for 3D reconstructions of CT and MRI scans. CME Telemetrix (Canada) Infrared analysis techniques for the noninvasive measurement of blood analytes. Abtox (US) Plasma-based sterilisation systems, instruments and supplies.</pre>
