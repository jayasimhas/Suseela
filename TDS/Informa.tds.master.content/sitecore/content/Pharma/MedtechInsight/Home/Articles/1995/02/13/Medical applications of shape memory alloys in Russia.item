<p>The unique mechanical properties, biological compatibility and chemical neutrality of the shape memory alloy (SMA) nitinol make it a useful material for medical implants. Since 1979, when the first application, a surgical staple, was used in the USSR, more than 100 SMA medical implants, tools and devices have been developed and tested and more than 50,000 patients have been treated.</p><p>During the 1980s, a number of Soviet research institutes studied the mechanical and biochemical properties of nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium. Research concentrated on controlling the alloy's thermomechanical properties, in particular on the optimisation of the temperature at which it starts and finishes its shape restitution. This work resulted in the development of a number of NiTi-based SMAs for medical applications.</p><p>distinguishing marks</p><p>NiTi-based SMAs are distinguished by shape recovery after significant deformation (up to 15%). While reshaping, they exert substantial pressure (up to 800 MPa) and exhibit superelasticity over a defined temperature range. NiTi alloyed with a small quantity of molybdenum is especially effective in withstanding the multiple alternating strain loading (up to 20 million load-unload cycles with a deformation of up to 5%) which occur during walking, breathing and other normal activities. The interval between shape restitution start and finish temperatures varies from 10-40degreesC and lies within the temperature range -50-/+150degreesC, depending on the type of alloy. The implants can be sterilised by any standard method.</p><p>Tests in the early 1980s also demonstrated that nitinol has a high corrosion resistance (compared with stainless steel) and an apparent lack of carcinogenic and toxic properties. The alloy is non-magnetic and does not react with biological tissues or liquids.</p><p>how to use an SMA</p><p>SMA implants are manufactured and implanted in several steps. To record its final shape (in which it will be fixed inside the human body), the nitinol implant is "programmed" by isothermal forming at high temperatures (300-700degreesC). The implant retains the information about its final shape but by cooling to 10degreesC immediately before implantation it becomes malleable and can be formed to ease insertion. After implantation, the alloy warms to body temperature and returns to its "programmed" shape.</p><p>SMAs versus tradition</p><p>Studies have been carried out in Novokuznetsk and Tomsk on the treatment of mandible fractures by traditional methods and with SMA implants. The comparison demonstrated that SMA implants can reduce the treatment time by up to 50%; the number of return visits to a surgeon can be cut five-fold; cases of repeated hospitalisation can be reduced; and complications can be minimised.</p><p>After leaving hospital, patients treated with SMA implants had normal chewing and respiratory functions within three days compared with 21 days for patients receiving traditional treatment. Similar results were achieved for treatment of fractures in other locations. These effects were explained by higher bone fixation stability, lower tissue trauma and facilitation of osteosynthesis.</p><p>SMA implants represent potential benefits for elderly people, for whom fractures take longer to mend and can be complicated by senile symptoms and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Near-joint fracture of the humerus, one of the most frequent problems for elderly people, is difficult to treat by traditional methods since surgical operation and external immobilisation are undesirable. SMA implants ensure stable osteosynthesis without heavy fixatives and allow early movement.</p><p>unique uses</p><p>In some instances, SMA implants provide a unique treatment. There are cases when the shape memory effect provides traction or dynamic displacement. One example is treatment of congenital hip dislocation. W-shaped SMA implants are designed to ensure steady distraction loading that enhances correction reliability and prevents relapse. SMA-based dynamic correctors for scoliotic spinal column deformations and SMA fixation for endoprostheses are also unique applications of the material.</p><p>Besides traumatology, clinical practice has shown SMA implants to be useful for stomatology (implants for dental prosthesis fixation, intradental implantation and bite correction); surgery (devices for compression anastomosis, surgical tools with adjustable blade shape and clamps); and otolaryngology.</p><p>An original application of SMAs in otolaryngology is in tools with adjustable blade shapes for rhinosurgery. The most important advantage of these tools is their malleability, while the blade keeps its cutting properties. The surgeon can reshape the blade at the operation site so that the tool fits the patient's individual structure and can be inserted into the nasal cavity. The shape memory effect is used after an operation - during sterilisation the scalpel is heated and returns to its initial shape without residual deformation.</p><p>Another branch of SMA is porous nitinol implants. Biocompatible porous implants are implanted with living tissues and incorporated into the human body. Tooth root implants and porous prostheses for spinal column stabilisation are the most advanced examples of this kind.
