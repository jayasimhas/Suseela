<p>On August 4th US Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala issued a "Special Fraud Alert" warning about illegal practices in the provision of medical supplies to nursing facilities. "This is the second in a series of new fraud alerts that the HHS Inspector General will issue over the next year to make the public and industry aware of fraudulent healthcare products."</p><p>Federal and state governments will pay an estimated $328,000 million for Medicare and Medicaid claims this year and nursing- home costs are among the fastest-growing in these programmes, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller. Officials, therefore, are especially anxious to reduce unnecessary purchases - such as superfluous supplies and equipment; double-billed items; or equipment that is not provided as claimed. Dr Shalala showed a Texas press conference one example of the latter: a $50 wheelchair cushion with straps, billed as an $859 custom-made orthotic body jacket.</p><p>"Many inappropriate transactions involve marketing of incontinence supplies," the Office of Inspector General Alert says. One entrepreneur collected information on deaths among nursing-home residents - and immediately back-dated orders of medical supplies in quantities consistent with Medicare's 30-day limitation on after-death shipments.</p><p>The OIG is generally concerned about the provision of services and equipment to beneficiaries in nursing-homes because of the number of providers involved, Inspector General June Gibbs Brown says. "No single individual or institution is held responsible for managing the beneficiary's care and ensuring that only needed services are delivered to the patient. Many of the incentives run in quite the opposite direction."</p><p>The Fraud Alerts identify segments of the healthcare industry that are especially vulnerable to abuse. Widely disseminated, the documents tell the public what to look for. They also give details on reporting suspected fraud, including a telephone hotline established under "Operation Restore Trust", a federal- state collaboration focused especially on fraud in home healthcare, nursing-home care and durable medical equipment, three of the fastest growing cost areas of the government health programmes.</p>
