<p>British Technology Group (<strong>[C#198601174:BTG]</strong>) will go public - when financial conditions improve. "The market is not very receptive to new issues at the moment and it is particularly unreceptive to anything that smacks of 'high-tech'," says BTG's finance director, Rusi Kathoke. "But if there was a six-month window, we would be ready to go," Clinica's Brigitte Ascher was told in a recent interview.</p>

<p>British Technology Group (<strong>[C#198601174:BTG]</strong>) will go public - when financial conditions improve. "The market is not very receptive to new issues at the moment and it is particularly unreceptive to anything that smacks of 'high-tech'," says BTG's finance director, Rusi Kathoke. "But if there was a six-month window, we would be ready to go," Clinica's Brigitte Ascher was told in a recent interview.</p><p>The aim is to "achieve a more stable capital structure" with a full stock market listing and to raise money for investment in a business in which all costs are up-front followed by 20 or even 30 years of royalty income once a patent is licensed to a manufacturer.</p><p>Analysts have suggested that BTG might be worth anything up to &pound;100 million ($150 million). The present-day company has developed from a public sector organisation set up in 1949 and was the last privatisation before the 1992 UK general election, when a consortium formed by management, employees, UK financial institutions and universities bought BTG for &pound;14 million. The government took another &pound;14 million from the company's cash reserves.</p><p>BTG describes itself as a world leader in the creation, management and commercialisation of intellectual property rights. It has 1,400 technologies on its books - about half of them earning revenues, the rest are in development or in the process of being introduced. BTG's aim is the commercialisation of new technology through the licensing of patents, know-how and copyrights. It holds 10,000 patents and patent applications and has 500 licences with major companies worldwide. The portfolio ranges from pharmaceuticals through automotive transmission systems, to a device to detect glue ear in children.</p><p>BTG's single largest non-government competitor is a purely US operation, Research Corporation. It has a somewhat larger turnover but, unlike BTG, this is almost exclusively from a single cancer drug. Other competing organisations are substantially larger but usually government-owned, such as the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in Germany.</p><p>The overview ... is overseas</p><p>BTG sees future opportunities in sourcing its technologies in Europe and the US and in earning revenue from intercorporate business. Sources for its technologies used to be primarily UK universities and research establishments but are now increasingly overseas universities and companies.</p><p>Overseas companies are described by Rusi Kathoke as a "huge market" in the US. "We sued Johnson & Johnson over MRI licences. J&J sold the business to GE but settled with us out of court. J&J was impressed with the way we had handled the issue and when it was left with about 130 patents and products related to MRI, these were given to us to commercialise."</p><p>This, explains Mr Kathoke, was the beginning of BTG's intercorporate licensing business and the platform on which it established its US subsidiary. "Now we license out for a whole range of household names - ITT, Campbell, DuPont." For J&J the arrangement earns more revenue than a straight sale of the patents; for BTG it means that it is taking on developed technologies that reach the market more quickly with revenues starting earlier.</p><p>With new inventions, the time scales can be long. "Our skill is in anticipating what the market wants in 10 years' time," says Mr Kathoke. BTG usually buys a promising idea outright. "We will share the net revenue - minus development and patenting costs - normally 50-50 with the source." Income will last as long as patents do - usually about 20 years, but BTG says this can be extended to up to 30.</p><p>Success in the company's business is based on extensive networking to source new technologies; a good reputation; and faith in BTG not to divulge proprietary secrets and to implement various legal agreements.</p><p>In fiscal 1994 (ended March), BTG saw sales grow 8% to &pound;29 million ($45.5 million). Pre-tax profit was &pound;4.16 million after a loss of &pound;3.89 million in 1993. Some 85% of turnover came from companies based outside the UK.</p><p>Medtech royalty earners</p><p>Royalty income from medical engineering licences contributed more than 30% to BTG's 1994 turnover. The medical engineering division manages 150 groups of patents together with 60 licences. Colin Hunsley, assistant director of the division, says: "Our source base needs to be expanded and investment in resources in the US and the rest of Europe is the key to accessing inventions in those areas." The following four areas form the focus of the medical engineering group:</p><p>* Imaging and Monitoring: MRI, CT, SPECT, Ultrasound and EIT. Apart from MRI, which is one of BTG's main successes with &pound;60 million in royalties up to 1994 and another 16 years to go, a new fee-earner is Applied Potential Tomography. This monitoring technique was developed at the University of Sheffield to assess lung function based on the fact that air has high and blood low electrical resistance.</p><p>* Disposables: Catheters, incontinence products and infection management. This includes the needle encapsulation technology licensed to the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Critikon. A new revenue-earner in this category is a contact lens manufacturing process which uses part of the mould of daily wear contact lenses as packaging. The patent has been licensed to Boots (UK).</p><p>* Implantables: Range from circulatory support and biomaterials to orthopaedics such as the Exeter Hip which has earned BTG more than &pound;500,000, or the epiphyseal hip, licensed to <strong>[C#198600199:Pfizer]</strong>'s Howmedica. "We have nothing in the cardiac assist area but that would be the sort of thing we would be very interested in," says Mr Hunsley.</p><p>* Dental: Restoratives, cosmetic finishes and devices. BTG considers this a significant market. According to Mr Hunsley: "The dental area is a huge market and some of our products have been earning &pound;250,000-500,000 a year."</p><p>Licensed to fill</p><p>New licensees are sought for the following technologies:</p><p>Glassy Coatings: a method of applying a glassy coating to teeth for fissure sealing and cosmetic purposes by applying sol-gel and heat.</p><p>Liver Assist Device: an implantable pump that normalises portal vein blood flow in order to reduce the incidence of variceal haemorrhaging.</p><p>Glue Ear Detection: a device to identify children most at risk from recurrent glue ear.</p><p>Bone Graft Material: a collagen-based material that is rapidly mineralised when implanted, forming a new bony structure.</p><p>Antioxidant status test: a rapid-test for assessment of total antioxidant status, suitable for testing clinical samples and foodstuffs. Reactive radicals generated in the test are partially neutralised by anti-oxidants in the sample. The remaining reactive radicals combine with a dye to generate a colour which can be measured by most routine laboratory instruments.</p>
