<p>More than 14,000 instruments had been installed in Italian laboratories under reagent rental plan agreements as of December 31st, 1994, according to a report in Il Sole-24 Ore. Evidence from records of materials used with 7,779 instruments showed that over 5,200 had been supplied on condition that the health authority purchased materials or reagents from the same equipment supplier. These preliminary results of a survey conducted by a Health Ministry committee into the extent of reagent rental plans indicate wider usage than expected. The figures do not include Sicily, where magistrates first began investigating the legality of this business practice.</p>

<p>More than 14,000 instruments had been installed in Italian laboratories under reagent rental plan agreements as of December 31st, 1994, according to a report in Il Sole-24 Ore. Evidence from records of materials used with 7,779 instruments showed that over 5,200 had been supplied on condition that the health authority purchased materials or reagents from the same equipment supplier. These preliminary results of a survey conducted by a Health Ministry committee into the extent of reagent rental plans indicate wider usage than expected. The figures do not include Sicily, where magistrates first began investigating the legality of this business practice.</p><p>The survey has demonstrated the pressure the health service was under to conclude such agreements given the lack of capital funds to purchase essential equipment. It has also highlighted the lack of transparency in agreements between health service administrators and suppliers, which sometimes involve the purchase of materials and reagents at exaggerated prices.</p><p>Once it has analysed the results of its survey, the committee will make legislative proposals to the Health Ministry. Work has already begun in this respect: the bill on reagent rental plans is under discussion within the select committee at the Social Affairs Commission of the Italian Parliament (see Clinica No 653, p 5).</p><p>It now seems likely that there will be a two-fold solution - for equipment already installed and for future purchases, which will abolish the use of reagent rental plans in Italy. For equipment already in use, local health authorities (USLs) will be given time to indicate how many instruments they have under reagent rental plans. If they are unwilling to return them, the USLs must work out how to buy them.</p><p>In future, equipment must be bought with capital funds, if possible, or through staggered payment involving public tender notices that establish the value of the equipment, technical support and each type of reagent used with it.</p><p>The final report should demonstrate: the correctness and efficiency of individual services; the types of contract drawn up; and whether tendering was used in the purchase of reagents.</p>
