<p>The UK government continues to support breast implantation in the UK since "no clear evidence" has emerged to support the link between silicone gel breast implants and connective tissue disease.</p><p>The Department of Health will, however, continue investigating the link theory in a crusade to bring "this expensive controversy to an end". Its intention is made clear in a December report on the debate, produced by the Medical Devices Agency and incorporating the views of the Independent Expert Advisory Group (see Clinica No 638, p 2). The Advisory Group was first set up in 1992 to assess the evidence for an association.</p><p>The MDA contends that the standard of many papers reviewed has been "disappointingly poor". As a result it has been impossible to draw conclusions from much of the original research. Findings are often based on inadequate or inappropriate controls and "an apparent disregard for accepted standards of scientific proof", it laments. The public's perception of the debate has been coloured by a "disturbing tendency ... to seize upon experimental findings as proof irrespective of the conclusiveness or quality of the data".</p><p>Most reviews considering the data in their entirety, on the other hand, conclude that there is no proof of a causal link, MDA states. These include a review by the Canadian Independent Advisory Committee and the American Medical Association Task Force. The trend of the emerging evidence from studies meeting accepted standards of quality and proof should provide additional reassurance to recipients of silicone breast implants, says the MDA.</p><p>The MDA's conviction is supported by statistical evidence. Since the 1970s the incidence of connective tissue disease among breast implant recipients has been no greater than in the general population. According to MDA's "conservative estimates", the prevalence of Scleroderma in US recipients is "at least 15-fold lower than estimated by chance".</p><p>the hidden costs of legal action</p><p>MDA is also concerned that health services worldwide will suffer as a result of the breast implant controversy. The cost of class actions and of other cases involving implant manufacturers (see page 17) has prompted some polymer manufacturers to discontinue supply of materials for certain medical applications (see Clinica No 640, p 7). The extension of the controversy beyond purely scientific matters highlights the need to establish the "validity of any claims about the health effect of implant materials", MDA warns.</p><p>The study, Silicone Implants and Connective Tissue Disease, was written following the evaluation of some 270 papers. It contains sections on: literature reviews; studies in animals and explanted human tissue; and clinical studies. It is available, for &pound;75, from the Medical Devices Agency at 14 Russell Square, London WC1B 5EP. Tel: +44 (171) 972 2000.</p>
