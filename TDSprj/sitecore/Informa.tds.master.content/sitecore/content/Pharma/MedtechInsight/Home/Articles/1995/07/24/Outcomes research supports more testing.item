<p>Testing saves money. David Firn heard the latest results from three projects at the AACC Conference in Anaheim, US.</p><p>Last year the Association of Analytical Clinical Chemistry awarded three research grants aimed at finding data to support its proposition that lab testing can provide better outcomes for patients and save money. The recipients looked at PCR for tuberculosis, enzyme tests in acute myocardial infarction and serum albumin for predicting post-surgical mortality and morbidity.</p><p>With funding from the coffers of <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong>, Baxter, <strong>[C#198600358:Bayer]</strong>, Ciba Corning and Roche, the projects not surprisingly came up trumps. Chairman of the project committee Dr Lemuel Bowie put it another way: "Testing saves money when we focus on appropriate use." But are the data as strong as AACC would like?</p><p>TB - PCR versus culture</p><p>A three-day PCR protocol can cut 48 days from the time taken to rule out TB by culture and 21 days for culture-positive cases. A one-day test could get patient out of hospital 58 days sooner than traditional testing, said Dr Karen Kaul of the Evanston Hospital in Illinois. Dr Kaul and her colleagues compared TB culture to both home-brew PCR and Roche's Amplicor kit in 228 samples from 67 patients. She admitted that good sample preparation for the home-brew test is costly and both types of PCR assay produced false positives. However, the overall cost savings were significant. Some 30% of the patients proved to have TB, 55 out of the 228 samples were positive by PCR and 30 were smear-positive.</p><pre>Smear positive samples Culture +ve -ve In house PCR +ve 29 0 -ve 0 1</pre><p>The Roche kit gave the same results. More important, however, is finding TB in smear-negative patients, who would be discharged only to return more ill and having infected more people.</p><pre>Smear-negative samples Culture +ve -ve In-house PCR +ve 20 16* -ve 1 157 * includes six patients who subsequently produced positive culture samples.</pre><p>The Roche kit produced five false negative results and missed three culture-positive cases. The in-house test produced twice as many false positives as the Roche assay but both tended to pick up the same samples, suggesting that the samples themselves may have been contaminated.</p><p>Ignoring the six false positives which subsequently turned out to be genuine TB cases, the in-house PCR test had a positive predictive value of 72.2% and a negative predictive value of 99.4%. Sensitivity and specificity were 96.3% and 94% respectively.</p><pre>Potential outcomes Outcome Test results Patients Smear PCR Culture Earlier detection & treatment - + + 10 PCR or culture incorrect - + - 2 PCR or culture incorrect - - + 0 Earlier certainty/no change - - - 33 Earlier diagnosis + + + 9 PCR or culture incorrect + + - 0 PCR or culture incorrect + - + 0 Earlier diagnosis MOTT + - - 0</pre><p>Culture speciation results were available after an average of 22 days for smear positive patients and 51 days for those with negative smears but clinical symptoms of TB. For PCR this was cut to three days in both cases.</p><p>With a three-day PCR turnaround time patients could be moved to regular hospital beds 11 days earlier and sent home four weeks sooner than patients waiting for culture results. With a one day turnround this could be cut to discharge patients from isolation 46 days and home 58 days early.</p><p>So should everyone switch to PCR? Not necessarily. It depends on prevalence and the sort of patient you are dealing with, said Dr Kaul.</p><p>Secondly - Rapid diagnostics for AMI</p><p>Not only does enzyme testing in AMI improve patient outcomes and cut total costs, it cuts lab costs too. "The patients were sent home so quickly the physicians never got a chance to order all the tests they like to try on difficult chest pain cases," said Dr Philip Anderson, leader of the Virginia Commonwealth University Acute Cardiac Team (ACT).</p><p>Over 11 million Americans visit an emergency department because of chest pain every year. About five million are admitted to hospital but only three out of ten actually have AMI. Only half will be diagnosed at presentation and $13,000 million a year is spent on ruling out heart attacks.</p><p>The ACT goal was diagnosis for high risk patients in 20 minutes and three hours for low-to-medium risk patients, who would be sent to a nuclear medicine unit for a SestaMIBI scan.</p><p>The group performed stat, CK-MB mass myoglobin and total CK assays with results returned immediately in 250 consecutive chest pain patients. Outcomes were compared with 333 control patients treated in 1993 when tests were batched and performed twice a day - mass assays took three to four hours to report and electrophoresis 15 to 25 hours. Low-risk test group patients were also subjected to a standardised nuclear imaging protocol.</p><p>The researchers focused on two key patient-types: those with non-diagnostic ECG who were eventually ruled in for AMI and those highly symptomatic for AMI but who were eventually ruled out. The first group included eight test patients and 10 controls, the second group 139 test patients and 133 controls.</p><pre>Outcomes for rule-in patients Test group Controls Hospital days 3.3 4.7 Total costs $ 6,562 7,824 Lab costs $ 715 911 Mean time to diagnosis (hr) 3 20 Patients treated 6/8 5/10 Treated in 24 hr 3 0 Cost Savings Mean number of procedures 1.2 1.6 Mean hospital days 3 4.4 Total costs $ 5,965 7,432 Variable costs* $ 3,607 4,749 Cost of lab tests $ 751 897 * excludes overheads = saveable dollars</pre><p>According to Dr Anderson, enzyme testing using a random access immunoanalyser and nuclear medicine could save $100,000 a year in lab costs and create overall savings of $1.1 million a year at the Virginia Commonwealth Health Center alone. "Extended to the whole of the US, that is $4.4 billion," he said. Why did it work? "The appropriate use of technology and the involvement and acceptance of all the relevant departments. Rapidly available CK-MB and myoglobin results play a critical role."</p><p>And thirdly - serum albumin testing</p><p>Serum albumin testing can save between $116 and $215 by targeting nutritional support. Dr James Gibbs analysed data from the Veterans' Affairs Surgical Risk Study. Serum albumin was the best indicator of 30-day mortality and morbidity in the 51,215 major non-cardiac surgery cases. "The cost seems quite small in relation to its prognostic function as a marker of malnutrition," he said. "SA testing is a cost-effective component of nutritional support programmes and perioperative nutritional support. Nutritional support is more effective when SA is used, rather than subjective assessments of malnutrition."</p>
