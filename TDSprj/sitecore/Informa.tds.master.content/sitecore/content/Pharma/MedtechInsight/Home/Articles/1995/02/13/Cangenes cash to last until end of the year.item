<p>Canadian development-stage company <strong>[C#198600453:Cangene]</strong> says its cash will be insufficient to fund operations beyond the second quarter of fiscal 1996. It is on the lookout for a major corporate collaboration or licensing agreement for its development products which include its NASBA technology. Organon Teknika introduced a research-use RNA amplification-based HIV test based on NASBA in North America in August 1994 (see Clinica No 620, p 19).</p>

<p>Canadian development-stage company <strong>[C#198600453:Cangene]</strong> says its cash will be insufficient to fund operations beyond the second quarter of fiscal 1996. It is on the lookout for a major corporate collaboration or licensing agreement for its development products which include its NASBA technology. Organon Teknika introduced a research-use RNA amplification-based HIV test based on NASBA in North America in August 1994 (see Clinica No 620, p 19).</p><p>Cangene has reported sales of Can$2.17 million, down 42% on the previous year, for fiscal 1994 (ended July). Its loss increased to Can$7.18 million from Can$5.21 million in fiscal 1993. The fall in revenue was mainly caused by the absence of technology transfer payments relating to its NASBA technology from Akzo Nobel's diagnostics subsidiary, Organon Teknika, payments which accounted for Can$1 million in revenues during fiscal 1993.</p><p>Cangene expects to record higher revenue for fiscal 1995 resulting from higher NASBA royalties from Akzo and from higher research contract revenue. Expenses in fiscal 1994 were pushed up by advisory fees incurred to fight off Pharma Patch's hostile takeover bid (see Clinica No 612, p 14).</p>
