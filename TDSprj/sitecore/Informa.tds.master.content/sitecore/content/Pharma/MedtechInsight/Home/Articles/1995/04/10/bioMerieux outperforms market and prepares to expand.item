<p>Major changes at diagnostics manufacturer bioMerieux over the last six months mean the company is now wholly French-owned. In addition, its holding company bioMerieux Alliance has taken control of genetic therapy company <strong>[C#198700558:Transgene]</strong>. This increased liberte and fraternite seems likely to herald a new expansion strategy for bioMerieux and a flotation looks set before the end of the century. Bernard Gilly, bioMerieux' corporate research director talked to Clinica's Jon Bryant about the company's plans at its Lyons headquarters.</p><p>bioMerieux recorded a 10% rise in revenues in 1994, outperforming a declining French diagnostics market, and showed signs that it may be looking for further alliances. Following the purchase of <strong>[C#198600118:Becton Dickinson]</strong>'s 49% share in bioMerieux last September (see Clinica No 631, p 1), chairman Alain Merieux and co-owner the CGIP have just injected another Fr 300 million ($61 million) into the new holding organisation bioMerieux Alliance (formerly Bio Participations).</p><p>Turnover reached Fr 2,411 million in the year, up from Fr 2,196 million in 1993, which the manufacturer says will launch it into the world's top ten diagnostic companies. bioMerieux claims to be number four in Europe after German giants Boehringer Mannheim, <strong>[C#198600358:Bayer]</strong> and Behring. Net profits for the year were Fr 118 million, representing some 5% of turnover. At a Paris press conference at the end of March, Mr Merieux told reporters he hoped to maintain at least this level of profitability over the next five quarters with a 5-7% rise in sales over the same period.</p><p>Group turnover 1990-94</p><p>The reason for bioMerieux' success in a declining French market has been its ability to occupy niches inside the diagnostic industry, says Mr Gilly. He also cites the company's broad international network and its focus on infectious diseases. The world infectious disease market, of which bioMerieux has a 13.5% share, is still growing, albeit slowly. Cost constraints are at the heart of problems in the biochemical diagnostic industry, he told Clinica.</p><p>The French diagnostics market fell some 9% last year; while the European market decreased by an estimated 5%. However, the company expects the European market to grow 3-4% next year. and the world diagnostics market to increase because of rapidly expanding markets in developing countries.</p><p>Breakdown of group activity</p><p>bioMerieux has a revenue target of Fr 2,500 million for fiscal 1995, ending September 30th, which represents a 4% growth rate. In the first six months, sales are "slightly up". However, because currency is risk-managed in Lyons, changes in European money value have had a negative impact on consolidated turnover, according to the company.</p><p>While the RMO medical guidelines in France have had a major impact on private laboratories' diagnostics sales (see Clinica No 641, p 4), these have primarily affected biochemistry. Of increasing importance to bioMerieux' sales, especially in the US, is the overall cost of its products, which includes set-up time, instrument processing, servicing of tools etc. The overall price of running kits and the purchase of new software thus become more important than the individual price of the kit. In the US, where this information is required by purchasers, it brings a new level of economic concern to the product, says Mr Gilly. North American sales represent 24% of bioMerieux' revenues. Europe as a whole represents 69%, of which France has a 31% share.</p><p>Geographical breakdown of sales</p><pre>Breakdown of world diagnostics market: South America 2% Other 6% USA 39% Europe 36% Asia Pacific 17%</pre><p>In a $15,000 million world diagnostics market, a third is accounted for by biochemistry and another third by immunoassays. Infectious diseases represent almost 10% of the world market; bioMerieux is ranked number one in microbiology, with 24% of the world market.</p><p>The company plans to set up Russian and Turkish facilities this year, Mr Gilly told Clinica, to add to its subsidiaries in Europe, the US, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, South Korea, Poland, Taiwan and China.</p><p>research and development</p><p>The company has spent a billion francs on research and development over the last five years, representing some 10% of annual revenue, and spent Fr 239 million in 1994.</p><p>VIDAS, the company's automated EIA analyser, developed in the early '90s (see Clinica No 512, p 8), has a menu of some 40 different assays, including HIV-1, virology, cancer markers and steroids. Since the VIDAS system is user-friendly, it is particularly suited for developing markets. "The normal life for an immunoanalyser is around 7-10 years," says Mr Gilly. "After the seventh year, you have to bring in new techniques to stay ahead of the market." bioMerieux has a number of new tests under development for its VIDAS system, including two probe-based tests scheduled for launch in 1996. The VIDAS system, of which the company has placed 2,500 in the world, can carry out 60 tests per hour.</p><p>The company is also developing an NSB system, which is scheduled for launch in 1997. "It is faster and better than the existing VITEK bacteriology system," says Mr Gilly and can detect over 80 different species of bacteria and their susceptibility to antibiotics.</p><p>nucleic acid technology</p><p>The future of diagnostics, believes Mr Gilly, lies in the use of molecular biology and nucleic acid technology. Two months ago, the company launched a programme to develop a closed, fully-automated system for amplification and detection. A system is expected to be launched by 2000. According to Mr Gilly, the system's first menu will be for antibiotic resistance with results ready in two hours. This menu will be followed by probe-based diagnostics for bacteria, viruses including HIV, and cancer.</p><p>The first part of the programme has already borne fruit in the form of bioMerieux' HLA-DR oligo detection system. It is currently a manual system, which the company will launch in June. The HLA-DR is a test based on direct determination of polymorphism of the DNA level. The system uses reverse hybridisation technology to detect over 40 HLA-DR types on the DRB1, DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5 loci. Single-sample testing and simultaneous detection of up to 20 samples can be performed with identification being obtained 90 minutes after amplification. "There is increasing evidence that the HLA profile is involved in a lot of diseases, including infectious diseases," says Mr Gilly.</p><p>gene therapy</p><p>Jean-Pierre Thierry, director of the national hospital equipment centre (CNEH), commented last year that one way to rejuvenate the depressed French biomedical industry would be for companies to seek as yet undeveloped areas in the market, such as gene therapy. bioMerieux Alliance, has done just that through a recent coalition with Strasbourg-based Transgene.</p><p>Transgene was founded in 1980 as a biotechnology research company, acting mainly as a boutique for pharmaceutical companies. Since 1992, however, it has concentrated exclusively on genetic therapy.</p><p>Group structure</p><p>While the two companies' products are not directly related, bioMerieux Alliance claims to have a global approach to the diagnosis and therapy of diseases on longer term. The link will be molecular biology. "The scientific and technological content of gene therapy is more important than in classical pharmaceutical compounds," says Mr Gilly.</p><p>future flotation</p><p>There has been much speculation in the French press about a future flotation of the company. The purchase of Becton Dickinson's stake in the company and the creation of the alliance suggest bioMerieux is a company which wishes to change scale. Other alliances or acquisitions may also be under discussion if the company is to move towards flotation as Mr Merieux has suggested. If both the company's revenues and the condition of the stock market are suitable, it is likely the company will go public within the next five years.</p>
