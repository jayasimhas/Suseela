<p>Critics are launching at least one major attack on the US FDA Center for Devices & Radiological Health every week now. The underlying message seems to be that the European system is far better; the US system must change. The calls for change are all being made within earshot of Congress, often by allies of the new Republican majority, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p>

<p>Critics are launching at least one major attack on the US FDA Center for Devices & Radiological Health every week now. The underlying message seems to be that the European system is far better; the US system must change. The calls for change are all being made within earshot of Congress, often by allies of the new Republican majority, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>The latest chorus comes through loud and clear in the Competitive Enterprise Institute's new report, "How FDA is Causing a Technological Exodus - a comparative analysis of medical device regulation in the United States, Europe, Canada & Japan". Released on February 14th, the study is certainly no valentine.</p><p>"Medical device regulation in the United States during the past 30 years has been driven mainly by political forces, especially by the reaction of members of Congress and FDA officials to shocking or scandalous revelations widely disseminated by the news media. Even without such revelations, however, the same political actors strove relentlessly to increase the scope and detail of the regulations," the report charges.</p><p>Other countries have been far less influenced by political considerations, the CEI contends. Specialists in standards organisations rather than lawyers have produced their regulations. The FDA has far more discretionary authority than other countries far fewer established standards. "US regulatory requirements are a 'moving target,' as individual reviews can and routinely do <strong>[C#198700592:alter]</strong> the requirements for product approval and the process unfolds."</p><p>In the 50-page report, the CDRH's activities are criticised from premarketing requirements to postmarketing reporting.</p><p>push not pull</p><p>The exodus from the US is not necessarily motivated by a more attractive market in Europe, notes the report. Given the recession of the last few years in Europe, "the recent movement offshore represents a regulatory push out of the US rather than an economic pull toward Europe," CEI reasons.</p>
