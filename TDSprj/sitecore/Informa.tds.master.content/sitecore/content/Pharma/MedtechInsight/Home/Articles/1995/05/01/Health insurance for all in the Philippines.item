<p>Radical new legislation in the Philippines, passed by Congress in February, seeks to extend the coverage of the country's existing Medicare health insurance programme to all Filipinos, including the unemployed and the very poor. Low incomes and the prohibitive cost of healthcare lead the majority of Filipinos to defer seeking medical treatment until a problem becomes life-threatening. Filipinos spend on average no more than 1.7% of income on health, says the Manila Times.</p>

<p>Radical new legislation in the Philippines, passed by Congress in February, seeks to extend the coverage of the country's existing Medicare health insurance programme to all Filipinos, including the unemployed and the very poor. Low incomes and the prohibitive cost of healthcare lead the majority of Filipinos to defer seeking medical treatment until a problem becomes life-threatening. Filipinos spend on average no more than 1.7% of income on health, says the Manila Times.</p><p>Medicare health insurance is at present limited to private sector and government employees and their dependents - some 24 million of the Philippine population of over 63 million, of which 4.52 million pay into the scheme. The new scheme would initially bring in an additional 18.6 million members, predominantly agricultural and forestry workers, fishermen and domestic workers in private homes. Indigents and those whose income is insufficient to support their families will also be enrolled in the programme, which will be progressively expanded until it covers the entire population.</p><p>The National Health Insurance Act of 1995 provides for the establishment of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC), which will be given quasi-judicial powers to implement the new programme. The PHIC is authorised under the law to increase the premium rates paid by existing Medicare members to as much as 3% of salary. It will also be able to select healthcare providers for participation in the scheme.</p><p>expanded package</p><p>The new insurance system will cover both inpatient and outpatient treatment, unlike the present scheme which only reimburses hospital-based care. The benefit package will include emergency services; all hospital accommodation expenses; diagnostic procedures; use of surgical and medical equipment; and prescription drugs and biological products "subject to limitations". Non-prescription devices and drugs are excluded from coverage, as are cosmetic surgery, home and rehabilitation services, optometry and "cost-ineffective procedures" as defined by the PHIC. The medical industry association PHAP has proposed to the government that non-prescription drugs and devices should be reimbursable if they are prescribed by a doctor.</p><p>Herculean task</p><p>Substantial additional funds will be needed to cater for the expanded membership base, particularly since only 5.8 million of the 18.6 million new members will pay contributions into the scheme. According to the Manila Times, extra payments of around Pesos 3,000 million ($116 million) annually will be added to current Medicare expenditure of some Pesos 2,400 million. The government plans to raise finance for the new scheme through increased tax on tobacco and via other taxes. Some members of Congress doubt whether these sources of funding will be sufficient, however.</p><p>Another challenge facing the PHIC is to reach the large proportion of self-employed and unemployed in the population. Two decades after it was set up, Medicare only covers 20% of its target clientele, despite its compulsory nature, says the Manila Times. The scheme will also need to address the problem of "shrinking support value" - the amount covered by health insurance compared with total treatment costs. It was originally intended that Medicare would cover at least 70% of the cost of a private hospital stay; however, this was reduced to 50% in 1993.</p><p>implementation uncertain</p><p>According to the PHAP, no timetable for implementation of the new insurance scheme has yet been agreed. Since Congress has now gone into recess in anticipation of the elections in May, it is unclear when work will begin. However, the PHAP says it has been invited to join the government working group which will be responsible for drafting the implementing regulations.</p>
