<p>Judgement has been delivered in China's first intellectual property infringement trial, reports Clinica's China correspondent. The Beijing Intermediate People's Court ruled that two local medical equipment companies had infringed the patent rights of Zhoulin on its "broad-spectrum wave therapy device". The defendants - Beijing Aomei Mechanic-Electronic Joint-Development Company and Beijing Hua'ao Electronic Medical Equipment Company - were ordered to cease manufacturing and selling their products immediately, pay the plaintiff Yuan 2 million ($241,000) compensation and issue a public apology.</p><p>Zhoulin filed the lawsuit in July 1991, demanding that the companies stop what it regarded as a serious violation of its patent. Its product, which is described in the patent as a "therapy device and means of production of wave frequency matching the effect field of the human body", has been granted patent protection in China, Japan and the US, among other countries. It has also won several awards, including the World Intellectual Property Organisation's Gold Medal.</p><p>The Aomei and Hua'ao companies have been marketing wave therapy devices since 1991 and 1993, respectively. Between them, they have sold more than 20,000 units, generating profits in excess of Yuan 1.14 million and Yuan 210,000 by the end of last year.</p>
