<p>Two months after an FDA panel recommendation for approval, <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> CardioRhythm's Atakr radiofrequency catheter ablation system has been cleared by the US agency (see Clinica No 633, p 1). The device, which was under expedited review, is the first cardiac ablation system that automatically controls the temperature of the ablation electrode, says Medtronic.</p>

<p>Two months after an FDA panel recommendation for approval, <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong> CardioRhythm's Atakr radiofrequency catheter ablation system has been cleared by the US agency (see Clinica No 633, p 1). The device, which was under expedited review, is the first cardiac ablation system that automatically controls the temperature of the ablation electrode, says Medtronic.</p><p>Atakr is the second cardiac ablation system to be approved in the US: EP Technologies' system received approval at the end of 1994 to treat certain types of tachyarrhythmia (see Clinica No 628, p 1). The FDA had threatened to withdraw 510(k)s for diagnostic catheters with electrode tips over 2 mm last year because of concerns about unapproved use in cardiac ablation (see Clinica No 620, p 9) but no action has resulted yet.</p><p>Medtronic's new generation Jewel Plus tachyarrhythmia device entered US clinical trials this month with the first implant on February 20th. Small enough to be implanted in the pectoral region, the Jewel Plus Model 7218 is designed to detect and treat ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The US clinical trials will test the effectiveness of the device in discriminating between a normal rapid heart rate (such as that caused by exercise) and an abnormal rate which requires treatment.</p>
