<p>As Don Earhart looked at the round soap container in the bathroom he found the answer to the design problem facing I-Flow. The company wanted to develop an ambulatory pump as an alternative to stationary pole gravity for the fusion of IV antibiotics. The conundrum was to devise a means of maintaining consistent delivery of the drug while the patient was mobile. The round container, realised Mr Earhart, provided the answer.</p>

<p>As Don Earhart looked at the round soap container in the bathroom he found the answer to the design problem facing I-Flow. The company wanted to develop an ambulatory pump as an alternative to stationary pole gravity for the fusion of IV antibiotics. The conundrum was to devise a means of maintaining consistent delivery of the drug while the patient was mobile. The round container, realised Mr Earhart, provided the answer.</p><p>From such simple concepts I-Flow has developed a range of portable delivery systems which generated $7 million revenues in 1994 and the company's first profits in the final quarter of last year. While Mr Earhart, chairman, president and CEO of the Irvine, California-based company, admits he cannot compete with the Baxters and Abbotts in the domestic market on volume, he believes his systems have the competitive edge in terms of cost, durability, storage and ease of use.</p><p>product portfolio</p><p>The soap container provided the key to I-Flow's SideKick Ambulatory Gravity System. It comprises a coiled-spring infuser which delivers medication contained in a DISC (a round PVC mini- bag with an attached administration set). When the DISC is placed on the bottom half of the infuser and the two halves are screwed together, the spring applies pressure to the DISC. The flow rate is controlled by the diameter and length of tubing of the administration sets.</p><p>I-Flow has just signed an exclusive deal with Central Labs (Ireland) to supply SideKick to Central Home Care, a partnership between Central and Syntex, for the UK and Irish markets. Mr Earhart considers the UK launch timely since homecare is just taking off in that market.</p><p>In the US, SoloPak has exclusive distribution rights to the SideKick pump which retails at around $15; the one-piece administration system is less than $6. This is in a different league to I-Flow's initial product, the <strong>[C#199400040:VIVUS]</strong> 4000 - claimed to be the only four-channel remote-controlled, ambulatory infusion system. Launched on the US homecare market in 1991, the VIVUS system costs around $5,000 (this compares with $3,500-4,000 for single- or two-channel systems). Some 1,500 devices have been sold to date in the US, while a limited number of devices have been made available in Canada. European marketing is planned once a suitable distributor has been found.</p><p>The VIVUS system is capable of delivering four separate medications (antibiotics/tissue-plasminogen activator (t- PA)/analgesics/chemotherapy) at individual rates. Candidates include bone marrow transplant recipients, cystic fibrosis sufferers (who require multiple antibiotics) and AIDS patients.</p><p>Using the same spring mechanism as SideKick, the Paragon infuser is capable of delivering medications requiring slow, continuous and constant infusion, such as chemotherapy and analgesics, as well as short-term therapy such as antibiotics and anti-emetics. Paragon, priced at $200, is sold in the US for homecare use, although I-Flow would like to find a distributor for the hospital sector, where Mr Earhart sees cost advantages. Outside the US, Kobayashi sells the system for post-operative use in Japanese hospitals. <strong>[C#198601363:Fresenius]</strong>, well-established in the homecare market, distributes the device under the UltraFlow name in Germany.</p><p>products nearing market</p><p>Of I-Flow's 100-strong workforce in Irvine, three engineers are working on new designs for delivery systems. Some $300,000 was devoted to R&D in 1994 and more will be spent this year, says Mr Earhart. US FDA clearance has recently been granted for two systems. A device similar to Paragon which can be used with standard rectangular mini-bags will be launched at the end of this year by a "large corporate partner". A disposable device for patient controlled analgesia which employs no electronics and can be used with any continuous infusion pump such as the Paragon is nearer the market.</p><p>The PCA device, which will compete with the Pharmacia-Deltec electronic pump costing around $2,000, is expected to be available in the third quarter. I-Flow expects it to receive the CE mark within the next two months. It will be introduced simultaneously on the US and international hospital and homecare markets.</p><p>US approval is pending for a delivery system in which syringes replace the IV bags. The design solution for this device, Bandit, was a rubber band. Pressure from the band ensures continuous delivery of antibiotics for home or hospital use. The CE mark is expected from the TUV San Diego office by May.</p><p>Work on an enteral feeding pump using the same mechanisms as the rectangular pump should be completed by the end of year, according to Mr Earhart. Funding for the development is being provided by a commercial partner. Work is also under way for a device which will deliver a 60 ml standard syringe and on larger IV bags for use in ambulances.</p><p>small company "getting bigger"</p><p>Mr Earhart forecasts revenues of over $10 million in 1995 and expects a profitable year. In 1994, $1.3 million was achieved from sales outside the US and these are expected to double this year. Through its distributors, I-Flow is making an early start in the international homecare market. The need for good distribution partners is underlined by Mr Earhart, who believes that the international market could be as important for I-Flow as the US market in two years' time.</p><p>Founded in 1984 by an oncologist who wanted a system to deliver several drugs through just one infusion device, I-Flow became a public company in 1991. It has raised $20 million in private placements and has not had to resort to venture capitalists. Revenues grew 23% in 1994 to $7 million primarily as a result of increasing demand for the Paragon and SideKick systems. Net income for the final quarter of 1994 (ended December 31st) was $47,000 compared with a net loss of $642,000 in the 1993 fourth quarter.</p>
