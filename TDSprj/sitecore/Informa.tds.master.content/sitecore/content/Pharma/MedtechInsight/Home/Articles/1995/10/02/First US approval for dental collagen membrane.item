<p><strong>[C#200000448:Integra LifeSciences]</strong> has received US FDA marketing clearance for BioMend, an implantable collagen membrane, for tissue regeneration procedures in periodontal defects following oral surgery. Believed by the company to be the first such clearance, BioMend will be marketed in the US by Calcitek (part of Sulzermedica).</p><p>Made from bovine Achilles tendon, BioMend has demonstrated complete closure of furcation defects. It absorbs into surrounding gingival connective tissue through collagenase degradation. Apical migration of epithelium is prevented and space for periodontal ligament and bone regeneration is maintained. The membrane remains intact up to seven weeks and is fully absorbed in eight weeks. US marketing clearance was based on data from eight trial sites involving over 130 patients.</p><p>Calcitek has worldwide distribution rights to BioMend. Marketing approval has been granted in France and Spain, the company told Clinica. Approval is pending in Italy and South Africa. Calcitek expects to obtain CE marking by the second quarter of 1996.</p><p>other projects</p><p>Integra is developing tissue regeneration devices for severely damaged skin, severed peripheral nerves and damaged cartilage. A premarket approval has been submitted to the US FDA for use of a dermal replacement product (called Integra) for severe burns. Clinical trials are planned with the product in plastic and reconstructive surgery and chronic skin ulcers. Additionally, Integra LifeSciences intends to conduct clinical trials with its peripheral nerve regeneration conduit product this year. Trials on cartilage regeneration are expected to start next year.</p><p>Integra, based in Plainsboro, New Jersey, has developed its technologies as a result of a combination of the following companies: Integra (Artificial Skin), which was formed to acquire from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Marion Merrell Dow technologies related to the Integra product; Vitaphore (former subsidiary of Union Carbide); Colla-Tec (former subsidiary of Marion Merrell Dow); ABS LifeSciences; Biomat; and, most recently, Telios Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>The company manufactures a range of products used in surgical haemostasis, ophthalmology, dental surgery, infection control and wound care, which are marketed by distributors.</p><p>Future applications of its biomaterials, regenerative medicine and extracellular matrix technologies include: controlled drug delivery; constructing replacement organs; and seeding extracellular matrices with patients' own cells or donor cells for tissue regeneration.</p>
