<p>The Japanese government will this month publish its medical procurement tenders for 1995, according to Pharma Japan. The number of items will be substantially higher than the 181 issued in 1994 and US companies are expected to gain a larger share of the business, following framework talks between the two countries last year (see Clinica No 624, p 9). Details will be published in the Official Gazette by the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Department of National Hospitals this month and bids should open in April. Contract prices will be negotiated with successful bidders in June.</p>
