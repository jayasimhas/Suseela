<p>Supplies of medical grade silicone could be severely curtailed if Dow Corning decides to withdraw from the market following its Chapter 11 filing on May 15th. Faced with potential silicone breast implant claims from 7,000 women who opted out of the global settlement and a $2,000 million contribution to the settlement fund, Dow Corning decided to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law. By ceasing to supply silicone to manufacturers of medical devices, the company would avoid future potential lawsuits relating to devices containing silicone when it completes its Chapter 11 reorganisation.</p>

<p>Supplies of medical grade silicone could be severely curtailed if Dow Corning decides to withdraw from the market following its Chapter 11 filing on May 15th. Faced with potential silicone breast implant claims from 7,000 women who opted out of the global settlement and a $2,000 million contribution to the settlement fund, Dow Corning decided to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy law. By ceasing to supply silicone to manufacturers of medical devices, the company would avoid future potential lawsuits relating to devices containing silicone when it completes its Chapter 11 reorganisation.</p><p>Dow Corning's continuing participation in the medical materials business will come under review by the board who will be asking "does it carry too much liability?" a spokeswoman for the company told Clinica. Dow Corning says it will stay in the business if the US FDA will 1) confirm that silicones are needed and are appropriate biomaterials for many critical care applications; and 2) affirm the position of the UK and French health authorities that there is no connection between silicone and autoimmune disease.</p><p>Some 3% of Dow Corning's global $2,205 million revenues are derived from medical grade silicone. The leading supplier worldwide, it claims to be the only significant company with a plant which meets US GMP standards for medical silicone. It supplies 80-90% of the US market and over 50% of global demand. Other suppliers include NuSil (US), Wacker (Germany), Shin-Etsu (Japan) and Rhone-Poulenc (France).</p><p>Dow Corning withdrew from the long-term implant grade silicone market two years ago but continued to supply several large manufacturers under indemnity agreements. It still supplies medical grade silicone for implants of less than 30 days (catheters, tubing) and non-implantable devices, including <strong>[C#199901331:transdermal]</strong> drug delivery patches.</p><p>only option to resolve lawsuits</p><p>Explaining the Chapter 11 filing, Dow Corning's chairman and CEO, Richard Hazleton, said the company was preparing for nearly 200 cases in the next six months which "represented a potentially enormous financial and management drain which threatened our business .... We cannot both fund the global settlement and afford large numbers of lawsuits outside the settlement." The filing immediately halts all new lawsuits and puts pending litigation on hold.</p><p>The company aims to preserve its participation in the global settlement, to which it is the largest contributor, and is "continuing discussions with ... attorneys to reach a satisfactory agreement," according to Mr Hazleton. Dow Corning is involved in negotiations along with other defendants, including <strong>[C#198600502:Baxter International]</strong>, <strong>[C#198601245:Bristol-Myers Squibb]</strong> and 3M, to modify the agreement. Last month Judge Sam Pointer announced that the fund was insufficient to meet the number of claims filed (see Clinica No 653, p 8).</p><p>The filing to prevent bankruptcy was also prompted by the slow reimbursement by insurers to Dow Corning, explained Mr Hazleton. The company has received less than $100 million of the $1,500 million which it claims it is owed.</p><p>While financial reorganisation is planned, Dow Corning, its subsidiaries and joint ventures will continue to trade normally. There are no European breast implant lawsuits pending against the company. Some 7,000 women decided to opt out of the global settlement and reserve the right to pursue litigation against Dow Corning in the US. Of the 7,000 opt-outs, 5,000 are Americans.</p><p>no federal charges</p><p>Just prior to filing for Chapter 11 protection, Dow Corning received notification from the US Department of Justice that the grand jury investigating the company's silicone gel operations has concluded its two-year inquiry without bringing federal criminal charges. The investigation, begun in February 1993, reviewed information subpoenaed from Dow Corning as well as other documents supplied by the company (see Clinica No 541, p 1).</p><p>Dow Corning pulled out of the medical device business in 1993 with the sale of its Dow Corning Wright subsidiary - now trading as Wright Medical Technology (see Clinica No 556, p 1). If it halts supply of all medical grade silicone it will no longer have any healthcare business interests.</p><p>US industry association HIMA is concerned that if Dow Corning does cease medical grade silicone production it "will have an enormous impact on patients and the medical device industry", senior vice-president James Benson told Clinica. Manufacturers of devices ranging from pacemakers, defibrillators and CNS shunts to replacement joints and condoms "will be forced to halt production or search for alternative suppliers of silicone". That, says Mr Benson, may prove to be enormously difficult - if not impossible - because other producers may not be able to compensate for the shortfall.</p>
