<p>Shares of Pacific Dunlop, the Australian conglomerate troubled by Telectronics' faulty pacemaker leads, slid 5% in response to the interim results announced last week. These showed a fall in profits compared with a year earlier. Pacific Dunlop's shares closed at Aus$2.86 ($2.20) on February 15th, down 5% from the previous day. In total, the shares have fallen 30% since the lead problems first surfaced.</p><p>Last November, Pacific Dunlop's subsidiary Telectronics recalled three models of lead after finding that some had fractured, causing two deaths (see Clinica Nos 632, p 2 & 639, p 1). At the end of January, news broke that two lawsuits had been brought against the company. When presenting the interim results, Pacific Dunlop said that six separate sets of legal proceedings have been instituted in the US which will probably be merged into a class action. Telectronics will contest the proceedings but Pacific Dunlop has yet to appoint a law firm to represent its interests.</p><p>interim results</p><p>Group revenue was up 5.7% at Aus$3,780 million in the first half of fiscal 1995. Sales by the Nucleus group, which mainly consists of Teletronics, are given as Aus$187 million, down 6% from the previous year. Unit sales of leads have fallen 25, according to Pacific Dunlop. The company's first-half profit after tax but before extraordinary items was Aus$151.3 million compared with Aus$150.5 million a year earlier. After a pre-tax charge of Aus$45.5 million, mainly to cover costs related to Telectronics, bottom line profits were down 24% to Aus$114 million. The company has set aside Aus$40 million to cover the costs of having all leads examined, monitored and if necessary removed. It is estimated that about one in 40 Americans who have pacemakers have the models in question, according to Dr Susan Alpert of the FDA's CDRH.</p>
