<p>Manufacturers may not have to register every medical device in Greece after all. The supplementary measure introducing this requirement is to be reconsidered by a new Competent Authority, as will the applications of ELOT and Ekevil as Notified Bodies.</p>

<p>Manufacturers may not have to register every medical device in Greece after all. The supplementary measure introducing this requirement is to be reconsidered by a new Competent Authority, as will the applications of ELOT and Ekevil as Notified Bodies.</p><p>The government was about to appoint a new regulatory department as Clinica went to press. Responsibility will pass from the Health Ministry's biomedical technology division, headed by Mr E Papandreus, to an organisation. "I am not in a position to comment,", Mr Papandreus regretted</p><p>Mr Papandreus told Clinica in May that the Health Ministry was intending to require registration for products in Classes II and III of the Directive. This would have gone beyond the Directive's requirements for registration of Class I, custom- made devices and sterilised products. It was considered particularly onerous for industry and far exceeded the demands elsewhere in the European Union.</p>
