<p>The new herpesvirus (HHV-8) found in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma is probably also responsible for causing the disease in HIV-negative homosexual men and the classic form of the disease. According to Drs Patrick Moore and Yuan Chang of Columbia University, New York, the same herpes-like DNA is present in all three forms of the disease. Because it is associated with certain sexual practices, CMV infection and geographic regions it is probably sexually transmitted and not simply an opportunistic infection in AIDS patients, they say (New England Journal of Medicine, May 4th). The researchers found HHV-8 DNA in 95% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients, but only in 5% of control samples.</p>

<p>The new herpesvirus (HHV-8) found in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma is probably also responsible for causing the disease in HIV-negative homosexual men and the classic form of the disease. According to Drs Patrick Moore and Yuan Chang of Columbia University, New York, the same herpes-like DNA is present in all three forms of the disease. Because it is associated with certain sexual practices, CMV infection and geographic regions it is probably sexually transmitted and not simply an opportunistic infection in AIDS patients, they say (New England Journal of Medicine, May 4th). The researchers found HHV-8 DNA in 95% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients, but only in 5% of control samples.</p><p>In a second paper, researchers from Cornell Medical Center and Drs Moore and Chang report the presence of HHV-8 in AIDS-related, body-cavity-based lymphomas. The researchers say they found HHV-8 DNA together with the Epstein-Barr virus genome in eight out of 193 lymphomas from 42 AIDS patients. All eight, and only those eight, were body cavity lymphomas, which suggests that the new herpesvirus has a pathogenic role in AIDS-related, body-cavity-based lymphomas. The infected lymphoma cells contained 40 to 60 copies of the HHV genome each, compared with only one in each Kaposi's sarcoma cell.</p>
