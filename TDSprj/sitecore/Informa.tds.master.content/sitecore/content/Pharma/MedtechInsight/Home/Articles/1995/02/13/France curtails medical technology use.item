<p>The French Health Ministry has published its proposed 1995 list of new medical guidelines which will affect the rate of use of some categories of medical equipment and certain diagnostic tests. According to the Quotidien du Medecin, the new guidelines, along with some modifications to previous ones, will be added to the 1994 list. They will take effect when the annual covenant between the national sickness insurance organisations and the doctors unions is signed and approved by the government.</p>

<p>The French Health Ministry has published its proposed 1995 list of new medical guidelines which will affect the rate of use of some categories of medical equipment and certain diagnostic tests. According to the Quotidien du Medecin, the new guidelines, along with some modifications to previous ones, will be added to the 1994 list. They will take effect when the annual covenant between the national sickness insurance organisations and the doctors unions is signed and approved by the government.</p><pre>The new guidelines cover, amongst other things, the use of: * MRI and scanners in spinal arthroscopy and lumbago; * electromyography; * hip prostheses; * electro-encephalography; * intra-ocular implants; * ophthalmic lasers; * digestive endoscopy; * routine ultrasound scans in pregnancy; * digestive endoscopy; * breast cancer screening * cervical screening; * pre-surgery tests; * hCG pregnancy tests; and * tumour markers.</pre><p>The guidelines, of which there are some 150, are part of the covenant originally signed in November 1983 between the doctors' associations and the national health insurance organisations in an effort to control health expenditure.</p><p>The laboratory analyses industry has been under constant pressure over recent years due to the guidelines which have brought about a continual reduction in test prescriptions. According to SFRL, the French diagnostic industry association, laboratory turnover suffered a further severe reduction in 1994 and reagent sales fell 5% in the nine months to September. Industry turnover dropped sharply as a result.</p>
