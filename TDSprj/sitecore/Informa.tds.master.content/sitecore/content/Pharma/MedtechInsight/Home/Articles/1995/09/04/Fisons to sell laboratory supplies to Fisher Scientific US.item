<p>In its third disposal within six months, Fisons (UK) intends to sell most of its laboratory supplies division to Fisher Scientific (US) for $310 million in cash. This sale would pare the UK company down to its $730 million-turnover pharmaceutical business, which is the target of a hostile $2,700 million bid from US-based Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>

<p>In its third disposal within six months, Fisons (UK) intends to sell most of its laboratory supplies division to Fisher Scientific (US) for $310 million in cash. This sale would pare the UK company down to its $730 million-turnover pharmaceutical business, which is the target of a hostile $2,700 million bid from US-based Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p><p>Fisher Scientific would acquire Fisons' two main businesses within the laboratory supply division - US-based Curtin Matheson Scientific and Fisons Scientific Equipment of the UK. Sales of the acquired businesses were around $750 million in 1994 and would raise Fisher's annual turnover close to $2,000 million. The deal is subject to approval by Fisons' shareholders and regulatory review.</p><p>The sale of the last remaining lab supplies business, J&W Scientific, a US-based manufacturer of gas chromatography capillary columns, is in late-stage negotiations, Fisons says. Completion of an earlier disposal of Fisons' laboratory equipment operation to Thermo Instrument Systems has been delayed to the end of September due to anti-competition issues raised in the US (see Clinica No 668, p 12).</p><p>The disposal of the lab supplies business would increase Fisons' cash coffers to some $950 million before tax and bolster its defence against RPR's hostile bid. RPR, the 68%-owned drugs subsidiary of French chemicals company Rhone-Poulenc, is seeking to turn it into a friendly takeover and appears prepared to increase its offer, currently standing at 240 pence a share.</p><p>Fisons' defence document will probably be published on September 4th, followed by its interim results. Fisons is said to be in talks with several companies on various defensive options. These include a higher takeover offer from a third party or a takeover by Fisons of another company to make itself too large to be easily swallowed.</p>
