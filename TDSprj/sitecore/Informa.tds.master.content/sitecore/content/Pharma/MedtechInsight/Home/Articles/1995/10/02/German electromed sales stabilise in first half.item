<p>The 1995 first half finally saw a slight upturn in domestic sales for the German electromedical industry. The member companies of the electromedical industry association (ZVEI) achieved a domestic turnover of DM 1,150 million ($772 million), up 2% on the first half of 1994. Last year's equivalent figure had been 5% below the 1993 level. The association maintains that it is too early to speak of a turnaround, however, since the development of the domestic market will be greatly affected by the course of further healthcare reforms.</p>

<p>The 1995 first half finally saw a slight upturn in domestic sales for the German electromedical industry. The member companies of the electromedical industry association (ZVEI) achieved a domestic turnover of DM 1,150 million ($772 million), up 2% on the first half of 1994. Last year's equivalent figure had been 5% below the 1993 level. The association maintains that it is too early to speak of a turnaround, however, since the development of the domestic market will be greatly affected by the course of further healthcare reforms.</p><p>Exports, meanwhile, increased 10% compared with the 1994 first half to DM 1,730 million, accounting for 60% of total turnover of DM 2,880 million. Orders from abroad, however, were significantly down on the 1994 first-half level which means that total turnover for 1995 may be lower than for the 1994 full year. German electromedical companies are still under heavy price pressure and the association fears that, if they are to survive in the competitive international market, further rationalisation measures, possibly including more redundancies, may be unavoidable.</p><p>Domestic sales of imaging systems and radiotherapy accounted for 46% of the DM 1,150 million achieved in the first six months of 1995, while medical electronics represented 36%, ultrasound 14% and nuclear medicine 3%.</p><p>Imaging systems and radiotherapy took a greater share of foreign sales with 65% - or DM 1,125 million - while medical electronics accounted for 28%, ultrasound 4% and nuclear medicine 1%.</p>
