<p>A second suitor has emerged for Bird Medical Technologies just as the Californian company had agreed to be acquired by Thermo Electron. Allied Healthcare Products has topped Thermo's bid for Bird with an offer combining 51% of its stock with cash worth $9.50 per Bird share. Bird had previously entered into a letter of intent to be acquired by Thermo in a stock-for-stock merger valued at $8 per Bird share (Clinica No 659, p 16). Bird says the letter of intent does not represent a binding commitment but includes Bird's agreement not to engage in discussions with any third party bidders until July 9th. Bird intends to "evaluate seriously the Allied proposal". Bird's shares closed at $8.50 on June 20th.</p>
