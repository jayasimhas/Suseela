<p>US company InStent, which specialises in the development of self-expanding stents, plans to seek FDA approval this year for its VascuCoil peripheral vascular stent and its CardioCoil coronary stent.</p><p>InStent's EndoCoil biliary stent is awaiting approval at the agency for use in malignant obstruction of the bile duct in pancreatic cancer patients. To date, the company markets one product in the US - EsophaCoil, which was approved in February for malignant obstruction of the oesophagus due to cancer. Several of InStent's products are sold internationally, including the EsophaCoil, the EndoCoil, the UroCoil for recurrent urethral strictures, and the ProstaCoil for bladder outlet obstruction, which are all available in 32 markets worldwide.</p><p>Products in development at InStent include a stent graft for use in repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms and a number of bioabsorbable stents, including prostatic and oesophageal stents which are in preliminary trials in Europe and Israel. InStent spent $1.1 million on R&D in 1994, up 90% on the previous year.</p><p>Earlier this year, InStent issued a prospectus for an offering of 3,250,000 shares of common stock, aimed at raising $39 million net. The company expects to spend about $16 million on clinical trials.</p><p>Net sales for the first quarter were $422,000 against $84,000 in the 1994 quarter, and InStent's net loss fell from $586,000 to $423,000. Unit sales more than doubled in the period, as did sales in Germany, Italy and France. During the quarter, InStent obtained distributors for its products in the UK, Belgium, Iceland and Australia.</p><p>InStent's 1994 sales rose almost sixfold to $772,000, boosted by a 400% increase in sales in France, Germany and Italy, while new distributors in Spain, Greece, Finland and South Korea added revenues of $132,000. About half of InStent's unit sales in 1994 were of the EsophaCoil and the EndoCoil. The company's net loss rose from $2.2 million to $2.4 million last year.</p>
