<p>Norland Medical Systems (the Netherlands) is reducing to 50% its ownership of Ostech, a US distributor of bone densitometry systems, through an offering of 2 million shares at $10.50 each. Ostech, which achieved a net income of $68,044 on revenues of $10.04 million in 1994, began operations in January 1994 as the exclusive distributor of systems produced by Norland (US) and Stratec Medizintechnik (Germany), both owned by NMS.</p>

<p>Norland Medical Systems (the Netherlands) is reducing to 50% its ownership of Ostech, a US distributor of bone densitometry systems, through an offering of 2 million shares at $10.50 each. Ostech, which achieved a net income of $68,044 on revenues of $10.04 million in 1994, began operations in January 1994 as the exclusive distributor of systems produced by Norland (US) and Stratec Medizintechnik (Germany), both owned by NMS.</p><p>Norland manufactures bone densitometers based on dual-energy X- ray technology, while Stratec produces systems based on peripheral quantitative computed tomography. A desktop screening device, pDEXA, jointly developed by the two manufacturers was recently added to Ostech's range, notes the prospectus for the offering.</p><p>At the end of May 1995, Ostech had 12 employees, seven of whom were engaged in sales and marketing. Outside the US and Canada, Ostech depends on third-party distributors, such as Nissho Iwai American for Japan and Meditec for Korea. International sales represented 92.5% of 1994 revenues, with Japan accounting for 33.9% and Korea for 30.2%. In the first quarter of this year, sales to Nissho were 81.5% of Ostech's total revenues of $3.9 million, boosted by the introduction of the pDEXA system. Sales of this desktop system - all of which were in Japan - accounted for 69.2% of first-quarter revenues. US market clearance for the device was received in February this year. Primary US competitors for the DXA system are identified as Hologic and Lunar.</p><p>product development</p><p>Some $3.5 million derived from the offering will be used to finance product R&D by Norland and Stratec. Enhancements to the pQCT systems under development at Stratec include the XCT960 for forearm scanning and the XCT3000 for scanning weight-bearing bones such as the tibia and femur. The German company is also developing a system for measuring bone at the neck of the femur to enable more direct assessment of hip fracture risk and to monitor hip implants. A high <strong>[C#199200264:resolution]</strong> pQCT scanner is being developed for research laboratories. Norland has recently upgraded its XR36 DXA-based bone densitometry system with the XR QuikScan which reduces scanning time from 5-8 minutes to 2-6 minutes.</p><p>litigation</p><p>Ostech is the subject of a US lawsuit filed by Ostex claiming infringement of its trademark and name (see Clinica No 667, p 9). Ostech considers it has substantial defences to the claims.</p><p>* Ostech's shares had risen to $15.50 on Nasdaq at the close of trading on August 11th.</p>
