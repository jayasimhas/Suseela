<p>Leeds Antenatal Screening Service (LASS) at the University of Leeds has launched a private antenatal screening service for cystic fibrosis (CF). A similar service was launched by UDL (UK) in December (see Clinica No 634, p 17).</p><p>Antenatal screening has been available in the UK through limited pilot studies since the gene for CF was discovered in 1989. However, the university's Prof Howard Cuckle believes that the findings of LASS's study of over 5,000 pregnancies "demonstrate the feasibility of introducing CF screening into routine obstetric practice".</p><p>The procedure involves extraction of DNA from a mouthwash sample. This is analysed for four common mutations, which together account for 85% of UK carriers, and for an additional mutation common in carriers of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. A fee of &pound;98 ($156) is being charged for the service, which offers results within 7-10 working days from receipt of the sample.</p><p>One in 25 people in the UK are CF carriers and for couples where both partners are carriers, the chances of having an affected child are one in four.</p>
