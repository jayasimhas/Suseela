<p>Retaliation against device and drug manufacturers is routine at the FDA, delaying or denying availability of important products, witnesses told the US House Commerce Committee subcommittee on oversight and investigations on July 25th. "The threat of retaliation is deeply embedded in the culture of this agency," Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA) claimed. "That threat - spoken or unspoken - is used by bureaucrats to avoid the more difficult task of promulgating clear rules based on sound science." Clinica's Washington correspondent Duffy Miller reports on the catalogue of alleged cases of retaliation revealed at the hearing.</p>

<p>Retaliation against device and drug manufacturers is routine at the FDA, delaying or denying availability of important products, witnesses told the US House Commerce Committee subcommittee on oversight and investigations on July 25th. "The threat of retaliation is deeply embedded in the culture of this agency," Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA) claimed. "That threat - spoken or unspoken - is used by bureaucrats to avoid the more difficult task of promulgating clear rules based on sound science." Clinica's Washington correspondent Duffy Miller reports on the catalogue of alleged cases of retaliation revealed at the hearing.</p><p>Earl Wright, vice-president of Inventive Products, related his company's unsuccessful ten-year effort to gain approval for the Sensor Pad, a simple product intended to help women to detect breast lumps. Inventive Products finally decided to challenge the agency's contention that the Pad was a device and to launch it without FDA approval. The agency seized 30,000 Pads and filed suit. Inventive lost.</p><p>"We made a decision not to appeal further and voluntarily ceased distribution, but once more met with FDA to discuss approval. During that meeting, we were intimidated and threatened by an agency lawyer," claims Mr Wright. The fight has cost Inventive over $2.5 million and nine years of patent life.</p><p>Mr Wright said he had planned to announce that he would close the Sensor Pad business at last Tuesday's hearing. However, the FDA appears to have changed its stance and he considers that progress was made at a meeting with Office of Device Evaluation officials last week. Mr Wright has decided to try to raise the money necessary to bring his product to market.</p><p>Myo-Tronics' "devastating losses"</p><p>"There is no way for Myo-Tronics to recover the devastating losses that the FDA's abuse and misuse of its authority has caused," Roland Jankelson, co-owner of Myo-Tronics, said in a prepared statement distributed at the hearing. "Our employment has been cut by half, extraordinary legal costs and management resources have been expended, and a 25-year reputation as a pioneer in leading edge [clinical dentistry] technology has been badly tarnished."</p><p>Mr Jankelson is scathing in his prepared comments on agency behaviour over the last four years, alleging "overzealous regulation and possible criminal activity", even claiming at "co-operation between certain FDA officials and employees and outside private interests to improperly and illegally remove the company's instrumentation from the marketplace. We have asked the FDA to investigate these acts to determine whether they violate criminal statutes".</p><p><strong>[C#198600122:Biomet]</strong> claimed that it encountered problems in gaining approval for orthopaedic devices after president Dane Miller prepared a White Paper on the company's experiences with the FDA regulatory process. "My only objective in preparing this paper and publicly appearing on panels to address regulatory issues was to communicate to the public the consequences of a regulatory process that is too often based on knee-jerk reactions from Congress and a media which concentrates too extensively on sensationalised stories driven by the plaintiff's bar," he told the subcommittee.</p><p>Since Mr Miller's statements in 1993, "our ability to communicate and resolve problems through open, unpoliticised dialogue with the FDA seems to have changed". He blames "the process, not individuals" at the agency, and said he is "fearful" for both patients and industry.</p><p>"These stories are no rare exceptions," chairman Barton told the Subcommittee. Many US device manufacturers believe the FDA's power "is so pervasive that voicing even the slightest nuance of frustration or dissatisfaction with the agency results in retribution", a HIMA statement from president Alan Magazine said. "Frankly put, many in the medical device industry choose silence over coming forward publicly as a matter of survival for their companies .... This hearing is long overdue."</p><p>And this is just the beginning, Mr Barton says. "To the extent we can, we will try to address some of these issues through legislation, but I will take action now to instil a level of accountability and provide a recourse for those with legitimate grievances about FDA abuses." He announced that the House Commerce Committee has created an e-mail channel through which "allegations of FDA abuses can be reported to this subcommittee. This will enable us to establish a comprehensive and responsible means of addressing allegations of FDA abuse. Where it is justified, the subcommittee will investigate and refer matters to the appropriate authorities".</p><p>one-sided hearing</p><p>No FDA officials appeared at the hearing to refute witnesses' charges. Commissioner David Kessler had declined to attend, citing insufficient time to prepare himself. He is expected to give the agency perspective sometime after early August although Clinica notes that Congress is due to begin the summer recess next month.</p><p>* The e-mail address is FDAABUSE@HR.HOUSE.GOV.</p>
