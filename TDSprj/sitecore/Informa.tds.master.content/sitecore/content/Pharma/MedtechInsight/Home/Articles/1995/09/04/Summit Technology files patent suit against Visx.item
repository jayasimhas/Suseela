<p>Summit Technology has filed suit in the Delaware District Court against Visx for infringement of its excimer laser patent no 4,973,330. Summit is seeking damages for past infringement for all excimer lasers manufactured by Visx in the US for international use. It is also seeking to enjoin Visx from manufacturing and selling excimer lasers for any purpose other than US clinical trials. In March this year the FDA approved Summit's PMA application to commercialise its excimer laser systems in the US for phototherapeutic keratectomy (see Clinica No 646, p 20).</p>

<p>Summit Technology has filed suit in the Delaware District Court against Visx for infringement of its excimer laser patent no 4,973,330. Summit is seeking damages for past infringement for all excimer lasers manufactured by Visx in the US for international use. It is also seeking to enjoin Visx from manufacturing and selling excimer lasers for any purpose other than US clinical trials. In March this year the FDA approved Summit's PMA application to commercialise its excimer laser systems in the US for phototherapeutic keratectomy (see Clinica No 646, p 20).</p><p>The suit reopens a medley of patent disputes between Summit and Visx which was settled in 1992 when the companies formed the Pillar Point partnership. Summit subsequently obtained patent 4,973,330 and, as required by the Pillar Point agreements, offered Pillar Point the opportunity to purchase it, which was declined.</p><p>Visx files against Herbert Schwind</p><p>California-based Visx has filed a suit in Germany against the company Herbert Schwind for violating several of its patents. The action has been brought against Schwind's Keratom ophthalmic excimer laser systems, distributed in most countries by Coherent. The Visx patent portfolio covers the core technology for the excimer laser, a technology in which Visx has made a "substantial investment".</p>
