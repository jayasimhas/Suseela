<p>Genelabs Technologies and Chiron are negotiating an agreement for a worldwide diagnostics alliance which is intended to capitalise on both companies' positions in hepatitis and retrovirus technologies. Under a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Chiron and its partners will develop and commercialise products for diagnosing and screening Genelabs' newly-discovered hepatitis G virus. In return, Genelabs and Chiron will cross-license certain other product and market rights for hepatitis and retrovirus technologies, including Chiron's hepatitis C virus. This requires the approval of Chiron's partner, Ortho Diagnostic Systems, to which Chiron intends to offer an equal partnership.</p>

<p>Genelabs Technologies and Chiron are negotiating an agreement for a worldwide diagnostics alliance which is intended to capitalise on both companies' positions in hepatitis and retrovirus technologies. Under a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Chiron and its partners will develop and commercialise products for diagnosing and screening Genelabs' newly-discovered hepatitis G virus. In return, Genelabs and Chiron will cross-license certain other product and market rights for hepatitis and retrovirus technologies, including Chiron's hepatitis C virus. This requires the approval of Chiron's partner, Ortho Diagnostic Systems, to which Chiron intends to offer an equal partnership.</p><p>The agreement envisages commercial rights for Genelabs to Western Blot and rapid diagnostic tests in Asia, except Japan. The alliance would also resolve any potential conflict with respect to HCV intellectual property. Genelabs will receive licence payments for HGV and an equity investment from Chiron which could amount to $24 million. Chiron will additionally pay up to $9 million to Genelabs for the development of HGV diagnostics.</p><p>Pending a definitive agreement, Chiron will provide Genelabs with $5 million, creditable toward Chiron's licence payments or its $10 million investment in newly issued Genelabs convertible preferred stock. Five years after closing, Chiron can convert its stock either into Genelabs common stock at $3 per share, or use it toward half the purchase price of a new holding company for virtually all Genelabs' diagnostic interests. The agreement provides for negotiating the price of the remainder of this business.</p>
