<p>Diagnostics made the news more often for mergers than scientific breakthroughs in 1994. But with the human genome giving up its secrets at an ever quickening pace more hereditary diseases were tracked down in 1994. One of the most exciting discoveries was announced in September when US researchers published details of BRCA1, the gene which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. David Firn reviews the year's molecular milestones.</p><p>Genetic factors are estimated to contribute to 5% of all breast cancer cases, but around 25% of cases diagnosed before the age of 30. The BRCA1 gene is believed to be responsible for 45% of familial early- onset breast cancer and often occurs in families with a history of ovarian cancer.</p><p>A team of US and UK scientists mapped a second locus, BRCA2, to chromosome arm 13q. Their findings suggest that this second gene appears to account for a proportion of early-onset breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1 but does not influence ovarian cancer risk. Ovarian cancer, though less frequent than breast cancer, is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in American women.</p><p>In March, a Johns Hopkins team announced that it had found another hereditary nonpolyposis cancer (HNPCC) gene - hMLH1. Defects in the two genes may be responsible for most cases of HNPCC - one of the most common genetic diseases - which affects 1 in 200 people.</p><p>Scientists at the University of Texas identified a gene involved in psoriasis. The gene turned out to be at the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 17, not in the human lymphocyte antigen locus (HLA), as previously thought.</p><p>A nine-year search of chromosome 16 finally pinpointed the gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD affects one in 1,000 people and about 10% of kidney dialysis and transplant patients in Europe and the US have the disease. The search for the gene, PKD1, was made difficult by the complexity of the surrounding DNA. The breakthrough came when the scientists found a Portuguese family with both ADPKD and a translocation of DNA between chromosomes 16 and 22.</p><p>UK scientists found two new genes associated with insulin dependent diabetes. One of the genes, located on chromosome-6 is probably related to sensitivity of the islets of Langerhans, the insulin-producing cells that are destroyed in type 1 diabetes. The function of the other gene, found on chromosome 11q, is unknown.</p><p>A multinational study confirmed that the CAG trinucleotide expansion seen in Huntington's disease is a highly sensitive and specific marker for inheritance, worldwide. Measurement of the number of CAG repeats is said to be both simpler and cheaper than genetic linkage testing. In July, Genica, a US based manufacturer of diagnostics and therapeutics for neurological diseases, launched a PCR test for spinocerebellar ataxia - based on amplification of the CAG repeat.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease</p><p>The announcement in November that a simple eyedrop test could diagnose Alzheimer's disease was widely reported and came only days before the disclosure that Ronald Reagan had the disease.</p><p>A Harvard Medical School team linked hypersensitivity to tropicamide, a cholinergic antagonist, to patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease. The test is said to be 95% accurate in distinguishing patients with clinically diagnosed or suspected Alzheimer's disease. Patients with other types of dementia had a similar response to normal controls, suggesting that the pupil dilation assay may be specific for Alzheimer's pathology, say the researchers. Genica has acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to the eye test.</p><p>Imaging techniques are also homing in on the subtle brain changes involved in Alzheimer's disease. The University Hospital of Cleveland is collaborating with Mallinckrodt Medical to test a SPECT technique. The researchers are using (99m)Tc-labelled 10H3, an antibody for alpha-amyloid. Diatech (US) is also testing an alpha-amyloid antibody in collaboration with Harvard and Minnesota Universities.</p><p>In December, a team from Oxford (UK) unveiled a technique combining CT to study structural changes in the medial temporal lobe and SPECT to assess blood flow in the parietal lobe of suspected Alzheimer's patients. The researchers say the combination of CT and SPECT can detect 90% of cases. The medial temporal is thought to be the focus of damage while reduction in metabolic activity in the parietal is also an indicator of the disease.</p><p>New HIV Virus Foxes AIDS Tests</p><p>The changing pattern of HIV infection struck the European diagnostics industry last year, with the detection of subtype-O in France, Spain and possibly Switzerland. In one investigation, kits made by Murex and Clonatec failed to give strong positive results in 11 patients infected with the new subtype. Most of the confirmed cases of O-HIV infection have spent time in Cameroon, where it has been recognised for some time. Murex altered its kits but Clonatec - with its HIV-1 test withdrawn and facing patent litigation from Sanofi over its HIV-2 tests - went into receivership.</p><p>The US CDC assessed a range of immunoassays against O-HIV. Virus lysate-based kits tended to fail, while those based on recombinant or synthetic peptide antigens performed better. All missed at least one specimen.</p><p>The CDC believes the risk to US blood supplies is very low indeed. HIV-2, which, like O-HIV, is endemic in Africa, has not been found in US donor blood, despite a $30 million screening programme launched in 1992. Donor criteria aimed at malaria prevention would exclude O-HIV infected blood, at least for several years, says the CDC. Nevertheless the CDC cautions that the danger posed by divergent HIV strains is a real concern to the medical community.</p><p>In December, the Paul Ehrlich Institute took 10 HIV tests off the market in Germany because of low sensitivity during the seroconversion phase. However, the BGA and Health Ministry vetoed the use of p24-antigen tests for blood screening, saying it would not be cost-effective.</p><p>Home HIV Testing</p><p>Home HIV testing remains controversial in the US. The FDA has said it will not allow such products unless the manufacturer can assure adequate counselling. J&J says it has a complete programme mapped out for Ortho's as yet unapproved test but the homosexual community is split on the issue and initial pressure to make home tests available has turned to opposition. In November, a coalition of advocacy groups asked the FDA to take action against J&J for alleged illegal promotion of its home HIV-test.</p><p>A number of other companies are collaborating on home-tests including Waldheim Pharmazeutica (Austria) and Anonymous Test Services (US). ATS is racing to develop a home collection kit for use with Waldheim's detection techniques. Coonan Clinical Laboratories (US) is also in the race and Trinity Biotech (Ireland) is collaborating with Harvard to develop a rapid HIV-1/2 test which Trinity says will be for over-the-counter sale. Right at the end of the year, <strong>[C#198600593:Epitope]</strong> received US FDA approval for Orasure, its oral specimen collection device - almost three-and-a-half years after filing the PMA. Orasure is not for home use but Epitope says it will target that market if the FDA changes its policy.</p><p>In July, the Institut Pasteur and US <strong>[C#198600351:NIH]</strong> settled their long-running dispute over the discovery of the HIV retrovirus. The French organisation will receive a larger share of test-kit royalties under an agreement that acknowledges the role of French samples in Dr Robert Gallo's ground-breaking work on the virus.</p><p>In August, 1993 Chiron launched an HIV monitoring service in the US based on its branched-DNA amplification technology. The test, which costs about $200 per patient, competes with high-cost methods based on reverse transcription PCR</p><p>There are more than one million known cases of AIDS worldwide. However, the WHO puts the true figure at 4.5 million - 70% in Africa. The WHO believes a further 19.5 million are infected with HIV.</p><pre>AIDS cases in Europe France 32,722 Germany 11,854 Italy 24,511 Spain 27,584 UK 9,865 source: WHO</pre><p>H Pylori</p><p>1994 saw increasing acceptance of the role of H pylori in peptic ulcer disease and the launch of several tests. Cortecs (Aus/UK) launched Helisal Rapid Blood, the UK's first doctor's office test for H pylori, in June. Endoscopists have resisted non-invasive diagnostic techniques but moving testing into the doctor's office could open the flood-gates for H pylori testing. Also in June SmithKline Diagnostics (US) received FDA marketing approval for its point-of-care H pylori serum test, FlexSure HP.</p><p>Up to 10% of the US population suffers peptic ulcer disease at some time and 25 million people have the disease at any one time. Doctor's office H pylori testing could save the UK NHS &pound;100 million ($150 million) a year.</p><p>Cystic Fibrosis</p><p>Several companies launched cystic fibrosis gene tests. <strong>[C#199000319:Raggio-Italgene]</strong> launched a test for deltaF 508, the most common mutation, in July. In September, UK chemicals giant Zeneca entered the clinical diagnostic market in association with the former Kodak Clinical Diagnostics, launching a PCR-based cystic fibrosis test. Cambio (UK) is developing antibodies directly from a number of gene sequences including cystic fibrosis. Although its PCR work is focused mainly on infectious disease testing, Roche is evaluating a cystic fibrosis test.</p><p>PSA</p><p>The US FDA changed its attitude to PSA screening and in September approved <strong>[C#198601109:Hybritech]</strong>'s Tandem PSA assay for prostate cancer - as long as it is carried out in conjunction with a digital rectal examination.</p><p>PCR</p><p>PCR patent-holder Roche is the undisputed market leader with kits for HIV-1, HCV, HTLV-I & -II, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trichomonas, HLA typing and quantitative RNA-kits for HIV-1 and HCV available in Europe. January should see the launch of a multiplex STD panel (chlamydia and gonorrhoea); kits for M avium, M intracellulare and enterovirus should follow. Roche expects to launch Cobbas Amplicor, its automated PCR system, in Europe in the autumn. A broad European patent on thermostable DNA polymerases is likely further to strengthen the company's position.</p><p>Kodak Clinical Diagnostics (KCD) won non-sublicensing rights to PCR in its 1993 settlement with Roche. However, the future of KCD PCR in-the-pouch technique looked uncertain during 1994 as Eastman Kodak sold off its non-imaging businesses. KCD re-emerged on December 21st as Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostics with a commitment to launch the PCR machine within two years. The company introduced CF(4)m-PCR, a cystic fibrosis gene detection kit, in the UK in September and in December, University Diagnostics (UK) launched a home collection service based on the Kodak kit.</p><p>LCR & NASBA</p><p>In April Roche and <strong>[C#198600101:Abbott]</strong> announced an agreement that allows the two companies to operate under each other's amplification patents. Abbott expects to bring clinical products to market through a deal with Perkin-Elmer.</p><p>Organon Teknika launched an amplification-based research-use HIV test based, on <strong>[C#198600453:Cangene]</strong>'s NASBA in Europe and North America.</p><p>Netherlands-based Organon, which holds a share in Cangene, purchased Siska Diagnostics, owner of the 3SR amplification technique, in March. Siska subsequently lost its US patent interference case against Cangene in June.</p>
