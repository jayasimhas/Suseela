<p>Scimed Life Systems (US) has settled two lawsuits related to the proposed merger with Boston Scientific. Among other issues the lawsuits alleged that the consideration for the deal was grossly inadequate. Although Scimed maintains that it acted properly in approving the proposed merger, the Minneapolis-based company has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to "eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation". The Memorandum is an agreement in principle to certify the lawsuits as a class action; to reduce fees payable by Scimed to Boston if the merger is not completed as a result of Scimed receiving an alternative offer; and to reimburse the plaintiffs' expenses up to $250,000.</p>

<p>Scimed Life Systems (US) has settled two lawsuits related to the proposed merger with Boston Scientific. Among other issues the lawsuits alleged that the consideration for the deal was grossly inadequate. Although Scimed maintains that it acted properly in approving the proposed merger, the Minneapolis-based company has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to "eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation". The Memorandum is an agreement in principle to certify the lawsuits as a class action; to reduce fees payable by Scimed to Boston if the merger is not completed as a result of Scimed receiving an alternative offer; and to reimburse the plaintiffs' expenses up to $250,000.</p><p>The merger was announced in November valuing Scimed at around $850 million (see Clinica No 629, p 1). The deal is to take the form of a stock swap leaving Scimed shareholders with 35% of the new company. Proxy statements seeking approval of the merger have been mailed to the shareholders of Scimed and Boston and a special meeting has been scheduled for February 23rd.</p><p>Furthermore, the merger remains subject to final approval by the Federal Trade Commission. Asked whether similar problems to those delaying the Boston merger with Cardiovascular Imaging Systems (see this page) might endanger the deal, a Boston spokesman told Clinica: "It is possible but we do not anticipate that. We do not think the combined market share would be a problem for the FTC." In the US angioplasty catheter market, Scimed holds around 20% and Boston has a share of up to 5%.</p>
