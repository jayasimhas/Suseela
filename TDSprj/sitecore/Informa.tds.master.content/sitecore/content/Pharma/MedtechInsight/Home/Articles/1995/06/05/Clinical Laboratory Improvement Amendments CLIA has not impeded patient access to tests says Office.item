<p>Within the next few months, the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) will announce that strict new rules and federal regulation of clinical laboratories have apparently not limited patient access to certain tests, reports Clinica's Washington correspondent, Duffy Miller.</p><p>The 1992 rules, implementing the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, extended federal regulation to all sites - including physicians' offices and other facilities previously exempt. Concern was voiced that many of these physicians' labs might cease operation and thus restrict patient access. The Health Care Financing Administration, which drew up the regulations, asked the HHS OIG to assess the effects of the new law and its implementing regulations.</p><p>The OIG has now completed that study and a draft has been circulated to HHS and HCFA officials for comment. The final version will be released after the bureaucrats return their comments - probably within the next few months.</p><p>"We found that the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 appear not to have affected physician ability to obtain laboratory services," Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said in a cover memo to the draft report. In fact, the volume, number of tests per patient and expenditures have increased rapidly. When the law was passed in 1988, Medicare paid for an estimated 232 million laboratory tests. Today, the total is over 403 million. The number of tests per patient covered by Medicare (Part B) has more than doubled from five in 1985 to an estimated 12 tests in 1993.</p><p>in-office services down</p><p>However, OIG data indicate that the rapid growth has slowed and physicians' office services have declined slightly since implementation of the 1992 HCFA rules. "Only when hospital outpatient data become more reliable will we be able to determine whether growth has, in fact, levelled off, declined or continues to increase," the OIG cautions. Additionally, it notes that the new Amendments are only one cause of change: a recent law generally prohibits physicians from referring patients to clinical laboratories in which they have a financial interest.</p><p>Nevertheless, the number of physicians who operate in-office labs has remained unchanged, although the actual number of such sites has decreased. CLIA does seem to have had an impact on the types of testing performed in these office labs. More simple tests are being carried out, with a corresponding decrease in procedures requiring moderate or highly complex methodology. These latter are subject to greater government regulation. Rural areas do not seem to have been adversely affected by the new law and regulations, the IG found. "None of the rural medical practices contacted during this study indicated that they had any trouble in securing needed laboratory work for their patients. While physicians' labs are uncommon here, hospital labs take up the slack: 7.4 hospital lab sites per 100,000 persons compared with 5 such sites per 100,000 people in non-rural counties." The OIG notes: "Since hospital sites are more likely to perform moderate and high complexity testing, persons living in rural areas appear to have available to them laboratory sites equivalent to their non-rural counterparts."</p>
