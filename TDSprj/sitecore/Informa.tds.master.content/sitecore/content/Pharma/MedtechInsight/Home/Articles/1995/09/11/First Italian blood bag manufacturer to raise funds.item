<p>Medical Grade System, the Italian manufacturer of medical tubes and drip bags, plans to be the first Italian company to manufacture blood bags. According to Il Sole-24 Ore, it intends to float on Il Ristretto, the stock exchange for small companies, in the first quarter of 1996 to raise funds for its project.</p><p>MGS believes its new venture could produce an annual turnover of Lit 15,000 million ($9.3 million). The company had a turnover of Lit 10,700 million in 1994, which it predicts will nearly double by the end of 1995, now its manufacturing premises in Valtellina are working to full capacity.</p><p>MGS hopes Gepi, the society for the management of Italian projects, will take a 49% stake in the new venture, and that the Italian conglomerate, ENI, may also become a shareholder. MGS may use the facilities in Manfredonia vacated by ENI to manufacture the blood bags.</p><p>The new business would need an investment of some Lit 12,000 million, Lit 7,000-8,000 million of which the company hopes will be financed by a Manfredonia regional development fund, and the remaining Lit 4,000 million by MGS and Gepi.</p>
