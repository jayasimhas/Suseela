<p>Six months after MediSense's initial public offering in July 1994, the original large investors are reducing their stakes and offering to sell a total of 5.3 million shares. The largest stakeholder, Baxter Healthcare, will lower its share from 24% to just over 3%. MediSense's shares were offered in the float at $12 each and closed at $19.38 on January 31st, up 62%. On completion of the offer, the 16 million outstanding common shares would value the company at more than $300 million. The offer price is expected to be disclosed and the shares to start trading by February 20th.</p><p>MediSense is selling 50,000 shares and, assuming an offer price of $18.87 per share, expects to receive $3.1 million net, including $2.7 million from the exercise of options covering shares of common stock to be sold in the offering.</p><p>90% of sales from test strips</p><p>In the first nine months of MediSense's fiscal 1995, revenue from test strip sales was up 28% compared with the previous year, at $93 million, representing 90% of its total sales. Around 64% of sales came from outside the US.</p><pre>Revenues Net income ($ millions) ($ millions) 1994 1993 1994 1993 3 months 31.10 29.64 5.55 2.33 9 months 102.88 80.79 17.24 9.72 (ended Dec 31st, 1994; Dec 25th, 1993)</pre><p>Last August, MediSense submitted 510(k) applications to the US FDA for its new blood glucose monitoring meter, the Precision QID, followed by a 510(k) application for a new generation of disposable test strips in November.</p><p>In its prospectus, MediSense says the new strips are designed to minimise environmental and haematocrit effects on test performance. They also permit the meter to be moved to the point of blood sample application after strip insertion and to be held in the hand during assay performance. The new test strip is compatible with MediSense's Companion 2 meters as well as the new Precision QID meter.</p><p>The new strip has been test-marketed in the Netherlands and is being commercially released in Europe. Netherlands-based TNO has evaluated the meter and strips and issued the first TNO Quality Certificate for a blood glucose meter.</p>
