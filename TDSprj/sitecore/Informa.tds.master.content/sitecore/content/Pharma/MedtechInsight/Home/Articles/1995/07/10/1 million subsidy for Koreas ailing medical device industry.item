<p>South Korea's Health Ministry is to release Won 800 million ($1 million) in subsidies over the second half of 1995 in a bid to offset the country's growing trade imbalance in the high-tech medical devices sector (see Clinica No 639, p 9).</p><p>The Ministry is screening 51 applications received from pharmaceutical companies and research institutes earlier this year, reports Pharma Koreana. Priority will be given to projects involving CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound and other high-tech devices, as well as artificial human organs.</p><p>Korea's balance of trade in medical devices showed a deficit of $527.7 million in 1994. Imports totalled $674 million, a 40% increase on year-earlier levels, while exports, at just $146.5 million, were 20% above 1993.</p><p>OTC-diagnostic imports surge</p><p>Industry sources suggest that imports of OTC-diagnostics had netted $13 million in the first quarter of 1995 - 30% up on year-earlier levels. Imports of these products doubled last year to $50.6 million. Domestic demand for self-diagnostics climbed 40% in 1994 to Won 10,000 million and is tipped to reach Won 20,000 million this year.</p><p>You-Test, a brand-leading US import, generated sales of Won 2,100 million last year. <strong>[C#199800134:Handok]</strong> Health, which markets the product, plans to increase its market share 30% this year, notes Pharma Koreana. Other major importers of US self- diagnostics are Samchundang Pharma, which sold Won 1,000 million-worth of OS Card, and Dong-A, whose sales of Clear Blue, the pregnancy test, yielded Won 740 million.</p>
