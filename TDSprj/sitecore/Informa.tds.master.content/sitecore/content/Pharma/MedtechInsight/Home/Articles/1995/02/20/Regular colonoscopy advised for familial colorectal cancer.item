<p>People with a family history of colorectal cancer should undergo a colonoscopy every three-five years from the age of 35, according to data from two of the first prospective US studies of the disease (NEJM 1994;331:1669-74). People who have a family member with colon cancer have a 1.7 times higher chance of developing the disease than do the rest of the population; if two or more family members have the disease, the risk is 2.75 times higher. Most at risk are people under 45 with at least one immediate relative with colorectal cancer - the risk for these people is five times higher than normal.</p>

<p>People with a family history of colorectal cancer should undergo a colonoscopy every three-five years from the age of 35, according to data from two of the first prospective US studies of the disease (NEJM 1994;331:1669-74). People who have a family member with colon cancer have a 1.7 times higher chance of developing the disease than do the rest of the population; if two or more family members have the disease, the risk is 2.75 times higher. Most at risk are people under 45 with at least one immediate relative with colorectal cancer - the risk for these people is five times higher than normal.</p><p>The studies were analysed by researchers at Harvard Medical School (Boston, US), headed by Dr Charles Fuchs. Of 120,000 people interviewed (mostly medical professionals, of whom 87,000 were female nurses), 148 men and 315 women had a carcinoma of the colon. Some 17% of these had a family history of colon cancer. According to the researchers, 23% of the cancers in people under 45 were hereditary. Family history was irrelevant in people over 60.</p>
