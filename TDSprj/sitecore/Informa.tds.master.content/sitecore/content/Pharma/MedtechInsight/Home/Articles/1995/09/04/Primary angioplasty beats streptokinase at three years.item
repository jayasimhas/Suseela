<p>MI patients treated by primary angioplasty are more likely to survive three years, have less re-infarctions and better ventricular function than those treated with streptokinase. Data from 301 patients in the Zwolle trial (Weezenlander Hospital, Zwolle, the Netherlands) shows that three-year mortality for primary angioplasty is 2.5% compared with 6.4% in the streptokinase group. In order to salvage viable myocardium, it is necessary to restore normal bloodflow rapidly and completely. However, thrombolysis fails to restore flow in 20% of patients ans as many as half do not achieve full restoration of flow. Re-occlusion occurs in 15-30% of patients.</p>

<p>MI patients treated by primary angioplasty are more likely to survive three years, have less re-infarctions and better ventricular function than those treated with streptokinase. Data from 301 patients in the Zwolle trial (Weezenlander Hospital, Zwolle, the Netherlands) shows that three-year mortality for primary angioplasty is 2.5% compared with 6.4% in the streptokinase group. In order to salvage viable myocardium, it is necessary to restore normal bloodflow rapidly and completely. However, thrombolysis fails to restore flow in 20% of patients ans as many as half do not achieve full restoration of flow. Re-occlusion occurs in 15-30% of patients.</p><p>Dr Aylee Liem, a cardiologist at the Weezenlander Hospital, said that normal bloodflow was restored in 97% of PTCA-treated patients and that the size of the infarct, calculated from enzyme data, was smaller in the PTCA group. Average follow-up was 31 months.</p><p>There was no difference in medical costs between the two treatments. Higher initial PTCA costs were offset by lower readmissions. However, Dr Liem cautioned that the study was undertaken at an experienced centre with 24-hour angioplasty facilities and on-site surgical back-up.</p>
