<p>Some of the reseach presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting in Orlando last month is summarised below. The long-term wear of hip implants may be more related to the implant design than any patient risk factors, according to a UK study. Researchers at the Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, studied the records of 374 hip replacements after an average of 14.5 years following surgery, using the Charnley prosthesis, to study the influence of a number of variables on the wear of polyethylene acetabular components. Two groups of patients, one with no detectable radiographic wear (84 implants) and one with high rates of wear (40 implants) were compared.</p>

<p>Some of the reseach presented at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting in Orlando last month is summarised below. The long-term wear of hip implants may be more related to the implant design than any patient risk factors, according to a UK study. Researchers at the Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, studied the records of 374 hip replacements after an average of 14.5 years following surgery, using the Charnley prosthesis, to study the influence of a number of variables on the wear of polyethylene acetabular components. Two groups of patients, one with no detectable radiographic wear (84 implants) and one with high rates of wear (40 implants) were compared.</p><p>There were no significant differences in terms of age, weight, side of implantation, cup position, length of follow-up or activity in the two sets of patients. They attribute differences in radiographic wear, defined as the change in position of the femoral head within the acetabular cup, to variations in hardness and surface finish of the femoral head and changes in sterilisation of polyethylene components. The researchers suggest that implant design holds the key to long-term success of total hip replacements.</p><p>cement technique improves implant life</p><p>Advances in cementing techniques appear to increase the life of hip replacements, according to a 15-year follow-up study by US researchers. Dr Steven Madey and colleagues at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City studied 357 total hip replacements which had been cemented using a cement gun and intramedullary cement plug. The gun applies more just pressure to the cement to form a more uniform column around the femoral component. Femoral loosening was reduced from 6.3% to 2.9% using this technique compared with hand-packing, according to Dr Madey.</p><p>Patients receiving non-cemented femoral components as part of a total hip replacement have a higher incidence of thigh pain and thus a higher revision rate that those with cemented implants, according to a Canadian randomised controlled study. In the first study of its kind, Dr Michael Gross and colleagues at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, followed 435 patients with total hip replacements over a period of up to five years with the only variable being cement. The implants used were designed for non-cemented use.</p><p>There was a statistically significant increase in thigh pain and revision in non-cemented components, says Dr Gross. Although the conclusions of the study should be limited to the implant models used (PCA and Whiteside systems), it makes a convincing argument for more regulation, such as performing randomised controlled studies, before new implants are introduced, he believes.</p><p>instrumentation improves lumbar fusion rate</p><p>Instrumentation for the lumbar spine increases the success rate of fusion operations for degenerative conditions, according to a randomised prospective study by researchers from Case Western Reserve University, Ohio. Dr George Stevens and colleagues compared two groups of patients over an average 18 months follow-up following lumbar fusion with and without semi-rigid pedicle screw instrumentation (Danek Luque plates and screws). Of the 38 patients treated with an autograft alone, 66% achieved successful radiographic fusion compared with 91% of the 32 patients treated with an autograft and fixation. Complications were essentially the same in both groups.</p><p>artificial cartilage</p><p>Researchers in the UK have developed an artificial implant to treat full-thickness articular cartilage defects. A team from University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London, have developed a hydrophilic polymer which, when implanted, is designed to absorb tissue fluids and proteins, thus promoting cartilage growth.</p><p>The material, a mixture of polyethylmethacrylate and tetra-hydro-fufuryl-methacrylate, was implanted in the knees of 32 rabbits. After six weeks, 81% of defects were resurfaced with articular cartilage which integrated with surrounding normal cartilage. No inflammatory or foreign body reactions were observed, the researchers say. Studies to clarify the origin of chondrocytes in the repair tissue and assess the durability of the new cartilage are under way, they add.</p>
