<p>Medical technical progress plays a significant role in slowing down the growth of healthcare expenditure, asserts the European Coordination Committee of the Radiological and Electromedical Industries (COCIR) in a recent report. Its comments follow a general trend among European trade associations to argue the case for investment in medical technology against a background of continuous budget cuts. The European Diagnostics Trade Association (EDMA), the Italian electromedical trade association (ANIE) and the German diagnostic manufacturers association (VDGH) have all spoken out on this issue</p>

<p>Medical technical progress plays a significant role in slowing down the growth of healthcare expenditure, asserts the European Coordination Committee of the Radiological and Electromedical Industries (COCIR) in a recent report. Its comments follow a general trend among European trade associations to argue the case for investment in medical technology against a background of continuous budget cuts. The European Diagnostics Trade Association (EDMA), the Italian electromedical trade association (ANIE) and the German diagnostic manufacturers association (VDGH) have all spoken out on this issue</p><p>The COCIR report highlights the significant advantages recent high-tech medical procedures have offered over conventional techniques, both in terms of cost and of patient benefits. Cost reductions of over 50% are frequently cited. Technologies reviewed by the report include: CT scanners, digital subtraction angiography, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, lithotripsy, laser-assisted surgery and picture archiving communications.</p><p>New techniques not only offer savings in terms of direct costs for diagnosis and/or therapy, they also shorten hospital stays and result in improved use of healthcare facilities, COCIR argues. More effective diagnosis means results are available more rapidly and often reduces treatment costs because the most appropriate therapy is used more quickly.</p><p>Among benefits to patients derived from new technologies, COCIR points to developments in two- or three-dimensional imaging which enable surgical procedures to be planned in more detail and be less invasive when performed. Patients also benefit from a reduction in hospitalisation, faster recuperation and earlier return to work.</p><p>statistical proof</p><p>The report demonstrates statistically the level of savings that have been made possible by recent technology. For example, when compared with conventional techniques used in the early 1980s, CT scanners offered the following savings:</p><pre>Kidney examinations 30% (combined with ultrasound) Liver disorders 70-77% (1) Lymphoma 30% Hepatic mass 27% Obstructive jaundice 23%(1) due to shorter hospitalisation.</pre><p>Costs of &pound;674,000 ($1.1 million) could be cut by 67% using CT scanners to replace a series of other imaging procedures, according to a 1987 study by A K Dixon et al of the University Department of Radiology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge (Proceedings International Symposium CAR 1987, 839-842). Moreover, the introduction of CT scanners caused the number of conventional X-ray scans to drop considerably.</p><p>An 89% reduction in EEGs was achieved with the introduction of CT, according to a study by R G Evens of Mallinckrodt Institute, St Louis. There was also a 60% reduction in the number of scintigraphs, and a 20% drop in angiographs, cutting overall imaging costs by half.</p><p>DSA</p><p>Similar cost reductions were seen with digital subtraction angiography. A 1985 study demonstrated how 43% savings ($75,000) were made in brain neurodiagnosis compared with film angiography. Other advantages cited are reduced contrast agent quantities (30-50%), results within 30 seconds, views in different planes and improved information quality. The costs of angiographic examinations were cut by 39% over two years by employing colour-coded duplex sonography before DSA, according to a study by A Tschammler et al of the University of Wurzburg (1991).</p><p>angioplasty</p><p>The arrival of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty produced significant savings when compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), although the cost advantages are less obvious in cases of multiple stenoses. A study by Alexander J R Black et al (The American Journal of Cardiology, October 1st, 1988) showed how the costs of bypass surgery and balloon dilatation differed by some $10,000 that year:</p><pre>Procedure CABG PTCA Mean hospital stay (days) 13 5 Total hospital costs ($) 15,372 6,185 Physician fees ($) 7,398 2,953 Total ($) 22,770 9,138</pre><p>* More recent figures comparing the relative advantages of the two techniques were presented in September at the European Cardiology Conference (see Clinica No 569, pp 16-17).</p><p>The report concludes that angioplasty can also be applied successfully in peripheral regions with cost savings. Thigh and pelvic angioplasty resulted in savings of 68% compared with bypass surgery. Average hospital stays were reduced from 15.2 to 3.6 days.</p><p>many other cost-saving procedures</p><p>Other procedures cited as having brought about considerable cost-savings are extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy and laser-assisted surgery, which significantly reduce patient hospital stays.</p><p>Digital imaging, meanwhile, now permits picture archiving. Further advantages are a reduction in examination time where fluoroscopy is needed, no repeat examinations due to film loss or exposure error, less radiation, improved image quality and the simultaneous availability of images at several sites.</p><p>Looking to the future, COCIR predicts that new MRI equipment for interventional therapy will result in progress in efficiency and productivity compared with radiological interventions today.</p><p>relatively modest cost</p><p>According to COCIR, the purchase of medical technology represents a small percentage of overall healthcare spending. Recent statistics from NEMA in the US (see page 5) show the level of investment in various imaging systems in 1993, compared with national healthcare expenditure that year.</p><p>The total investment costs for the five leading medical imaging techniques, radiology, CT, MRI, ultrasound and nuclear medicine, amounted to 0.6% or less of total US healthcare expenditure.</p><p>Worldwide, the electromedical market is worth some $20,000 million, approximately 67% of which is accounted for by diagnostics. This sector represents just 2% of the world market for electrotechnology and electronics.</p><p>World market for electromedical systems and devices (not including laboratory equipment and other appliances)</p><p>Global competition has placed considerable downward pressure on prices in recent years so that for many users, the decision to invest should have become easier, COCIR concludes. The US cost of CT scanners, for example, decreased by an average of 40% from 1982 to 1992 and MRI systems by 26% over the same period. While average prices have fallen almost across the board, price/performance ratios and cost-effectiveness have continuously been improved.</p>
