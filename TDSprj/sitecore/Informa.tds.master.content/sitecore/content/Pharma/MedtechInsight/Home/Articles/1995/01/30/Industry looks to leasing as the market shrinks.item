<p>The Italian medical device industry recorded a turnover of Lit 761,000 million ($470 million) in 1994, an increase of 1.1% on the previous year. Of this, Lit 330,000 million is directly attributable to Italian manufacturing, according to recent figures from ANIE, the Italian national association of electrotechnical and electronic industries. The 20% rise in 1994 exports to Lit 180,000 million helped compensate for the domestic market, which became increasingly hostile.</p>

<p>The Italian medical device industry recorded a turnover of Lit 761,000 million ($470 million) in 1994, an increase of 1.1% on the previous year. Of this, Lit 330,000 million is directly attributable to Italian manufacturing, according to recent figures from ANIE, the Italian national association of electrotechnical and electronic industries. The 20% rise in 1994 exports to Lit 180,000 million helped compensate for the domestic market, which became increasingly hostile.</p><p>Faced with the prospect of continued lack of investment in medical equipment by the government this year, the health service should consider leasing, ANIE president Pierluigi Parola believes. Leasing could be financed through the current costs budget and would mean fewer demands on the already stretched capital investment budget, which remains static this year at Lit 300,000 million. The more forward-looking Regions, such as Emilia Romagna and Tuscany, are already making significant use of this option.</p><p>The government is calling for efficiency, but efficiency is closely linked to quality, Dr Parola asserts. If equipment is not updated, he argues, money will be wasted in maintaining and updating obsolete equipment - money which could have been used to part-finance new equipment.</p><p>Italian capital investment spending represents just 0.3% of total healthcare expenditure, compared with a European average of over 3%.</p>
