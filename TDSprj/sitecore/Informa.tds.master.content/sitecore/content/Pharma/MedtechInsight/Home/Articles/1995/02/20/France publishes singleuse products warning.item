<p>The French Health and Social Affairs Ministry has sent a memorandum to heads of healthcare establishments and health departments warning against the reuse of single-use medical devices. The warning, by Jean-Francois Girard, director general of Health and Gerard Vincent, director of Hospitals, says that purchasers and users may in the past have received contradictory information from different sources but recent studies have confirmed the dangers of reusing single-use sterile devices. The risks may be divided into three categories, Devices, Clinical usage and Recycling:</p><p>* Effects of re-sterilisation and preparation on the physical and mechanical properties of polymer components.</p><p>* Problems sterilising devices exposed to high levels of bacterial contamination during first-use.</p><p>* Build-up of toxic residues from decontamination and cleaning agents. The memorandum points out that risk evaluation from traces of certain sterilisation gases has not yet been carried out.</p>
