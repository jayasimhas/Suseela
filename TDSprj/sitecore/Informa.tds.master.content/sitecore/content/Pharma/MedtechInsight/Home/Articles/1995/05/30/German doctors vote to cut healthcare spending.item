<p>German doctors have agreed to restrict non-essential medical procedures in an attempt to reduce healthcare spending, according to Handelsblatt. At the annual meeting of the Federal Kassen Doctors Association (KBV) last week, delegates finally accepted the need for cost reduction, particularly in the hospital sector, and charged the KBV executive to work with other doctors' unions to achieve a <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on reimbursement reform.</p>

<p>German doctors have agreed to restrict non-essential medical procedures in an attempt to reduce healthcare spending, according to Handelsblatt. At the annual meeting of the Federal Kassen Doctors Association (KBV) last week, delegates finally accepted the need for cost reduction, particularly in the hospital sector, and charged the KBV executive to work with other doctors' unions to achieve a <strong>[C#200100809:consensus]</strong> on reimbursement reform.</p><p>The move is likely to have been forced by Health Minister Horst Seehofer's recent reiterations that health insurance premiums should be stabilised, by legislation if necessary. The KBV, which represents 110,000 doctors, stressed at its meeting that it is vehemently opposed to any form of cost-capping, including the extension of the existing fixed budgets (due to expire at the end of this year) or maximum premium levels.</p>
