<p>The increasing internationalisation of Chinese medical companies is highlighted by the results of Guangdong-based Weida Medical Equipment. Some 80% of the company's Yuan 150 million ($18 million) sales in 1994 were accounted for by exports and Weida expects this to rise, according to Clinica's Beijing correspondent. No comparative figures for 1993 were given but the company, which manufactures some 10 types of medical device ranging from PET scanners to extracorporeal shock-wave devices, says the export business "is getting better and better". Gross income was Yuan 33 million.</p>
