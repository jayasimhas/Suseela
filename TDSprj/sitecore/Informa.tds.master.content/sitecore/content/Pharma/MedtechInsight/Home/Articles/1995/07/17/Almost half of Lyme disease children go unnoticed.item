<p>Almost 50% of children with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed, according to a study published in JAMA (July 5th). Deer tick bites often go unnoticed by the patient and physicians. Erythema migrans can be confused with allergic reactions, fungal infections and eczema while ELISA results are not normally positive in the first three to six weeks, says the Connecticut Health Centre paediatric research team. In a study of 146 children, only 75 were correctly diagnosed. Treatment mistakes were made in 25% of cases.</p>
