<p>ChemTrak has submitted a US premarket approval application for its home collection HIV-1 test. ChemTrak acquired the test through its recent purchase of Coonan Clinical Laboratories (see Clinica No 636, p 1). The company has not given details of the PMA submission but the FDA told Clinica that it still considers home-collection HIV tests as Class III devices which means clinical trial data must be included.</p>

<p>ChemTrak has submitted a US premarket approval application for its home collection HIV-1 test. ChemTrak acquired the test through its recent purchase of Coonan Clinical Laboratories (see Clinica No 636, p 1). The company has not given details of the PMA submission but the FDA told Clinica that it still considers home-collection HIV tests as Class III devices which means clinical trial data must be included.</p><p>The FDA's 1989 statement that HIV-testing should be restricted to a professional setting is under increasing pressure from manufacturers and lobbying groups. More recently, however, some groups changed their position and asked the FDA to withdraw consideration of a Johnson & Johnson home test (see Clinica No 629, p 5).</p><p>Between 20% and 60% of US HIV tests are never followed up because patients do not return for the result. According to the US CDC approximately 33 million HIV tests are performed every year in the US and about 18% of adults have been tested. It is thought that only half of all HIV-positive Americans have been tested.</p>
