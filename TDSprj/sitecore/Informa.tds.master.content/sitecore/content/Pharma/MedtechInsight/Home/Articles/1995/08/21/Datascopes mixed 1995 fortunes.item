<p>US medical device manufacturer Datascope experienced mixed fortunes for its two main businesses in fiscal 1995 ended June. Patient monitoring sales declined 9% after Datascope was forced to recall its "point of view" monitor in April. Cardiac assist sales, meanwhile, rose 18% supported by demand for intra-aortic balloon catheters and balloon pumps.

Patient monitoring sales declined 9% after Datascope was forced to recall its "point of view" monitor in April. Cardiac assist sales, meanwhile, rose 18% supported by demand for intra-aortic balloon catheters and balloon pumps. Datascope received an approvable letter from the US FDA for VasoSeal for coronary angiography and angioplasty in July (see Clinica No 664, p 18).</p><p>Datascope's problems in the patient monitoring division date back to October 1994 when the company put a voluntary hold on US shipments after an internal audit disclosed regulatory problems concerning data submitted to the FDA (No 654, p 14).</p><p>In June the company resumed international shipments of the "point of view" monitor. In the US, however, sales of the product remain suspended. Datascope is preparing a new 510(k) submission which it expects to be ready by the autumn. The company warns that the review of the submission is likely to be deferred pending the conclusion of a satisfactory FDA inspection of the patient monitoring division's manufacturing facility.</p><pre>Datascope's 1995 results ($ millions) 1995 1994 % change Cardiac Assist 97.7 82.7 +18% Patient Monitoring 78.3 85.7 -9% InterVascular 14.7 10.7 +37% Other 5.0 3.7 +35% Total sales 195.7 182.8 +7% Net income 17.3 15.7 +10% (ended June 30th)</pre>
