<p>Brigitte Ascher reports on how Sulzermedica aims to increase its share of the medical device market.</p><p>Swiss engineering company Sulzer is boosting the already substantial R&D spending of its subsidiary, Sulzermedica, and will again look for potential takeover targets in the medical field. To maintain the trend of the past four years when Sulzermedica out-performed market growth, cash will continue to be pumped from non-medical areas to orthopaedics, pacemakers and cardiovascular implants.</p><p>In 1994, Sulzermedica contributed 17% to group sales but spent 46% of R&D funds. Between 1990 and 1994, Sulzermedica's R&D spending rose 66% while group R&D spending remained flat. Within Sulzermedica, around 45% is allocated to orthopaedics, a sector which contributed 54% of sales in 1994.</p><p>The shift in R&D spending began in the late 1980s when Sulzer first became engaged in medical devices with the purchase of pacemaker manufacturer Intermedics for $770 million - then widely criticised as too expensive. Andre Buchel, head of Sulzermedica, believes that seven years after the last major purchase, the company is ready for the next step. "We expect to do something on acquisitions during 1995, though not necessarily the same size as Intermedics," he told Clinica at the company's presentation of 1994 results in Winterthur, Switzerland.</p><p>"Acquisitions would have either to increase market share, increase the speed at which we can gain market share or complement our current portfolio of products. We are looking at a number of opportunities in the orthopaedics or the cardiovascular sectors."</p><p>Sulzer's CEO Fritz Fahrni underlines that acquisitions must always be complemented by divestments. However, Mr Buchel says Sulzer has no intention of disposing of any of the medical businesses. In the hectic acquisition playing field of 1994, Sulzer stayed largely on the sidelines. "We were not interested in Siemens' pacemakers because we believed we would have had trouble with the Federal Trade Commission because of our US market share," Mr Buchel says. Another possibility did, however, hold more interest: "We looked seriously at <strong>[C#198600152:Eli Lilly]</strong>'s CPI, now part of Guidant."</p><p>Sulzermedica's only move was the acquisition at the end of 1994 of a south German orthopaedic implant distributor. G Hug has sales of around DM 50-60 million ($40 million) and, as part of the Protek subsidiary, should expand Sulzermedica's role in the European orthopaedic market. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p><p>Offsetting the Hug purchase was the divestment of California- based Techmedica. Bought in 1987, Techmedica had been Sulzer's first acquisition in the medtech sector, but its business, the production of custom-made implants, failed to prosper in the 1990s. The sale resulted in staff reduction of about 110. Despite this, Sulzermedica's staffing levels at the end of last year were up 3% at 3,963 compared with 1993.</p><p>Sulzer is also investing heavily in Sulzermedica. A new facility for orthopaedic products for the North American market, located in Austin, Texas, is scheduled to be ready in May. Another facility in Winterthur is due to be completed at the end of the year and will bring together the orthopaedic facilities now scattered across the Swiss town.</p><pre>Average annual growth rates 1991-1994 Market Sulzermedica Orthopaedics 6% 7% Pacemakers 7% 13% Cardiovascular 9% 12% (on US$ basis)</pre><p>In orthopaedics, Mr Buchel explains, healthcare systems' cost- cutting measures have been more strongly felt than in the company's other two areas. "Savings measures are expected to continue, but will probably not be as significant as in 1993 and 1994."</p><p>Sulzermedica is number one in the European orthopaedic market with a 35% share. "With about 8-9% of the market we are one of the smaller players in the US but hope to grow there," Mr Buchel says. The company is market leader in artificial hips in Europe which makes it harder to grow significantly; it has, however, grown strongly in the European knee sector. "In the US we increased our share in knees and slightly in hips." He estimates worldwide growth rates of 5-6% for knees and 1-2% for hips in 1994.</p><p>pacemakers</p><p>Market growth in pacemakers - the main business of the Intermedics subsidiary - is estimated to have slowed to around 5% by last year. With an average growth rate of 13% in the four years to 1994, Sulzermedica has gained market share with new products that were introduced in 1991 and 1992 - mainly the implantable, rate-responsive pacemakers, Relay and Dash.</p><p>Intermedics introduced a new pacemaker, Unity, in the US in March this year following its European launch in 1994. Unity is a single-pass, rate-responsive pacing system that allows physicians to offer patients atrioventricular synchrony without the added surgical time and expense of implanting a separate atrial lead. It uses a single lead that senses in both cardiac chambers and paces in the ventricle. Mr Buchel believes that Unity - unique in the US - will allow Sulzermedica to increase its pacemaker sales significantly this year. Recently launched was Rx5000, a smaller programmer with expanded capabilities, which was approved by the US FDA in March.</p><p>On defibrillators Mr Buchel concedes the company is lagging behind the competition, which is led by <strong>[C#198600185:Medtronic]</strong>'s Jewel, approved by the FDA in March (see Clinica No 647, p 19). Sulzermedica's Res-Q1, still unapproved in the US, sells only in small quantities and is already obsolete.</p><p>Sulzermedica expects Res-Q2, which will be smaller, lighter and more compact, to be available in the second half of the year. However, it will still be slightly heavier than Jewel. "We are working on Res-Q3 with which we will hopefully catch up with Jewel as regards function, measurement and weight. We hope to receive approval for Res-Q3 in 1997," Mr Buchel says.</p><p>A future Res-Q4 could be a device that is implanted prophylactically in those at risk of fibrillation, Mr Buchel believes. While defibrillators are now only implanted in patients with a first episode of fibrillation, in future a simple, straightforward and relatively unsophisticated product could be implanted as a precautionary measure.</p><p>cardiovascular growth</p><p>Sulzermedica outperformed the cardiovascular implant market with CarboMedics' mechanical and tissue heart valves and Vascutek's artificial vascular grafts. This was despite the fact that CarboMedics' mechanical heart valve was approved in the US only in late 1993. "In the US, we started at zero and had around 3% market share by the end of 1994. Not much, but a good result competing with St Jude. The growth mainly occurred in the fourth quarter of last year." In Europe and Japan, where CarboMedics' 25-30% market share is approaching that of St Jude, growth is likely to be more modest.</p><p>Mr Buchel admits to an admiration of St Jude's heart valve. "After all, we have been manufacturing the delicate components of the St Jude valve ourselves and still do for a large part of the valves." This OEM production is one of CarboMedics' two arms. The other is its proprietary mechanical heart valve. By the year 2000 CarboMedics will have to replace all its OEM business with proprietary heart valve sales. Until 1991, St Jude had bought exclusively from CarboMedics but this OEM contract will run out at the end of the decade.</p><p>The company is active in the development for a tissue valve and will market its Photo-Fix alpha more widely in Europe at the end of 1995. Mr Buchel expects US approval to take around five years. Competitors in the field include Baxter, Medtronic and St Jude.</p><p>Share price</p><p>By early April, Sulzer's Zurich-quoted shares had fallen around 20% compared with late 1994. In the eyes of Sulzer's management the current low level is a case of stock market understatement just as the high level in 1994 was an exaggeration. In the long term board chairman Pierre Borgeaud believes that share prices reflect the company's profit development. The share price decline was sparked off in January when analysts downgraded the Sulzer share from a buy to a hold following the company's 1994 order figures (see Clinica No 639, p 15). Underlying this decision was the analysts' expectation that the weak US dollar coupled with the strong Swiss franc would continue to depress Sulzer's profits. Another consideration was the stagnation of Sulzermedica's profits when expressed in local currencies and the expectation that the pressure on the medical company's margins will not ease.</p>
